{"text":"Best. Restaurant. In. Pitt.   Try the mussels. And the meatloaf. Thank me later. BYOB"}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTING!  After reading all the marvelous reviews on how wonderful the food was, our expectations were very high.  The 6 of us started with several appetizers: mussels - ok,  heirloom tomatoes - good,  fried green tomatoes - very good,  fig, cheese,Italian meat,fig on crusted bread- very good.   Four of us had the highly touted meatloaf over mashed potatoes with crispy onions - totally uninspiring. Meatloaf was overdone and tasteless. Two had the hanger steak which came cold! Sent them back and one got the monk fish which she said was good, the other got the same steak but didn't comment.  Dessert was chocolate fudge with mint ice cream shared by all and was very good.  Parking was impossible, the noise level made it very difficult to talk.  All in all, we would not go back."}
{"text":"Have been meaning to check out this restaurant out for awhile!  I've heard good things from friends and I drive by it all the time!  Finally made it over for Restaurant week and we really enjoyed ourselves!  The space isn't very big, but it's comfortable and has a lively vibe.  It seemed like a lot of small groups of friends catching up and kicking off the weekend.  It's also BYOB, so there were plenty of wine bottles on every table.  Service was great.  Very knowledgeable and friendly, but not pushy or overly obtrusive.  Some of the menu items are their staples (Chalkboard Menu) and some of the items change depending on the season and what they receive locally.  I think most of the items we had were seasonal, but we loved the eggplant appetizer and the roasted chicken breast the most!  The heirloom tomatato salad we had was also good, light and refreshing.  And the veal dish I had was also good, but just not as good as the chicken, which was juicy, flavorful and with a nice crispy skin!    Overall, I would definitely recommend checking out Avenue B if you're looking for a slightly nicer restaurant with reasonable prices and yummy food!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews, we decided to finally try Avenue B as it had been on our list for quite some time. I have to say, I found everything about this place to be lackluster. We had The Raw Deal appetizer, and I can't think of a more apt name for a $16 plate of mushy fish that had gone one too many pulses through the food processor. It was almost inedible. After that, we had the duck and meat loaf entrees, which were not terrible in flavor, but were both prepared poorly. The temperatures were off (warm potatoes, hot onion rings, room temperature meatloaf), the duck was medium well (despite ordering mid-rare), and the sides were just off, for lack of a better word. It's possible we caught the kitchen on a bad night, but this was entirely overpriced even if it had been good. We spent nearly $100 for an awful appetizer and two entrees that we barely ate half of, and I'm already regretting the fact that I have leftovers in the fridge. There are much better options in the city, both cheaper and better, and I will not be returning to Avenue B."}
{"text":"Making the reservation: easy and friendly. Atmosphere: quaint and inviting (if you do not like tight spaces this isn't for you). Menu: great!  I love the small seasonal menu and focus on more day-to-day options.  Very well conceived. Appetizer: delicious!  The heirloom tomato salad was perfect, and the Yellowfin Tuna trio of sushi was even better! Entrees: mediocre at best.  The Kung Pao Tofu was lacking in the spicy-peanutty character of good Kung Pao.  My Short Rib Tacos weren't seasoned and the Chipotle Cream was just pink cream. Dessert: amazing!  The chocolate was amazing! The kicker, and reason for my poor rating, was when my server dropped a wine glass on my entree plate (before I was finished) and it shattered.  It made a HUGE mess and really upset the table next to us.  I work in restaurants and make mistakes myself, but they failed to recover from their mistake.  The server was extremely apologetic, but I had to pay full price for an entree that I was unable to finish and the chef sent out an extra of my date's meal to-go.  They also did not charge me for our 2 bottles of wine (its BYOB).  Had they supplied me with another entree, or not charged me for the one they destroyed I would be more gracious.   I don't intend on coming back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in my neighborhood. They are known for their Kobe beef meatloaf, which is my go-to dish. This place is primarily a meat restaurant, so be careful if you have vegetarians in your group.   The main room has a huge chalkboard with their specials, (of which there are always about a dozen). These include interesting appetizers and a few desserts, (though I've never had room for dessert here). The portions are surprisingly large considering the style of the place looks more like a large plate/small serving type joint.  Personal favorites here are the swordfish, the meatloaf, and the pork chops. Its BYOB, so be sure to bring your favorite wine."}
{"text":"The chef really makes some challenging dishes.  The dishes incorporated seasonal local produce (we had ramps!).  All the menu choices are posted on the giant chalkboard and you get choices of sides.  The restuarant is small and seating area is very tight, but acceptable.  If you are looking for a contemporary menu that incorporates all many types of cuisine, look no further and bring a bottle of vino!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was relaxed and cozy. The service was mediocre at best due to inexperience but they were friendly.  The food was O.K. but the amount of salt used was beyond excessive. i cant recommend a restaurant where the Chef does not know how to season the food and you have to ask for more water at least twice. i mean lets be serious, water is free! Has potential but needs work."}
{"text":"Avenue B is one of my favorite Pittsburgh restaurants, but did you know they do private dinners as well!  Having Chef Chris, one of the top chefs in Pittsburgh, design a private menu for your group is.......well, it doesn't get much better than that!  Our group of four couples meets quarterly and every fifth dinner we have a chef design a private menu for us.  Chris did an AMAZING job designing an innovative six course menu.  His blend of flavors in each dish was TOP NOTCH!  They hosted our dinner at their B-Gourmet Sewickley location after hours so we were the only diners there.  A FANTASTIC night.  We matched wines to each course (BYOB of course) and the dinner couldn't have been better.  THANK YOU CHRIS!  Highly recommend you contact Chef Chris for your group's next dinner party.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that this is the best new restaurant in Pittsburgh. We first went here for Valentine's day, and it was just fantastic in every way. They really do understand it all.  -vegetarian friendly -attentive & friendly wait staff -excellent selection and seasonal variety -coffee in a french press, need I say more  I've recommended this to several others, and everyone I know has had a positive experience."}
{"text":"I've been here three times, and all have been great. While I did find a couple dishes that needed a bit more work, nearly all of the food was delicious, well-conceived, and beautiful. The Asian inspired dishes are consistently my favorite. Don't miss out on their side dishes, which are more complicated and flavorful than their simple description would lead you to believe. We recently had a summer squash side dish which was one of the best dishes for the evening. The deserts are also consistently amazing.  Considering the restaurant is BYOB, you can have a fantastic meal out with wine without spending a fortune. It's a bit expensive to go regularly, but a perfect choice for a nice meal out every now and then."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The menu is creative and thoughtfully planned with interesting dishes and flavors.  I always appreciate places that cook seasonally and make a point of changing the menu to reflect what is fresh and available locally.    I had the sea bash fish and chips... amazing. Husband had the meatloaf, mouthwatering yumminess. Veggie friend had the tofu enchiladas and scrapped the plate clean.  Oh, we started off with the ribs... goodness.  All of the deserts sounded amazing and super interesting... but we were stuffed and couldn't eat any more.   All of the servers were excited to tell you about what their favorites on the menu were and were knowledgeable about about the preparations... something that is difficult to find in Pittsburgh area restaurants.    Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Avenue B for the third time last night, four of us, all thrilled with each of the three courses.  The place just gets better.  The food choices are eclectic and exciting and varied and confident.  Presentation beautiful, wait staff friendly, informative, polite, and respectful.  It was a great meal/experience.  Highly recommend.  Chef, Chris Bonfili is doing a terrific job."}
{"text":"Absolutely no negatives. Great service, great food, cozy quiet environment. I will recommend this gem to anyone who asks."}
{"text":"Warning: this is going to be a bit of a love letter.   I seriously love this place.  I love the dinner, love the lunch, and now have a whole new reason to love it - Sunday brunch!!  Those who know me know that I'm obsessed with brunch and really wish I could have it every day.  Darn you work!    They just started doing Sunday brunch a few weeks ago and it's AWESOME.  I just ended up in the Burgh for a visit and I had a delicious dinner there (Kevin the waiter is SO knowledgeable about food - he is great!) and found out about brunch and had to have it before I left the city.  They don't take reservations right now for brunch and I had a sizable crew with me for the size of the restaurant so I called at 9:30am and Seth was SO nice to help me figure out a plan to have the best chance to set everyone seated around 11:30.   We had no trouble getting seated but I fear that will change quickly as the word gets out about this amazing brunch.    Ok onto the most important part - the FOOD.  OMG.  We started with some beignets  that are a healthy portion - 5 puffy fried pieces of deliciousness with a spoon of cinnamon sugar and an apple compote and a fresh berry compote kind of on the side.  whoa - I licked my fingers.  On recommendation I got the eggs benedict which comes with thinly sliced asparagus and hearts of palm and is topped with a slice of mapley bacon that is insane.  The bacon is so good that you want eat a plate of just bacon - and then another one - and maybe another one.  whoa.  the hollandaise was heartstoppingly butterliciously good but JUST the right amount.  I hate it when there is a giant glop of it - I want to be chasing it around my plate to get every bit of goodness, not wiping it off on the side.  This also came with potatoes on the side which were like homefries but with some sweet potato mixed in and some red pepper?  They were delicious!  Boyfriend had the huevos rancheros which were hearty and delicious but could have had a little more spice for my taste.  Basically everyone loved their food but I was too absorbed in my own food to try bites and when I looked up - everyone was licking their plates so I can only infer from that and their subsequent food comas that they were happy.    After I rolled back to PK&A's (darling wonderful host friends) apartment  for my own food coma, I realized we forgot to pop out and get champagne for mimosas or bellinis.   Yes, I forgot about brunch beverages.  Me!  One of the main reasons to love brunch!!  This has NEVER happened to me before - and that says a lot about the food, the company, and the experience in general...and perhaps explains my love for brunch.  But seriously they do have the fixins for brunch beverages without the alcohol since it's BYOB - by the glass or carafe.    I am seriously sad that I no longer live down the block from Ave B - but I will be back for sure on my next visit to the Burgh!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, quick service, reasonable prices, and you can bring your own bottle of wine. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  I've been here 3 or 4 times for dinner.  The food is fresh, creative and tasty.  There are great vegetarian options.  The service is excellent.    They have a seasonal menu, and always have new specials.  It's on the pricey end for Pittsburgh, but isn't that expensive given the quality of the food. It's BYOB which is always a plus for me."}
{"text":"Never let's ya down.   Started our meal by beating the crowd.   Began with a nice tomato and watermelon salad. Loved the lamb spring roll. It was paired with a sauce that you just wanted to lick the plate clean.   The sushi roll was a great flip on a traditional roll. Once I got over the disappointment of not being able to use the chopsticks, I quickly forgot all about it. Well balanced layers of flavors.   I had the day boat scallops and risotto cake. Cleaned my plate. Enough said. But a perfectly cooked scallop and a nice portion.  Spouse had the chicken which was a very unexpected surprise. Tender as can be... And bursting with flavor. Perfectly seasoned   Service was efficient and perfectly timed.   Plenty of street parking with meters that are free after 6pm."}
{"text":"The food at Avenue B has been consistently flavorful and beautiful.  Every dish is better than the last one and I appreciate the BYOB setup.    I have some small critiques though--I have ordered dishes with \"morels\" twice; both times, there was a different mushroom in the dish.  I am an avid mushroom hunter and I can identify morels with no trouble.  They are distinct in appearance and flavor.  The first time this happened, I assumed that they ran out and I didn't mind the substitute.  The second time, I realized that it was probably a deliberate swap (or their vendor is dishonest and they didn't know any better).  Besides the morels, they only other issue at this restaurant is the cracked/ripped upholstery on chairs in the new section of the restaurant.  These are petty things, but they're holding the restaurant back from being 100%."}
{"text":"Went there last night and was disappointed.  The atmosphere was nice and service was very good.  Food was unimpressive and pricey.  We shared a lot of starter items.  Kale salad was good,  celeriac bisque good, asparagus crisp also good but that's where it ended.  Mussels were horrible and I always get mussels.  The other starter dish was just alright.  As I said disappointing."}
{"text":"I went to Avenue B with my sister, whose boyfriend used to be a chef there.  I was not sure if she was a little impartial towards it for that reason. I have to say, the food and ambiance was great. it is small, BYOB, and they write their menu on large chalkboards every night.   We had an apple/fennel/gorgonzola salad. I had the kobe meatloaf and she had a grilled wahoo. For dessert we shared the lavender cake with panna cota. All of it was terrific. The kobe meatloaf was especially delicious and I really enjoyed the flavor.  Only downfall- it is hard to get in (apparently you don't come unless you have a reservation) and it is quite pricey. The plates are all decorated and the portions are very small - in high end restaurant fashion. I dont mind spending $ on food when it is as tasty . . .  so all in all I would probably go back again, maybe on a date night."}
{"text":"Very talented cook, good combination of seasonal ingredients, beautiful presentations and great service! You have to try them for a special day! It is our favorite place to eat out, and we reserve every special day--even invent ones--to go there...why not celebrate street cleaning day with roasted pear and Gorgonzola flatbread :) waiting for the pi-day ^.^"}
{"text":"Stellar service and amazing chalkboard menu along with a lovely bistro ambiance.  My appetizer of fried goat cheese medallions with a little truffle and greens salad was outstanding.  I had the scallops as the main course and they were big, huge, fresh, succulent scallops cooked to perfection.  Scallops being overcooked is a huge peeve of mine as they become tough, rubbery and chewy when overcooked but these were perfection.  Great BYOB option here too.  My server was knowledgeable, polite and professional.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I recently had lunch with my cousin at Avenue B.  I saw all of the rave reviews and decided to try it.  It is a very nice place and has a good atmosphere.  However, I dont know what the fuss was all about.  My chicken salad sandwich was good...but i think it's a little pricey..."}
{"text":"Their lunch menu was not memorable. I had some type of vegetarian wrap, but it was not as good as something that I could make myself. It was definitely not worth the money for their lunch."}
{"text":"Talking with a friend Friday night, I mentioned that I was going out to dinner with my mom in Shadyside. He asked me where I was going and I replied \"I honestly cannot remember where we decided to go.\" He promptly said, \"Oh, Avenue B!\" I looked at him, wondering where he acquired the ability to fetch memories I had forgotten, and exclaimed \"Oh my Gosh. Yes! How did you know that?!\" To which he replied \"Everyone always forgets about Avenue B.\" Well, yes, I've been here several times now, but this trip was thoroughly unforgettable. We started with the pork belly. My mom was convinced she didn't like pork belly prior to this experience. It was barbequed and served with a miso slaw and potato chips. She has since changed her mind on pork belly. It was perfect.  Then we shared the pork medallions and their signature dish, the meatloaf. Both were outstanding. I did prefer the pork medallions over the meatloaf, you really have to be a lover of goat cheese to enjoy the potatoes that come with the meatloaf, but both were really wonderful.  And really, who doesn't love a BYOB. Also, these are Pittsburgh portions that they serve here, so you will not be leaving hungry."}
{"text":"If you live in Shadyside for three years, and eat out quite a bit, you would probably know the menus of most of the restaurants here. Not true for Avenue B. They stick to what's seasonal and fresh when choosing their ingredients, which translates to an ever changing menu. I don't think I have ever had anythig there that was just \"blah\". Everything tastes awesome and looks awesome. The service is great and very attentive, even on Saturday nights. My favorite thing about an Avenue B experience is the menu on the wall. It's written with chalk in beautiful script. The brunch is amazing! I have taken out of towners there and they absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"Very unassuming restaurant with a neighborhood feel but the food was creative and outstanding. One of the best in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Avenue B is a fantastic addition to the Burgh's culinary scene! Everything I had here - app, entree, dessert - was amazing!!!! The only negative is that the menu is pretty small - about 5-8 app choices and maybe 7 entree options. This place is not for picky eaters! This is a place where I suggest throwing caution to the wind - whatever you order is going to be great!"}
{"text":"The Waygu Beef Meatloaf is awesome. Wandered in on a rainy Thursday night. Top notch service and great food. Starter was \"The Raw Deal\", which was spicy tuna on sticky rice with avocado mousse and caviar, also very good. They do not serve alcohol but diners can bring their own (I don't know if there's a corkage fee). Seems a bit pricy, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I cannot believe how utterly indescribable the food and overall experience was at Avenue B. My boyfriend brought me and his parents here while they were visiting for Easter. We haven't stopped talking about this restaurant since. I would go into lengthy detail about the food we ate, which we shared with each other, but I will just list out what we ate and include some pictures. Our server was very kind and attentive, even though we were kind of a pain to start out with because of the 3 bottles of wine at our table. And lastly, Avenue B may be quite pricey, but it is worth every cent. Please, go here, at least once in your life. ----- Appetizers: PEI mussels (for the whole table, they were in a smoky, rich tomato sauce...we practically licked the bowl clean), salad (for the parents, I'm not sure what it was), soup (for us, smoked cheddar & onion bisque, bacon jam, broccoli tempura - this was my absolute favorite thing) -- Momma C: Shrimp and scallops, with red lentils (and quite possibly more) Poppa C: Erie walleye fish & chips, with a Napa slaw Tim: Butterfish on black quinoa and coconut bisque, topped with crab & walnut butter (yum) Me: Wagyu beef meatloaf, goat cheese & chive whipped potatoes, crispyonions, blistered tomato jam -- Dessert: German chocolate type sundae (for the parents) and croissant bread pudding with popcorn ice cream & caramel (for us)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and interesting choices. I went for lunch and had the Thai BBQ sandwich, which had some amazing pickled veggies in it that were just amazing. I also had the strawberry hazelnut cheesecake which was to die for - had small pieces of dark chocolate, hazelnut and sugar rocks. YUM!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable flavors. Great service. One of the best meals I've ever had."}
{"text":"We went for wife's birthday and really enjoyed it. The food was very well prepared and really tasty. Too many restaurants have bland food or pedestrian taste. Mussels in tomato sauce very good as was the kale Ceasar salad with hint of lemon. The house special meatloaf is basted for 5 days to give very deep taste and sauce. On bed of mashed potatoes but with wonderful flavor. Not cheap but good value for price.  One negative is the front room is very noisy...  Very. Ask for table in back room."}
{"text":"Early in our relationship, Belle confessed to me that she didn't like tacos or meatloaf.  This was, of course, a serious problem.  Some homemade pulled pork tacos later one of the hurdles was cleared, but the meatloaf issue continued to vex me.  Enter Avenue B.  First off, don't let the largely unfinished web site turn you off.  Avenue B has a much more expansive menu that what you'll find online.  Thankfully, the above-mentioned meatloaf is a mainstay (although its exact composition changes seasonally).  You'll find ~6 starters and ~6 entrees on the chalk board menu, most of which are made, to one degree or another, to highlight local and seasonal fare.  Quick aside: assuming you remember your own wine, this is a pretty good place in terms of menu and atmosphere for a date.  Just know that they don't give you menus, you have to rely on the chalkboards.  Not every seat has a great sightline to the boards, so don't make your date sit in a chair so she has to awkwardly crane her neck to figure out what she wants to eat.  And for God's sake don't (as I did) forget your glasses and resort to having your date read to you.  Belle was understanding, but for an early date, I was hoping to come across as something other than quasi-literate.  All the meals I've had at Avenue B have been very good.  The cook obviously knows what he's doing; his previous spot (the Red Room) really took off under his guidance.  That said, the menu is not going to blow anyone's mind when it comes to pushing the envelope with unusual preparations and/or ingredients.  Take a closer look at the menu picture from the yelp profile and you'll see: Roast Chicken Braised Short Ribs NY Strip Steak Falafel and Tabouleh Seared Scallops BBQ -not pictured, but also on the menu: Fish and Chips Meatloaf.  Not really very vegetarian-friendly and not really separating itself from the crowd.  There are, of course, excellent reasons from a financial standpoint to play it safe when it comes to Pittsburgh menus, but I think the city's tastes are slowly changing and I hope Avenue B steers its obvious skill in more interesting directions down the line.  All that said, if you like these things (and I certainly do), Avenue B does an excellent job with them.  On visit 1, I ordered the meatloaf and loved it--it was probably the best meatloaf I've ever had (with apologies to my father).  After much cajoling, I convinced Belle to have a bite.  On our most recent visit, Belle ordered the meatloaf for herself, which stands as testimony to how well Avenue B executes the \"new American bistro\" catalog."}
{"text":"Avenue B is outstanding. This place offers an amazing seasonal menu and a variety of creative and mouth-watering daily specials. I have never been more CONSISTENTLY impressed with a restaurant in Pittsburgh as I am with Avenue B.   They are also BYOB. I like this aspect of the restaurant because you get to bring your own wine to enjoy alongside their amazing beginnings, entrees, and desserts.   The brunch, naturally offered only on Sunday mornings, is also outstanding. I am particularly a fan of the buckwheat pancakes with Guinness butter and Framboise syrup. My friend had the steak and eggs. The steak was cooked perfectly to order (medium rare) and the eggs were delicious. I think that brunch is a great value that is slowly starting to catch on at this restaurant.   If I could rate Ave B more than five stars, I would!!!"}
{"text":"We ate here for our anniversary and all I can say is wow!!! From appetizer to dessert, the flavors we enjoyed were incredibly smart and adventurous with everything coming together so well! Loved my hangar steak and really appreciated their take on \"pork n' beans, which my wife had (and loved). All in-all, we ABSOLUTELY loved this place and can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"*** 1/2   I am always wary of newer restaurants in Pittsburgh, and I always have low expectations since Pittsburgh isn't considered a gourmet food city. I have to say for Pittsburgh, I was delighted with Avenue B!   We were a group of eight and had the front table by the window. Our server was knowledgeable, friendly and patient. The atmosphere inside the small restaurant is upbeat, but not overly noisy and crowded. I would never sit outside on the sidewalk, though, as you have to contend not only with the people walking by, but also the fumes from the buses at the stop right outside the door. Street parking on a Friday night was easy!   There is a small regular menu at the table which changes seasonally, but the ever-changing daily menu is up on chalkboards on either side of the room. Depending upon where you sit in the room, you may or may not be able to read the daily list. With help from my glasses, I could see most, but awkward angles made it difficult to read some of the available choices. I think that it would be a good idea if they had at least one copy of the daily menu in print at each table.   The food was delicious, from the small plates to the main course. We shared several appetizers, lobster spring rolls, calamari, sashimi, all of which were flavorful and fresh. The soft shell crab and scallop entree was succulent, and the Kobe meatloaf was tasty. Nothing was over the top, but it was all very satisfying. Absolutely no complaints across the board, and remember, there were eight of us!   The restaurant is BYOB. I am still trying to wrap my head around that concept, the good and the bad. Most of our group are wine drinkers so that we could bring better bottles of wines at reasonable prices rather than order from an overpriced wine list is a real plus. On the Filip's, I am more of a cocktail gal, typically a martini girl, and I can't envision bringing a big bottle of vodka, mixers, etc. Maybe that's what those mini bottles are for?   All in all, a lovely experience. I definitely would go again, if the opportunity presented itself."}
{"text":"I have passed by this restaurant everything when I go shopping grocery at Giant Eagle. It's around 10-table restaurant, quite small for me. Their dish that was quite surprise me is Wagyu Meatloaf. Wagyu is a premium kind of beef, and I've never thought to use it for meatloaf. However, restaurant did pretty good with this dish. It's not an exact meatloaf. I considered it as a burger streak, rough grounded beef served with mashed potato and cherry tomatoes."}
{"text":"Our first experience with Avenue B was to celebrate Valentines Day on Saturday 2/13/16.  Typically I avoid all restaurants like the plague on VDay and New Years as they are oversold, have a limited menu, and with most of the items prepared way to long in advance.  Not set up for the best of experiences.  Avenue B was not that at all by a long-shot.  The staff was very good and Brett our server was as good as one can get.  We agreed that he was one of the top 5 servers we have ever had.  We were not over serviced, nor under serviced, he had an excellent knowledge of the menu, and he talked me in to ordering the signature meatloaf.  I NEVER order meatloaf at a restaurant.  On a night that it was 4° out I have to say that this was more than a delight, the dish was incredible.  My date ordered a fish dish,  I cannot recall (BYOB - two martinis in) what it was but she loved it and I loved the taste that I had.   I would go back for the cuisine and I will absolutely go back if we can have Brett take care of us.  I will request him."}
{"text":"Can't believe we haven't been here before. Great little neighborhood bistro. Went on a busy Friday night and enjoyed a meal that was sophisticated while still being comforting, delicious, and enjoyable. No complaints. Service was fantastic and I love this is byob. Four stars instead of five because the appetizers we ordered were good but not great (flatbread was a bit boring for my liking, the chicken satay and pate was excellent, and the shishito peppers were good but nothing remarkable). Entrees were all great. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"After getting off a late flight into Pittsburgh, I was starving and ready to see the city that was so new to me. Luckily my friends who I was visiting lived about a block away from Avenue B and were raving about it. We grabbed a few bottles of wine and walked over.   As soon as I entered, I knew I would like this restaurant. The chalkboard menu and comfy interior made me feel at home. Our server came over right away, uncorked our wine and explained the menu. To start, our group split the pork belly lettuce wraps, the tuna 3 ways and the sweet potato and black bean taquitos. Although it was quite an eclectic mix of foods, I was impressed. I loved the lettuce wraps the most. The pork belly was perfection. The tuna was fresh and prepared in a variety of manners that I loved. The flavor of the taquitos was amplified by the addition of the sweet potato. Things were off to a good start.  For my entree I got the fish and chips. I was able to get one piece of fish fried and the other grilled. Both were fantastic. I fell in love with the cole slaw and the chips were thick cut and perfectly seasoned. I snuck a few bites of my boyfriend's pork chop and was once again impressed. The pork chop was juicy and flavorful while the polenta was creamy and rich.   Avenue B was my perfect introduction into Pittsburgh. Next time I travel back I will most definitely be ordering off that chalkboard menu!"}
{"text":"Really good food and great service. BYOB is a bonus. Only complaint was that portion size was small for the price but surprisingly i was comfortable full. I would gladly go back again."}
{"text":"Had an amazing, friendly, quiet, cozy & fresh dinner here.  Very much looking forward to coming again but after going once I'll say its one of the best places I've been in Pittsburgh.  Daily menu is limited and written on a chalk board above the dining room.  Looking forward to getting to know this place.  BYOB is a plus. Servers are friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here! The service was the right level of attentiveness, and the food was delicious! We had the green salad, the chicken on a stick, the pork terrine, falafel, and the jalapeño popper ice cream trio. I'd want to go back just for the jalapeño ice cream, but everything was great. I wouldn't recommend sitting outside, though, since it's right by a bus stop and it gets quite loud."}
{"text":"My friend and I had the BEST meal in Pittsburgh tonite.  Having been here once for lunch (wagyu burger), I knew a return visit for dinner was happening.  We went on a Thursday evening at 7.  Reservations were made but were unnecessary.  We were seated by the windows next to a gentleman who was eating alone and reading a book - he got the seafood/squid ink pasta and the croissant dessert - he didnt look like a rookie at Avenue B.  The menu featured main courses that included ramps and morels - 2 ingredients I had never tried.  We asked the chef if he could create an appetizer with morels for us to try and he brought out a medley of fiddleheads, peas, & tons of morels - WOW!!  We had also ordered the bone marrow/pate starter which was equally amazing and a perfect pairing to our veggie sampler.  For the main meal we ordered the Wagyu meatloaf and Berkshire porkchop (to share) and to our surprise they had split the dishes and placed 1/2 of each dish on each of our plates!  The croissant (bread pudding-like) with caramel popcorn was recommended for dessert and was the perfect ending to our dinner experience at Avenue B.  Service was excellent.  Food was all around one of the best meals I've ever had.  Beautiful, yet simple space with an ordinary mission to serve good food.  We fell in love with this restaurant tonite and look forward to coming back when the seasonal and chalkboard dishes change again.  Bravo Avenue B!!  You are the reason Pittsburgh is becoming a foodie's heaven."}
{"text":"This was some of the best food I've ever had. First was the mussels which had amazing flavor. The sauce was so good you can drink it like soup. Then came the walu dish that was cooked in a garlic butter sauce. It melted in my mouth. The texture reminded me of crab meat. My wife had the meatloaf which I had a bite of. Excellent dish. Very filling but not overwhelming. Brussel sprouts were our side, it was enough to share. Byob was a nice touch. We had a bottle of champagne. The cork fee was $8.   Ambiance was really nice. Jenn was our server, she was awesome, very knowledgeable. This was a great experience. The food was so good I'm afraid to go back! Try this place out you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The shrimp and scallop appetizer was really great.   The meatloaf was ok and the muscles were decent.   Their homemade ice cream trio was a lot of flavors. I enjoyed it and I'm not that big into ice cream. There was definitely room for improvement but I left satisfied."}
{"text":"Don't get the Bronzino. It is good but when all the tail and skin is removed , it only came out to about 2 0unces of actual meat. For $29, not worth it. Also was served with potatoes that were just diced up potatoes and no sauce or anything. Very bland. The service wasn't good either. Took them almost an hour and a half to bring out our food. Had to remind server to bring our side of brussel sprouts Which turned out raw and hard. Couldn't even eat them. We weren't drinking byob so every minute was torture. Wouldn't go back...  They are really good at wording the menu to sound like their food is unique and something you'll never find anywhere else. Such a let down when you actually taste it. Bland and unimpressive"}
{"text":"I am big on the bistro circuit. When Avenue B first opened, I had an incredible meal here. I've been back a few times now and definitely enjoy it. Most recently I had dinner here during Restaurant Week.   The food is great and it comes with a refreshing amount of creativity each time you visit. They use a giant chalkboard to let diners know about the daily menu that goes above their more consistently available items. I'd recommend heading for the chalkboard unless you're really pulled toward something on the main menu.   The service here is generally great although our server last week was a bit pushy. I felt rushed and definitely felt pressed to buy above and beyond the set restaurant week menu. She could have been a bit more friendly for sure but our food courses were spaced well, which is a big service pet peeve for me if it gets botched up.   Bottom line: if you want some upscale dining without busting open your wallet too much, Avenue B is an excellent choice. BYOB makes it an easy place to spend under $100 and still splurge for dessert!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Wonderful Ambience, Delicious Food, Great Service!"}
{"text":"Great service and great. This is a BYOB restaurant which is just fine. Trendy and a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Had my annual pre-Christmas dinner w/friends here this year, and loved it!  First off, the place is really charming. Dim lighting, chic design, I can't believe it used to be a Chinese joint! Also, love that it's BYOB. This makes it easy to have a nicer meal without breaking the bank. Corkage fee is $5 per bottle.  The menu had lots of fun, innovative choices, with a continental influence. You could choose from the seasonal menus or nightly specials. The gal pals and I started with a deconstructed rainbow roll and mussels in a smokey tomato sauce. The rainbow roll was full of high-quality ingredients but not so good for sharing. I kind of wish the server would have mentioned this. All the ingredients were chopped up and served wrapped in cucumber, making it pretty impossible to eat with the chopsticks it was served with and almost impossible to share between three gals. We kind of had to mix up the ingredients and scoop with our forks. I'd get this again with a salad for myself, but not for a group.  The mussels, on the other hand, were awesome. The sauce was smokey, flavorful and thicker than your traditional mussel sauce. I'd definitely get it again. The mussels were plump and perfectly cooked.  For my meal, I got shrimp wrapped with brasaola served with pesto, a creamy sauce and homemade pasta. This dish was FANTASTIC. The sauce was creamy without being heavy; the pesto was full of flavor and the shrimp were perfectly cooked. The brasaola was salty and tasty. All the flavors combined for an innovative take on a pasta dish.  I thought it was super cute that the meal ended with teeny tiny macarons as well.  I'll definitely return here the next time I'm in the 'burgh!"}
{"text":"Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.  I have been there a few times, but I have postponed writing a review of Avenue B. I wish I could like it a tiny bit more to give a four stars, but it falls short of it.  On the plus side, the room is very enjoyable. Small, but not crowded, with ample room between tables. Nice acoustic. Big black boards.  The staff is helpful. And it's BYOB. And the food tends to be good.  So, where's the catch? *tends* to be good... It's a bit unreliable, and it's rarely fantastic. For the price, and despite the BYOB option, I prefer the other high scale in Pittsburgh.  My first time at Avenue B, a couple of years ago, the good was way too salty. This did not happen again, but some dishes I have tried have left me disappointed, although I have enjoyed others more. (Sorry not to give examples, I have no eaten there since early Fall.)  I will probably back at some point, but that's not one of my go-to destinations in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. Loved sashimi app, Kobe meatloaf--duck was good not great. Enough choices for husband w/ gluten issues. Appreciated reminder to bring wine when I made the res. Looking forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I have had in a while!  I have passed this place so many times going to Market District (right across the street on Centre Avenue) and never gave it much thought. Lately I have been hearing many great reviews and wanted to give it a try when some out of town guests were visiting.  I recommend making reservations as the restaurant has limited seating. I had to call twice to change the reservation and each time they made sure to tell us it was BYOB-a nice touch.  We were seated right away and our server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  My only complaint is the seating was tight (not much room to move around) and it got really noisy inside but expected for a Friday night.  The bread they brought out was delicious-warm and fresh baked. We ordered the lamb meatballs as an appetizer. It was a very small portion but oh so delicious served with a tasty Greek yogurt sauce.  For the main entree I went with their specialty, the meatloaf. It was amazing and I can see why it is so popular!  It also came with blue cheese mashed potatoes which were the best I have ever had and topped with onion straws to complete the flavor.  Another in our party ordered the short ribs with sweet potatoes and it was just as tasty.  We split an apple cobbler dessert which once again was a small portion but very good. I highly recommend this place for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Most unforgetable restaurant in pittsburgh. Nice beef loaf and the maybe environment is alittle bit crowded but it's really romantic."}
{"text":"We had a 3 person party visiting Avenue B for the first time. I had a requested a quiet area of the restaurant and was pleased that they honored the request by putting us towards the back. Our waiter, Colin, was excellent - very knowledgeable of the menu, attentive but not suffocating. We had the butternut squash arancini as an appetizer and it was delicious - great textures and flavors. For entrees we had the wahoo, the hangar steak and the short rib. All wonderful and full of flavor, great portion sizes too. For dessert we had the chocolate bar and the croissant bread pudding, both delicious. My friends had coffee - miniature French press brought to the table which they were quite pleased with.  I would return again great cozy spot and the food was impeccable!"}
{"text":"Exceptional.    It took me three tries to get a reservation (almost unheard of in Pittsburgh).    But - third time was a charm.    I always am worried about BYOB restaurants, that they're one week away from closing because they don't make enough money.  So I always have managed expectations.    Avenue B OVER DELIVERED.  We ate outside, so I can't comment on the full atmosphere.  But the service was outstanding.  From the person taking reservations, to the host, to our server.    The menu changes daily, but I was pleased with both the few regulars on the menu and the selection of the unique items.    I was with two friends and we had the beef, pork chop, as well as ravioli.  I'm under delivering on my descriptions to you - but they were amazing.  They did everything well.  There was a guy at the table next to ours who was freaking out about his steak.  From eavesdropping, I believe he wanted it still mooing.  I'm not sure if he was eventually satisfied with their response, but after addressing several times - I'm amazed at the lengths the staff was going to, to make sure he was properly served.  Meal was pricey, but I didn't think over the top.  Additionally because it is BYOB - that cut my bill down by 60% anyway.  Well worth it!  Also, I accidentally left my credit card there - and they were soooo helpful about returning it.    I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I have been here at least 5 times before but not in the last year. Last night, my better half and I went for date night. We both had the parsnip and pear soup and the meatloaf. We both found the soup odd, the mix of sweet and savory just didnt hit the mark, perhaps it was just not for us. But the biggest disappointment was the meatloaf. I have had this meatloaf several times in years past and it was amazing. Last night it was like a sweaty salty grease ball with burnt edges on a pile of mash. The signature sauce had no taste. The Waygu Beef was very greasy and the only noticble seasoning was alot of salt. The mash was good but blinded by the poor meatloaf and overpowered by the salt. I wonder if they have grown complacent over time and let the quality slip. For $100 for a dinner for two we would expect better. The waiter, Brett, was excellent(reason for the one star). The wine was spectacular, but we brought that as they are BYOB."}
{"text":"What a delight. Everything that I have heard about Avenue B was true and more. BYOB is the first bonus. Call ahead for menu and pair accordingly. Excellent selection of  farm to table fare with outstanding service. Small, quiet setting. Great for special occasion. The meatloaf was perfect as was the catch of the day. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good place! We ordered the PEI mussels which taste fantastic w the tomato base. The entree are wagyu meatloaf, which is really just OK because the meat is not tender enough, and the pan seared halibut which is really tasty and yummy. For dessert, we went w the croissant bread pudding. It was pretty good, nice texture and sweet. generally I would give it a 3.5 cause it's BYOB and one of the waiters actually urged us to leave faster as they would have other customers coming soon."}
{"text":"We went to Avenue B once . I ordered steak. It was 8 oz steak . I ask about well done , not blood at all . And I've got really RAW steak . When I asked them to cocked longer , of course after that steak was really dry . I did not like it . And I paid 35$ just for one meal . Do not recommend ."}
{"text":"I just came here for the first time last week with a friend and I'm bummed I waited so long! Don't be like me and put off coming because the menu seems too fancy. It doesn't matter if you don't know what it is, it's all delicious :p I loved it so much that I brought the boyfriend back in the same week for date night! Everything is top notch here from the food to the service to the ambience. It's low-lit, romantic and BYOB! What more could you ask for? The food is fresh and super flavorful and their menu changes often. First time I had the ramen noodle bowl that came with pork belly, shrimp and a soft egg. So good. The second time I got the wagyu meatloaf that comes topped with crispy fried onions on top of a bed of goat cheese whipped mashed potatoes. Out of this world. We also had the side of honey brussel sprouts which is one of the best things I've ever eaten!! The service is very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. Never waited too long for anything. Our table was a little awkwardly positioned which led to our waiter bumping into us a few times so he gave us a free dessert as an apology, which was a nice touch and also so good! Excited to have a great new place in the date night rotation. Seriously go- you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding meal every time.  Start off with the Tuna cubed.  It's Tuna 3 different ways and every bite is a new flavor.   If you are unsure about what to order, always go with the meatloaf, but anything you pick shouldn't disappoint.  They have fresh ingredients that make me question what other restaurants are doing wrong.  So much better than Salt of the Earth.  Don't forget BYOB!"}
{"text":"***Avenue B's kitchen turns fresh and high quality ingredients into light dishes that are also flavorful, vibrant and filling; their reasonable lunch prices also make Avenue B a great option for an upscale lunch in Pittsburgh***  Avenue B sits in a neighborhood that kind of reminded me of Silver Lake, Los Feliz or Atwater Village.  The restaurant has a simple café-like décor, but there are great touches.  I liked the use of purple as well as the hanging light fixtures--rustic but also trendy.  The restaurant has a great neighborhood restaurant feel to it.  Their lunch menu is reasonably priced and it features dishes inspired from many different cuisines.  There is a Cobb salad and a potpie as well as a Thai-like dish and a banh mi.  I went for one of their modern Asian entrees, which was black sesame crusted salmon served with a salad of seaweed, cucumber, surimi, and mushrooms.  It also came with a sauce of sweet soy and a garnish of carrot and daikon.  The salmon entrée seemed like something you would find at a run-of-the-mill Asian fusion restaurant, but it was so much better than that.  The salmon was very fresh and they got a nice crispy crust on it.  The salmon was served medium rare and it was very moist, but it still flaked very easily.  I also liked the great flavor of the black sesame as well as the sweet soy sauce.  The garnish of carrot and daikon was fresh with a light crunch while the seaweed salad was cool, refreshing and flavorful.  I liked the mix of the warm salmon with the cool salad.  It was a very light dish, but it was also a very flavorful and filling dish.  If I were going to nitpick, I would say that the entrée seemed very close (maybe too close) to the Asian ingredients and flavors that influenced it.  But when the ingredients are high quality like this (especially the salmon) and they are handled so well, it is hard to complain (5 stars).  I also tried their flatbread, which was topped with cheese, grilled artichokes, prosciutto, and arugula.  This flatbread had a great crust, which is where a lot of flatbreads can go wrong.  It had a great flavor with the right amount of char; it was thin and crispy but also with a little bit of a chew.  The arugula was great--leafy, peppery and nicely dressed in a light vinaigrette (you often get dry arugula on flatbread).  The generous portion of the arugula kind of overwhelmed the small portion of prosciutto, but the prosciutto was good (not dry, meaty and with the right amount of saltiness).  The cheese was good too.  In terms of other toppings, they used the woody part of the artichoke, which wouldn't be my first choice, but it was actually a good contrast to the leafy arugula and it made the artichokes stand out in a good way (4 stars).  For dessert, I went with their blondie, which was filled with pretzel buttercream and garnished with bruleed green apple.  The bruleed green apple was great.  It was reminiscent of a candy apple but with the use of a tart green apple versus the more sweet red apple (the more traditional apple used in a candy apple).  I think the tart apple combined with the sweet crust was great.  That candy apple-like taste made from a technique you often see with crème brulee was kind of eye opening.  And when it was mixed with the sweet and chewy caramel, it became a dessert that felt very nostalgic but also sophisticated at the same time.  The pretzel buttercream was good.  You do get a little bit of a pretzel flavor with the addition of coarsely chopped pretzels though the buttercream did not have a prominent pretzel flavor.  What I liked about the buttercream though was how it was sweet and creamy without being overly sugary like a lot of buttercreams (4 stars).  I also tried their housemade brown butter ice cream and it was great--great flavor, smooth, creamy, dense, and firm (without being hard) - 4 stars.  Service by Lauren was great.  She was personable, nice, knowledgeable about the menu, and very attentive.  The food also came out at a good pace.  Prices for lunch were reasonable.  Most of the entrees were in the $12-$15 range and several of the starters were $8 and below.  Avenue B is a very impressive restaurant that showcases fresh ingredients in satisfying flavor combinations.  There is also a lot of talent in the kitchen as the flatbread and salmon were both perfectly to near perfectly prepared.  All these great things plus Avenue B's reasonable lunch prices make it a great choice for a delicious upscale lunch in Pittsburgh.  Parking is available on the street by meter.  It is not that difficult finding a space during lunchtime."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE WORST DINNER EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD IN PITTSBURGH. hey Avenue B, you need to stop pretending to be one of the top restaurants in pittsburgh, such as cure, meat and potatoes, butcher and the rye, or crested duck charcuterie. because Avenue B does NOT deserve a 4 star on Yelp whatsoever.   I took my boyfriend there yesterday for his birthday. We were excited about it because a few things on the menu really stood out for us. we both enjoyed our apps, the mussels were decent but it wasn't shockingly good as the reviews described. then it comes the best part. my entree was served: the grilled sword fish with zucchini salad. I took a bite of my fish, it was okay.. then I took a bite of my salad, and immediately wanted to throw up. they probably have put a whole bottle of salt in it!!! Just to make sure I wasn't crazy, I asked my boyfriend to taste it as well. BOOM!! It was so salty that his face was twisted and his eyes teary. I felt really bad to return it to the kitchen, so when our waiter asked how the entree was, I was as polite as I can, and said \"I'm really really sorry, but my salad is inedibly salty.\" he told me no problem, then grabbed my dish really quick and disappeared. after 2 minutes, he came back with supposedly a new salad and the fish (the same piece). I apologized to the waiter again and he explained to me that they pre-make the salad and accidentally salted it twice. omg, i swear it tastes like they've spilled the entire bottle of salt in it. okay, I took a deep breath and tasted the salad. one bite, okay it tastes fresh and NORMAL. second bite, WTF is this, didn't you say this is a new salad? it tastes exactly the same as the old one. so I told the waiter that this is still inedible, he then looked at me as if I was lying. he said, well they didn't salt it this time, then asked me if i would like to get another salad, or a totally different side. I decided to go with the crispy smashed potato. at this point, i'm already DONE with this restaurant. my boyfriend's entree was blend. it consists of regular onion rings you would find in a regular restaurant, mashed potatoes with goat cheese, and a burger patty. IT DOES NOT TASTE LIKE WAGYU BEEF. I ended up spending $100 on the dinner (the swordfish was still charged) but if I had known what this restaurant really is, I would RUN to meat and potatoes, or anything other restaurant that actually knows what they're doing."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE STOLE MY CREDIT CARD & KICKED ME OUT FOR DISLIKING THE FOOD & UNCOVERING SHADY, UNETHICAL & ILLEGAL BUSINESS PRACTICES! Here is my full review:  i'm an extreme food lover & i've inquired a delicate yet exquisite taste for fine dining. my palate includes $1200 dinners at nobu in san diego, ca along with an average $300-$500 italian dinners in nyc or the best unmatched sicilian food around at il milano's in las vegas. my normal hangouts in pittsburgh are hyde park steakhouse & nine on nine. these are just a few of the gourmet restaurants that have undoubtedly effected my judgement when it comes to fine dining or as in this place wannabe fine dining. now to critique every aspect of this bizarre, unpleasant experience & bland, buttery, cold food here would take more time then what i'm willing to spend writing this review. therefore, i will try to sum up my day here as best as possible in lament terms with fewest words possible. i will tell an unbelievable story to the point of my disgust. i simply decided to choose this place for a treat to my wife on mother's day 05/10/15. the only reason i selected this place is because of some dumb comment gordon ramsey made on kitchen nightmares regarding this is supposedly one of the top 10 restaurants in pittsburgh...fyi i strongly disagree. we sat down at 2:30pm & ordered several small plate appetizers including: pork belly lettuce wraps, strawberry flatbread & a demi glaze portabella mushroom plate. none i repeat none of the appetizers were up to par. the strawberry flatbread was saturated with oil & doused with butter out of all things! the bread tasted like nothing but land o lakes butter! next the pork belly was way too charred & noticeably a cheap commercial grade of pork was utilized as well. the portabella mushroom dish was so rich with no balance between the thick almost gravy like demi glaze which shouldn't taste like a cross between canned campbell's beef stew & a botched  marsala. of course i complained & to my surprise the sever argued with me! okay two strikes already, we haven't even had our entree lobster eggs benedict yet. finally, the lobster benedict came out & the first bite immediately introduced a disgusting cold taste of what was suppose to be hot food to my mouth! the eggs were over cooked & absent yolk which makes an eggs benedict famous! okay check please...i had enough. server: \"was everything okay sir\" disatisfied customer: \"no everything was not okay. the eggs benedict was cold. the overall experience here was unsatisfactory.\" server: \"i'm sorry you feel that way sir. i'll remove the appetizers from your bill.\" he huffs & puffs as he walks away knowing that his tip will mostly likely be nonexistent. i'm going to capitalize what happens next because it is unbelievabley by far thee most bizarre inappropriate, unprofessional thing that has ever, i repeat ever, happened to me!! i go to pay with a credit card it was declined? i thought hmm maybe it's over the limit so i tried another. it was declined. the third time, i decided to contact my card first to make sure i had $64.20 available in credit on my discover card. yes i confirmed there was $70.00 available in credit. i gave my discover card to the waiter. patiently, i waited to sign the receipt and be on my way. this is when things got really out of control. the waiter says: \"sir i'm sorry your card was declined\" impossible i thought, i just contacted discover card i know that i have $70 in available credit? disatisfied customer: \"wait let me contact the bank & speak to a live representive\" picking up my cell i called discover card. what they told me next blew my mind! the female representive explains that this restaurant was not only trying to charge $64.20 the actual bill which i kept a copy of my for my records but they were secretly trying to add on a 20% gratuity! nowhere from the menu to the receipt stated auto gratuity was added especially 20%! the pudgy, arrogant, incompetent piece of work  manager came out & argued with me insulting my wife & myself on mother's day in front of a room full of customers! he said now i quote: \"what's wrong don't you have the money to pay? just pay your bills man!\" i was so infuriated that i almost grabbed this fat ass by his neck & gave him a well deserved beat down. however as calm as i could be i tried explaining to an iq of 80 or so that i have discover card on the phone! they told me that a charge of $77 was attempted three times! this would've been exactly 20% ontop of my bill! This unprofessional manager prick then tells me to leave the restaurant and he's going to call the cops?! Why because maybe I exposed a major fraud? I will be filing several more complaints with the consumer credit bureau, bbb & seeking legal council for the way that I was treated & publicly humiliated today. My advice to any future customers is stay far away! The food is grade A garbage and the staff is nuts!!!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance and the food were great. The restaurant week menu is very good.  The tuna^3 (tuna sashimi, tuna tartare on rice, and tuna and roe nigiri) was an ambitious take on the Japanese classic. The tuna tartare was amazing. While the sashimi had a unique and delicious seasoning, the quality of fish was not stellar (but probably typical for a landlocked city like Pittsburgh). The sushi rice was not appropriately cooked (seemed a bit dry/undercooked). But I laud the chef for the innovative adaptation of the dish.  The cauliflower soup was standard and was pretty tasty.   The wagyu meatloaf was excellent. Avenue B has managed to let the taste of high quality beef shine through the meatloaf in ways far better than expected. The fried onions were light and crispy and the mashed potatoes were good too.  The dessert was alright. A white chocolate ice cream filled with crunchy things. The berries or whatever inside were kind of acidic.  According to my friends who ordered the John Dory and prawns, and the pork chop, they were also fantastic.  The free bread was okay.  The candle on our table extinguished and was never lit again.  The service was very friendly, but at a rather leisurely pace. Allot at least 1.5 hours to your meal here."}
{"text":"After some research we decided on this place for my birthday dinner.  The restaurant was on my yelp radar but I didn't know where it was (who knew it was tucked on the corner next to the market district, well I am guessing most people actually).   The place is cozy with only about 10 tables.  The menu is compiled of the rotating \"chalkboard\" menu and the staple menu.  Both menus were intriguing, the gorgonzola flat bread peeked my attention for an app. We also started with the calamari.  Both apps were delish and devoured quickly.  I ordered the tofu noodle bowl which isn't a regular choice for me ( I don't eat red meat or pork) but there weren't too many \"kate friendly\" options. The entree was good don't get me wrong!   The table enjoyed their veal, fish and chips, hanger steak!   Pros: Cozy, BYOB, rotating specials, BYOB, BYOB, delish food.   Cons: Service was not memorable, parking, not many \"kate friendly\" options (ha)   Pros: We definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm adding Avenue B to my list of go-to restaurants when I'm willing to spend a little more to get fantastic food. I've never had a bad meal here, and the food is always interesting. The menu changes constantly, which is fun too. They have a stable, non-changing menu (well, it's seasonal, but it doesn't change very week), and a list of items that change almost weekly up on the wall chalkboard.  I have to admit that I've never had any of their non-rotating menu options, but hear that the kobe meatloaf is quite good. Because their menu changes constantly, I cannot tell you what to get, but I assure you that you'll be pleased with your meal, whatever your choice. The servers are also very willing to give advice (indeed, sometimes their opening description of the options can get a little TOO involved).  My only complaint about Avenue B is the noise level. If you come in around 5:30 to 6:30. the noise level is perfectly acceptable. Or, come on a weekday. But, once the dining room fills up, it can be hard to hear a table-mate across a four top. I personally find that unacceptable, and am disappointed in the number of new restaurants in Pittsburgh that share this problem (Cure is another example). I understand that acoustics are difficult to manage in old buildings, but there are solutions that can be used.   Don't forget - BYOB!"}
{"text":"Just fyi: don't get anything on the menu with seafood fried rice. It's salt bomb. I drank a gallon of water after that.   Otherwise, still giving it a 4 because the app was amazing and the fish on top of the fried rice was decent.  I got tuna hamachi tartare. So good!! Can taste bit of nuttiness from sesame oil and some kick of spice. Kind of reminds me of Korean flavors of gochujang and sesame seed oil together. So they def know how to flavor things so maybe I just got a bad plate with the fried rice.   Their olive oil ice cream was also a pleasant surprise. Little chalky in texture than your regular ice cream but flavor is light and a good palate cleanser. But wasnt so much a fan of other things on the plate like the chocolate bar or the citrus-y reduction. Thought they overpowered the olive oil ice cream's rather delicate flavor.   Still I liked that it was byob (bring a bottle of wine!) and the staff were very nice to us!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Avenue B for a few years now and it is one of my absolute favorite restaurants. Its welcoming and relaxed environment is perfect for date night or catching up with friends. I love that its BYOB and its always consistent. The food is amazing and the ever changing menu is exciting. Overall, just a fantastic place."}
{"text":"Avenue B was amazing- service was superb/ decor was beautiful which made us feel at home from the start!    We split the \"Real Deal\" app of tuna tartar which was crazy good, hush puppies, and Chicken pate- all really nicely prepared and sooo tasty... then 4 entrees including pork bellies and shrimp  with noodles and egg- yummy! Chicken confit and pasta- another hit- stripe bass- killer And the grand finale- meatloaf which was the best this Irish/ Scottish gent has ever devoured (next to my mom and wife's)- stop what you are doing and go!   Bill from Philly"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch during a work day and I was really pleased. The space is small and intimate, and I can imagine it being a great place for a date night or with some good friends in the evening.   My co-worker and I started off with the romaine salad for an appetizer and split it, and I loved it! The tastes were perfect and the balance of dressing (usually my worry) couldn't have been better. For our meal, we each got one half of the chicken panini and the pulled pork with a small side of sweet potato fries. I'd have to say that while I was expecting the pork to be my favorite, the chicken probably came out on top, although I enjoyed them both just fine. The food quality was great and I thought the prices were perfect.  I'll definitely be back for lunch again some time and look forward to a dinner night here!"}
{"text":"This place is just flat out delicious. I mean, flavor explosion to the head, shhhh-I'm-eating, how do they do it kind of delicious. They don't have a liquor license, which is odd - you have to be a local to know to bring some wine. I didn't know... But it's ok: all my cash went to the chef, and I feel he deserves it. Bravo."}
{"text":"Well, after reading all the other reviews I am going to sound like a real downer, but here goes.  I went here for the first time for a birthday dinner with two friends, both of whom had been here before and loved it.  I got the red snapper.  My friends' meals were both extremely salty--one even commented that she would be a bloated mess in the morning!  Her scallops came, she looked at the plate and said, \"Is that it?  Is this an appetizer?\"  Five smallish scallops on a bed of wilted greens.  NOT a good choice for the hearty appetite! Her salad was very good, though.  My fish came, and I needed a sharp knife to saw through it!  I'm not kidding, it had the texture of cartilage!  I tasted it, made a face, and gave it to both friends to try.  One said, \"wow it's fishy!\" the other said, \"You have to send this back, there's something wrong with it!\"  The very gracious waitress came over and went to the kitchen.  When she returned she said the chef told her they were having problems with the fish and would I like to order something else.  SOOOO, why would you keep it on the menu????  I ordered an appetizer, the rock shrimp, because at this point my companions were almost finished with their food and I was still trying t o get an edible meal.  The shrimp was just ok.  Small, a bit chewy with mushy breading.   We got dessert, pineapple upside down cake, which was described as \"traditional\".  NOT.  Two little wedges of pineapple -flavored something with a scoop of cherry ice cream.  For $9, mind you!  My mom makes a better pineapple upside down cake!  I'm not cheap, but I do expect something pretty special for the prices they are charging. Anyway, and this was the shocker of the evening,  although neither the chef nor manager ever came to our table, our entire meal was comp'ed on the basis of that horrible fish.  An unexpected and frankly gracious move on someone's part.  Granted, the waitress recognized a repeat customer in my friend from her previous visits .  My friends were thrilled since they were buying me dinner!  lol.  The waitress got a nice tip, and though I had a very unsatisfying meal, I suppose I could be persuaded to go back and give them another try, as my friends stand by their initial assessment of this restaurant.  And the BYOB aspect is a plus!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to Avenue B, since a friend had enthusiastically recommended it. It was good, though not as good as I had hoped for. My husband and I had a reservation for a Friday night, but when we arrived (on time) our table was not ready. I think we waited about 15 minutes - it was already a late reservation because they were all booked for the times we would have wanted, so to have to wait even longer for our table put a damper on things.  They provide a nice bread basket to start. I had the Crispy chevre salad as an appetizer - fine - nothing exciting (they did comp us one appetizer to make up for seating us late). My main course was really interesting - it was a homemade manicotti and I can't remember exactly what the prep was but it involved cocoa/coffee and I think nettles. I enjoyed trying something new, though I think the flavors could have been more subtle. My husband had a lamb dish with artichokes, which he seemed to enjoy. We skipped dessert, since it was so late by then.  The service was fine.  Not sure if I would try Avenue B again - if so, I'd probably go on a weekday so they'd (hopefully) be less busy."}
{"text":"Our meal was delicious from start to finish. We started with mussels and fried green tomatoes; the mussels were served in a red sauce the tasted of BBQ and the fried green tomatoes were served with different sauces, including a ground mustard and spicy sauce which made for a great accompaniments for the appetizer course. I had the fried fish and chips for my main dish and it was a very light and fulfilling dish. My husband also liked his main dish, which was wagu steak with potatoes and beans in a mushroom sauce. For dessert, we had the croissant bread pudding with salted caramel popcorn ice cream. It was the perfect mixture of flavors and was the best dessert we've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has closed down.  I heard but not confirmed that they will be relocating.  I hope this is true.  They had the best meatloaf dish ever!  Staff was very accommodating with dietary requirements."}
{"text":"This was the last restaurant on a list my boyfriend and I had made in the past year to go to and basically we saved the best for last! The decor and vibe is just so welcoming and relaxing. Our server was very informative and  very attentive, which I find is not so easy to come by!  First we each got an appetizer. He got the mussels and I got the baby spinach salad. For me these are both crazy choices, but what's even crazier? I LOVED them both!!! I never and I mean never order salad out, but I really do enjoy baby spinach and strawberries. The best way to describe my love for that dish? I would have ordered that and only that and been happy.. The mussels were amazing and I don't even like mussels (or at least I didn't). Every flavor for both dishes were delicious and blended together perfectly.  Next was the entree and I got the duck. Now I get duck almost every time I go out. But this, it was exceptional! Cooked perfectly and the cavatelli.. Oh that delicious gift from the heavens! Need I say more? And last is the meatloaf and my boyfriend was just over the moon for it!   The best way to describe our love of this food is to say that we tried to have a conversation with each other during dinner, buttttt the food took over and all you could hear were silverware on plates and a deep breath every so often.  And on top of all that, it's BYOB!"}
{"text":"Been here a total of two times, both times were during their restaurant week. But I have been pretty impressed and loved what they had to offer.  For starters, this restaurant is tiny! By tiny I mean it probably can't fit more than 20 people. But that is also why it makes this place feels cozy.  For appetizers I remember their butternut squash soup. That was very delicious! I am not a fan of butternut squash but the soup they made was great! I don't remember the entree I ordered but I do remember it being really good! I  pretty sure this is one of the few places that manages to keep their chicken dish juicy and tender instead of dry and tough! And lastly, omg dessert heaven! Doesn't matter what you get, they are amazing!!! From presentation to the taste, everything is awesome. I would totally come here just for the dessert.  If you want to come during a weekend, please make reservation. I doubt you will ever get seated without reservation due to their size."}
{"text":"Nothing but good here. Staff is very quick and skilled but not pushy. They know the menu in and out. The food is all presented well. Solid diversity in meals choice. Good atmosphere. Good about the BYOB keeping wine chilled, etc. Even a candle on the desert for the b-day."}
{"text":"Not bad but not great. I think part of the problem is that there is a lot of hype around this place. Service was good. Food fell short. First, the complimentary bread (which I think serves as a good indication of how the rest of the meal will be) was boring, like something straight from trader joes. We had the grilled octopus and mixed green salad as a beginner. Both were okay but the flavor profiles were dull and left something to be desired. The salad had these sweet potato chips  sprinkled on top which just felt lazy. For entrees, we had the duck and the monk fish. Both proteins were well prepared but lacked creativity and the complexity of flavors that one would expect in a place like this. The deserts ( pumpkin trifle and chocolate bar) were delicious but it is hard to mess up sweets."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch here yesterday!  My friend and I both had the salmon with seaweed salad, and it was very good.  It's small and intimate, and the fact that it is a BYOB is a big plus.  The waiter was very nice and very accommodating."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times and have liked it in general, and went recently specifically for the fish and chips, one of our favorite foods. The fish was good, striped bass--that was going to be served with skin on, but we insisted that couldn't happen, so they took it off. Fish fine, but no chips. Instead, potato crisps mixed in with the cole slaw in order to make them soggy it seems. Fish and chips just have to come with french fries!  But, on the whole, food ok.  Ambience? completely terrible. We hadn't realized before just how noisy this place is. Terrible acoustics, unbearably loud. Not relaxing, not intimate, not friendly. We've written this one off, struck it off our list and won't go back, not even if they add french fries. ."}
{"text":"Coming to Avenue B was an unexpected and pleasant surprise! I have heard of this restaurant but to be honest I didn't know much about it. Chris told me that a group of his friends & their girlfriends made reservations here for Friday night.. after searching through Yelp I was excited to try it out!  We had dinner reservations for 8:30 on a Friday night and when we arrived we were quickly seated. The restaurant was pretty full but not overly packed. It had a simple and romantic atmosphere that I loved! Our waitress Jenn was very informative and helpful. She provided fabulous service and the whole group was happy with her.  Avenue B is also a BYOB (score!) so we all shared bottles of wine over our chit chats throughout the evening. As appetizers, we shared the shared the sesame  Brussel sprouts and one of their seasonal breads(I can't remember the name). We were also served fresh bread with homemade cinnamon butter- everything was delicious!   The menu here is seasonal with the exception of a few different entrees. The meatloaf- which many Others have raved about- is always on their menu. Chris ended up ordering this after our waitress saying how amazing it is. It was served with goat cheese whipped potatoes and onion straws with a tomato jam. It was amazing and chris also said it was super filling! For my dinner, I ordered the pasta dish off the seasonal menu. It was a thicker pasta that had a spicy pesto sauce, burrata, kale, roasted squash, and hot Italian sausage. This dish was also a winner and super unique. I look forward to coming back to Avenue B in the future!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I waited so long to try Avenue B. It's a shame that I spent such a large portion of my time in Pittsburgh without ever eating there. Anyway, I have now seen the light and fallen in love with Avenue B (on Valentine's Day!)  Why do I like Avenue B? The ambiance is great, the servers are on point, it's clean, and of course, THE FOOD.   We had: -A lobster bisque which was unique and very flavorful. It did not have lobster pieces in it, but it did have very delicious roasted cauliflower. -Crispy oysters with two amazing sauces. The only issue I had was that there were three pieces (maybe with multiple oysters) and the cost was $13. It was a great dish and I'm glad I ordered it, but I don't know if I believe it should have been more than $8.  -Grilled swordfish that was also very unique and had distinctive curry flavors that were not overwhelming.  -Dayboat scallops and shrimp in a chowder. Holy moly these were phenomenal. My boyfriend and I always split and try each other's food and I seriously did not want to give this one up. It took all of my will to not devour the entire plate. Please go to Avenue B and order it. Please. -Croissant Bread pudding with buttered popcorn ice cream. The bread pudding was good but the ice cream was way better. -Chocolate sea salt caramel bar. I'm still having fantasies about eating it. It was a combination of a candy bar and brownie and it also came with an interesting olive oil ice cream and a side of marmalade.     It's also BYOB so bring a bottle of wine when you go. And go ASAP."}
{"text":"Meatloaf! Meatloaf! Meatloaf!  I never thought in a million years I would order meatloaf at a restaurant, but after all of the positive reviews and a glowing recommendation by our server, I had to dive in.  Let me just say it, this meatloaf is more like a ground up steak than your standard high-school cafeteria fair.  Moist, complex and paired with awesome onion straws and mashed potatoes.  The rest of B's menu is just as complex (though occasionally forgettable) and it plays a great Americana twist on some common staples.  Add in the fact that it's getting rarer and rarer throughout the city to find good restaurants that still honor the BYOB calling, and Avenue B rounds it out as a fantastic double date spot!"}
{"text":"For the food, I was in between 4-5 stars. But the service was slow (though friendly), so 4 stars for the whole experience.  I was lucky that the boyfriend's parents were in town, so among the 4 of us, I was able to try many dishes. We ordered: Brussel Sprouts - I never knew brussel sprouts could be so good. Simple, healthy and absolutely delicious. They were cooked in a slightly sweet sauce...honey? Even my boyfriend who hates this vegetable enjoyed them. Wedge Salad - Pretty standard flavors. The lettuce was fresh. The figs were a nice touch. The Raw Deal - There were 3 mini servings of raw salmon and tuna. I liked the thinly sliced rectangular slices of tuna; melt in your mouth fish! The salmon nigiri was standard. The mix of diced tuna and salmon in between a bed of rice and wasabi mayo was pretty good but I would have preferred if it were all tuna. Wagyu Meatloaf - Yum!!! The meatloaf was full of flavor. A tiny bit salty, but when I ate them w/ the potatoes, it was perfect. The crispy onions on top were a nice touch. Hanger Steak - I didn't try this because I don't like steak, but my boyfriend said it was one of the better hanger steaks he has had in Pittsburgh. Fish and Chips - The fish of the night was walleye. The fish was well cooked. Pork Tenderloin - Another dish I didn't try, but my boyfriend's mother said the flavors were \"great.\" Their free bread was just okay. The pumpkin flavored butter that it came with was odd.  Overall, we really enjoyed our meal here and will likely be back."}
{"text":"I didn't bring a bottle of wine. This is a BYOB which I was aware of prior. However I noticed people sitting around with a couple bottles of wine and talking with friends which is nice. Not being one of those people this time, I really notice things like the food and service? I got the meat loaf and my wife got Bronzino. It took over an hour to get our meals. We both shared a side of Brussel sprouts, that you could of used as marble.  The Brussel sprouts were so hard I couldn't pick them up with a fork Alone eat them. My wife did like her fish but it was very small and my meatloaf was average at best. In short I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Prices aside this is a fantastic place. I went there with my girlfriend and we both agreed it's some of the best food we've had in Pittsburgh. Service is great and it wasn't hard to get a reservation a few days out."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here on a whim. Service was terrific, food was terrific, dessert was terrific. We sat for hours to catch up, and never felt like we were given the evil eye for taking up a table.   The menu chalkboard had some terrific choices on it, and we would have liked to try every one. I liked the fresh, local ingredients, the fact that the portions weren't huge and that there were interesting choices available for someone who's trying to watch the calories.   I loved that when we each asked for decaf, it came in a French press. Delightful.   I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I ate at Avenue B in Pittsburgh during a visit back in July.  Chef Chris Bonfili really puts forth some creative and tasty cuisine sourcing seasonal ingredients from local farms for his menu which changes daily.  My girlfriends took me here and we ordered & shared many different dishes and they were all delicious.  Kobe Meatloaf, goat cheese & chive whipped Potatoes with Crispy Shallots and tomato jam - Heirloom Tomato & asparagus salad, with a roasted garlic vinaigrette - Black Grouper, black eyed peas & greens, candied bacon, sweet potato hay, berry BBQ - Crispy Eggplant, Tagalini Pomodoro.   Pittsburgh better savor this gem of a restaurant that could easily rival my favorites here in San Francisco.  I look forward to eating here again when I'm back over the holidays!!!  YUM!!!  PS. BYOB"}
{"text":"I slept in this morning and I blame Avenue B.  As someone who's never late, I had to have experienced a certain level of satisfaction to cause this coma.  After years of promising to try this Shadyside gem, I finally bit the bullet with Jonathan D. and headed there for a lovely little Wednesday date night during Restaurant Week.  Though their full menu was available, we both opted for the 3-course Restaurant Week menu which consisted of: Choice of Starter - either Falafel or Mussels; Entrees - Vegetarian Bolognese; Arctic Char and Scallops; and Braised Pork Cheeks; and a dessert of Ice Cream and Bread Pudding.  We both opted for the mussels to start and what a perfect beginning it was.  I'll order mussels anywhere...including places I shouldn't. Though I love them, I'm often disappointed with the broth and/or bread - always left longing for something more. Not this time.  I don't know what they do to those mussels or what that sauce/broth/heavenly soup was, but it was the BEST I've ever had.  I chose the Arctic Char and he chose the Pork Cheeks for our entrees, and neither were disappointed.  The scallops were the highlight of my dish, and while the char could have used a bit more seasoning, I loved it just the same. After tasting Jonathan's Pork Cheeks (not a euphemism), I was equally hooked.  We both ended with the bread pudding, of which I'm not generally a fan. For what it was, it was delicious.   In addition to the excellent food the service was perfection.  Our server Jessica was attentive, timely and friendly.  At $80 including tax and our corkage fee (hooray for BYOB), Avenue B is one of Restaurant Week's greatest values. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"It was a beautiful night, so we sat outside.  Although the tables are right at the bus stop, so there are buses starting and stopping, it was okay.  Inside (as we learned when we used the rest rooms) was MUCH noiser.  The Food was EXCELLENT.  We had the tempura green beans and sweet potatoes to start.  Yummy.  For entrees, we had the signature Kobe meatloaf, which was very good.  No wonder it is the signature dish.  We also had the veggie/pesto tower, which was good, but small.  (was it a first course?  I didn't think so.).  Dessert was worth the trip.  Croissant bread pudding served in strips alongside popcorn ice cream.  We might go again when it is warm enough to sit outside, but will be hesitant to go inside."}
{"text":"If someone asked me to pick my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh, Avenue B would be my top choice. This place has a quiet and intimate setting with not many tables. The tables are close together but I don't find it overly intrusive.  With every visit there is always a new menu with many seasonal items.  The food is always top notch and the service is stellar. Add in the fact this place is BYOB and you have the recipe for greatness.   On a recent visit with great friends, we had yet another fine experience. This is a great place for a fantastic dinner."}
{"text":"It is a small, cute place.  Creates nice atmosphere, in particular for special occasions.  Other than this, food is good but not the best ever.  Their selection is fairly small I could say (but I guess it suits its size as well :) ).  Service is very good; you do not get overwhelmed with questions but at the same time you have the attention you need.  By all means I will visit it again but it's not top on my list."}
{"text":"Fabulous food- different options and presentations  makes \"foodie\" food accessible. Service great and the byob makes it easier to concentrate on the food. Only drawback to the small size of the space is the noise factor at times- Food always of the freshest ingredients and most  interesting combinations. Every time it's been a hit- one of our favorites"}
{"text":"It's little expensive, but they have good food and excellent service!! It's not only delicious, but seems to be fresh and healthy. It's BYOB, so they don't have wine the house, you must bring your own. I recommend the steak."}
{"text":"This restaurant is indeed very good. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff was great. The appetizer dishes were outstanding (mussels, tuna tartare), delicious flavors all around. However I was a bit disappointed in the main course, a meal consisting of short ribs and gnocchi among other ingredients. It was seasoned ok but it seemed like there was a bit too much fat in the meat. And I wasn't really into the gnocchi - perhaps it's an acquired taste. The prices were higher end, but not too bad."}
{"text":"Just tried Avenue B for the first time last week, and will definitely be back again! Loved the atmosphere and our service was excellent...not to mention the delicious food! I had the Wagyu Beef meatloaf and was not disappointed! And it's BYOB, so what more can you ask for? Highly recommend Avenue B"}
{"text":"Remarkable food in a very nice space.  The Mussels were cooked perfectly and tasted delicious.  The pork belly lettuce wraps were excellent. I ordered the Wagyu beef meatloaf because it is a \"signature dish,\" however I did not think it was as remarkable as the other entrees I tasted.  This is a BYOB restaurant.  The chef seems passionate about preparing good food and the service is attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"Can I say I have been dying to try this place.  First a word for the wary, it's super popular so make sure that you get a reservation. However, I went for lunch, so I will be reviewing that.  My friend Cam and I love our BYOBs. It's an awesome way to enjoy your food properly without the hassle of stumbling through your budget and the often meager selections. Cam is the wino and I pick the food [it works] today we had a Williamette Valley Pinto Gris 2013 which is fruity and perfect for so many items on this menu.   Walking in the first things that I noticed was the smell of Brussel Sprouts [the rave] which automatically told me that it was going to be an elongated space which a direct line from the kitchen to the reception space [wind tunnel] which is perfect for speed and customer service allowing any potential short staffed scenarios to be minimized. I seated myself at one of the two seaters on the left side of the room. Immediately ahead and behind me you could find chalk board with the specials from the menu. Perfect. Unfortunately my current new shoutout item of grilled octopus is only a dinner item [:-( I will be back for that].   The menu is short and sweet on a single slim placard divided in beginning, mains and sides, the deserts you are told by the waiter. We were brought our waters [with lemon of course] and wine glasses promptly but he scattered to give us time to order.   We started with a beginner to share the Vegetable Tempura in a Japanese Aioli. There are two veggies, carrots and asparagus and they are just slightly battered where the entire vegetable is covered but not drenched. Delightful. What a great start.  I was torn between two dishes for main but settled on the Wild Mushroom and Roasted Squash Pappadelle with Rosemary crumbs and Chevre. I love it, however I do not consider it perfect. The portion was just right, the Chevre was meltaway to moisten and enhance you mushrooms, the shrooms were lovely and woody but the pappadelle were slightly too al dente for me. Maybe an extra 15-30 seconds would have been good for me. Oh well. I sized filled me up well. Cam got the Grilled Chicken burger that came with greens. I personally am not a Burger go-to burger but it looked delicious. Beware of the fluffy bun.   What I can't forget. The side of Brussel Sprouts. How could I smell it and not get them? Seriously. Duh. Anyways, first of all this is not a side, this is an appetizer and perfect to share, almost too much. They are charred roasted to perfection, crispy as all heck and accompanied with super salty candied bacon. Perfect, perfect, especially with the fruity wine. Weird, I know! But it did it for me.  At this point I was satisfied and full but Cam wanted desert. There were two available, either a Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee and a tri-flavored icecream with pineapple pieces and a maraschino cherry that made it in a icecream pineapple upside down cake in a bowl. Great, great! Love the fruit variety but I will say that those chocolate lovers will be disappointed.   Between the desert and the pappadelle I had to knock off a Star because It was just not perfect for me. But that is just my opinion, but kill me.   However, I am beyond intrigued to come back to try the Octopus. Come for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"I am going to have to go with a ok here. Most of that probably is because I went into this place expecting the \"best restaurant in the burgh.\"  The food was great. I ordered something that wasn't on their chalk board which made me nervous. It was organic chicken and quinoa. Perhaps I am different than most, but I expected the quinoa to be warm. I don't know if that is normal or not, but chilled quinoa on warm chicken was a bit... weird for me.   The byob is a major plus. I love that about Pittsburgh! It was a perfect atmosphere for a date. My dates meal was much better than mine. Meatloaf I think?   Anyways, the food was decent and atmosphere was great. I just wanted it to be more than great? And wanted my meal to be warm."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this restaurant. It was my 3rd trip to Pittsburgh. We couldn't squeeze it in during our visit in August but kept it on our list of places to try after reading the YELP reviews. We sat patiently waiting in the car for it to open at 5:00. it turns out that we were the only customers until 2 others came in an hour later, on this rainy Thursday evening. The waiter was friendly and took our orders quickly. A small basket arrived with cold but fresh bread. What a difference if the bread was warm. Our food arrived 30 minutes later after we ordered. I had calamari stuffed with a seafood sausage with risotto and some sweet corn. My son ordered meat loaf made with wagyu beef, mashed potatoes, and threads of thinly fried onions. My dish smelled of spoiled seafood but foolishly I did not trust my nose. I ate a forkful of salt. I was convinced that maybe the seasoning hit a isolated spot. I tried more but the entire dish $27 was so salty and bad that I could not finish it even though I had skipped lunch. I tried my son's potatoes and they were salty too. He said his entire dish tasted like salt. In all my years eating out, I think this was one of the few times I had the guts to say something negative when the waiter asked how is your food. I said it was very salty. In all fairness, he asked if we wanted them to fix it. We did not want to wait another half hour for a fixed dish and what was wrong with his nose? What would they give us to replace these scary dishes with? We were terribly disappointed. The serving was tiny but we could not and dared not to finish the itty bitty portions. How could they serve dishes like that? There were no other customers. It took more than a half hour to get it. The kind waiter offered to \"do something\" but he came back with the complete bill. Our tongues felt like they were cured with salt for over 2 hours. This is probably the most shockingly negative experience following a restaurant with positive YELP reviews we have ever experienced. Yes, we wimped out. I should have asked the waiter or manager to smell and taste what they served us. It made no sense. I'm still puzzled by the experience. 2 nasty dishes, with tip a few coins under $60. I can't think of anything worse than this dinner except 20 years ago at a Denny's when the staff were targeting customers in a fight with management. I'm getting more upset as I write this."}
{"text":"For some reason, some kind of force in the world has kept me from wanting or even considering going here since it opened. It might have been the location - it's on the wrong side of Shadyside to be a good restaurant, right? Wrong. So wrong.  I went here for a staff lunch and left full of amazing food. We split some great French pressed coffee while pondering the menu, until we were informed that was from last night's dinner - if there was something that we wanted on the menu, we could ask and they'd check with the kitchen. We asked if they could whip up some delicious truffle fries for us, they checked, and they did.  Pittsburgh is getting really good about gourmet, seasoned fries and these were no exception. They arrived along-side delicious tempura-battered vegetables (om nom nom sweet potatoes), and a pear and Gorgonzola flatbread (also om nom nom).  Being the sucker that I am for beet salads, ever since I went to Salt of the Earth I've been devouring them, I got the pistachio chicken, beet, and goat cheese salad. The chicken was pretty okay, it didn't knock my socks off, but chicken on salad isn't normally... a sock-knocker. However, I hear that three of my colleagues kobe-beef burgers were very tasty. Apparently they have a great cheese selection.  I'll absolutely come back for dinner, but prepared to spend a lot more than I did at lunch. Big price changes between menus - probably with good reason."}
{"text":"FOOD:  Great food.  Came with a large group and we all sampled a majority of the dishes.  Each dish was extremely tasteful and appeared appropriately balanced.  Everything, right down to the desserts were excellent.  Props to an excellent chef.  ALCOHOL: BYOB.  How can you beat that?  $5 corking fee applies (Wines: $5 Small bottle; $10 Large Bottle)   SERVICE:  Even for a large group of 13-15, they did an excellent job making sure we were all taken care of.  They even divided up all the bills appropriately without complaint.  All the food came out at the same time.  Perfectly timed.   ATMOSPHERE: Romantic.  Hip.  Although it doesn't appear to be like this from the outside, once you're in, it's a completely different place.  PRICE:  A little on the higher side, however, it's well work the price for the quality of food that you're getting.  Avg meal: $15-$30.  Appetizers: $8-$15."}
{"text":"We hosted a private party here for 25 guests to celebrate my mom's birthday.  The restaurant is closed on Saturday afternoons, yet available for private parties.  I loved that we had the entire restaurant to ourselves.  It is an intimate and down to earth space but has all the right touches to make a special event feel pretty spectacular.  Chris, the chef/owner is extremely mellow and easy to communicate with.  He sent us a suggested menu and it was perfect.  No negotiating, no revisions needed.  The day of the event was very smoothly run.  The waitstaff was fantastic.  They were attentive yet felt invisible at the same time.  The food was very good and presentation excellent.  It is also great that they are BYOB, which of course makes for a less expensive tab.  The cost of the entire event was extremely reasonable.   I think a Saturday afternoon event here would be perfect for anyone looking to host a bridal or baby shower in the East End area, or who wants a smaller afternoon luncheon wedding reception."}
{"text":"as expected, dinner at ave b is definitely worth 5 stars.   the food (as it was with brunch) was amazing, and i love that they have just as many specials each night as the permanent (but seasonal) menu.   service was also great, and byob much more appreciated during dinner when bringing your own wine can be a great way to make a more expensive meal affordable.   i was also pleased to find out what 'tuna squared' was - a deconstructed spicy tuna roll and tuna sashimi - annnnd it was really tasty."}
{"text":"In our search for all of the great restaurants of Pittsburgh I am thrilled to add Ave. B to the list.  It is in a gentryfing neighborhood but parking was much easier than Southside! The food was really fantastic,  We had dinner on a Saturday night.  It had a good crowd but was not super busy.  We had a reservation which is worth making because there is no bar to wait for a table. Probably because it is BYOB-which is great for your budget---just make sure to plan ahead.  The decor is simple but nice with a cool vibe. The severs are VERY enthusiastic about the food in a \"I must tell you every detail of the preparation\" kind of way which is mostly endearing because everyone who works there is a foodie. It has the potential to get on your nerves after a while.   The menu was not vast but everything we tried was delish.And the prices were quite good for the quality. I would highly recommend.  It is a pretty small space though so maybe not great for a large group but perfect for 2 couples or maybe 3."}
{"text":"I have no idea how it has taken me this long to get back to Avenue B. Maybe it's because you have to call over a month in advance for a reservation at a normal time (unless you eat at 5 or 9:30). Seems that every time I call weeks in advance, I can never get a reservation. Why must you be so darn busy? Must be the amazing food, adorable atmosphere and incredible service. Did I mention that I love this place? If you asked me right now, where should we go for dinner, my answer would be Avenue B. If you asked me again tomorrow and then next day and the next, my answer would always be Avenue B. But seriously people, stop going there so I can actually get a reservation!  This trip, I decided to go with one of the specials on the chalk board. A pasta with sausage, spinach and fresh cheese which was not mozzarella though the texture was the same. The best part of the meal? The \"garlic crumbs\" on the top. What are garlic crumbs and how do I find them so I can literally put them on everything I eat? I was also able to reach across the table and try the schezuan green beans. Didn't mix well with pasta but phenomenal on it's own. For dessert; I couldn't resist the holiday themed ice cream trio- chocolate thumbprint, sugar cookie and (I think) gingerbread. Hubs had to steal the bowl away from me to get a taste. Yet another incredible meal from Avenue B!"}
{"text":"I tried Avenue B for the first time a couple nights ago. I went with my parents, who had been once before over the summer, and had a good experience then. Our waitress was pleasant and service was quick but not so speedy you felt like your dinner was over before it started. I had the vegetarian spaghetti squash chilli relleno. The waitress warned me it would be very spicey, and indeed it was! If you're looking for a spicey dish, I would recommend this. My mom thought her dish (the scallops and mung fish) was too salty, but she is particularly sensitive to salt. We were a little disappointed by the dessert portion, particularly of the ginger bread cake with egg nog ice cream. There were two small pieces of cake and one TINY scoop of ice cream. Of course, most American restaurants have ridiculously huge portions of food, and I appreciate when a restaurant gives you a reasonable amount to eat, but if you are excited about one of the desserts, don't plan on sharing!"}
{"text":"Dinner last night, a slow, cold Sunday, was very good. The restaurant was half empty, which is the way we prefer. Our entres were the crab and clam black pasta and, as required, the signature Kobe meat loaf. We were happy with both, but the bread was a little stale, probably because it was late on a Sunday night. For desert we shared the caramel popcorn bread pudding, which was good but nothing special. Service was efficient, but given the low turnout, service demands were minimal. We took advantage of the BYOB feature, and scored twice, since the corkage fee is waived on Sunday. Overall it was a very good experience and we will return, but we avoid the crowded Fridays and Saturdays, when parking is often a hassle. I"}
{"text":"OMG.  I was in town on business and went here for dinner.  It blew me away. A very playful, creative menu.  I am very impressed.  The food was outstanding.  I was only here for 4 nights.  I spent 2 of them here and that's only because they were closed in the first two.  I am a big foodie and have eaten in the best of the best in NYC.  I may have to make a special trip back to Pittsburgh just to visit Ave B.   Don't forget to bring your own wine as they are BYOB."}
{"text":"This gem of a BYOB is a welcome find in Pittsburgh. From what I gather, the menu changes often and erratically so my review may not actually help you pick what to order. That being said, I've already started writing so here goes.  They did a squid ink dish with fish that really blew me out of the water. Also, the fish and chips is very, very good. The fall spice pork belly lettuce wraps didn't really impress me, but the other items more than made up for it.  Instead of dessert, I supplemented my meal by ordering a \"raw bar\" dish. It consisted of a few different creative takes on sushi (a fish salad, a few basic nigiris, and a \"deconstructed\" maki roll). This was pricey but extremely clever.  Avenue B seems oddly out of place, stationed in some random road in the 'burbs of Friendship. I applaud restaurant owners for striking out like this, bringing creative food to quiet areas that otherwise might be restricted to chain sandwich restaurants."}
{"text":"Thank you Avenue B for saving our birthday dinner! My husband's birthday was last week and his parents were coming from out of town to visit. We had a pretty early dinner reservation at Avenue B, and we got a call from his folks saying they had hit some issues on their trip and would be about an hour late. They were able to push our reservation back an hour, no problem- we had the table the whole night. This was great because then we uh, had to push the reservation back a second time. Yes, we were those people. All in all, we were able to keep our reservation about 1 1/2 hours later than we initially planned. I'm sure we could have scrambled to find another nice restaurant if we had to, but it was great not having to worry about it. Additionally, we had someone dining with us that had food allergies and they handled it great.   Any time we've been to Avenue B, service has been great.  It's a great neighborhood restaurant with a rotating menu. Everything I've had, I've really enjoyed- comforting, yet slightly elevated American dishes. We always like finding a nice spot that is BYOB. You really feel like you can relax and catch up with friends here over some wine- there's no rushing through your courses. Sometimes, the wait for orders, food, etc CAN be a little long, but I don't mind."}
{"text":"We decided to try Avenue B to celebrate a fellow Yelpers Birthday.  We're both lovers of anything BYOB, so Avenue B was a front runner from the beginning.  It's a cute little space tucked right on the corner of Centre.  Parking was a little tricky, but we expected that.  The exposed brick and chalkboards set the right tone for me.  We started with the Gorgonzola flat bread and calamari.  Both were very good.  If I had to pick one over the other I'd go with the flat bread again.  After reading all the rave reviews about the fish and chips, my decision was made before I walked in the door.   I chose the pan seared option on the fish and it was cooked perfectly.  The chips and the slaw that accompanied the dish met my expectations.  I'll definitely be back again.  The rest of the table ordered from the chalk board menu.  We had the tofu, veal medallions, and hanger steak.  We shared a side of brussels sprouts.  I'm not typically a fan of brussels sprouts, but Avenue B won me over.  Everyone really enjoyed their dinners!  Looking forward to B Gourmet opening in Sewickley soon!"}
{"text":"Avenue B was outstanding. We made reservations through Open Table, got there a little early, but got seated right away. The service was incredible. Even the butter that came with the bread was excellent.   We began with a butternut squash soup, which was very filling but so flavorful. I would highly recommend.   Next, we had to order the meatloaf. It's been raved about on more than one occasion and I can tell you, it's worth the hype. The flavors work so well together. My husband and I both cleared our plates. We were too stuffed for dessert, but we will definitely be back.   All around, an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"Based off the reviews, I was really hoping that Avenue B would give me a great dining experience; however, I was fooled once again by the several 5 star reviews. I was considering to give 3 stars instead of 2 since service was great, but it didn't convince me enough to increase my stars. Our waiter was extremely attentive and friendly so service here is great, the issue was the food.   Let's start with the bread basket. The bread tasted good - had great flavors - and the butter it came with was delicious, BUT the bread was cold (almost ice cold actually). I don't know if that was there intention, but isn't it standard to get room temperature or warm bread at restaurants?  I ordered the Wagyu Meatloaf. Everything on this dish was OVER SALTED. The crispy onions were good, but I couldn't get over the saltiness. Since the salt was so overpowering, I could barely taste the meatloaf and the mash. It wasn't very enjoyable, but I still managed to eat a good portion of it since I was very hungry.  My friend who also got the meatloaf said her dish was too salty. Another one of my friends who went there the day right after us got the Fish & Chips, and she said her dish was too salty as well. I love seasoning and bold flavors (I like everything super flavorful, especially anything that has garlic in it) but salt is one seasoning that needs to be dealt with a careful hand. I hate oversalted dishes, and this is what made me really disappointed about Avenue B.    I have been to Avenue B before one night just to have dessert and at that time the dessert was remarkable, but for this night's dinner, the dessert was subpar. I got the Croissant Bread Pudding with Popcorn Ice Cream. The ice cream was delicious! Yet, the bread pudding was underwhelming - I felt like I was eating super soggy french toast.   For dinner and dessert, it came out to more than $40. The price is not bad if the food is great, but since it wasn't great I don't think the price was worth the experience.   I wish my dining experience was better, but the salt and the underwhelming croissant bread pudding definitely has led me to not want to go back to Avenue B. The menu is intriguing but I don't want to overwhelm my palate with salt."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic, but nothing mind blowing.   It has a menu comparable to legume in the sense that everything is made with the freshest seasonal ingredients.  However...I prefer legume.   We started the dinner with 2 appetizers:  - Spare ribs with BBQ sauce  - Smoked tuna strawberry salad   Both were delicious.  The spare ribs were meat falling off the bone tender and the sauce was bbq sauce but more refined.  The smoked tuna on the salad made the appetizer worth it.   For my main course:  - arctic char and scallops with couscous   The arctic char was nothing special but the scallops were AMAZING, unquestionably FRESH. Best part of the meal hands down (too bad there were only 2 pieces).  A friend had the ribeye which was also very tasty.   I definitely enjoyed my meal at avenue b, but with a meal that comes at a hefty price, I don't know if it's worth another trip =/ If I'm paying that much, the food BETTER be mind blowing."}
{"text":"Avenue B...I'm very glad to meet you!   My entire party of 8 wanted to lick their plates.   Here are a few things to know about this place. - Everything we ordered was delicious.  You can't go wrong.    - They are vegetarian friendly. - The menu they give you has a very small selection, but then there are a whole bunch of other options on chalkboards (like more options than are on the actual menu).   Now, I do usually hate a chalkboard, but these were pretty visible.  There is more than one and the place is small enough that you can see them from your seat without too much trouble.    - BYOB, but the corkage fee is kinda high.  $5 for the first bottle and then $2.50 for each additional.   We had 6 bottles and I don't think he even charged for all, which helped.   - Service was great.  Prompt and friendly, with good descriptions of the menu items.   - Reservation just took an e-mail.   I requested separate checks with the reservation and the server already had the memo (which is rare).   We were seated on time and had plenty of space.  Overall, this place is a winner and was a great start to my alphabet dining series."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and the service really good.  I enjoyed the cauliflower soup and swordfish.  The brocollini side was perfectly seasoned.  The only idea we had for improvement is to hang some acoustic tiles.   The dining room is on the loud side."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times for lunch and once for dinner. Always ordered their wagyu beef burger for lunch, packed full of flavor served with sweet potato fries. The burger itself is usually on the saltier side but absolutely does not overpower. Had the lamb2 for dinner, two pieces of grilled lamb chop and some slow cooked lamb shoulder. Lamb chop is cooked to medium and goes well with the sauce. The dessert we had was something like caramel chocolate cake with olive oil ice cream. May not sound like much but also a delight. Only slight disappointment was that they didn't have mussels that were on the menu and we were looking forward to trying."}
{"text":"I had wanted to try this place for a while. After seeing it on the list of best BYOB places in Pittsburgh, I thought it was time to act. After pulling a couple bottles of red wine from my wine cellar and making reservations for a friday night, we drove to Shadyside (actually, I consider it more like borderline East Liberty). We got a table near the window and settled in. The chalkboard menu was a great supplement to the standard menu and listed specials on appetizers, salads, entrees, desserts. As we read each selection, we were convinced that there wasn't a bad choice among them. We all ordered from the chalkboard menu and started with some great apps including some spectacular tuna served three ways. Entree selections included center cut bone in pork chop and monkfish and sea scallops. Everything was PERFECTLY cooked and fresh. Incredible flavors and complementary blends of purees, capers and veggies were so well thought out and done to perfection. The monk fish may have been the best I've ever had. The scallops were so flavorful and prepared by a master. The pork chop was so tender and juicy - it tasted like you could only HOPE a good chop would taste.  No disappointments at all - not even one. Corkage fee was only $2.50 a bottle. Service was outstanding and attentive without being annoying. The atmosphere is great and has a rustic feel, although a bit small. Tables are not too close together so you don't feel cramped. Once you sit down, you just feel like you're gonna have a good meal. It's that kind of place. Prices are quite  reasonable for the quality of food you get. I've paid far more and gotten far less. I can't think of any area that wasn't satisfactory here. I will go back again! Maybe I should rate this as 4 1/2 stars!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  I really like the Avenue B concept; a smaller rotating menut with an emphasis on local inredients.   The service was great, our server Emmett was fantastic. Very knowledgeable about all the items on the menu.  Food was great overall; if you read no further: Avenue B is more than worth the trip.   Now for specific thoughts:  Complimentary bread service - 2 types of bread provided, whole grain/frnch baguette it seemed. Not sure where they were sourced from but quality artisinal bread. Served along with a cherry molasses whipped butter. This was tasty, but I wish th butter was salted.  Local Greens Salad $6 - acceptable, nothing special. I enjoyed the dressing and the sweet potato crips..but I suspect there are far better ways to start the meal.  -Raw Boat  $13 - 3 preperations of fish, all of which were incredibly fresh.   2 miniature tuna nigiri topped with red and black tobiko.- these were passable, the sushi rice itself did not seem to be all that glutinous and I wouldn't be pleased with it if I were out for sushi, but a fun little bite when implemented into the menu. I'm not one to complain about portion sizes, but these were truly miniature, would have preferred a more generous slice of fish to get the full effect.   barely seared salmon topped with an avocado/onion/wasabi sauce - very good,  poke and pineapple cevice topped with creme fraiche and sweet potato flake - may be one of the best things I've ever eaten. I scrapped every last off the plate. I would make the visit again if only to get this.  -NY Strip $26 - truffled fingerling potato salad, arugula, asparagus, demi glaze - perfectly prepared steak, other components of the dish were quite good; only down side was one bad potato that probably shouldn't have made it out of the kitchen.   - Seared Dayboat Scallops $24 - squid ink tagiatelle, summer squash, pesto duo - again the protein portion was prepared flawlessely. The two pestos were both very a good, a basil and roasted red pepper.  The squid ink pasta had a slight brine that was mellowed by the accompanying zuchinni, squash, and sat a top an alfredo-esq sauce.  The bottom of the plate had a bit more olive oil than I would have liked, but I'm really nit picking here. Fantastic dish.  Bonus points for crushed ice in the soda, and macaroons with the check.   pics to come"}
{"text":"I'd give this 4.5 if I could.  I deduct only for the  decor/ambience.  This is a very good restaurant with well prepared, fresh food.  It deserves better than brown Dept store curtains and burgundy cloths covered with brown paper and a thrift store leftover seating waiting area.  If you go \"rustic\" (ala chalkboards, and brown paper) then don't confuse it with cheap sheer curtains.  It's either rustic or elegant.  Choose one and go with it.  Consistently.  Good decor doesn't have to be expensive.  Windows need to sparkle with cleanliness whatever the decor.  Enough about that.    About the food:  Carbonara:  lovely vegetables, nicely cooked pasta, nice balance - the soft boiled egg (which seems to be everywhere lately) actually belongs in this dish and was cooked to perfect.  Only issue was the \"sauce\" which should have been thicker and a little less.  Also, no cracked pepper was offered.    Fish and Chips:  fish was fresh, well breaded and well cooked; \"chips\" were literally chips which was fine,  but became soggy in the slaw.  Why must every dish be served vertically these days? Sometimes components  should be served as a child prefers  - not touching the other.  And I didn't really like the slaw much.  Carrot Cake Ice Cream Trio- almost worked.  The flavors were not really in the ice cream but in a crumble served with it.  When we ran out of crumble, the ice cream alone was not very flavorful nor did it taste like carrot cake.  Squash Soup: a little bland and uninspired.  This chef can do better  Byob: with a $5 cork fee!!! What's not to like about that?  Service:  Excellent.  Overall:  Enjoyed it and will definately return! (Hopefully to a redesigned dining area - ask for pro help.  Most think they can decorate themselves, but really can't. You'd be surprised what a good designer can do on s small budget)."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious. The flavors are just outstanding. I've been here only twice (I don't know why...I need to come more often) but both times the service was great and the food out of this world. My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh (yes better than Meat & Potatoes). Highly recommend. Prices aren't cheap but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"I made a reservation beforehand so I wouldn't have to wait. Although, there weren't a lot of people there on a Thursday at 7pm. There were seats outside but since the restaurant is located on a busy street it's a bit unpleasant to sit there with all the traffic and noise. I opted to sit inside.   The restaurant has seasonal dishes that change well, seasonally, and a chalkboard menu that changes weekly or so.   I ordered the wagyu flank steak on the chalkboard menu. I wanted the steak medium rare but it came out more like medium rare plus/medium. The steak was almost too tender as if I was eating fat. There were definitely some parts of the steak that were just plain fat which was disappointing. The seasoning was ok plus/good.  I think I would come back but I would probably order something else. Service was ok and the decor/ambiance was good."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Avenue B now 3 times.  Each time it has gotten better!  I went here on New Years eve with a friend for dinner and we had the most amazing oysters I have ever had!  Keep in mind its BYO, so there is no bar, so remember to bring your own!"}
{"text":"Went to Avenue B for a lunch date. Enjoyed the server Maggie she was super nice and super friendly. Enough about Maggie though onto the num nums.   My date and I ordered the same meals. So Ill only be reviewing two items. We had the Aged Cheddar Grilled Cheese with the Tomato Bisque soup and the Sun Dried Tomato Pesto & Arugula Flatbread.   Flatbread: My flatbread was slightly burnt but edible nonetheless. I expected more sauce on the flatbread it kind of left me wanting more. Maybe the next time I go in I should ask them to go a little heavier on the sundried tomato pesto.  Grilled Cheese: Is an adult version of grilled cheeese which comes with sliced tomatoes. The soup is a little too salty on its own but with the grilled cheese it made for a perfect pairing.  All in all fairly good experience.  By the way also had the Blueberry Mint Lemonade. Its more on the tart side so don't be afraid to ask for some of the mint infused simple syrup they use.  Otherwise Avenue B is delicious. Ask for Maggie!"}
{"text":"Oh.My.God. Ah-mazing!  Avenue B is.. amazing.   Being in Pittsburgh for the past 6 years, I would say that Avenue B is by far the best and most inventive meal I've had in the steel city (besides Umi of course)  Located on Centre Avenue- the location is a bit strange and in the middle of nowhere (ok Giant Eagle, but who cares) but the food is so good!  I've been there for brunch and dinner on a few occasions, and I would have to say that the dishes I got were perfect. For my most recent meal, I got the gorgonzola flatbread and the sweet potato pot pie. Sounds pretty ordinary right? WRONG!  The flatbread was warm and was sweet and tart from the pears and blue cheese while the pot pie was so comforting yet decadent and flavorful.  It was the perfect meal!  I would most definitely recommend Avenue B for a great (but expensive) date! Make sure to make reservations ahead of time, they are booked any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Out of this world.  We live in the N. Hills and head to this place as often as we can.   It's BYOB- don't forget. Just love it!!  Whether it's me and my husband or me and some friends, we always leave happy- VERY HAPPY!  I've never had anything here that I didn't like.  Last night my husband and I went for our anniversary.  The staff was super as usual.  Barry  was a great server and helped us pick.  Everything looked so good.  I got the pan seared sea bass and it just melted in my mouth like butter- the corn grits and blackberry were the perfect touch to complete the dish.  My husband got the flank steak and the presentation of that dish was really good.  He loved it.    The place is very simple.  Not stuffy at all but just enough- class and casual.  Even though it's a smaller dinning room they have it sectioned off well that you are not hanging out with the table next to you.    I also recommend their cafe in Sewickly- B Gourmet.  Totally different than the restaurant....well, except for the fact that food is great.  Go to either one and you won't be sorry.    LOVE AVENUE B!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing meal!! I got the chicken - which seems boring but was perfect. This was one of my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant experiences. Such flavorful food with unique and elaborate combinations. Good portion sizes as well.   Only negative is it was a bit loud in there."}
{"text":"Avenue B sits unassumingly on Centre Ave in Friendship and can be easy to miss if you're not looking for it- but you definitely should be.  There is not much seating so a reservation is probably needed, especially on weekends, but this little bistro is the perfect environment for a casual date night, special occasion, or random night out with friends.  As many others have commented it is BYOB and not sure if it was a fluke or not but they didn't even charge us a corkage fee!  The menu is relatively small (a few regular seasonal menu items plus daily chalkboard options) but we still found ourselves overwhelmed by choice while reading through each delectable sounding description.  On our waitress's recommendation we started with the mussels ($12), which came in a smoked tomato sauce with grilled bread.  I do not say this lightly, folks- these are hands-down the best mussels I have ever had.  Not only were the mussels themselves delicious (and not a single dud in our bowl!), but the sauce was smoky, tangy and sweet and just thick enough to coat each little mollusk to perfection.  The rest of the meal followed suit and certainly did not disappoint.  I ordered one of the daily chalkboard items- hanger steak with braised onions, green beans with gorgonzola, and cous cous ($29) and my boyfriend ordered one of the regular menu items- the fish and chips (I believe with tilapia that day) with napa slaw and malt aioli ($22).  Both were cooked to perfection and packed with flavor.  We also ordered a side to share- the roasted cauliflower with cheese and truffle oil ($6)- which was also superb but probably not necessary given how full we were from our mussels and entrees.  Especially because the desserts sounded AMAZING and neither of us had any room to pack more in.  My only regret about this meal is that it took me so long to get here and try it out! Oh, and make sure you do not pass on the bread and butter-- you may have to man up and clear out a little more room in your stomach for the rest of the meal but it is worth every bite."}
{"text":"Went on valentines day, Lobster corn dog, not so great, not worth $14. Loved the short ribs, best gnocchi's ever!  Honey bourbon glazed pork belly poutine was off the hook! (That's a good thing) BYOB...$5 corkage fee. We had nice romantic seats, service was spot on. Would definitely go again. Had to stop the wife from licking her plate!"}
{"text":"I took my ex-bf (a different one than I took to Cure) here for his birthday in March.  He told me he wanted to go out on Fri. for Sat. night, and I had to scramble to find a fine dining restaurant that (1) had decent reviews; (2) had availability; and (3) served Lent-friendly food (sorry, Cure!).  After much scrambling, we settled on Ave. B, and I was able to reserve a table for 5pm on Sat. morning.  Talk about last minute!  We started off with a mussel appetizer from the chalkboard, which came with a tomato-based dipping sauce and cheese bread.  Although I enjoyed the mussels, I thought the sweetness of the sauce actually complemented the savoriness of the bread better than them!  For our entrees, we both had seafood entrees--mine was a pasta with prawns (head-on shrimp) and a cream sauce over some vegetables, and his was a swordfish plate (I believe), both also from the chalkboard.  We also ordered a side of truffled mashed potatoes to share.  While my entree was delicious, well-balanced, and well-presented, it wasn't quite up to the level of those I had at Cure and Legume.  After dinner, my ex ordered coffee, and I ordered the salted chocolate dessert with lemon sauce and olive oil ice cream.  This was, by far and away, the highlight of the meal, blowing the desserts I had at Cure and Legume out of the water.  It was a mouthwatering combination of sweetness and saltiness and textures that rocked my world!  Even the ex, who isn't generally a dessert fan, thought it was great.  Based on this experience, I highly recommend ordering dessert here.  Service was excellent, as to be expected at a fine dining establishment--attentive and helpful, without being overbearing. Don't forget, Ave. B is BYOB, so be sure to bring your favorite wine to pair with your meal!  While this wasn't the best fine dining experience I've had in PGH, it was very good.  I'd love to come back for lunch sometime."}
{"text":"First of all, the service was outstanding.  I called earlier in the day, when I was still trying to decide at which restaurant to eat, and the waiter/host on the phone was happy to describe to me, in detail, the appetizers and entrees that were on the board that evening.  I made our reservation then and there.    To me, an indicator of a great restaurant is a menu that isn't standardized.  While they do have a small menu of appetizers, entrees and desserts (I think 3 each) that are always available, the majority of what they serve each evening is written on chalkboards on both sides of the restaurant.  We decided to go with an appetizer and entree from the year round menu, and one each from the chalkboard.    Our starters were the butternut squash soup with green chilis (from the board) and the pear gorgonzola flatbread (from the menu).  The soup was phenomenal .  It was smooth, creamy and slightly sweet with the perfect amount of spice courtesy of the green chilis.  The seeds of the squash were roasted and added as a garnish.  Waste not, want not.  Plus they were delicious and a great crunchy contrast to the perfectly pureed squash.  The pear and gorgonzola flat bread was good too, but nothing spectacular.  When we go back I think I'd probably skip it and try something a little more unique.    After reading fellow yelpers reviews, I decided to go with the kobe meatloaf for my entree.  It didn't disappoint in any way.  The presentation was beautiful, with the meatloaf set atop a mound of chive and goat cheese mashed potatoes (I'll get to those in a minute) and topped off with a generous helping of crispy fried onions.  The meatloaf itself was juicy and had great flavor.  The potatoes were fantastic... a possible \"last meal on earth\" contender.  Potato + chives is always a big hit with me, and the addition of the goat cheese put it over the edge.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  The goat cheese wasn't overwhelming but there wasjust enough to make it recognizable.  Avenue B adds to the dilemma my husband and I face every time we visit Pittsburgh: too many good places to eat, and not enough meals to fit them all in.  Needless to say, Avenue B has pushed itself to the top of the priority list.  I see an anniversary dinner here in our future..."}
{"text":"Dinner was delicious.  Had the scallops.  Really tasty with a lovely presentation / composition.  Girlfriend had the meatloaf.  Neither of us would ever order meat loaf during fine dining or otherwise.  But it's not your Mom's meatloaf.  It is really good and suitably fancy!  Though I did prefer the scallops.  Side note regarding meatloaf - the table beside us - four people - they had four meatloafs.  After looking at the menu I wasn't excited about dessert, but the marshmallow, chocolate and peppermint ice cream was awesome!  Im glad we got it.  It's BYOB so the bill looked pretty good at the end of the night.  Went for a romantic date.  It was good.  Note that last night at 8 there was an older-ish crowd.  FYI - I'm (a young) 42!"}
{"text":"I'd love to give this place three stars but for the price, and despite the nice and cozy room, I prefer the other high scale in Pittsburgh. The food was not warm enough, service was ok but I mean seriously there are much better restaurants (if you are willing to pay). This place is trying so hard to be a high end, small but warm place, but believe me there are other places with much much better food & atmosphere."}
{"text":"They certainly have the right idea, although the execution is not 100% there. Starters were very good, but the pasta main course was extremely salty. I only raise such issues because of the hurt this place will put on your wallet. While the food is good...it still doesn't live up to the price. I'd be willing to give them a second chance....but that's it."}
{"text":"Okay. I see what all the rave is about. The food here is awesome. I'd say it's a tad over salty for me, but the flavor's as good as it gets. This gotta be the best meatloaf in the world."}
{"text":"This is a solid contemporary neighborhood bistro.   I liked Avenue B for its * frequently changing menu with up-to-date dishes that appeal to current palates * fresh ingredients * competent kitchen -- overall, the food is pretty good * competent front staff -- friendly hostess, helpful wait staff * comfortable ambiance  * pricing -- comparing to other restaurants of its type, not too expensive  Why it's not a 5 star: While the kitchen does have the basics down (they won't overcook the meat, for example) not every component of every dish works. I do appreciate that they are at least trying to put together interesting flavors, but sometimes the combination is just off. Of what I've sampled there, I'd rate the dishes in the B range -- they are far from a disaster, but none was a hit-out-of-the-park winner.  Recently, a friend walked into Salt of the Earth and confused it with Avenue B (because of the oversized chalkboards).  I thought the two restaurants make an interesting comparison. I'd give the food nod to Salt, but I probably would visit AveB more frequently because it is a more comfortable dining experience overall."}
{"text":"With such a small selection and steep prices, I was expecting something local, organic and sustainable. The decor and style of the place definitely looks the part, down to french pressed coffee and tea served at the table. But no, they just look like it. It's a bit of a drive and isn't near anything I frequent and while I liked the decor and style, the food won't have me coming back.  I ordered fish and chips, tempura style... All I could taste was flour and mush. The fish was soggy and completely without flavor. The chips were actual potato crisps (I was expecting fries, so it was a little disappointing) The best part of the meal was the veggie slaw. The ice cream and dessert did sound amazing (but then so did the fish and chips;) ). I tried a few spoonfuls of different flavored ice creams and they were quite good. So maybe it's more of a dessert kinda place?   Also this is an older crowd (probably because of prices), most patrons were well over 40. I felt like a kindergardener,"}
{"text":"While the food was delicious, a few things take away from the experience. BYOB is not ideal. Additionally, the dining area is somewhat crowded and noisy due to the tight space. I really like the menu and the unique offerings, but the other things I mention limit me rating this restaurant higher."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant a 4 starts because the food is really excellent  They would have few dishes but all great!! I loved the steak and the bread pudding! I hope they continue to be so good!! It's small place not great seating spaces but again this is one thing you run into in many little restaurants in Pittsburgh  Their service is good too."}
{"text":"The flavors here are ON POINT. We had an evening reservation for two, and here's what we got.   P.E.I. mussels with crispy bread: amazing. They came in some kind of ridiculously good tomato sauce that we wished we had saved our earlier bread for; we were basically lapping it up. Tartare trio: little mounds of salmon, tuna, and beef. Each was so different and tasty! Seriously some of the best appetizers we've ever had.  Walu entree: how have I never heard of this fish before?? The texture was smooth and almost buttery, and the tangy sauce with this dish was perfect.  Steak entree: nice and tender.   Overall, my only real complaint was that our first bread basket was cold. That didn't really stop us from enjoying the rest of the meal though. Although it's a little pricier, the food at Avenue B is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Caveat lector: I'm giving this place 3 stars because I'm comparing it to other similar restaurants in Pittsburgh within the same price range. So in effect I'm rating them not on an absolute scale but relative to what they try to be.  I'll say right off the bat that I was very underwhelmed by Avenue B. It was hyped to me by some friends and the fact that it was a pain to get a reservation for this place for a Friday night made me think that it was worth the hype. Unfortunately, that turned out not to be the case. I came here with my girlfriend, and as appetizers we got the tartare and the mussels. The tartare was perhaps the most disappointing part of the whole meal: entirely bland with almost no dressing. There was a sort of slight smoky flavor to the meat tartare (there was also a salmon tartare as well) but otherwise it was pretty tasteless (the salmon wasn't any better). The mussels were very small, though the sauce was pretty decent. I found it mostly unexceptional, though my girlfriend liked it, but for the same price you can get a much better dish at either Point Brugge or Brasserie 33.  For the mains I had the hanger steak and she had the monkfish. I am not terribly familiar with monkfish so I don't know what the \"right\" way to prepare it is, but when I tried a piece, it was rather flavorless. My girlfriend thought that it was tougher than it should have been and that the taste of the fish was watered down by the sauce. It seems to me that when you have a fish that is not naturally full of flavor, you have to prepare a sauce for it that enhances it, but it didn't seem to me like that was the case with that dish. The hanger steak was fine, and the lobster mac and cheese was a nice touch, but again, there wasn't anything particularly special about it. The meat was of decent quality and prepared nicely, but overall I found it less juicy and flavorful than the hanger steaks I had at Salt and Meat & Potatoes. We also had a side dish of brussels sprouts to share, which I thought were ok, if a little too well done and too drenched with sauce.  The only really good part of the meal was the dessert. We split the chocolate salt bar with the olive oil ice cream, which was very nice.  Overall, we both felt that Avenue B was overrated relative to other good restaurants in Pittsburgh. It's not that anything was bad per se, but if you're interested in getting a good meal in the 412, there are any number of restaurants that you could go to that would cost you the same amount but have much better quality of food. Just to list a few: Salt, Meat & Potatoes, and Legume, all of which have a comparable style of food, are much better and not more expensive. In addition, all those places have great cocktails, whereas Avenue B is BYOB; nothing wrong with that, but it's not like I'm going to be mixing a bourbon drink at my table. You could do worse than eat here, but you could also do a lot better."}
{"text":"This place is super busy! We waited for a long time but it was recognized and someone came to take our order.   We had the Waygu meatloaf and the potato gnocchi.  The Waygu meatloaf was absolutely one of the BEST dishes I have had not only in Pittsburgh but anywhere I have eaten. It's delicious juices and perfectly cooked meat was on top of an amazing mashed potato. Anyone who knows me knows that I will order a dish for the sides and this was the perfect side. To top it off they added crispy onions that were so thinly sliced and fried that they dissolved after the first crunchy bite.   I will go back and I will order this same dish. I can't stop talking about it. Go. Go now.   Avenue B-Don't ever remove this from the menu. Please!  Also, this place is BYOB. Which is BEST."}
{"text":"Avenue B is worth going to. The menu is creative and diverse and tasty. There's a good vibe here and the owners work hard to keep things on point."}
{"text":"Avenue is a cute bistro-esque set restaurant with a chalkboard menu of specials. The wait staff is so on top of their game too! I had the kobe meatloaf which was delicious."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and our server was great! I loved that it was byob. I had the meatloaf and it was amazing. My fiance had the artic char and it was also very good! The atmosphere was cool but not too trendy. The bathroom was very clean (I'm a freak about cleanliness of bathrooms, haha) the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that our entrees took an hour to arrive which made us late for the show we had tickets for. We wanted dessert but it was already too late. :("}
{"text":"Finally, I've gotten to try Avenue B and wasn't disappointed. We ordered the Tuna 3 which was a big hit - very fresh and flavorful. I ordered the Grilled Tofu, and my friends ordered the squash ravioli and then the meatloaf (which is apparently a specialty of theirs). I have to admit that I wasn't a huge fan of my entree, the grilled tofu - it was just meh. But it might have to do more for the fact that I don't really enjoy grilled tofu. Why did I order this dish you might ask...well I wasn't really in the mood for meat or fish so I figured I'd give it a whirl. But for a vegetarian dish it wasn't awful. It was fairly light which is what I was looking for.   I tried a sampling of my friends' entrees and they were very tasty. We decided to go for deserts and had the croissant bread pudding with caramel popcorn ice cream...there was actual popcorn - awesome...the bread pudding however was not so awesome...it was sorta weird and cheesy tasting, not my cup of tea.   But we had the Fruit Loops, Coco Puffs, Cinnamon Toast ice cream combo which was delish! I guess after reading my own review, perhaps 3 stars would be sufficient, but I just can't help but think that this place has potential and so I'll give them the extra star for good measure and b/c I did enjoy the Tuna 3 and ice cream so damn much...I'm so easy to please!   It's BYOB so we had a nice bottle of red wine to complement our dishes."}
{"text":"Sorry Avenue B, my taste buds did not dance with joy and my wallet definitely cried a bit. My significant other had a very lousy vegetarian option and my chicken dish tasted more like a store bought entree than a fancy-schmancy bistro creation. Yeah, this is definitely a case of high expectations going unfulfilled."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with a creative touch of wonderful flavors. I truly enjoyed this restaurant right down the street from the Marriott Hotel."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the rave reviews for this place.  I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt though and say maybe I just chose an off night.    The menu items the night I was there were just not that exciting.  I ended up going with the falafel and the squid ink pasta with shrimp.  The falafel was mediocre and rather small.  The squid ink pasta with shrimp was just OK, nothing special.  My other friends I came with had a similar experience with their dishes.    Also, the whole menu on the two chalk boards, super annoying.  Especially since where we were sitting there was no way to see them without getting up and looking at them and being intrusive on other people's dinners.  I was really turned off by it.  Overall, no real complaints about the service.  Will I be back? - Yes.  I feel like I need to give this place another try since their menu changes so frequently."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Fridays ago with my fiance and another couple for dinner.  We had been here previously a couple of years past and not much has changed since then. The restaurant was absolutely packed whenever we got there with only a single table open that was being held by our reservation.  I really have not noticed much decor in this restaurant but I am not sure that much is needed since they have giant chalkboards on either side of the restaurant with the daily specials on them.  My fiance and I started off our meals by splitting the lettuce wraps appetizer.  It was good with a nice sauce and a decent amount of filling.  Then for dinner I decided to go with the duck breast that came with honied Brussels sprouts and also some pierogies as well as a side of Szchuan green beans. Whenever the duck came out I thought it looked good but after biting into  it I realized that it was missing something.  My other friend confirmed that it just wasn't that great of a duck dish.  The Brussels sprouts were almost non existent on the dish as well but the pierogies were good.  Sadly I think I chose poorly twice in a row here as my fiancés swordfish was awesome as well as my friends sausage pasta.  The green beans were pretty good though as they were cooked nicely and came with a dark sauce that was mildly spicy.  It's not the green beans you would get in a true Szchuan restaurant with prickly ash but was good nevertheless.  The bottom line for me is I would head back here again in the future.  While my meal wasn't that fantastic I did see some potential in my dining companions dishes."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice since the first review, food was too salty on both occasions. This place is no longer on my list of reliable options. Hope this improves, though I doubt I will be back to find out..."}
{"text":"In Pittsburg on business. Recommended to me. Outstanding meal. The porky chop was undoubtedly the best I have ever had!! HIGHLY Recommend!!!'"}
{"text":"My friend and I have been trying new restaurants when we get together for girl's night and selected Avenue B for dinner on Thursday night. I mentioned my dinner plans to a coworker and became even more excited about my dinner that evening when she immediately began to give rave reviews!  I found street parking across from the nearby Giant Eagle and walked half a block to the restaurant. I previously had no idea where the restaurant was located - thanks for guiding me, car navigation - and was not surprised that the location was pretty random. As I walked from my car, I passed Giant Eagle, apartments, and a funeral home before getting to the restaurant. The entrance of the restaurant is very tiny, and I was happy to be the only one waiting to be helped. The front entrance could probably fit only six slender - or four heavier - people.   After waiting at the entrance for a few minutes, a waiter came and asked if I needed to be helped and seated me right away at the second table from the entrance. Because of my seating location, I didn't get a great look at the rest of the restaurant. If the total dining space only includes the open room where we were seated, I believe total seating capacity may only be around 40 people. The space was decorated in a traditional, formal style including candles, tablecloths, and cloth napkins.  Now, let's get to the food... Our waiter delivered a little basket filled with five small slices of white and wheat bread to the table with a delicious butter spread. The basket quickly disappeared, and we then began with an appetizer of PEI mussels served with the \"chef's preparation\" broth and grilled bread. I approve of the chef's preparation! SO yummy! I'm guessing the broth was some sort of mixture of tomatoes, cream, and wine but am not quite sure. Whatever it was, when the second bread basket arrived, the two of us proceeded to quickly consume it, dipping our pieces into the mussel's left over deliciousness.  As soon as I read Wagyu Beef Meatloaf on the seasonal menu, none of the eye-catching offerings on the chalkboard menu could change my selection. I am so happy I stuck with my initial selection. The beef's texture and flavor was tender, rich, and savory. The meatloaf was placed over a pile of creamy and fluffy goat cheese chive potatoes and under a tall pile of crispy fried onion rings. All of this - paired with a sweet and savory tomato jam - was incredibly flavorful and innovative while still feeling classic and simple.  As soon as I got out of my comfy booth seat at the end of the meal, I regretted ordering - not one but two - desserts, but at the time, it seemed like a good idea. The chalkboard menu dessert was a blueberry, lemon, and vanilla ice cream mixture served in a little dish. Unfortunately, it was just too sweet. My friend and I determined that it could've used some acid and salt.  The only negative component of our experience at Avenue B was the amount of time it took to receive our food. I had arrived a few minutes before our reservation at 7pm, and my friend right on time. We don't get dinner together nearly as often as we should and didn't mind the wait that it took to receive our entrees, especially considering how tasty our appetizer and bread was. However, I began to look at my watch around dessert time. We realized that we didn't receive dessert until after 9pm, even though we had probably ordered a half hour earlier. With total dining time around 2 hours and 15 minutes, I think that this is much longer than average. I'm not sure if our experience was the norm, but I'll make sure to allow plenty of time to dine next time I eat here."}
{"text":"Taking into account though the positive reviews, menu, and location of the restaraunt, I thought this might be a positive dining experience.  The service was wonderful, but the food left a lot to be desired.  I found the style and description of the menu to be both misleading and inaccurate.  Nothing really came out on the plate the way it was described.  The food in particular was extremely over salted - almost to the point of being inedible.  The quality of the ingredient was average at best.  The plating was clustered, busy, and very sloppy.  Flavors were very disjointed and lacked balance.  I would have rather had dinner at the Whole Foods salad bar.  I wish I could find a positive note to make me come back for a second try, but I just can't find one.  The food was just not good - in fact it was pretty gross."}
{"text":"A great menu that would be a hit in any city.  Very creative entrees.  We started with the pork belly lettuce wraps and the squash soup with a hint of chili and a taquito.  Both were great, although my wife preferred the lettuce wraps.  They bring rosemary-flavored butter and bread to start.  By the time our entrees arrived we were already decently full.  I had the pork shank with polenta, which looked gargantuan but a good chunk of it was bone.  She had the monkfish, which was good but not quite at the level of the rest of what we had.  We shared the cauliflower gratin, too.  The dessert really stood out.  The chocolate bar and olive-oil ice cream was very unusual and delicious.  I'm a bread pudding fan, and the way they made it with croissant made it even better (Though the popcorn didn't really add much - I skipped that).  Our service was attentive without being overbearing, but a bit awkward at times.  We got there at 6:30 and the place was nearly empty; by the time we left it was nearly full.  In any case, my local-native wife had never been here before and her friends hadn't heard of it, so my sense is that it's not as well-known yet as it should be.  Good stuff!  Oh yeah, they're also BYOB, so sharing a good bottle of wine from the Giant Eagle down the street ran us $20. :)"}
{"text":"The pickiest eater in all of Pittsburgh and I dined here and we loved it.  Just goes to show you don't have to spend a fortune to eat well.  Very strategic placement right next to Shadyside Giant Eagle Marketsquare District (so you know the food is fresh!).    The sashimi appetizer was good but I almost threw it aside to get to the CHOCOLATE CHIPOTLE RIBS which in my mind is the best thing on the menu.  Delicious flavor and meat that fell off the bone.  I got the signature dish, the Kobe meatloaf, and it was good but I think I'm not a meat and potatoes kind of girl.  In contrast, my companion got the fish which was much lighter and he enjoyed it.    Overall, wonderful experience!  It is BYOB BUT a warning, do not buy your wine at Giant Eagle across the street or else you will be wrangling with a small selection trapped inside a bothersome wine vending machine."}
{"text":"This place was fabulous! A few of us came here for dinner. The menu was so creative and ever changing. I wanted to try everything. It is BYOB though I didn't bring my own. For drinks I got water and iced tea. For a starter I got the Rainbow Roll and I was technically expecting a roll, but this came out as one big piece with layers. This was a new twist for me and I thought it was delicious. Then I got fish for the main course and I basically chowed down without saying much because it was that good. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly. All the sauces flowed well together. For dessert I had the bread pudding with the scoop of ice cream/popcorn. To me, this was so fun and tasty! I recommend it! I will definitely be coming back.  The one issue I did have was with our waiter. He was polite and didn't let my iced tea run empty. Aside from his politeness, the serving skills were kind of off. I sat on the outside with my back facing to the rest of the seating area. He would basically reach across awkwardly with his arms in my face most of the time. I had no idea he was coming to deliver a dish or pick one up. I would be eating and BAM an arm would just appear next to my face. Startling."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there. Glad we made reservations. Meatloaf was killer!!! Hubby had pork chop which was ok - nothing terribly special. Tuna app was fantastic w/ a deconstructed spicy tuna roll and tuna sashimi w/ avocado-wasasbi dollop on top. Yum yum. Nice salad from the chalk board selections which change daily. Great ambiance, and Lauren, our server, was fantastic. Food could have come out hotter, but overall, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"The kitchen here is impressive.  Very impressive.  The dishes are cleverly put together with fascinating combinations...but the focus is on being impressive rather than being delicious.  Avenue B is a perfect example of why higher end fancy restaurants, once they get to a certain level of culinary accomplishment and achievement, tend to focus on lots of small courses in a meal.  The first bite of everything was interesting (and impressive, as I may have mentioned), but I didn't really want a lot of anything once the novelty wore off.  The menu descriptions were also problematic--confusing and dishonest.  The dishonest part is a little easier to explain: Avenue B is a BYOB and didn't disclose to me at any point until handing me the check that there was an 8 dollar corkage fee.  I thought maybe I had missed it on the menu, but I checked later and didn't see anything (and even if it had been there, I agreed to have them open the bottle for me before I saw a menu).  So then I figured, \"Ah, must be on the website,\" so I went home and checked.  Nope.  The only mention of a corkage fee anywhere on the website (as of the time of this writing) is where they say there's a special Sunday dinner service with no corkage fee (though no mention of what the corkage fee usually is, and I hadn't read the \"Sunday Dinner Service\" section of the website in advance as I wasn't going on a Sunday).  I'm not saying corkage fees are inherently wrong or dishonest, but I believe hidden fees--especially those much higher than one would normally expect--certainly are.  On the \"confusing\" end: When you're doing fancy and impressive things, clarity is important.  And I'm not talking about using a fancy ingredient and not explaining what it is--people can ask or look that up on their phones.  But when you're inventing your own terminology, you're putting up a barrier to clarity that isn't as easily overcome.  For example, the night I went, one of the item descriptions included chicken with a superscript 3 (a tiny 3 aligned to the top and immediately following the word chicken--if your browser is configured like mine, it looked like this: chicken³ ).  My dining companion assumed it was a footnote and didn't bother to look into it any further, as often restaurants will footnote items and put health information in the footnote.  I was a little more suspicious, as I hadn't noticed a 1 or 2 in superscript, and after further consideration I thought, \"Ah, it's just them trying to be cute.  Chicken to the third power...or chicken cubed...it's just chicken in cube forms.\"  Both of us had come to a reasonable conclusion: a superscripted 3 commonly means either \"third footnote\" or \"cubed.\"  What it DOESN'T commonly mean, however, is \"3 ways,\" and in this case, that's what it was, chicken 3 ways.  Pretty much every other English-speaking restaurant on the planet writes out the number of ways they're doing an ingredient if that's the theme of the dish, but no, not Avenue B.  My companion ordered it and wound up quite disappointed, when an accurate menu description would have easily and immediately helped her make a better choice (at no point did any member of the waitstaff explain what it was to us, either before or after ordering, though our waiter did explain a few other menu items which weren't nearly so poorly described).  They clearly have the talent in the kitchen to be a great restaurant, but seriously, get your priorities straight and get your act together."}
{"text":"I visited here last night to partake in Pittsburgh Restaurant Week 2015. Avenue B had long been on my list as a \"must try\" spot in town, however, I've always balked (slightly) at the price for just an average dinner out. Restaurant Week, however, made this a very affordable option for a random weeknight dinner out, so as soon as I saw they were listed on the restaurant week website, I quickly snapped up 7:00pm reservations for myself and a friend. I read online that they have valet, although I did not see a valet stand or any valet attendants out front, so we took our chances and parked in the Market District garage (and we were totally fine-no ticket or tow). We arrived promptly at 7:00pm and it was actually our server who sat us. The atmosphere is very cozy and intimate-nice if you are looking for a romantic evening I would think. We were seated pretty close to the table next to us, however, it was not much of an impediment (except the woman next to me was clearly annoyed she could no longer use my seat to hold her iphone).   Service was prompt throughout the night. She first brought over waters and wine glasses. Of MUCH importance, this establishment is entirely BYOB so come prepared with your favorite varietal to imbibe. She explained the restaurant week concept and also said we could order from the blackboard menu as well, however, the entire restaurant week menu was composed of  blackboard items so fiscally, it made sense to order from the restaurant week menu. After we ordered, our server brought out a small bread basket (sourdough and wheat bread) served with a coffee cocoa butter. OMG  did that hit the spot! The coffee flavor was not dominating but prevalent and complimented the sweetness of the cocoa flavor nicely. She explained they rotate butters regularly, and in fact, a large party was seated after we had finished our meals and they received some type of ghost pepper butter, so perhaps they had multiple varieties that evening.   The first course came out quickly but with a slight snag. Both myself and my friend received a salad when I had ordered the salad and my friend the reconstructed rainbow roll. The server apologized for her mistake and it was remedied within 5 minutes so no harm no foul there. I cannot really speak to the rainbow roll as I did have a small bite but sushi is not something I typically enjoy. The presentation, however, was superb and artistic. The salad was an arugula & roasted mushroom salad with charred onion and truffled vinaigrette topped with chevre. The dressing was by far one of the best I have had out in a long time and there were plenty of mushrooms throughout the salad which I really enjoy.   For entrees, both myself and my friend ordered the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin with mustard spaetzle, braised cabbage and apple. The pork was cooked to perfection-pink and tender. The bacon had an applewood flavor to it and was complimentary to the mustard sauce that was served with the pork. I rarely order pork out since often it is overcooked, however, I would order this entree again, no questions asked!   There was only one choice for dessert- a phyllo dough concoction with pear, caramel, and (maybe?) vanilla creme. I should have taken a picture of the menu since the flavors were amazing but hard to pick out at times.  Our bill came to $80, which  at any other time not during restaurant week, I believe it would have been much more for the same amount of food.   I am so happy I chose Avenue B as the first restaurant I am visiting this week! I only hope my second choice lives up to this experience!"}
{"text":"Avenue B is one of the originals in a wave of new American restaurants in Pittsburgh. They do a chalkboard menu, and a farm fresh rotating menu.  I've been twice, and I always make reservations on Opentable ahead of time. The food is always innovative (the last time we were there, we ordered waygu beef meatloaf), and it's usually pretty good. In terms of the dishes, there has been nothing that I've disliked, and nothing that I've absolutely loved to the point where I think about it.   The quality is consistently good, but again, nothing's knocked me over on my face aside from an amazing balsamic vinegar cheesecake! That was amazing and a standout dessert for me.  The setting is a bit more simple than a lot of the other new American restaurants, and the service is consistently good. I will be back when I'm in the Shadyside area!"}
{"text":"First time last night and Ave B did not disappoint!  It was delicious!  Went with the girlfriends and we all loved everything.... Mussels were great,  the Arctic char was so tasty, the Brussels sprouts were amazing- we shared 3 desserts and the calories were worth every bite!   Our servers were so friendly and attentive.   Can't wait to visit and try more items on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, tasty, intelligent food and great service.  Nice ambience as well.  I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because they described their tartare as sushi and even served it with chopsticks, however, it was simply tartare in the shape of a disc. No other resemblance to sushi :)  However they do a great job with their soups, salads, seafood, and desserts.  Their chocolate dessert is to die for.  A full meal for 2 with appetizers and desserts cost me ~$110, not bad for a special evening out."}
{"text":"Avenue B is a restaurant you need to hit. If you are looking for something new and interesting, this is the place to get it! You may have passed many times, but the taste of the food will not go unnoticed. The place is small, yet quaint and elegant. I imagine it is perfect to take a date for lunch or dinner. The creative touch applied to a variety of American ingredients makes for some unconventional, yet brow-raising dishes, kobe meatloaf and chocolate chipotle BBQ pork tostada to name a few. The mac'n'cheese is also a must! Service was flawless. Our server helped us pick just the right amount (too much) for my brother and me as well as was accompanied by other servers to put all the dishes on the table at once--both details I appreciate. The reason for 4 out of 5 stars was the dessert, a popcorn bread pudding with popcorn ice cream. It was simply not tasty.  Other than the dessert, the meal was unforgettable, and I will be going back. Please go, and enjoy a deliciously decadent dinner!"}
{"text":"I had the Brussels sprouts and Arctic char.  Disappointing. Food is overly sweet, not seasoned properly and flavors  are not balanced. Server was nice but you can't make up for food preparation and design that is weak. Reminds me of my 16 year old trying to make a fancy meal.  Nice idea but it doesn't really result in a great meal."}
{"text":"We love this spot.- so much so that we had a private party here after our wedding last year.  Every single guest commented on the food multiple times.  Returned recently after many months of absence (because of a move, not because it isn't awesome!) and they had already realized we were coming in due to the reservation book- they were so sweet and attentive, and brought us complimentary vegetarian poutine amazingness.  Try this if you have a chance- you'll be shocked it's meatless.    The place always has a very friendly, easygoing, and intimate vibe in our experience.  Our server was very helpful, suggesting different food combinations so that we could squeeze in(to our bellies) everything we were craving.  I have now had chicken breast several ways there, always crisp skin with juicy meat and great, interesting flavors.  The Kobe meatloaf is always very good, and the husband always enjoys the fish entrees he gravitates towards.  I don't think you can go wrong here, it's just a matter of choosing what fits your tastes.  Have some fun with the creative sides and definitely DO NOT skip desert!"}
{"text":"I will miss this place. I've always had a wonderful meal every time I have been there."}
{"text":"I very rarely go back to a place twice intentionally because I love to try new restaurants as much as possible, but I've been back here twice in one month. The first time I went was for my anniversary, and we were blown away. The appetizer was incredible, as we had whipped Gorgonzola with crostini's, apples, beets, radishes, and candied pecans. I tried their specialty meatloaf (which never leaves the menu), and it was one of the best dishes that I've had in Pittsburgh. When I returned earlier this week, I explained the menu to my family because it is farm-to-table inspired, and highly recommended the meatloaf. Our waiter said, \"If you try the meatloaf, you'll be back to try everything else\". This is so true! My entire family enjoyed their dishes tremendously on my second trip back. Their desserts are also amazing, so come hungry. You must try Avenue B!"}
{"text":"I had wanted to try this place for a long time after watching an episode of Kitchen Nightmares, when Gordon Ramsey had Avenue B's chef mentor a struggling restaurant outside of Pittsburgh. Great place, nice interior, especially with the added room from the expansion. I recommend making reservations, particularly for dining on weekends. The chicken and the meatloaf are both excellent choices, though the fresh fish is often good as well. Reasonably priced, especially for the quality."}
{"text":"I visited Avenue B on Valentines Day and was absolutely thrilled.  The atmosphere was the perfect noise level: not loud at all, but not so quiet that you were afraid to laugh too loudly or accidentally hit your knife on your plate. The BYOB policy is very convenient, and within minutes of arriving, our table was provided with an ice bucket and two glasses for our bottle of wine. The service was attentive and friendly, and the food was rich and flavorful. Overall, the entire experience was lovely!  We ordered the mussels and lamb shoulder \"cheesesteak\" as our appetizers. Both were incredibly flavorful, but the winner was the dish of mussels with its vibrant broth that had the perfect salt level. I would've loved at least five more pieces of crusty bread to soak up all that broth.  For entrées, we ordered the wagyu meatloaf and the scallops with prosciutto wrapped shrimp. The meatloaf had the perfect texture and was very rich. I loved seafood dish best, though. The scallop was cooked perfectly and the farro risotto had a creamy texture with the ideal amount of bite from the farro. The shrimp were also perfectly cooked, but the prosciutto made it just a bit too salty. However, when paired with the sauces, it was balanced.  Finally, for dessert we ordered the carrot cake special and the caramel chocolate bar. The carrot cake had a pillow -like texture and was slightly warm when it arrived to the table. The caramel chocolate bar was rich and was paired with a tart sauce that cut through the decadence. Both were incredible.  A friend told me that Avenue B is going to be closing shortly. This really is a shame. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. If you haven't tried Avenue B yet, please do so. Maybe a flood of new diners will convince them to stay open!"}
{"text":"BEST place i've eaten in Pittsburgh in years. The service was great (try to sit near the back of the restaurant, it's cozier). The menu was local, fresh and delicious- i had a steak, my husband had fish and chips and our other guest (gluten free and vegetarian) had a personally created dish that she loved. the dessert was great (except for that it slipped off of its pedestal as it was being served, it was repaired, and it was in the end a funny moment). they do french press coffee for dessert -  a nice signature item. i would eat here everyday if i could afford to do so. definitely check it out."}
{"text":"I was torn between 3 and 4 stars for this, as the food was rather good (3.5-4 stars) but service was lacking on a Friday night.  The good: The chevre was DELICIOUS. I would order this again in a heartbeat, and I don't frequently repeat orders. The chicken with fried green tomatoes was good as well.  The meh: The \"Three Little Pigs\" was underwhelming. I'm a big fan of pork, but this wasn't really up to the high standards set by Sonoma Grill's \"Study of Hog.\"  The bad: We managed to secure a day-of reservation, which I understand is rare, but they had 3 tables in the same section with the same server all supposed to be seated at the same time. This led to rather poor service--some table has to get shafted, and it was us, which was especially frustrating as we were the first to show up. First, the waitress goes over the menu, tells us they have one duck entree left, and promises to return. She then goes over to another table to greet them, but apparently they were instantly ready to order as the proffered duck was no longer available. We order alternatives, and then sit while both of the other tables are brought tasty-looking bread. Twenty minutes in, and we're about to devour our napkins, when she brings over our apps (first time she's stopped back since we ordered). We ask why we didn't receive bread, and we get an \"oops\" from her. Water refilling was similarly slow, and service overall put a damper on the meal.   I'll come back for the BYOB, but with lower expectations for service. At time of writing, corkage is $1/bottle for beer, $5/bottle for the first bottle of wine and $2.50 thereafter."}
{"text":"Got a last minute reservation here on a Thursday evening, but I am guessing this was an aberration given the place was packed the entire time we were there. The accessibility is a little tough. There is plenty of street parking around, but not much in the way of a lot close by. Hardly the fault of the proprietors, but something to keep in mind when planning to dine here.   Upon arrival we were seated rather quickly, but given the business of the restaurant, it did take awhile to get service, be it drinks or placing the order or time until the order was delivered. That said, the wait staff really worked as a team to service the tables. Normally if I wasn't aware who \"my\" server was I would be irritated but as each server there took time to check on our needs, we're gracious with requests and treated us like we were there table, I was fine with it. They also acknowledged that things were slow and took all opportunities to apologize and keep us happy. Again, since there was no rush I had no real issue with this.   The menu was an interesting mix of seasonal choices (according to the waiter a selection of patron favorites that are pretty much always on menu) and then a chalkboard selection of items based on available fresh ingredients. For our meal as is our custom, we got an appetizer to share and then 2 entrees which we also shared. No, I don't think that's weird at all... Stop judging. We got the charcuterie, which was absolutely tremendous. Then we got the Waygu Meatloaf with Goat Cheese and Chive Mash and Potato Gnocchi. I'm not generally a fan of Meatloaf, but this was probably in my top 10 of all time dishes I have eaten. Everything about it was amazing. The meatloaf was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Salty, yes, but for this dish it completely works. The mashed potatoes where amazing. Creamy enough, but still enough substance to stick to the fork. The goat cheese and chives added the perfect flavor infusion to balance the beef and its saltiness. The gastrique I could have eaten with a spoon. The gnocchi, well, they were just ok (which contributes to 4 instead of 5 stars, along with the speed of service). I tend to prefer mine more tender and starchy, these were finished in a pan and had more camalization than I tend to like. Probably a matter of preference. The crispy pecorino added a little crunch to the bite, but not enough for a much needed change of texture or a sharp flavor to balance all the muted ones (potato, cauliflower, peas etc). This dish was not a win for me. It wasn't bad, just didn't match up with the rest of the meal.  The desert menu looked great, and they had a salted caramel popcorn ice cream that we were dying to try, especially since we had both loved a salted caramel popcorn panna cotta we had a dinner lab a few months ago. Alas though, way too full to pull the trigger there. Will have to return to give that a try for sure."}
{"text":"Went there for thursday lunch with a friend. Atmosphere is great. Ordered tomato bisque, kobe burger wit sweet potato fries, and pasta (the vegetarian one). Tomato bisque was a bit salty to our taste, but extremely rich and delicious. Kobe burger was SO juice and magnificent, don't know how else to describe it. Pasta was tasty too. Overall, great choice for special occasions!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I made a dinner reservation for 8:30pm because they had nothing earlier than that, and i don't blame them because it is a small place and we tried to make a reservation for the day of. We got there a couple minutes late, but they still had our table waiting. It was just as small as we had imagined it, but it had a very romantic feel. It was crowded, but it wasn't too loud. The price was right as well for the quantity and the quality of the food. The bread was really good on it's own, but the buttery garlic spread was an excellent touch. We decided to not get an appetizers and get two desserts instead. My boyfriend got the \"Roasted organic chicken breast, caramelized fennel & rapini cavatelli, saffron beurre blanc\" off of the chalkboard menu which was mediocre at best. I thought the mustard sauce was okay and made the dish taste worse. The chicken was dry as well.  I got the duck which was absolutely amazing. Everything was well cooked and seasoned really well for my dish. I would definitely get that again. We decided to go for two desserts. We got the olive oil ice cream with the brownie which was interesting. I thought that while eating both at the same time, you couldn't taste the ice cream. It was alright. We also got the caramel, pretzel sandwich with the caramelized green apples. This was the best dessert we have ever had and still rank it as the best dessert after going to other places. the caramel wasn't overpowering and the pretzels brought in the saltiness. The apples was a nice touch and added some sweet and sour flavor.  All in all, the dinner was really good and still one of the best dinners we've had as a couple. I would highly recommend the duck and the caramel, pretzel sandwich for dessert. We plan on revisiting again!"}
{"text":"Avenue B is my favorite special occasion restaurant for several reasons: The food is consistently delicious, the atmosphere is romantic without being too stuffy, and the menu changes constantly, so I can always try something new. Chef Chris prides himself on \"sophisticated simplicity\" and that's exactly what you get here. Nothing too over-complicated. Nothing that seems to be trying too hard. Just good, well-thought out dishes. Period.   I'm happy that they expanded their dining room. It takes away from the intimate feel a bit, but it makes it easier to get reservations at a reasonable time.   Dinner starts off with a basket of fresh bread and whatever the special house-made butter is that night. Expect some interesting flavor combos like kale/honey. On my recent Avenue B visit I ordered the most tender melt in your mouth Hanger Steak that was served over a flavor explosion of mushroom mac and cheese ($35). Dessert was a croissant bread pudding with salted popcorn ice cream. Divine!  If there's nothing on the rotating chalkboard menu that catches your eye, do yourself a favor and order the Wagyu Meatloaf ($25). You may be thinking, \"Amy, $25 is a little steep for something my mom made for me as a kid.\" Well, I don't know your mom, but I can guarantee her meatloaf sucked in comparison to this distinctive, delightful, enticing, exquisite dish. This meatloaf will change your life (or, at the very least, cause you to over-use adjectives).  Service is always fantastic. The corkage fee recently raised from $5 to $8, which I think is a little steep. There's free corkage on Sundays, though!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Quaint and cozy. Good service and delicious flavor. A seasonal menu which makes it extremely fun - different each time.  I liked it so much that I returned the next night, as I was in Pittsburgh for the week on business.  The first night I had: Butternut squash green chili soup, which had a very unique taste - sweet with spicy (delicious).  I thought to myself - how can I make this at home. Next, I had the pan seared walleye.  This  was fantastic with pomegranates and pecan basmati rice. One of my favorite meals. Mmmmm.  The next night I had the short ribs with sugar snap mashed potatoes, again - unique, but extremely flavorful.  I hate when food is over-seasoned and this chef is it perfect.    You must make reservations, as there are limited tables. The menu is on a large chalkboard, the seasonal items, and they have a few standards, but I'm all about the adventure.  BYOB.  Makes me hungry just thinking of the food options.  I rarely rate any restaurant 5 stars...but this is a definite.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and think it's been overrated a bit. For the food, service and environment, I would go to spoon for similar price."}
{"text":"Now open on Sundays and they have a marvelous 3 course prix fix menu. I started with the roasted beet wedge salad which was great and I loved the green goddess dressing with blue cheese. My tempura battered fish and chips and slaw was excellent as well and the portion size was generous. I was in a food coma from the first two items so I cant' really remember the desert and I was so full I didn't make much of a dent in it. BYOB makes having a really great wine with a great meal even easier. Service and food is always excellent and now that they are open Sundays there is even more reason to go."}
{"text":"Awesome food selected from either seasonal menu or daily options. The meatloaf, which is currently standard, was delicious and the green bean and sweet potato tempura starter was light and very tasty. The dessert - the Girl Scout trio consisting of their take on Samoas, Tagalongs, and Thin Mints - was, well, orgasmic. The waitress, Roxanne, whom I told did NOT have to put on her red dress, was sweet and not overly attentive. Oh, and it's BYOB! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Are you considering Avenue B for dinner tonight? Well, you should be. Go ahead, ask some questions. Here are some answers--Yes. Great. Fantastic. Right away, actually. No way! You too?!  Avenue B's main attraction (in the opinion of our seven-person party) are their mussels. Clams down the best mussels I have ever had. If I could do it again, I would get a few plates of the mussels. And then order a few hundred more to go. I don't even need to hit the gym anymore. Get it?!  A friend of mine was celebrating his birthday last week, and so we, accompanied by his entire family, strolled in to Avenue B with a few bottles of red wine and a couple of growlers from East End (BYOB).  I could waste the time to write out everything we ate, how it was cooked, and add in various side-comments, but I'll save the time and space to just simply comment that everything was delicious, I doubt you'll be dissatisfied, and you should try the mussels."}
{"text":"We had very high expectations for this cozy little BYOB.   We went here with another couple who RAVED about this restaurant.  The decor was very simple, romantic and intimate, it was a great compliment to the outstanding food and service to come. There is a standard seasonal menu, and the daily chalkboard specials.  The service was wonderful, Kevin, who also doubles as a chef in the back walked us through the menus. The decor was very simple, romantic and intimate, it was a great compliment to the outstanding food and service to come.  We started off with the raw deal- a Deconstructed spicy tuna roll and tuna sashimi, it was a wonderful way to start off our meal, we also ordered the PEI mussels, which steeped in a smoky tomato base brother, very delicious.  The deconstructed pork spring roll was nicely done. For the main entree we ordered the Kobe Meatloaf with goat cheese and chive mashed potatoes, finished off with french onion crispsit was pure heaven, our friend had been talking about this dish for the entire day and it did not disappoint! We also balance the meal out with a fish dish, we tried the grilled wild striped bass, the fish had a great texture with a hint of smokiness to it. The dessert, finished off as strong as we started. We had the lavendar cake with panna cotta and also the chocolate cake,   We ended up being the last ones in the restaurant and Kevin still asked us if we wanted coffee, he had said that he lived around the corner and didn't mind if we wanted to stay a bit longer, he always gave us after dinner bar options to continue our night out.  All in all, one of the best dining experiences we've ever had!"}
{"text":"I have tried Avenue B thrice, and  two of my trips out of three were really good. The second time the menu was a little boring. I feel that the restaurant has improved over time and the menu has become even better. The expansion of the restaurant is great because earlier it was a little too small. Overall the food is always good and fresh, and the desserts exceptional."}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant before and loved it. Unfortunately we loved the sunday special advertised and they decided to cancel it without updating the website to reflect this. This lack of planning cost them all of my future business. When confronted about the false and innaccurate advertising they simply did nothing and said there was nothing they could do. Will never be back. I drove an hour for their fasely advertised special.  Very dissapointed."}
{"text":"I'm positively in love with this restaurant. After dining here once, I couldn't wait to go back. The 2nd time has me pining for a 3rd. I ate every dribble of sauce off my last dish there and snapped a photo of my friend licking her plate! Yep, THAT GOOD!  It's tough not to order off the wall chalkboard menu but I did get the starter pork belly lettuce wraps last time from the actual menu. My husband shushed me because I apparently made a bit too much of an enthusiastic sound as I took my first bite. My fingers were sticky by the time I was done and I didn't care. I did share 1 with hubby and I believe he made a similar noise as what I did & I also remember him saying 'wow!' Pork belly cooked & sauced to absolute perfection.  My chalkboard dinner entree was veal medallions with roasted root veggies, spinach & black truffle hollandaise that I didn't leave a single speck of on my plate. The veal was super tender and a really nicely sized portion, the sauce to die for!   Service was fabulous on both of our visits. Reservations are always required here with some advance notice to get what you want. You must call because they aren't on Open Table. The restaurant is small and usually packed but there's still enough room between diners that you don't hear their conversations. They are also BYOB and the person taking our reservation even reminded us of that.   Can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Avenue B since they opened and have never been disappointed. It is by far my favorite restaurant in the city. The environment is friendly and casual. The food is always amazing. I never think twice about ordering something with ingredients I've never heard of there. It's a perfect place to try something new."}
{"text":"My friend and I have been meaning to try this place since it opened. The dinner menu is a bit expensive, so we wanted to try lunch. We had been unable to go, though, because of this place's scarce hours (No Sunday or Monday, I think?). Well, I finally went!  The outside seating is gross. There is no way I'd want to sit outside next to the busy street and the bus stop. I know this isn't really something the restaurant can help, but it might be helpful if they could find a way to separate the seating from the bus stop a little better. My friend and I sat inside instead.  The inside was cozy and quiet when we went. The decor is quite nice. Minimalist and tasteful. The chalkboard menu looked delicious, and perhaps sometime I'd like to come for dinner.  I ordered the Cobb salad for lunch. It came with some flavorful toasted bread, which would have been better if it had a little butter on it. I think it was like rye bread or something...I wasn't sure, but it was tasty. My salad had: mixed greens, cucumbers, red onions, avocados, sliced cherry tomatoes, bacon, hard boiled eggs, chicken, blue cheese, red wine vinagrette, and buttermilk ranch dressing. It was a really yummy salad. They were not skimpy on the ingredients and everything was really fresh.  My friend ordered the Kobe beef lunch burger with white cheddar cheese instead of the Midnight Cowboy cheese (which, by the way, is a creamy blue cheese). He ordered his burger medium rare, but it came out more like medium well to well done. It did not matter, as it was still plenty juicy. I had a bite of his burger and the patty was very juicy and had diced onions in it, which added to the flavor immensely. It was definitely a quality burger.  I'd like to try this place again and get one of the more unusual orders other than a cobb salad. I was just really in the mood for a salad.  My only negative thing to say was that I didn't think the service was all that great. It wasn't BAD by any means, but I had the feeling that the server thought my friend and I were not going to tip well. She did not seem happy at all to be waiting on us. She wasn't rude, but she wasn't really nice either. She was just blah the whole time. My friend and I both have worked in the restaurant industry for years, so this is the kind of thing that really peeves me because I know all too well when a server thinks that their customer will not tip them well. It's a double slap, considering we tip well.  But anyway, other than that, it was a nice experience, and I would love to come back."}
{"text":"Great food with very decent portion sizes. First time visit for the 4 of us. Waiter was extremely knowledgeable about everything on the manageable-sized menu."}
{"text":"Terrific meal. Fried green tomatoes were especially good. Same for meatloaf, swordfish and hanger steak. One criticism. The tap water should be filtered. It was horrendous. No excuse for a restaurant of this caliber. Especially considering the install of a basic filter is a $50 do-it-yourself project."}
{"text":"Overpriced and small portions. Some of the entrees were served cold and others were over cooked."}
{"text":"Yikes!  A great meal in a room that somehow seems intimate.    Love the mural on the wall outside!    The two chalkboards had some interesting selections and the printed seasonal menu had my mouth watering.  Very hard to make a decision on what to order.  The food at the other tables looked so good.  Our excellent waiter was able to describe and explain the ingredients and how everything is fresh.    The basket of bread with the seasoned whipped butter was great.  For \"Beginnings\" we ordered the Calamari which was very crispy and had a sharp spice edge.  For \"Main Events\" I had the Berkshire pork chop, basil spaetzle, grilled Treviso, peaches & hazelnuts.  The meal was wonderfully cooked and a great combo of flavors.  For \"Sweet\" or desert we shared a desert that is two chocolate fudge rectangles on top of a chocolate cookie with homemade ice cream.  The fudge is so smooth and the the cookie is crispy.  But the ice cream was what we liked the most.     BYOB, and every table seemed to!"}
{"text":"Bring your own salt and outdoor voices. What reads on the menu as dishes made with top ingredients, turns out to be surprisingly bland and undercooked. The \"spicy\" tuna tartar must have been made with a tuna who was named, Spicy. There was no spice detected. The texture was also, not desirable.  Salt, spices, and fresh herbs would make a huge difference. Nothing was inedible, just joyless. The Brussel sprouts were charred on the outside, but crunchy and undercooked on the inside.  Service was slow, and the awkward acoustics in the space mean that you have to shout to your tablemates, but can hear every word from the other tables."}
{"text":"I love this place because it is consistently a 5 star restaurant. Every time you walk through the door you know that you will be having an absolutely superb meal.  The servers are perfectly attentive without being overbearing. They're knowledgeable, friendly, and pleasantly enthusiastic. The food is always fresh, well matched flavors and they love to use simple ingredients that create a well balanced course. Did I mention their dessert is absolutely to die for? Oh, coffee too.  I cannot wait to try the spring menu, I'll definitely be bringing a nice bottle of wine and relaxing for awhile."}
{"text":"Wow. The food at this place is AMAZING! Their menu changes all the time, and I highly recommend ordering a bunch of things and sharing. Drinks are BYOB."}
{"text":"Overall, I was pretty disappointed with Avenue B.   I made a reservation for 7:15 and arrived to the restaurant quite punctually. Even though the dining room was nowhere near full, our table for 4 was not yet prepared for whatever reason. Isn't that why I made a reservation so my table would be ready?   After we get settled, our server, rambled through the daily specials so fast that I basically comprehended about 1/3 of what she actually said. When I asked her to repeat one particular special that sounded appealing, she huffed and briskly repeated it for a second time.   We were never offered a drink menu or anything other than water. I had planned to treat my friends to an expensive bottle of wine of their choosing but since the restaurant never provided any type of menu, I chose Coke. Upon reading reviews of the restaurant after I got home, apparently its BYOB. I would have never known...   Our server came back relatively quick for our dinner orders. We weren't ready to order, and she seemed pretty irritated about it. Well maybe if she hadn't spoken so fast about what they were serving, we would have been ready. Regardless, we each ordered an entree.  After about 10 minutes we were served bread and butter. The bread was pretty lackluster. The butter was coffee and cocoa. For 4 people who are aren't big on coffee to begin with, the coffee butter pretty much ruined that course for us. The bread sat there cold for the rest of the meal.   After what seemed like eons, we were served our entrees, all of which were quite satisfying.   In my reservation, I noted that it was my friend's birthday. However, the server at no point indicated that she noticed. So I took it upon myself to excuse myself to the \"restroom\" to advise her. She responded with \"What do you want me to do about it? Put a candle in the dessert you ordered?\" You mean to tell me that no one has ever come to Avenue B for a birthday dinner before? To say the least, I was pretty ticked off.   2 stars."}
{"text":"I don't give many places 5 stars, but this place deserves it. From the well planned seasonal menu to the intimate setting, it's a great place for a date or dinner with some friends ... oh and BYOB, there's no corking fee!"}
{"text":"Cozy BYOB very close to UPMC-Shadyside.   The rooms nicely lit and service was very good.  Ordered the Wagyu Meatloaf based on reviews and it didn't disappoint.   Server was kind to substitute potatoes for a vegetable!  Complementary bread with wonderful chive butter provided before meal while waiting.  I look forward to coming back again and brining nice bottle of wine (flew into town and didn't have time to purchase, although server mentioned Giant Eagle close by now has liquor store in it)."}
{"text":"I visited Avenue B for the 3rd time last night for Pittsburgh Restaurant week.  Avenue B has been a favorite of mine, but I just can't get to it as often as I'd like.  While my most recent experience was sub-par, I will be back.  Their restaurant week menu was fantastic!  My choice for appetizer was the amazing cauliflower soup.  SO good, so stinking good.  Honestly, I could have just eaten that.  Entree - I got the hanger steak.  It was good - not as good as the cauliflower soup though.  Honestly, I think it could have used a little more seasoning.  However, I am not complaining!  It was still great!  There were 2 frustrating parts to our meal, both out of our control.  1.  One of the folks that was seated beside us had apparently previously worked at Avenue B, or was friends with our waitress.  She loudly told them that they would accommodate whatever they wanted to the restaurant week menu/price if they'd like.   While I did not see the bill, so I don't know if that was truly the case - you don't say that kind of stuff loudly for other patrons to hear!  It was frustrating how much time staff (other waiters, our waitress, and other staff) lingered at their table.    2.  Dessert.  There was only 1 option for dessert - which is FINE!  That's not my frustration.  When our entree plates were taken - everything was - bread, silverware, etc.  Again - fine.  Our spoons were brought for the ice cream.  20 minutes later - let me just say that again - 20 minutes later, we still hadn't received our dessert.  However, the buddies of the staff had their plates taken away and dessert (trio dessert) brought out within 5 minutes.  SO we waited.  When the dessert finally arrived (about 30 minutes later) the ice cream was a puddle on our bowl and melted and warm.  Ice Cream. Melted because it'd probably been sitting out.    While I am sure I will be back to Avenue B, I wont be rushing back.  I won't be getting dessert and probably won't go back for restaurant week.  They still got 4 stars as I have had other good experiences."}
{"text":"I took my parents here when my folks were visiting me from out of town and let me tell ya, I was not disappointed.  First off we showed up a little late with hubby and my parents in tow on a Friday night without reservations. We were told by the hostess that the wait would be 30 min, which was totally reasonable. Fortnutanely we were able to be seated within 15, not only that during our wait we were provided with glasses for some of the wine that we brought along for our dinner.  Anyway our server poured us some wine and shortly thereafter we were seated.   Our waitress was incredibly attentive and had some really good recommendations. Amongst them was their meatloaf (which my husband loved and said it was the \"best I've ever had\"), and the caramelized brussel sprouts.   I initially was rather hesitant to order duck which my husband was urging me to do. I had a previous experience where the duck was dry and stringy as well as real greasy.... not what I would want. But I went for it and was so glad I ordered it!!! The duck was probably the best I have ever had. It was juicy, tender, and incredibly seasoned. It was a total delight to devour.   This place was one of the many places that I have been meaning to visit and I was so glad that we took a chance and took my parents here. Love the ambiance, the services, and most of all the food. I honestly think that anything from this menu may just turn out to be amazeballs. I can't wait to come back!!  PS bring a bottle of wine as they are BYOB!   Cheers!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my trip to Avenue B and posted the whole trip to my blog.  \"A trip to Avenue B can be pricey--that's just the genre it fills. Unlike some other outings, I left Avenue B thrilled with the experience and truly excited by the and the quality of our experience---thanks in part to an exceptional waitress. Given that enthusiasm, I had no problem dropping a sizable chunk of change for an exceptional experience--at least on a somewhat rare occasion.\"  http://www.foodburgh.com/2010/02/avenue-b/"}
{"text":"I wanted to try somewhere new, BJ said okay!  We picked Avenue B together.  Since they were not on Open Table, I was thinking that maybe they didn't take reservations.  I guess I should have called....  Turns out, we had no problem table getting a table on a Saturday night.  This restaurant is small.  Probably only seats about 50 people.  We got a table along the wall.  The server was nice, but not overly helpful.  I mean it's like he was showing up for work, but not all that interested in it.  That's okay, we didn't really need his help with the menu..  We started with a chalkboard special - beet salad.  It was great.  Yummy butter lettuce, golden beets, granny smith apples and candied walnuts.  The bread basket was also great, we were especially in love with the nutty bread.  For our meals, I got the Wagyu beef meatloaf.  So good, especially loved the goat cheese & chive whipped potatoes and huge pile of crispy onions.  What I didn't love was the raw spot in the middle.  BJ got a rustic portobello & grilled pepper lasagna.  He really liked it, I thought that the flavors were awesome.    For dessert, we shared a french toast bread pudding with popcorn and ice cream.  I am a lover of dessert, but this one was really a fail.  Our meal was good, minus a couple hick-ups.  We will try them, again in the future.  Also, don't forget - BYOB!"}
{"text":"i wish i would have had more of an appetite the day i went here for lunch, because i'm pretty sure it could render 4 stars. anyway, when i got there, they had just opened so we were the only people in the whole place. the menu is short, but full of tempting dishes. we started with the vegetable tempura with a japanese aioli. aioli and tempura are two words i can almost never turn down, and they definitely delivered. the beans were my favorite of the veggies, but although the dish looked small, it just about filled both of us up before we even got our entrees. now, unfortunately my eyes were bigger than my stomach this day, so it's hard for me to really judge my entree, but basically, i enjoyed it, but i'd probably get something else next time. i got the turkey rachel. it was good, my only complaint was that i wasn't a big fan of the slaw... it was pretty much just pieces of lettuce and cabbage stuck on the sandwich. although, the sauce was good, so i took the leftovers home to finish. our server was super nice and gave us her opinion on several dishes, and the price was completely fair."}
{"text":"I want to like this place and I've tried several times but I'm just not a fan of the food here. The location is great and the ambiance is nice but the food is not nearly good enough to justify the price. The only thing I've liked here is the grilled cheese but I could get that anywhere including my own kitchen. If you want to spend  some money on a fancy meal I would opt for other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for my boyfriend's birthday at Avenue B after reading a few Yelp reviews who suggested to do so. The restaurant space is small but cozy, and is also pretty quiet on a noise level basis so you're not shouting across the table. Similar to Salt of the Earth, they have their menus up on chalkboards however the chalkboard size and the fonts are smaller so we had a hard time reading, especially since there was a glare from the light from where we were sitting (it didn't seem very appropriate for us to get up and take a closer look since that might mean us intruding on someone else's dinner). Good concept in theory.   I ordered the meatloaf which was good and my boyfriend ordered their special fish and chips, and unfortunately everything came out tempura fried for him which was not what he was envisioning from the way it was described by the waiter. And then because we were there for a celebration, we ordered their smore dessert. When we got the smores, it was a deconstructed version which unfortunately was a miss for us on this too. There were pieces of chocolate and we were suppose to drink or dip them into a chocolate liquid. We were confused. Needless to say we did not finish it.  Ultimately the choices we picked at Avenue B were either not mind blowing or memorable for all the wrong reasons. I unfortunately don't think we'll be back given the prices we paid for our food though from what the other Yelpers are saying this would seem like a place right up our alley."}
{"text":"This was a great option.  We were with a group of 8; friendly, fresh farm to table food, and terrific experience.  Would have been 5 star, but, I don't want to loosely use those markings!  Really good, I'm a fan"}
{"text":"Food is okay. Nothing special. Over priced. No real talent in the kitchen. Trying to be something they aren't."}
{"text":"Avenue B is highly recommended. The quality of the food is enough to bring you here. Their space expansion makes reservations easier. Bring your own wine to save drinking costs. The staff did their best to make it a pleasure able experience. We brought a six month rear old, and they did their best to accommodate her."}
{"text":"Out of the 2 dishes (meatloaf and beet + mac 'n cheese), we both agreed that the beet mac and cheese was the best out of the 2!  The meatloaf actually looked fantastic (you know that's a good sign with a dish like this!) and it actually ended up having a great flavor.  The mac and cheese, however blew it out of the water!  It was fantastic!  My only complaint is that there was a noticeable lack of beets.  I've heard this dish has been evolving and so my hope is that the next time I see it, I can have a beet in every bite!  Sitting outside was a bit of a mistake.  There needs to be a better divide between me: the food eater and you: the bus people.  It was just loud with the bus coming by every 5 minutes :("}
{"text":"What an outstanding find. so great to find a small local restaurant with a truly talented chef who likes to experiment and stretch the boundaries. The chalkboard menu has their standard and seasonal dishes. Crispy oysters with a light cream sauce and mussels prepared the chefs way. The service was fantastic what a great group.  Courteous,  professional and welcoming. Give it a try,  no disappointments. And yes I was eating alone Tara!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time last night.  The mussels starter and the green beans & sweet potato tempura starter, both off of the chalkboard, were fantastic. The mussels were outstanding. Not at all rubbery or grainy. The broth was very flavorful, but not overpowering. The tempura was light and crispy, with a delicious accompanying sauce. A few of the sweet potato pieces were slightly undercooked though.   For my entree, I ordered the meatloaf that everyone seems to be talking about. While it was definitely good, I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. My friend, who had ordered it before, also said it wasn't quite as good as she remembered. I can't quite put my finger on what was off though. While it wasn't dry, it definitely had sort of a chewy texture.   Finally, I couldn't leave without trying their mac 'n' cheese side. It was delicious, with bits of apple added for a little welcome sweetness.   Overall, I was happy with the portions. I left satisfied (even skipping desert) but not unpleasantly full.   My biggest complaint is, of course, the price. With the lovely space, great food, and constantly changing menu, it is the kind of neighborhood restaurant that I would love to stop at on a weekly basis. If only it wouldn't bankrupt me..."}
{"text":"What a cute little place!  It's uber tiny, but you get the feeling it will pack a big punch.  I opted to try out the lunch first because I was very intrigued by the grilled cheese and tomato soup I had read about in other reviews.    Sure enough, both were mighty fab!  There wasn't a thing I would change about the grilled cheese.  The bread (wheat or grain) was awesome and it was toasted perfectly.  Tomatoes inside were an added bonus.  But the real winner of was the cheese.  Oh Cheddar, oh cheddar, how I love thee!  It was sharp as could be and absolute melty goodness.  I was in cheesy heaven!  The soup was definitely good, but not great.  I think it could have done with a little more pepper and a tad more cream to add to the bisque name.  It tasted just a tad too runny for bisque.  If I'm going to calorie overload on my bisque, you better commit with my heavy cream!    Service left a little bit to be desired.  She just seemed very unenthusiastic about everything.  I really enjoy asking the server about different menu items, to get their take on what they enjoy.  Maybe I'm too trusting, but I assume they've tried mostly everything and have opinions about them.  I mean, I wouldn't work in a place I hated their food (that's maybe why I stuffed myself with one too many EnP Superburgers back in my day).  She didn't really offer much....oh well, you can't always have a peppy server (Lord knows I wasn't all the time!).    I can't wait to go back and try the dinner.  Everything on the lunch menu sounded awesome, and I'm sure dinner would be just the same.  I'll be back with my bottle of red for BYOB BABY!"}
{"text":"Back at Avenue B with some friends.  Entire meal was really good.  I had the mussels which were excellent in a tomato based broth.  Others had rainbow roll, foie gras, and heirloom tomato salad.  everyone was happy. I had duck and pork belly entrée.  Very well executed.  Good flavors.  Others had wagyu steak, arctic char and tile fish.  Again, everyone was happy."}
{"text":"Food was really good and the BYOB was an added bonus. Staff was knowledgeable and friendly. For the price, I was disappointed in the portion size but was surprisingly comfortably full. I would definitely dine there again."}
{"text":"I loved every single moment! There was nothing I would change absolutely nothing. If you want a delightful meal and peaceful dining experience. Grab a bottle of wine and go!!! There is nothing on the menu I wouldn't suggest or order myself but I will say you have lost your mind if you don't order the muscles in red sauce. Even if you don't like muscles, order them and you might find yourself a new food to crave!"}
{"text":"I became a fan of Avenue B after my first visit.  This tiny little restaurant located on Centre Avenue is BYOB.  Our waiter was knowledgeable of the entire menu and gave us plenty of suggestions on what me and my dining partners might like.    I went with a non-drinking crowd, so we did not bring wine.  I don't know how much the cork fee is, however there were plenty of people smiling with wine on their table, so I can't imagine it is too expensive.  They have both a seasonal and daily menu.  The one thing I did not like was the daily menu is written on a large chalkboard on the wall.  It seemed odd to me that we had to read off a wall- similar to a deli.  The restaurant was quite cozy.  I suggest making a reservation.  I had veal in a cherry glaze.  The veal was cooked to perfection.  All of my dining partners were also extremely satisfied with their meals.  If you are looking for a trendy restaurant with great food, you'll have to check out Avenue B.  :)"}
{"text":"I think that Avenue B is a solid 4 stars.  It is BYOB, which is a big advantage to an upper class place such as this.  Everything that we got was very good. We had three appetizers, the mussels, honey whipped chevre with prosciutto, and the duck poutine.  The mussels were in a tomato sauce - very flavorful and rich.  My date was very enthusiastic about the honey whipped chevre, and we both enjoyed the poutine, made with sweet potatoes. Our entrees were the grilled bronzino, which was very good, and the lamb pasta.  The pasta was very tasty, but a bit salty (and I like salt), and the portion was also smaller than I would expect for an entree nearly $30. Also, the noise level was a bit annoying.  I found myself speaking very loudly, as if I were in a bar. Altogether, the visit was very pleasant, service was good, and I would come back.  One piece of advice - when reading these reviews, check out their website.  Many of the dishes listed are on their \"chalkboard\" menu, which changes frequently."}
{"text":"I've only been to Avenue B for lunch (on several occasions) and each time that I've been there I've really enjoyed it.  I've never had a bad meal there and would like to try it for dinner sometime soon!  Some of my favorite items on the lunch menu so far have been the Falafel wrap, which they now offer as a salad instead of a wrap, but I've had both and the Falafel is perfectly cooked with the perfect blend of seasoning.  I actually prefer the salad over the wrap, so I'm glad that this seems to be a regular offering on the lunch menu.  I've also had the Wagyu burger which was delicious and juicy - perfectly cooked and big enough that I was able to take half of it home for dinner!  I love that they offer one of my favorite cold weather comfort foods - a grilled cheese and tomato soup, well to be accurate, it is an aged cheddar grilled cheese sandwich and tomato bisque and it definitely hits the spot when you want something warm that has both creamy and crunchy components!    I've never needed a reservation for lunch and have always been seated right away when I've dined here, but I'm guessing that might not be the case when it hits dinner time.  The service has always been consistently quick and the staff is friendly and attentive.  I look forward to going back sometime for dinner and bring a bottle of wine to go with it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant in consistently amazing. Consistently. I have been there five times over three years, and every single time, I am extremely impressed. They had a formula that worked, and they stuck with it. I highly suggest this place for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. Always excellent. A great choice for a night out with good friends. Different and creative every time. Be sure to experience it...you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"I looked up the best restaurants to try in Pittsburgh, and Avenue B came up as the top 5.  Very eager to try. I went there with my fiance for our 1yr anniversary. The food was OK. I had the organic chicken and my fiance had the very tough and chewy rib eye steak. VERY limited menu.  The chicken wasn't horrible, it had it's own unique flavor. The steak was not good. Tough meat and not even a dash of salt. The wait was VERY LONG. Very over priced for the portion and the taste. The ambiance was very plain. This place is a BYOB, and has a $8 corking fee. I did not engage.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This restaurant fits in Shadyside. The food was decent but overpriced."}
