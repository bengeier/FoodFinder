{"text":"Absolutely amazing ! They are busy but can handle it! Food top notch , we will return :)"}
{"text":"Great addition to Mimico. Only reason I am
not giving 5 stars is because we grabbed take-out so I cannot comment on service. Food was fresh and flavorful and I portions were plentiful. Will be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"I wrestled with this review as their menu, although expansive, was a little pricey for Indian. However, I'm going to stop reviewing on what I think the price should be for the style and assess on the value of what it is.

This place delivers bold, flavorful and authentic dishes, but with modern flaire and plating. The mixed grill appetizer is outrageously good and I would come back for that. The owners and staff are friendly and very helpful.  Service was attentive.

Only downside is the place is a little cozy... so make reservations -- not a place to drop into.

5 stars"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the customer service and the food from this restaurant.  We didn't felt welcomed from the guy that seated us.  The waitress didn't look happy to serve us either.   We only saw her twice and she disappeared for the entire evening.  The food wasn't great either rather bland which is surprising because Indian food is known for their flavour and spices.  We dined at many Indian restaurants and felt they cheap out with their spices.  We waited a very long time for our dishes and waited even longer for the bill.  We had to asked the waitress for the bill 3 times!  The food was bland and customer service was just horrible, a bunch of fake staff who didn't even acknowledges their patron isn't a place we want to return, first and last for us."}
{"text":"Finally a decent Indian eatery at Lakeshore. Their food is very good. Very well behaved/ friendly staff and owner. Portions are really good. I have been to TICH around 5-6 times and its always the same i.e. awesome. 
Only thing which they lack is space, and it get really crowded when full, which it is normally.
Overall very good place to eat. 
Definite repeat"}
{"text":"This was my fourth visit to Tish, and was not impressed with the staff. I ordered two items for p/u at 6pm.
When I arrived to p/u, I found that the order was lost. I was offered something to drink while my order was made from scratch, but declined. The manager offered no apology.
When I returned to get my order, the manager simply handed me the credit card machine, again with no apology for the mistake. The bill tendered was for the full amount ordered.
So, what did I learn? When ordering by phone from Tich, make them repeat the order, get the servers name, and if they still lose your order, don't go back.
Oh, and my mother in law, who is Anglo Indian, and adores spicy food, told me later that she could not eat the lamb vindaloo, it was too spicy even for an Indian person.
On my fifth visit to Tish, I ordered four items for takeout. I arrived 16 mins. late . By that time, the two orders of naan were stone cold, way over cooked (brittle), no naan taste left.
The Daal Bukhara was largely kidney beans, was over spiced, and to be honest, tasted like child con carne from a can, then spiked with hot chilli spice to hide the taste. The Hyderabad Baby Eggplant was decent, flavourful, just too over spiced.
The Tandoori Chicken Tikka consisted of 5 pieces of offcuts, full of gristle. Spicing was decent.

Would I ever step foot inside this establishment again? Do you really think I'm that crazy?"}
{"text":"My new favorite Indian resto in Toronto... Food was top notch, deft hand with the spices, generous portions. Shall definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service! I booked reservations for a party of 7, and although they were a little late seating us, the rest of the night was impeccable. The waitress was attentive and knew a lot about the ingredients and prep method of their dishes. The restaurant was busy the whole night, which made for a lively atmosphere. But most importantly, the food was delicious. 

Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Got a early reservation because it  was booked up. Usually a good sign.

The decor is really nice - modern and lovely.

Off the bat - I have a sensitive nose - so to me, before the place filled up and the kitchen got cooking, I was really put off by the way the restaurant smelled. I think they may have a damp basement or something. Understandable, but please burn some lamp bergeres, or something.

Friendly service. 

We started with the Kokani Crab Tikki, supposedly crab cakes. It gets a big no from me. When I ask for crab cake I expect to at least get a hint that crab was involved in the making of the dish... instead I got a cake overpowered by curry leaves and mustard seeds. I felt like I was eating a spice ball. Maybe they waved the crab over it? No - just no.

Our second appetizer was the Onion Bhaji - now I am not normally a fan of battered and fried onions, but these were delish!

I also had the Bengali Fish Curry, which was ok, and my dinner companion had the Chicken Vindaloo because he craves all things spicy - and the menu says in BOLD letters HOT - usually for him it ain't, but in this case it lived up to the hype! He was very happy.

I'll return and give it another shot - I hear the Sea Bream and Braised Lamb Shank are both great. For now...it's ok - hopefully I'll revise my opinion."}
{"text":"A great restaurant that shines along lakeshore west. We were here to celebrate our one year wedding anniversary. 

The positives - a) service was exceptional. Our waiter and associate staff paid close attention to our requests, answered our questions about portions and the restaurant history (I used to live in the neighbourhood years ago and mistook it for another restaurant (Everest) ; b) the food - delicious . We opted out of the prix fixe ( which looked good)

The negatives a) the beer I ordered was the last of its brand and came out flat, but chalk that one up to coincidence; b) service was just a bit slow... c) it was a little crowded ... 

Overall a good experience . Will come back."}
{"text":"We tried Tich for dinner last night and loved every bit of it. I tried the veg menu and almost ordered everything (we were party of 8). Onion bhaaji, tandoori platter,
saag panner, dal Bhukara,  masala Bhindi  are top notch. Have to say that the garlic nan is the best I had in a long long time. They also have some great wines options to go along with the food. Very nice ambience...great waiting staff and very welcoming host!! Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"We went try out this Indian Joint. Descent Decor. Honest opinion  is that the service is avg can use help. Knowing Indian food well, the choice is limited, appetizers are very spicy  and difficult to appreciate the true taste of the dish. The main course we ordered Dal, Butter Chicken and Paneer Labradar, they were very sweet and the curry was generic, the meat seems to be thighs and not chicken breast. The curry was overly creamy and sweet. I guess they are trying to cater to a clientele, who may not be knowledgeable  of good Indian Food. There is nothing modern or fusion about the dishes either. The food was not upto par for the Indian Pallett. The staff was nice!! I hope the management takes this critique as positive and may result in change. I wish them the best!!"}
{"text":"Its a decent place to go, today we had a great service for 12 ppl. They accommodated us n even gave us an extra table when the rush reduced. The server ensured all our requests were taken care of. 
Food was decent. I think service was the best part, they were courteous, helpful n knowledgeable."}
{"text":"My wife saw this restaurant on the show You've Gotta Eat Here and had a craving for Indian food.  We drove from Don Mills to eat here late yesterday  afternoon.  We arrived without a reservation as we thought it was still early enough.  The host was surprised that we showed up without one but we were still seated.

First impression was that it was a cute, cozy yet had a trendy decor.

The service was decent and attentive.  It wasn't busy then so no real excuse for it not to be.

Before our order came out we received a basket of papadums.
We ordered onion bhaji as our appetizer.  I have to say that it was the best onion bhaji that I've ever had.  Crisp on the outside yet soft and chewy on the inside.
Our mains were the Chicken Tikka Masala and Hyderabad Baigan with Naan and rice.  They were were both tasty and not oily.
The naan is less doughy than we like but if you like it crispy then it's  for you.
We paired our meal with Kingfisher beer.

In the end we were both satisfied.  If in the area I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Great great Indian place!  Very different dishes that you don't normally get and great atmosphere. Neighborhood is a little sketch but not too bad. Love it here!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!!! My boyfriend and I got the chicken tikka masala (which was absolutely incredible), one of the chicken curries (can't remember the name, it was nice and spicy), rice and garlic naan. The garlic naan was fantastic. Loved the decor. Gave it 4 stars as it is pricey! The dishes don't come with rice/naan and you have to order it separately. An almost $100 meal (we got wine too) and it didn't seem worth $100. I would recommend to others but with caution of the prices."}
{"text":"I love this place . Excellent Indian food . And I am a huge food critique . Their chicken biriyani , lamb Bhuna and fish are just amazing . It has hint if Bengali cuisine since one of the chef is Bengali . The restaurant is a bit out of the way if you are in downtown. But for an special treat I highly recommend this place !"}
{"text":"We came in on a Sunday without reservations and was told they were pretty booked up. They accommodated us though and we sat down. Ambiance was great, modern and relaxing. The food came quick and was delicious. We ordered the lamb korma which had amazing flavour and the chicken vindaloo. Our only complaint was the service. They were polite but we had to ask for water, drink refills and our bill.  Overall, a very good restaurant and we will be coming back."}
{"text":"The fam took me to Tich (what drama, figuring out how to pronounce it) last night for my birthday, and damn, I was not disappointed. Oh, and the parental units were concerned that they could not spy anyone who looked Indian working there, but their authenticity fears were quickly put to rest. 

Not only do they have a delicious veg section on their menu, they also have a veg 3 course option, which is nice. We opted to share many (oh, so many) dishes, and across the board, everyone was thrilled with every dish. For me, the evening's true hero was the garlic naan, but I'm weirdly devoted to white carbs and empty calories, so that's just me. 

I also loved the decor....rustic lighting and reclaimed wood feature walls get me right *here*. Kind of hipster-y I suppose, but we all secretly love that vibe. 

The service was excellent, if not a little formal at times (our server took himself very seriously), but overall beyond reproach. He really knew the menu, and was attentive and friendly. 5 stars for him, even though he forgot to take our drink order twice. So I had a dry birthday, which meant no hangover this morning - BONUS!

Side note: I brought my 13 month old daughter, and they had a high chair waiting for us at the table. It's not a kiddie restaurant, but it was surprisingly child-friendly. The music was a little loud, which muffled any complaining from the ankle-biter. ***sorry about all the pappadum bits on the floor, Tich!***

Highly recommend, and will defo return to this little Mimico treasure."}
{"text":"A lot of hype for this place, so wanted to give it a good try and got take out.  We stuck with the staples of traditional dishes, so perhaps we weren't adventurous enough?  The truth is, the dishes were good, the problem was their naan.  It was tough and chewy, and rather disappointing.  For my wife, naan is the highlight of an Indian meal.

Butter chicken - was good, had a more complex flavour than other butter chickens we've had.  For my wife, a touch spicier than she'd like, but that was the theme of the meal as the Saag Paneer was as well.  The chicken itself was very tender, and in her words, \"you can tell it's genuine Tandoori here\".  Yum.

Saag Paneer - generous on the paneer, which is very important, imo.  Probably the highest ginger concentration I've ever had for this dish, but tasty.  Spicy for the wife, but I appreciated the modern touch with ginger.

Bottom line - The naan couldn't be overcome.  I told her that we won't be back, I can't disappoint her like this again.  A shame for me, because I like their dishes.  Oh well, we can always do Banjara, though it's not as close for us."}
{"text":"Sorry overall disappointed. The decor is amazing. Our server was amazing. The menu is simple and includes all good Indian dishes. The food is a different story. 
Lamb shank felt like a tomato stew and quite bland, lamb chops were ok, crab cakes hardly had crabs. 
Overall, rather disappointed at both the main courses and the apps."}
{"text":"The food was pricey for Indian, but absolutely worth it. It was delicious. My husband and I ordered the lamb chops for an appetizer with four chops to share between the both of us, and for the main we shared the dal bukhara and dak bungalo chicken with a side order of naan. We were both very full and ended up taking some food home. The portions were generous! The food was not too oily and it was nice and spicy to our liking. The server was very friendly and looked after us very well. The only suggestion I have is to lower the music just a little as it was difficult to talk to my husband over it at times, and the washroom could have been a little tidier. The serving dishes could have been a little fancier as well. But in terms of food quality and overall vibe, it would be unfair for me not to give it a 5/5! Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"I went here last night. The server was friendly, but overall the service was a bit slow.

The portions are generous, however some of the flavours were lacking in the meat dishes. 

we had:

Achari paneer grill - 4/5 

Chicken tikka masala - 3/5

Lamb corma - 2/5 this dish was really lacking. It was edible, but the lamb was dry and the sauce was bland. 

Masala Bindi (okra) 5/5 this was fantastic! 

I will defiantly return to try more of the vegetarian dishes. All in all Tich is A -ok!"}
{"text":"Stop, drop, and get to Tich.

I'm so happy we ended up here. We made a reservation a couple weeks ago as we had a guest in town. I was a bit concerned about the service having read some of the previous reviews. Reso was for 6, and we parked nearby on the street (free parking after 6pm).

This is definitely not a hole-in-the-wall kind of joint. It's casual and cleanly decorated. We were seated right away at our reserved table. Immediately a bottle of water came onto the table with some glasses, so that was good. We reviewed the menu and the male server came back and asked us if we had questions, which we did - mainly centering on sizing and sharing. 

We initially planned to order the Onion Bhaji & Lasooni Chicken Pakoras; our server countered with that being a lot of fried stuff (fair point...) so he suggested we flip to sharing the Tandoori Chicken Tikka instead. We took him up on that and we're happy we did. The portions were just right for our group of 3. The appetizers came out in about 15 minutes and were accompanied by small salads with this amazing mango dressing on them. Both dishes also had an amazing spicy yet sweet red sauce.

We then ordered a portion of saffron rice & 2 orders of naan as per our server's suggestion. Our table went with an order of butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, and chicken vindaloo.

There was plenty of sauce left, so we ended up ordering a third order of naan... so worth it.

My chicken tikka was delicious, and the butter chicken had depth and was incredibly rich. The chicken vindaloo was certainly spicy, but in a pleasant way. I tasted a lot of pepper -- in a good way.

The place was full throughout our dinner, and we saw take out orders being picked up. Perhaps some of the staffing/ordering issues have been sorted.

I'm in real trouble if this becomes my regular Indian spot! ;)"}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal!! We had the tandoori platter, Biryani, butter chicken and Naan. Everything was just amazing. This is a real hidden gem in Mimico. The ambience and service is also top notch. This place is a must try. The food wasn't oily at all and the quantity was great as well."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and could easily be given 5 stars. Service however needs to be improved. We were a party of 4. 2 of us ordered the prefix and 2 ordered a la carte. For some reason we were given a drink menu but not the food menu when we first arrived. It is difficult to pick your wine choice when you can't even see the food options you might be closing from. While we given water right away, we were at there for at least 30-40 minutes before our drinks arrived.   I found the wine pours to be on the small side, especially with all glasses of wine being almost $10. 
The server repeatedly went through what we ordered but mumbled through it every-time so we could hardly understand what he was saying.  This was annoying when the bill came and he over charged us and then argued about what we ordered.  We also had one bill and each figured out what we owe but the server wasted a lot of time trying to split the bill and getting it wrong every time.   We also had to remind the server a couple times that 2 of our meals came with dessert since he was plopping the bill down right after our mains were down. 

Food was great. The lamp chop app on the pre fix was excellent with a ton of flavour. The lobster and shrimp dish was lacking lobster because they were out (which was very disappointing) but still excellent.   I have no idea what the dessert was but I took it home and ate it the next day and it was very good."}
{"text":"Let's start off on a positive note. The decor is beautiful and modern - clean! The service was really bad and the food was sub-par. Way too spicy and I am Indian. 
The apps were decent but the mains were not good. I didn't like the breads either. Unfortunately will not return."}
{"text":"Don't really know why people are raving about this restaurant. The food is ok. The portions are quite small for an Indian restaurant and some of the dishes are pricey. Also, I found that some dishes were lacking spices - not really authentic. Also, the mango laasi was not good at all. All I could taste was yogurt, no mango. Since I'm Indian and know what real, good Indian food taste like I had higher expectations."}
{"text":"A great Indian food spot in Mimico. The food seemed fresh and was flavourful. Highly recommend their biryani and also ordered the achari paneer which was pretty good. Patio and inside seating is available. If you want to sit inside, I would reserve a  table beforehand."}
{"text":"Can find nothing negative to say. Everything is fabulous. End of review."}
{"text":"Amazing service and delicious food. I ordered their lamb shank. It was perfectly cooked, well spiced and the taste was amazing. Their lachaa paratha and Paneer lababdaar was good too. Their chef knows what they are cooking and not experimenting. I will suggest to try this place at least once if you are a Indian food lover.

Their kulfi was amazing too. Must try."}
{"text":"Brilliant!! Food is exquisite. Service is great.  If you like Indian food, this place is a no brainer. 'nuff said."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, ok food.

I love the reclaimed wood and blue green colours, a great departure from the standard heavy orange, pink, red, purple golden Indian restaurant cliche. 

However, despite it's trendy hipster appearance, Tich is a let down when it comes to food. Yes, they do have some interesting dishes on the menu, especially in the fish and sea food department but the flavours are bland and the food is heavy. I felt terribly acidic the whole night after having dinner there a few days ago."}
{"text":"We read about the restaurant in Toronto Life.  The ambience is great!  The place was full which gave it a good vibe.  Our waiter George was on point.  The dishes were good.  Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Nice place, good vibe. Bathrooms are not the cleanest. 
Food is good but pricey. Service was fine. 
Had the fried onions as appetizers which were on point! Hyderabadi lamb shank was well done as well. Naan on the expensive side. Rice doesn't come with the dish and has to be ordered separately. Would visit again. Nice ambience."}
{"text":"Fine Indian food, but nothing special, and to compete with Indian cuisine I feel you need to do something ... Different. The place was packed. I know half of Etobicoke loves this place. But does half of Scarborough? Mississauga? Gerrard Street? Fine tasting. But special not so much.  Flavors were strong but almost overpowering -- rather than having the subtleties of spices come through, it was just hot. And intensely hot. The meat was tender but not flavor infused ... It was just meat that could have been marinated better, deeper. The prices were high -- around $80 with tax for four entrees. And while the cost of doing business is known and operating a restaurant isn't cheap, something needs to set this place apart. Bigger portions?  A side of naan?  Hmm."}
{"text":"What we ate:

- onion bhaji 
- chicken pakora 
- hara chicken tikka 
- saag paneer 
- lamb biryani 
- butter chicken 
- naan 
- rasmalai 
- kulfi 
- masala chai

Great food with authentic Indian flavors. Perfect amount of spice in the dishes, so those who prefer milder flavors needn't shy away from Tich. Special shout out to the saag paneer, which was probably the best I've ever had. If I had to skip something, would probably be the pakora. You should not skip dessert here - if you want just a little something, get the rasmalai. Solid service."}
{"text":"Amazing. Classic Dak Bungalow chicken. Fine service and remarkably good chai. I could make a habit of this place."}
{"text":"Went last night and even though it was very busy the food came out at a reasonable speed and was cooked well.  We had the lamb chops, hara mirch tikka and Lasun pakora for appetizers.  The lamb chops were very moist, which I find quite rare at Indian restaurants.  Normally they're over cooked.  The chicken tikka was very flavourful but I would probably pass on the pakora next time.
For mains we had the butter chicken (not bad but have had better), lamb bhuna (excellent), madras chicken (excellent), Hyderbadi eggplant( not bad), bhukara daal(excellent).  Portions were decent and flavours were good.  The Tich mule and Tich smash drinks were refreshing and something to try.
Decor was nice and if I was in the area again I would return."}
{"text":"We were given a gift certificate to Tich so we made the trek out on a recent weekend evening. As we were going with our baby, I decided to make an early reservation, and was able to do so last minute on the same day that we went. There's no dedicated parking but you can park on the street right in front (paid) or on the small side streets. It looks like they have a little terrace in the summer too.

When we arrived around 5:30, there were only a few other tables occupied (including a family with a young child - always happy to see other kids when I go out to eat now haha), but it quickly filled up so I would recommend making a reservation. The decor is really nice inside - I would describe it as slightly upscale casual (there's no tablecloths or fancy dinnerware). They seem to do a lot of takeout business. Even though we were seated near the door on a windy evening, it wasn't cold at all because they have a double set of doors, something I'd never considered before but appreciated here. I loved that they left a carafe of water on the table for us to pour ourselves as needed.

We ordered a small assortment of dishes, some favourites, some new. The lamb biryani was really tasty - good amount of meat (though it doesn't look that way at first glance), and it came with a small side of raita which was appreciated since it was actually a bit spicy like we'd asked for. The butter chicken was good as well, chicken tender and not dried out, though not spicy at all (we asked for spicy), and a touch underseasoned. They didn't have a paneer dish that we usually like to order so we got the saag paneer instead. I usually don't like it too much because often the spinach is overwhelming, but it wasn't in this dish, and the flavour of warm spices was actually really nice (nutmeg? cinnamon? cloves? that kind of spice). The Malabar lobster and prawn curry was interesting, unlike anything I've had before. You get two lobster tails and two pieces of prawn in a creamy coconut-based curry. The sauce is just fantastic to be sopped up with naan. One of our lobster pieces was actually missing the tail meat but they were quick to replace that without any issue. Unfortunately, the lobster was a touch undercooked, though I would rather it be undercooked than overcooked. The naan wasn't bad; wasn't as soft as I would have liked it, but still tasted authentic. 

A complaint that others have already mentioned is that the portions are very small for the price. As I mentioned, it's not a fancy restaurant - for example, the food isn't plated and arrives in underwhelming plain bowls. The food overall is good but not great, and combined with the price, I don't think I would have been satisfied with my meal if I didn't have a gift certificate. That being said, the service was excellent. Our waiter (and others helping him out) were very friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. They were also very accommodating towards my baby - they had a high chair ready for me, and welcomed her into the restaurant. I also didn't have any issues waiting a long time for our food to arrive, as others have mentioned, but that might have a been a product of dining so early. Oh, they accept Visa as a form of payment."}
{"text":"Flavour was there and the staff were awesome. Being white I ordered the lamb vindaloo and got immediate red flags. Waiter and I had a great laugh reassuring him I was fine. It was delicious. 

Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I like Tich. It's my go to Indian restaurant. I like the setting and service there. The food is delicious. Make sure you call and make a reservation as the place gets booked fast."}
{"text":"If there's one place you'd go while in Toronto for some great Indian food, let it be Tich. The food is prepared with extensive attention-to-detail. The drinks are exquisite. Don't miss out on the Lamb Chops. The staff is very welcoming and the service is warm!"}
{"text":"Great service and authentic food- the lamb  vindaloo never dissapoints and naan is on point"}
{"text":"The whole dining experience was tainted by horrible service. I came here on a Wednesday night and it took an hour and a half to get my food. The couple beside me ordered at the same time as us, and they had finished eating and paid for their food by the time we received our 2 appetizers. Just ridiculous. 

Between the horrible service, unjustified price and slightly better than mediocre food, I would never go here again."}
{"text":"My partner and I were excited to return to Tich, having had a memorable experience there shortly after it opened. While the food was good, we were quite disappointed with the service - we were brusquely greeted upon arrival and waited a good 20 minutes before our order was taken. When we each asked for a glass of their house wine, we were strongly encouraged to go with something more \"suitable for the food\", ie more expensive. The recommended wine was no better than the house offering, which I ordered for my second glass, more out of curiosity than anything else. 

The quality of the food is unquestionably good, but the service and blatant attempt to upsell us on the wine was disappointing."}
{"text":"Through jaded eyes. For sure another Toronto Indian revelation only to be a recapitulation of tired 3 day old has been. For Sure!    
           Wrong ,Bob
  Fresher cleaner intelligent spicing overall.MalabarSeafooD a little mild  not quite insipid .Biryani (veg ) very good.Vindaloo ( Portugese provenance ) eschewed, oft killed wi heat vinegar oft undetectable and Palm vinegar not widely available. Tandoor oven on premises excellent paneer( beyond commercial rubber),skewer and bread.
Pleasant competent service in serviceable venue Suck some Kulfi ( heavily rose watered)."}
{"text":"This was the second best Indian food I've had in my life (after Akbar's in the UK, if you're wondering).  The tandoori platter is not to be missed, although it is nearly a meal for two.  Everything else we had was also top notch.  I'll certainly be back to see what else is good."}
{"text":"Delicious! Doing it for the second time tonight and can't wait.

Building my hunger for some biryani!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and very good service. Highly recommend the tandoori sea beam and butter chicken!"}
{"text":"We are so lucky to live across the street! Found this gem on Yelp on a snow day :) 

Yellow Dal -- Delicious
Butter Chicken -- Delicious
Squash -- Delicious

Will definitely be our favorite place in this neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Have to say there are many other Indian fusion places that do Indian food better. The quality of the food seems to be lacking a bit (e.g. Chicken tikka masala, the meat was dark meat, the fish curry, the salmon seemed a bit off) This place tries to be a downtown hipster joint in Etobicoke. I think this place is trying to be a Vij's (Vancouver) but food quality has to increase if they ever want to get to that level."}
{"text":"Very similar to other reviews, good overall just pricy.

Pros:
+ tasty food
+ amazing service
+ decor is nice.

Cons:
- really expensive for what you get - $100 for 2 people after tax and tip.

Came here on a Wednesday night. we had reservations at 7:30, when we arrived the place was half full, when we left at 8:45 we were the last ones there.

Atmosphere:(5 stars)
Clean, spacious and modern look.  The tables are decently separated from one another so you do not get a claustrophobic feeling 

Service: (5+ stars)
The service is the best I had in recent memory.  We (and coincidentally the table next to us) thought the server was the owner.  He was super up beat, friendly, and actually trying to make our experience the best possible - not just serve us the food.

Food: (4 stars)
the food was tasty and well presented, Just a bit too expensive for what you get.  For example the mains come in a small bowl (rice and naan are extra) and cost $17.00.  With naan, it comes to $20.00 pre tax/tip for a basic meal.  

As you can see from the pictures, 1 appetizer, 2 mains (and 3 naans) with 2 beers was 100 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"Side plates were taken after we finished with appetizers and half of dirty cutlery was left on the table and half was placed on the napkins?!!!! Gross. 
Washrooms were dirty. I don't dine in establishments that don't take cleaningles seriously.
Not coming back."}
{"text":"Let's get the negatives out of the way early. The table layout of Tich is ridiculous. There is almost no room between tables which means servers are sticking their posteriors either in your face or your neighbours face much of the night. We actually had to walk sideways through the entire centre of the resto to leave after paying our bill.

Appetizers were brilliant, certainly vastly superior to any Indian Restaurant we have ever visited. The perfectly toasted nan was so good we could still be there happily consuming it. Main courses were more typical of a good to very good spot.

We will be back but only if we get one of those few properly placed tables."}
{"text":"For Indian food, this place does good things. The dishes are definitely a step above the buffet joints and closer in quality to what a standard Indian restaurant should be like.

My only real qualms with the place is the price-point to value ratio. Location, interior, food and quality doesn't seem to justify the prices. They're competing in the same space as Pukka in Toronto or Vij's in Vancouver, but they don't come close. 

It seems almost as if they're successful in bringing higher quality food to Toronto, but are a little carried away offering it at the same price point as higher end refined Indian food. 

They just need to turn it down a notch and they'll have the right formula. It is undeniably tasty food."}
{"text":"Very good food. Make sure you make reservations. Good options for vegetarians. The portions are decent. The fish and shrimp both are excellent."}
{"text":"Amazing service, above average food. Boyfriend and I didn't feel like cooking on a Sunday night, and since we were feeling adventurous, we settled on Tich. 

The restaurant is small, with minimalist but welcoming decor. Our server was extremely helpful. We told him it was our first visit, and he proceeded to walk us through the highlights of the menu. I ordered off the prix fixe menu, while boyfriend opted for just a main with rice and naan. 

The food was good, but didn't blow me away. The chicken tikka app was so-so. For mains,  I had the lamb shank and boyfriend had the Madras chicken curry. The sauces were very rich and delicious. However, while both the chicken and lamb were tender, they were quite bland, with little of the spiciness and flavors from the sauces penetrating into the meat. The kulfi dessert was excellent. 

Will likely return!"}
{"text":"The onion bhaji &  lamb chops appetizer I ate @ Tich last night made me realize that these guys are different level.   I don't eat Indian food alot,  but when I do it will be at Tich.   Service matches the food.   

Pro Tip -  this is a great neighborhood,  most likely post dinner you will be stuffed and happy.   Do yourself a favor,  leave your car at Tich and go for a post dinner stroll down the Lakeshore path and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Mostly style but not a lot of substance. The chicken appetizer was good but that's about it. The chicken tikka masala and the paneer lababdar entrees didn't pack as much of a flavor punch as one would expect. Naan and rice was good but the two main entrees were a bit disappointing. Maybe I should've asked for spicy food to amp up the flavours. Overall, ambience is great and the food was okay. Nothing spectacular but not bad either."}
{"text":"We loved discovering this modern Indian restaurant in the Mimico area. The interior was clean and modern, the food was delicious - hearty and filling. We ordered the Chicken Pakoras (lightly dusted & fried chicken morsels), Paneer Lababdar (my favourite - the tomato cream sauce was delicious), and Lamb Korma (the lamb is quite tender). The Garlic Naan bread was one of my favourite things about this meal - warm, moist and so flavourful. We got 2 orders between the two of us along with rice, but 1 order of naan would have probably been enough. Prices are obviously higher than other Indian restaurants, but you pay for the service & modern atmosphere. My one complaint was the mango lassi - it was horrible. It was so thick that I was barely able to get it up the straw and way too sour. The worst lassi I've had."}
{"text":"The menu was quite good - many interesting and well described options, but not so long as to lose focus.

I believe the prices have gone up, but all the dishes that we (party of four) ordered were very good so the cost is acceptable.

But the place was incredibly noisy - enough to really ruin the experience.  Normally I would say that the food is the most important thing at a restaurant but being unable to communicate without yelling made me reconsider that.  They need to do something about the acoustics of this small restaurant!

Also, their menu encourages patrons to go to their website to leave feedback, so I went to do that - to mention the noise levels - and found that I need to give my e-mail address and phone number to leave feedback.  If they really cared about getting feedback they would make these optional, so I came and wrote this review instead."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food and service. Absolutely love this place! Very authentic taste, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I would never go here again. Not because the food is bad, but because the service is horrible for its price point. If this was a strict takeout joint, I would completely understand, but it's not, so I can't. 

Food: 

Orded the lamb, paneer, and eggplant. Lamb was tasty, eggplant was very creamy, however the paneer was under seasoned and slightly bland. They have a sweet/savoury virgin drink that is however EXTREMELY tasty with a slight peppery finish, absolutely amazing. You need to try this.  

Service: 

First time goers, and no one told us of any specials, things to recommend, pretty much, \"here is the menu\". We ordered the 3 dishes, and it took them roughly 1:10 hr to come out, and only when asked. The paneer dish was the wrong one, and when we pointed it out, no apology or recognition, just vanished like a leprechaun at the end of the rainbow. Funny thing is that she came out with the right dish in 10 minutes. Wait! So if you could make the right one in 10 minutes, why did it take you 70 minutes to make the first dish?!!

That's fine, sometimes it can be a busy night, things happen. However what happened next is inexcusable, when you wait 70 minutes for food, and 20 minutes after you eat, and JUST put down the fork, the waiter asks if you are done, that is too much. I actually wanted to ask for possibly more naan but declined. I asked politely if there was another table after us because totally understand if there is another reso booked, however there was none. 

I was so frustrated I left the food on the table, and went to McDonalds to get 2 Egg McMuffins.

It would have been great to give feedback in person, however Tich is NOGAS...\"no one gives a.....service\". Good food, service is lacking."}
{"text":"Food was good. We ordered the onion appetizer. Forgot the name now. For mains it was the lamb korma and butter chicken. Butter chicken was decent but not as sweet as I am used to. The lamb korma was spicy and delicious. Probably one of the best I have had. Price wasnt bad. Nice atmosphere. Service will need to improve. The younger waitresses seem lost and the main waiter was too busy. We waited for a bit to order food. But they redeemed themself at the end with more frequent checking in on us. I would go back to try other dishes."}
