{"text":"I've been going to Park Road for six years now and feel comfortable saying its probably the best sports bar in the eastern half of Lake County.  They have a nice patio outside, pool tables, keno, etc. inside.  It can get very crowded at night and the service may be slow.  Pretty good selection of beer on draft or in the bottle, although the food is only average (pizza is a little better, though.)  Prices are great, and there is usually an interesting crowd.  I recommend it."}
{"text":"Bartenders are the worst!!! I moved just up the street and was excited to have a neighborhood bar to fancy.  My girlfriend was seemingly viewed as competition and passed over for 20 minutes at the bar on our first night.  Being an optimist, I chalked it up to a bad night. The next night we returned, we were served much sooner but this time the bartender added extra drinks to my bill.

So after deciding to not sit at the bar, we sat in the dining area.  Again, another disappointing experience. The food took almost 45 minutes. I had to stop the server and request another cocktail, which was also poorly made and served in 25 minute intervals. 

The establishment itself has great potential but the owners need to reevaluate the current order of service and management.  I will gladly take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Have been here several times for the steak special.  NEVER dissapoints! Mary, bartender/server only adds to my coming back for more. She is so professional and friendly, you feel like you are at home! .thank you Mary and Park Road!"}
{"text":"My friend,l daughter and I decided to go to Park Grill for wing night last night. What a complete waste of time. Grabbed a seat, sat there for 15 minutes without a hello, menu or acknowledgement of our existence. Left and went to Panini's and got great service and food. Won't be going to park grill again. Live just down the street and the food is ok, but not great. The service has always been slow, but this was just beyond poor customer service because they saw us, but chose to ignore us. So I guess I will return the favor.
 This was my last review about 3 years ago, but perhaps I'm a sucker for punishment because my friend and I decided to give it another go. I was hoping that in those 3years perhaps they have improved their service. Not so much. We ordered a lemon water and coffee. 20 minutes later our waitress brought it to the table. At that time we both ordered the steak salad. 30 minutes later we were served our salads. They had very little steak and was basically just head lettuce. Not great. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today, to try somewhere new outside of downtown Painesville. The waitress/bartender greeted us at the door and told us to grab a table anywhere. After 15mins of waiting we went and grab some menus that were in a holder by the door, then another 10mins passed no one came over to the table.  My mom got up and stood at the end of the bar to try and grab someone attention and the waitress/bartender and some other guy behind the bar didn't even look over at her. If you feel like trying this place out don't bother. They have one person staffed for the whole place and with a bar full of guys the waitress doesn't have time for anyone else. Plus menu is nothing special"}
{"text":"Great Food!Greta Service!Great everything! I am not being bias because I now the owners son."}
{"text":"Awful Awful Awful! I went in for Wednesday wing night as I've been doing for 8 years. I have been a regular at this bar and my father was an every day customer. I love most of the employees but the experience they gave me and my friends this last time was horrible. The bartender (Cher) knew me, but carded both of my friends (32&22) which was fine until she took both of the IDs over to another bartender and her husband (who sits at the bar during her shifts) and asked opinions about my friends legitimate IDs. She then told my 32 year old friend that she needed to see another form of ID because his picture \"obviously didn't look like him.\" I love the guy but he's got grey hair! Ive been drinking from every single one of these bartenders since age 18 with no issues. For them to put me and my friends through that after all the business I've given them is gross! I will never go there again for drinks or food. Neither will anyone in my family. I didn't even have wings that night because the service (at the bar) was that horrible. I cashed out and didn't even leave a tip. I'm not an awful person but I felt the need to download Yelp the app to stress resentment for this experience.

{"text":"We have been here a few times and the food is average but the prices are right if you want to grab a quick dinner and beer. The service is ok. Once they forgot to put our appetizer s in and my dad had to send his food back because it was cold. They do have keno so we like to eat and play while we are there. Overall not bad."}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for about 5 years now and never set foot in this place. Partly because I was very discouraged by the pizza place (Glenda's) next door. Their delivery was very lacking to say the least, but that's another review. I guess I need not be so judgey. 

The bar area is good sized, with every seat filled at 4:30 on a Wednesday evening. Lots of big screen TVs to watch assorted sports games on. The decor consisted of some wacky taxidermy critters, large fishtanks and framed sports jerseys. They have great 75 cent wings on Wednesdays. And I've always wondered what the heck the big draw of this place was. Welp, it's the fact that they have 24 taps of wonderful beer goodness. There's a happy hour that goes from 11:00 am - 7:00 pm Monday through Friday. It's family friendly with a dining room concealed by a well thought divider.  The place was well insulated and cozy, didn't hardly notice the trains passing right outside.

And if you dig drinking and gambling, no problem. They've got you covered with an array of Keno and lottery games on the back wall by the restrooms. And they have a nice jukebox. There's also a sheltered smoking area attached to the back of the building, if you're on the cigarettes terrible. 

The service was friendly and prompt as possible with a packed house. I ordered a shorty local IPA on tap and an order of nachos and a coke. My bill wasn't even $13. Their saying is \"everyone stops here\". I get it now, Park Road Bar n grill. Well played. I can mesh with the locals just fine."}
{"text":"Great food! and good service. Like 10 or so beers on tap. Bar side and dining part for the family are separate. Outside patio but filled with smokers. It's just your typical bar food but it's a lot better than most places."}
{"text":"This place was great when I went as part of a bar crawl. The bartender was extremely friendly and gave me a few things that made it easier to organize and keep everyone drinking. The drinks were cheap and no one seemed annoyed by us (which was really saying something). I didn't have a chance to eat, but I would check it out in the future."}
{"text":"I have been there twice and the buffalo chicken pizza is amazing and my second time I went there I ordered the Reuben and I don't know what they did to the meat, but the seasoning was delicious and it was so good. The drinks are reasonably priced and the bartenders are heavy handed when it comes to mixed drinks! Super Heavy Handed. After two cocktails, I was tipsy. I always love the waitstaff because of their personality and the DJ is great! What they should do though is add a Karaoke night! Seriously! Would be amazing!"}
{"text":"Very busy - the locals know where the good food is.  Our 15 minute wait turned out to be 25 minutes if not more.

Got seated, ordered, French onion soup came out - we had 4 bites each and the hamburgers were served.  EXCELLENT FOOD.  Very tasty. 

I would have liked a few more minutes with the soup before the main meal was served.  

Ordered pizza's to go when we ordered our meals.  Waited 20 more minutes after paying the check for the pies to finish cooking.  We told the waiter to get them cooking about half way through our meal.  

By 10:30 pm we were done and the place was clearing out.  Everyone was eating $16.99 half pound of crab legs and they smelled good.

We had French Onion Soup, Mushroom Swiss Hamburgers with Fries.  Waiter did not ask how we wanted our burgers cooked - they were medium and were good.

Meal plus one X-large seafood pizza, a large meat pizza and a large cheese pizza with pineapple and mushrooms - $80.00 - after tip we left for $92 dollars and change.

THE PIZZA IS AWESOME.  Good crust and toppings - very soft and great the next morning after sitting out all night.  Seafood pizza, X-Large was $13.99 - the two large started at $12.99 with the toppings extra.

There was a man in front of us that said his party of 12 got split up - 7 were eating and the rest were still waiting for a table and had been for over an hour.  Not set up for big parties - a few tables together - smaller place all around for the crowd they had.  

Two pool tables and an outdoor patio which was where the smokers were at - smoking.  You could not have eaten out there last night - too cold for sure... but all the smoke.  

If I owned the place - the outdoor patio would be gone and the new \"dining/party\" room would be there.  THE PLACE WAS PACKED.

Parking is a gravel driveway and parking area... full of pot-holes and mud with the melting snow...  what a mess!!!!  No outside lighting and I could not see where I was walking or in what.  Stepped into a few holes - you could jar your back doing that."}
{"text":"Pretty good bar. Nice patio, good food, decent prices. If you come on wing night... Don't expect great service though, they get REALLY busy! Nice place to watch a sports game and eat some good bar food and grab some drinks. I come here pretty frequently."}
{"text":"Ordered steak salad with double steak, when I got it home it was only single steak if that. To tired to go back and it takes too long. Since Glenda passed the good has gone down"}
{"text":"Absolute worst bartenders I've ever dealt with. Only waited on regulars and were openly nasty and pouring short when they did wait on us. For a Friday night you'd think they would be properly staffed? We won't be back."}
{"text":"Not impressed today. The waitress forgot to put our order in and then gave us some excuse about saying the printer ran out of ink and that's why order got forgotten. But I didn't believe her because she came over and asked us what we ordered if the printer ran out of ink order should still be in the system.  We were totally nice and understanding about that, but then even after they realize they hadn't done our order we waited another 20 minutes to get our food. They didn't even rush it once they realize they made a mistake. By the time we got our food we didn't have time to eat it we had to leave. And she was in no hurry to bring us boxes or The bill. I understand when you're busy but you need to be thoughtful, if you mess up an order you need to at least rush having it redone. Very bad experience."}
{"text":"Great price on food , great food , great atmosphere . Sports bar and keno if ya all like to bet money."}
