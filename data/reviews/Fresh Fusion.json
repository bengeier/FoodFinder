{"text":"Is it possible to vote a negative star? This was absolutely disgusting. Food was delivered.. dressing was missing, maybe 5-6 pieces of shrimp the size of a finger nail, less than a quarter worth of avocado, and the tomatoes were soggy... and then you charge me what.. $10 for that?  tossed it in the garbage within seconds of opening it. save yourself the time AND MONEY and don't eat from here.."}
{"text":"Outstanding. You *do* make friends with salad.  A great lunch option for less than $10, which is so worth my while. Imagining myself labour over lettuce chopping, messy tomato pulverizing, and the fact that there's never anything good to put on top makes Fresh Fusion an incredibly smart and tasty lunch choice."}
{"text":"Sorry, but I have given this place many chances! Used to get the Santa Fe salad and they have since taken it off the menu. Got a shrimp salad with avocados instead. The guy making it was so rude...threw some stuff down and chopped it up. The owner actually held the salad up to see if it had shrimp and avocados in it and then gave it to me. I took it back to my office and it had two small shrimp and a quarter of a piece of avocado in it! For over $10 I expected more. I just feel that the owner and most of the staff have lost interest in pleasing customers. Guess what, they have lost one more!"}
{"text":"A colleague told me about Fresh Fusion about 5 or 6 years ago, and I've been coming here ever since.  I've been through just about every item on their menu, and I find myself returning to the Pesto Chicken Wrap and Chicken Caesar Salad.  Food is always fresh and done right in front of you.  My only issue is that their salad portions seem to have shrunk in recent years.  The flow of the restaurant can be a bit awkward, especially during the lunch rush, so I would encourage people to order over the phone and pick it up.  I find it strange that people have experienced such displeasure with their food or service when I haven't had a poor experience in all the years of my patronage.  To those who left a poor review, I implore you to give them another try.  You might find your second experience to be a better one!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Sante Fe salad from here. I forgot to ask for the dressing on the side, but it seemed okay all mixed in. It wasn't too soggy as restaurants usually make it when they mix the dressing into it.  All the ingredients were very fresh (hence the name FRESH fusion :P), all well seasoned, nicely presented and exploding with flavour. It was a pretty big salad, so I had half of it for lunch and the rest for dinner.  I thoroughly enjoyed it. I used the 10% off coupon, but it was still quite pricey ($9). I would love it if they could post their prices on their website! But all in all, I'd hit it again."}
{"text":"One word......metro steak and cheese pannini.  I don't mess with anything else because I'm hooked.   A little on the pricey side though"}
{"text":"Not so fresh or delicious, I love salads and was looking for a spot for a fresh and tasty salad. Their menu was not exciting but I picked one of their salads anyways. I added chicken to my salad which did not taste like it was cooked properly and the salad itself was extremely lackluster. I ended up throwing out my salad and will not be going back."}
{"text":"So the food is good no complaints BUT i find it a taaaaad over priced for salads and you walk out smelling like food....not in a good way"}
{"text":"Veggie are fresh and crunchy.  Their burrito is great.  But sour cream turned the wrap socky for my take-out, 15 mins away"}
{"text":"Time was 12:10pm. Hungry. I sometimes work in the area so was walking by and noticed this place. Thought it looked interesting so popped in for a burrito. Mistake! From the minute I walked in it felt wrong. I was rushed in the prep of my burrito. The woman was slapping stuff in. Not sure if she realized she was 'handling' someone's lunch.  The place is loud, like a warehouse. They need some sound damping as you can't hear your food 'handler' and have to ask them to repeat. This seemed to piss-off my food 'handler'. Not my fault - bad store layout.  The cashier was another story, I felt like I was inconveniencing him by asking him to cash me out. He still hasn't greeted me or told me how much I owe him.  Customer service SUCKS. Food was adequate. Will not return. Lots of other places to eat in this mall.   Good luck on your visit."}
{"text":"My new favourite lunch place. Fresh greens? Check. Super yummy toppings like  grilled portobello mushrooms and sauteed peppers and onions? Check. What? I can add crunchy stuff like slivered almonds and edamame? I am sold. Yum, yum."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good salad place to go for lunch and stumbled upon this one. I've been twice, the first time I got the Cobb Salad - wasn't a fan and the second time I went I got the Santa Fe salad which was better than the Cobb but still not worth it for the price. However my friend got a panini and said it was really good so maybe it's better for sandwiches than salads."}
