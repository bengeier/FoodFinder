Thoroughly recommend for a chill Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"J'ai découvert cette merveille dans le cadre de l'événement Montréal à Table. 
L'ambiance et le décor sont agréables. Le décor rustique épuré et le menu créatif nous transportent dans un environnement unique.

Les plats - présentés avec finesse - sont plus délicieux les uns que les autres. 
J'y retournerai définitivement."}
{"text":"Location: in the heart of mile end. Restos, coffeeshop, bakeries and ice cream shops all around. 

Service: friendly, helpful, quick and enthusiastic. 

Decor: wildlife feeling

Food: very delicious! As an entree I had shark tartare. It was Flavorful.  As my main dish, I had steak with chimichuri sauce on the side garden salad and fries... it was perfectly cooked... it was one of the best steak I had.

Conclusion: recommended!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out for oystermania, drink was a white whine not bad little small the amount but I wasn't expecting much more. The oysters themselves weren't up to my standards the person who shucked them didn't do a good job and took out all the juices that's the best part! They however replaced it with some sort of red mustard seed it did look pretty but taste wise not the best.

appetizers weren't anything to rave about presentation was 5 on 5 stars it looked so beautiful but when it came down to the taste it wasn't there. the brioche they served was not what you would eat with the foie gras. it was soft and falling apart and no taste. foie gras was missing something as well couldn't put my finger on it. the meat platter wasn't bad but it wasn't something I would order again.

the boar was fantastic who ever created this plate picked the best combination of vegetables everything went together really well. the burger was good but way to much onions and apricot for my liking it was taking away from the meat. french fries were good.

I liked the décor inside had a really warm feeling with all the wood around and very cozy seating the lighting was a great ambiance as well. I give them 3 stars for food but 4 stars for the actual night."}
{"text":"Très bon resto, très belle déco, très bon service, bref, ce nouveau resto, encore méconnu, et bien situé dans le Mile End, est à essayer sans plus tarder!! =)"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant during MTL a Table and I have to say, I'm a big fan of the decor! It feels like a cosy log cabin, which is perfect for cold November evenings. 

Their cocktails are original (and have the best names), but there's unfortunately not a very extensive choice of beer. I found it odd that a restaurant priding itself on featuring Quebec delicacies would not have more local microbrewery beers on the menu (especially considering Dieu du Ciel is not far away).
Seal tataki was cooked perfectly (just raw enough), but poorly seasoned and poorly trimmed. I had a huge slice of 100% seal fat. In contrast, the trout was very good; loved the multicolored veggies accompanying it, it was simple and efficient! 
The brownie was (of course) to die for, a perfect way to finish the meal. However, I think the best surprise was the nougat! I could've ordered a second one, it was delicious! 

Good choice for a casual night!"}
{"text":"We had a great visit to this restaurant during Mtl a Table! The restaurant decor is very cozy - you feel like you are in a posh wood cabin! It was a cold night but the double doors kept us warm, despite being right near the entrance.

All of the dishes were very tasty. My husband had the seal tataki appetizer, which was definitely a first! The trout was cooked perfectly, with a delicious maple-beer glaze. The brownie was very decadent, but I found the nougat dessert to have too many nuts.

There was a beer/wine pairing that was available, but it did not seem like a good deal relative to the normal pint prices.

Service was great. The server was patient as we practiced our French but was sure to clarify things when she knew we did not understand. Great choice!"}
{"text":"Bon rapport qualité prix 
Ambiance agréable et calme

{"text":"Excellent restaurant where we discover all kinds of new ingredients! Rotating seasonal menu, good wine list, and good atmosphere. The have chalk in the washrooms so you can leave graffiti on the walls for other people. Never had a bad meal here, always excellent. 10/10"}
{"text":"Nous avons été très bien accueilli lors de notre dîner entre amis. 

Nous y sommes aller pour manger des huîtres dans le cadre de oystermania.

10$ la douzaine d'huîtres avec un verre alcoolisé ça ne se refuse pas ;-).

Les huîtres étaient belles et goûteuses. 2 sauces accompagnaient celles-ci l'une à l'aspect granité et l'autre à base de mangue.

La serveuse a été super !

Gourmande comme je suis, j'ai quand même regardé la carte par curiosité et ce qu'il propose avait l'air vraiment bon. Cependant rien en dessous d'une vingtaine de dollars et allant jusqu'à 45. 

Si vous voulez passer une bonne soirée dans une ambiance tamisé et n'avez pas peur de mettre la main dans le porte-monnaie, je recommande !"}
{"text":"The Pumpkin soup was very tasty.  We also had the baked camembert,  the lamb Burger and the risotto.  The risotto wad a bit too creamy for my taste but still good! I recommend the lamb Burger!"}
{"text":"Great location......great service......nice restaurant........maybe brunch isn't their thing. This is an area with some of the best brunch places in the city, Sparrow, Lawrence, Larry's, etc. all within a few short blocks of each other on St-Laurent. If you're going to open for brunch you need to step up your game and make it amazing. There were only 2 other diners in the restaurant with us but all the other places were packed with people standing in line. The food here was very average, that being said I've heard very good things about their dinners. I had the 'Caribou Breakfast', which looked incredible when it got to the table and had several different items on the plate, but each item was mediocre at best and nothing really stood out for the $19 price tag. The mini sugar-cinnamon donuts with chocolate dipping sauce were good. Overall, I'd like to go back there and try dinner but brunch has too many other great places across the city."}
{"text":"When a Groupon came up I figured I would bother with the trek as I am rarely in the area. Double dated with my roommate and I have got to say, I was actually embarrassed to have brought them here for our celebratory meal. The \"discount\" was paying $100 instead of $200 for a \"4 course\" meal for 4 people but if we had actually paid $50 +tax/tip/drinks per person we would have been beyond annoyed at the lack of bang-for-your-buck.

The service was fine. The waitress could spout off the menu details like no ones business and was very informative and friendly, however her flow of service was lacking. It took nearly 3 hours for this entire meal to go down. We were often sitting quite a bit between courses, had to flag our server a few times and sat with our empty dessert trays far too long while trying to get our bill (we were the last table of the night no less!).

The food itself was discouraging. The foie gras option was removed from our menu, seems as though they have since decided that it comes at an extra charge. The brie appetizer was the high point of the meal but that should be a slam dunk considering it was just a baked wheel of brie purchased elsewhere so all they had to do was warm it up and top it with bacon and apple slices. The \"Sorbet\" was cranberry seeds in liquid (not frozen) which pretty much resulted in us all having a shitty tarty \"martini\". The butcher's piece of the day was bavette with blue cheese so my hopes were high. The cut itself had great potential, but was flavorless and one of the two was delivered charred while still being under-cooked. The fries were so poorly made that they were in big clumps and the blue cheese sauce was overly flavorful while still being watery and colorless which left me hesitating to think if it was home made or chemicals from a bottle. The brownies were hard and dry which anyone plating it should have noticed, and would have required far more than the bottle cap sized scoop of ice cream to salvage it. Overall, we would have been better staying home and popping in a frozen pizza, it's to that point that the meal didn't serve a value. Trekking from Lachine for this meal had me feeling pretty stupid.

Honestly, had it not been for the brie, the meal would have been a complete write off. I hope that one day I'll be in the area during brunch hours because it seems like that might be their forte. Yelp food photos definitely hyped this place up. I would definitely suggest skipping this place for supper. Menu looked great but was a total let down."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés pour le brunch et c'était super bon! J'ai pris l'assiette de bénédictine avec le porc effiloché, MIAM! Attention, les assiettes sont vraiment très généreuses, donc ne commandez pas 12 repas! Sinon, mon amie a pris la gaufre qui était, elle aussi très bonne! Les jus sont faits sur place, donc goûte le ciel et le café est toujours très bon :) 

Je recommande! Pour le prix, ça vaut tellement la peine :) Très heureuse de ma découverte!"}
{"text":"Brought in by the oyster festival with the offer of a dozen oysters and a glass of wine for a $10. Stayed for the best Scottish style black pudding north of the St Andrew's Society Robbie Burns Dinner as well as a taste of foi gras. Could not have been happier with he food or the service.

I will return when next in this great city."}
{"text":"Menu original : des aliments du Québec (gibiers, poissons et autres) cuisinés finement et de façon... gourmande ! Il y a quelques options végétariennes, ce qui est apprécié. 
Le service a été excellent. 
Nous avons passé une excellente soirée. Ce n'est pas ma première fois ici et ce ne sera clairement pas la dernière fois. 
Le brunch y est aussi excellent !"}
{"text":"C'est bon quand c'est long ... Super bon brunch mais le service est très très lent. On était une grosse table mais on a eu nos assiettes presque une heure après notre arrivée. Par contre, ça valait le coup d'attendre, c'était bon ! Ils m'ont même fait un chaï latte réussi alors qu'il n'est pas à la carte."}
{"text":"Very disappointing service over the phone that doesn't give me the push to visit them in person. 

I called at 8:59PM to see if I could go grab a few bites and asked what time they closed. They said 10PM and then I asked if I could pass by quick but said that they weren't taking tables after 9PM...

I guess it doesn't close at 10PM, it just does at 9PM. So next time, stick to 9PM and don't get people's hopes too high. It's always better to over deliver. 

Maybe one day I'll visit but not for a while."}
{"text":"Localisé dans le Mile-End, restaurant autant pour le lunch, brunch (samedi & dimanche) ou le soir, style rustique (mur en rondins de bois) / moderne. Ma copine et moi avons brunchés ici un samedi matin,  mes pancakes à l'avoine (11$) étaient super bonnes + belle présentation, prix très abordable, rapport qualité/prix, ma copine avait pris le boudin noir (14$) aussi bon, café filtre à volonté (2$),  bon service du serveur. Si vous voulez bruncher dans le Mile-End sans les \"line-up\" des autres restaurants populaires du coin, c'est une belle petite place et bouffe abordable. 

4/5 visité en janvier 2017"}
{"text":"UN EXCELLENT MOMENT !

Pour la fête de mon copain, on a décidé de souper au Caribou gourmand un jeudi soir, j'ai réservé par téléphone la journée même. 

Une fois arrivée, j'ai été étonné par la beauté de ce petit restaurant, les rondins de bois apportent de la chaleur à la place alors qu'il n'y avait pas beaucoup de monde ! La serveuse nous a tellement bien accueilli ! 

La serveuse nous a expliqué tellement bien les plats, bref je pense que je n'ai jamais eu une serveuse aussi gentille et patiente ! On a choisi un plat de charcuterie, les moules à volonté et deux cocktails. 

Tout était PARFAIT ! Tout est fait maison et on ressentait vraiment la différence ! Ce restaurant devrait avoir plus de clients ! Alors je vous le recommande vraiment, parfait pour une date ou un souper en famille !"}
{"text":"Cette place est franchement décevante et pleine de prétention comme pour la grande majorité des restos dans le mile-end, des grosses belles coquilles vides. La nourriture est fade et sans goût pour un prix exorbitant."}
