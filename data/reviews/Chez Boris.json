{"text":"I was introduced to Chez Boris by my friend and I'm glad he did because it's one of the top cafes on my list. Great ambiance and space with delicious coffee and tasty snacks. Crowded on a weekend morning/afternoon but if you're willing to wait a bit it may be worth it. It's calmer on a week day afternoon/evening which makes for an excellent study/work place. 

Wifi is unlocked and reliable and the music blends in with the environment. Take a book, leave a book, walk in, check it out, order to go or sit for a while."}
{"text":"Un seul mot: DÉ-LI-CIEUX. Ces petits beignets sont vraiment incroyables, et oui, ils sont préparés à la commande. Il faut surtout les manger frais comme ça. Leurs saveurs sont toutes parfaites avec la pâte chaude et fondue. Et le prix ne pourrait pas être mieux - environ 6$ pour une douzaine, c'est excellent. Chez Boris est vraiment un endroit à essayer si vous avez un \"dent sucrée\" ... comme moi!"}
{"text":"I was just walking on the street when I saw this place. The name sounded pretty cool, so I decided to stop by. And I do not regret this, the staff is incredibly cool and the doughnuts are great. It's a great place to spend time in. You should totally go there."}
{"text":"You should really go try their donuts if you haven't already. They also have donut sandwiches that are quite tasty as well. Chez Boris has pretty good service and great coffee as well to go with your donuts. The cafe is usually full of people working on their laptops so it may be difficult to get a good seat. The hipster cafe is in a great neighbourhood of Montreal, so make sure to put this cafe on your to do list!"}
{"text":"I ordered a cup of black coffee and 4 beignets. The beignets were two and a half inches in diameter. They were generously coated with sugar, cinnamon and cloves. The coffee was as deep and dark as the Forêt de Compiègne on a moonless night. Simply delightful!"}
{"text":"Je trouve que cet endroit a une réputation surfaite ! Oui l'ambiance est cool, les beignes sont faites minutes et pas très chères (bien que par rapport à leur taille je m'interroge parfois). Par contre, le service est pas très sympa, très long et surtout l'endroit est très sale (de la cuisine pleine de gras au papier collé sur les tables imbibés de vieux cafés renversés), il y a une différence entre être cool et être sale !"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Friendly staff. Fresh warm Russian donuts... Need I say more? Check this place out, worth the experience. Also try the cidre chaud! Delicious! The soviétique is worth a try too :)"}
{"text":"Discovered this place after walking around the area.  Great cafe for beignets and hot chocolate from scratch! Atmosphere is very relaxing, server was helpful and friendly. If you find yourself in the Mile End...stop here for a pick-me-up."}
{"text":"Correcte"}
{"text":"J'aime ce café de quartier pour travailler... Le latté est bon et les beignes délicieux... Ils sont petits, donc n'hésitez pas à en commander plus qu'un..."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's still not overly crowded as some cafes are in the area. Nice atmosphere and staff. They have a small games collection for you to play with friends. Also, the arcade game thing there makes my life."}
{"text":"Just stopped in to try the donuts (beignets). All made to order and from the same dough with different sprinkled toppings: sugar, cinnamon-sugar or chocolate (cinnamon-sugar one had delightful hint of nutmeg). Very good. Only 2.65 for the three. Very friendly staff,helpful with our lack of French. Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"The cafe is very inviting, friendly and helpful counter attendant..however the donuts were disappointing.  They are supposed to be yeast donuts but they seemed to have an aftertaste, were more like fried bread and the jam filling was very watery.  Sorry but would not go back for donuts but would go back for the cosy feel of the cafe and perhaps a savory sandwich."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood meeting place. The coffee is excellent, and the environment is laid-back. The doughnuts are tasty and I really enjoy the dinner themes/events they do sometimes."}
{"text":"The breakfast donut sandwich with cheese, bacon, and egg is easily one of the best dishes I have ever eaten. All parts are perfectly cooked and the doughnuts are fantastic. The latte is also incredible. Great place for a cute, quick coffee and delicious donuts to go around. Easily one of my favorite, if not favorite, eatery in the city. Also, wonderful place for people watching and doing homework or both! Go here!!!"}
{"text":"We made a special stop on our way out of town for the phenomenal pork belly beignet sandwich on the advice of a foodie friend.  Wow.  The fresh fried dough complemented the tangy sweet sauce, green onions and hot flavorful pork to perfection!  

Better yet, the cappuccino was also expertly crafted.  For those interested in just a cup to dip fresh beignets into, it won't disappoint.  But seriously, go whole hog and get the pork belly sandwich.  

The setting of this eclectic hipster cafe includes friendly service, free wifi, and a sunny storefront.  The bathroom was clean.  

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Chez Boris for breakfast on Wednesday morning around 930. The barista suggested that we each take advantage of the free doughnuts they were offering. Apparently, they had a special going on that if you came in between 830 - 10, you got two free doughnuts for free. We tried the chocolate, cinnamon sugar and sugar. They were fresh and delicious. I also had the sovietique cafe. The coffee wasn't bad. My boyfriend got the breakfast sandwich. I finished the sandwich, and although not healthy, it was delicious. There is plenty of seating, plugs and wifi. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite cafes in Montreal. The coffee is a tad on the expensive side but the atmosphere is great for working or reading. And as a great added bonus the hand made donuts are amazing."}
{"text":"Tried the cinnamon donut. Sadly a chain like Krispy Kreme is better. The donut is small given the price.

The Lattes are terrible and bitter. I threw mine in the garbage as soon as I left the store.

The decor was nice and the parking is difficult given the location on Parc."}
{"text":"\"Normally I didn't see a great deal. I didn't hear a great deal either. I didn't pay attention. Strictly speaking I wasn't there. Strictly speaking I believe I've never been anywhere.\"


 let me begin by saying, after a good 30 minutes of eavesdropping at chez boris, i don't know what i liked more, the donuts or the man behind the donuts. maybe they're one in the same. today was my day to let go, i shared jovial laughs with the patrons attempting to navigate the black curtain upon entrance, and ate 6 donuts and a pork belly donut sandwich in the process. 

luckily at chez boris, even if you do have trouble with the curtain, the joke's not on you. 

to note, boris' menu isn't exclusively donuts, i saw a specials column (which i assume rotates on a  weekly basis) with chili/sandwiches/quesedillas and the like. a hop over to the facebook page confirms my inklings. if you're like me and probably won't have a donut (or 6) on the regular, there's still great coffee, and very affordable relative to other places in the area, you don't feel like you're getting nickle and dimed at every turn.

-1 for a special that seemed tacked on/thrown together for the sake of an alternative option  - quesedillas - which could be prepared better a home, and for that matter,  tasted  no different than my friend's 'we should get high and make quesedillas' sort of night."}
{"text":"This place just opened on Parc, and it already feels like home. It smells like fresh donuts and coffee, which is how I want every place to smell. The donuts are traditional Russian style, which makes them smaller and lighter than what you might be used to.  They are light and sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. They are made to order and fried in front of your eyes, which makes them super fresh. The coffee is fresh and supplied by 49th Parallel (a Vancouver-based roaster). I had a double-shot espresso with a thick crema and a sweet aftertaste, and I loved it. 

The atmosphere in here is also really welcoming. Floor to ceiling windows, the shiny blue floors, and fresh white walls give this place tons of natural light. It's the perfect place to meet friends or read a book, and there is even a huge bookcase of take-one-leave-one books and board games for patrons to enjoy. Almost all of the tables were up-cycled and renovations done by Boris and Grant themselves, two of the smilest guys on the planet.

Come in for a quick coffee and donut, or stay and make friends. Either way, you'll love Chez Boris and all of its delights."}
{"text":"Just had my first Russian Donut at Chez Boris today...and wow...it was incredible!!! I do not think I will ever eat a donut anywhere else ever again. I used to think it was an ok idea to eat donuts that had been sitting on a rack for indefinite amounts of time; not anymore - this place has changed my mind. Your donuts are fried right after you order them at Chez Boris, they are small, so you can order one or two or three depending on how much you want, and the crazy thing is that they are only 0.50 cents each. They come fresh out of the frier and get dusted in confectioner's sugar, so you get them just a tiny bit crispy, just the right amount of sweat, I didn't know what I was missing!! Apparently this is the way they are sold on street corners in Russia, and also the way they should always be everywhere. 

Plus there is a homemade Russian soft drink called Kavass that I'd never tried before which was very good - yeasty taste with a hint of sweetness, hard to describe, but definitely something I will order again. Ambiance is really chill. Boris is pretty much the coolest person ever. There is free wif, and the place is very open and spacious but homey at the same time, with plenty places to sit.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmh good tasty really delicious fresh made to order and not too oily cute little donuts.

Sugar, Cinnamon, Chocolate (dark) with good filter coffee...MMMMMHHHHH, the perfect combination. 

LOVE IT"}
{"text":"Found out about their beignet special this morning (2 freebies with coffee before 10a) and happily chowed down two delicious morsels as I read my book on the comfy couch. It's a great space for working, socializing or quiet time. The staff is always friendly, there's usually plenty of space to sit, the food is fresh and yummy and I've always just felt at home here. Thanks for being so awesome!"}
{"text":"Their russian donuts (80 cents each) are made fresh in front of you, are barely oily,with a touch of chewiness, are just absolutely delicious, and warm my cold donut hating heart. The ambiance itself is wonderful, with lots of light and a lending library. 
I plan on hibernating there regularly throughout the Montreal winter."}
{"text":"This is as close as you can get to authentic Russian donuts in Montreal. But don't get confused - this isn't a Russian restaurant and authenticity is not something that Boris is concerned with because he's not defensive like that. I'd describe the aesthetic as Soviet kitsch, reminiscent of my favorite cafe in Brooklyn - Dillinger's.

Just like the girls who own Dillinger's, it turns out that Boris's family is also from the same city as me and we both happened to lived in the same city as kids. He opened the cafe at 27 to bring a little taste of Soviet nostalgia to La Belle Province, which I can totally appreciate as I also have homesickness for a place that doesn't exist anymore. I can just TASTE the Motherland in Boris's donuts.

People with diabetes need to stay as far away as possible. This is for your own good."}
{"text":"I heard so many good things about the doughnuts at Chez Boris and I had a great expectation - it was a rather disappointing experience. It's not a bad thing you get to eat a freshly fried doughnuts but I didn't think it would take 10 - 15 mins to prepare, and the outcome was very mediocre. We ordered two doughnuts and came in very different sizes. The taste was good, any fresh fried dough wouldn't be bad unless you burn it - but really, it tasted like a doughnut I made for a Home Ec class when I was a kid. Not impressed at all. The cafe itself has a cool indie vibe but needs some improvements at the same time - looks a bit worn out. 
If you crave doughnuts, any Polish bakery or Dunkin Donuts would be a better option."}
{"text":"It's really sad that this coffee shop is closing this weekend! I appreciated my latte and the three types of russian donuts, as well as the good service from the staff! They're also having a promotion: 12 donuts for 6$ for the last weekend, totally worth it"}
{"text":"Nice donut and chai latte that what i had .Tell u something u dont Get more fresh Then that !!!"}
{"text":"They have a big sign outside claiming to have the best donuts in Montreal which I think hurts their credibility more than anything else. While they're good, they don't stand out particularly. However, two of my companions ordered the \"beignewich\" with eggs and hickory smoked bacon which they raved about. 

The decor is nice - it's a nice place to relax with friends. They have a few popular board games such as Monopoly, Scrabble, Cranium and jigsaw puzzles. They have a few books as well."}
{"text":"Today was pouring and needed some comforting. I had heard of Chez Boris on some Montreal based blog (maybe Mtl Blog actually) and today was the perfect day to try it out.

The place is perfect to watch a rainy sunday go by. It oozes coziness with its big windows, dimmed lights and comfy couches. 

My girlfriend and I ordered 6 cinnamon doughnuts and we respectively had a soviet coffee (milk is replaced by sweet condensed milk) and a chai latte. 

The drinks were fine, I actually wish mine had a little more flavour, but the doughnuts were straight up sent from heaven. Fresh, crispy and delightful. I could have made it my lunch with no ragrets.

I will definitely come back for more next time I'm in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Bien, mais pas wow. 
Le cappuccino est correct, sans plus. On ne s'y retrouve pas bien assis partout dû aux grands bancs sans dossier. Pour étudier quelques heures, c'est pas le best spot de Montréal mettons.
Pendant la dite période d'études, la musique est devenue tout à coup très, voir même trop forte pour ensuite s'arrêter un moment.
Le wifi faisait défaut. 

Bref, café irrégulier, service correct, je songe tout de même à lui laisser une deuxième chance"}
{"text":"Went to Montreal last summer and got Chez Boris.... I've literally dreamed about their doughnuts ever since. I actually stopped in and was waiting on my boyfriend to get there, while I was waiting the super nice guy working there asked what I was getting and I let him know I didn't have any canadian money on me, and he gave me coffee and doughnuts BEFORE I paid! Such a nice atmosphere/ staff/ and amazing food. Plus! an entire wall of bookcases with board games! We ate doughnuts, drank coffee, and played scrabble on the sidewalk outside. It was dreamy."}
{"text":"Stopped by on our trek back from the bagel shop, and I am so glad we did!

The shop clerk was super friendly, even with our indecisiveness. 

We ended up getting 6 donuts (1/2 sugar, 1/2 cinnamon) , a filtered coffee, and hot apple cider.

The donuts were great , but the hot apple cider was awesome!! Seriously spiced, and almost creamy tasting. So. Delicious."}
{"text":"Yummy fresh donuts, beautiful eclectic space with amazing paintings and good music, good service"}
{"text":"After hearing so many wonderful things about Chez Boris, now I completely understand why it has such a wonderful reputation. 

They are known mostly for their doughnuts, and they are truly as good as it gets. It's a basically buttery dough rolled and made all by hand. Fried in oil by hand as well. This truly a place that focuses more on quality over quantity. 

Also, they are not at all pricey. The place is very relaxed, great background music, with a wonderful ambiance by their clients. 

Both the place, the staff and, their homemade doughnuts are an absolute delight. A hot chocolate is an absolute must! Which they make a fantastic hot chocolate or coffees as well. A must try spot!"}
{"text":"Donut worry, this is a great place to go for coffee and donuts!! Chez Boris was a great place to study and was very spacious. The baristas were very nice and they served me my coffee and donuts to my table. The free Wifi was good!! I got half a dozen of donuts, 2 of each flavour (chocolate, cinnamon, and sugar) and a filter coffee. It all came to $7.25 ($4.50 for 6 donuts and $3.25 for the coffee). I appreciated how the prices they had on their menu already included tax, so I didn't have to worry about calculating the tax. The donuts were very good, but enjoy them when they are hot!! I am guilty of licking the sugar on the doughnuts off from my fingers :). I loved the cinnamon and sugar donuts; the chocolate wasn't really my vibe. The chocolate didn't have the right texture and was a bit too bland for a donut, in my opinion. Overall, a great cafe and this neighbourhood is fantastic!! Walk around and enjoy all of the restaurants and shops in Mile End!!

TIPS: They accept credit only if the bill is $5 and up
If you are studying here, be careful when erasing or writing on the tables. The tables are a bit wobbly so your coffee may spill. 
IF YOU CHECK IN ON YELP, YOU GET 2 FREE DONUTS WITH ANY COFFEE/TEA!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Donuts at fair price for the taste , they have a great selection of society games  and a good light temperament . The bad side must be the high price for a quite normal coffee and the lack of products ."}
{"text":"Came to brunch, bcz I heard about  their \"beignewich\" somewhere.

simple and fresh donuts, appealing price, creative menu (it's a pity, they only had beignewich with pork), pleasant and polite service, lots places to relax, fashionably worn-out style decoration, free wifi.

but what's most impressive for me was that they give a lot of care on each of their works (brewing coffee, frying donuts, presenting plates...). they really try to serve each one of us a cup of fresh coffee, fresh baked bacon, fresh fried donuts... everything fresh. I fell in love with their hospitality, I will come back to spend more time there next time."}
{"text":"Sans conteste les meilleurs beignes à Montréal! On les prépare devant vous et vous les sert tout chauds! À 0,80$ le beigne, il y a vraiment place à l'abus!! La soupe aux betteraves et la limonade sont aussi délicieuses. Le chaï latte laisse par contre à désirer, un peu fade. Les heures d'ouverture sont restreintes (ils ferment à 20h) et c'est dommage! Ils préconisent les aliments bio et locaux. Ça vaut certainement le détour!"}
{"text":"If there's one thing I like in an espresso, it's that it works. Bo knows!

Staff are friendly, fast and (look like they're having) fun. Sometimes it's packed, but if you need some room to sit and download torrents, it's a rad spot. 

Coffee is real and properly made, and everyone seems to dig their donuts. They have latkes too, which is impressive."}
{"text":"Chez Boris has some of the most delicious donuts I've ever tried. Fried right when you order them, rolled in cinnamon and sugar (but not too much), crispy on the outside while still being soft on the inside. I had a soviet coffee, my boyfriend had a chai latte, neither of which were overly inspiring. I thought the drinks were quite expensive based on the quality, but the donuts were worth every penny. Skip the drinks, but come here for the donuts and try not to burn your tongue as you wolf them down."}
{"text":"L'endroit est sympathique. Ya assez de table pour travailler. Par contre, ça sent vraiment la nourriture. Je pense qu'il ya besoin de changer l'aération. 
Les toilettes étaient sales aussi et pas de savon. 
Les prix sont raisonnables et Boris a l'air super gentil !"}
{"text":"Chez Boris is one of my favourite places to get doughnuts in Montreal! The doughnuts are made in house and come out warm and delicious every single time! 
They have both cold/warm espresso drinks. The lattes and mochas are my personal favourite. The prices on both the doughnuts and drinks are pretty fair! 

I would recommend this place for anyone who loves fresh doughnuts or wants a place to just relax or study. Chez Boris has tons of seating with a very interesting and unique decor.   

Try it out! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Full of studying students and hipsters in their native environment.  Doughnuts aren't bad."}
{"text":"Went back yesterday night, the donuts were delicious like the first day. What made it even better is the extremely good service I received. I just bought a couple of donuts but the man behind the counter was so nice, I left with a smile (and two piping hot delicious donuts). Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great place to do work, relatively good prices, awesome donuts."}
{"text":"Great coffee - get a cappuccino or espresso but don't get the Cafe Solvetique. It tastes like thinned out soviet coffee and has sugar. BUT with coffee you get 2 freshly made donuts at no charge  if you get there before 10am."}
{"text":"Pas vraiment un restaurant, pas vraiment un café, cet endroit est un repère à hipsters (on devrait ajouter cette catégorie sur Yelp).

Comme tout repère à hipster qui se mérite, décoration approximative, faite de brics et de brocs, ça ne ressemble pas à grand chose, service lui aussi approximatif, un peu trop \"jemelapèteunpeucarjebossedansunendroitquejetrouvetropcool\" ... des boissons simples et quelques originalités comme le \"cidre chaud\" qui au final n'a aucun intérêt, c'est à la cannelle comme le vin chaud, sauf que là, la cannelle prend tout le goût, bref ...

Par contre, au-delà de ce constat, il faut dire que leurs donuts sont quand même très très bons, malgré leur taille minuscule, derrière on a un produit très fin, bien travaillé.

Et à partir de ces donuts, qu'est-ce que l'on fait ? et bien des sandwichs avec les donuts pardi ! Je me suis laissé tenté par le sandwich au porc effiloché, et c'était mais super bon, super bien réussi ! Franchement chapeau ! D'ailleurs pour les non aventuriers culinaires, n'ayez pas peur ! les donuts utilisés pour faire le sandwich sont natures ou salés mais pas sucrés.

Ils font aussi d'autres plats, plutôt bien réussis, comme le chili aux betteraves, ouais c'est bizarre, c'est sans viande, pour plaire aux hipsters vegans (la pire race de tous les temps), mais c'est plutôt bien réalisé, et surtout PAS CHER !"}
{"text":"Chez Boris is closing at the end of April !! :,(
It will certainly be missed. This little place exudes Montreal, with its quirky deco, art displays, comfort food, disparate furniture and youthful spirit. 

We went there on a weekday morning to get some donuts and coffee before work. It was cold and grey outside, and deserted but warm inside. We got our freshly made donuts, one sugar and one cinnamon (they come free with a hot drink), and a \"beignewich\" - a Chez Boris invention starring egg, cheese and bacon sandwiched between two plain donuts. The total was about 10,50$. The \"soviet\" coffee (billed as \"commie coffee\" was basically vietnamese coffee (coffee with condensed milk). It was fine. The donuts were pretty good. They were fluffy and light, and not oily at all. Smaller than expected, but pretty cheap if bought in bulk. The beignewich (billed as \"guacamole sandwich\") was also smaller than expected, but pretty delicious (but hey, how bad can you mess up bacon, cheese and egg?). 

I wish I had time to try their pierogi and borscht, but work was calling. Another time perhaps, before the end of the month.The girl at the counter told me the employees were collecting money to start a co-op on their own. Hopefully it will bring back some of Chez Boris' vibe, but I have a gut feeling its a chapter that will be gone for good."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place so many times but never took time out of my day to visit because I'm really not a doughnut person. The only pastry I usually reach for is a croissant and it's always a plain one. 

Recently, I had the chance to go to Krispy Kreme doughnuts and it changed everything. Doughnuts became something I wanted all the time, always. But I could never find anything I liked as much as Krispy Kreme. I tried doughnuts from all the usual chains (Dunkin' Doughnuts and Tim Hortons), they were bland and not worth eating. 

But then I realized I had never been to Chez Boris!
What a rookie mistake!!! I live so close and I knew they made fresh doughnuts!! 

So yeah, finally decided to visit this place and it did not disappoint. I love love love that the doughnuts are fresh. I tried all three flavours on my first visit. They have chocolate, cinnamon, and sugar. So it's fried dough and they add the flavoured seasoning on top. 

They. Are. Heavenly.

Crispy and warm and sweet. Also, bite sized! They aren't huge american doughnuts. 

I shared them with my boyfriend and he agreed they were really special and unique. 

My favourites in order were: 
1.Sugar
2.Chocolate
3.Cinnamon

But that's because I'm not really a fan of cinnamon all the time.

The cafe itself is really artsy, you have paintings and poetry on the walls. Soft music in the background. Enough chairs and tables for study parties. Clean and relaxing."}
{"text":"Nice cafe. Had a really nice time there meeting up with some friends. The coffee was OK and so were the donuts. The hot chocolate wasn't hot enough, but this happens in many establishments in Montreal. It's a self service place, no waiters. The crowed was young. Lots of laptops. It was relatively quite and very suitable for conversation. We may be back."}
{"text":"Yummy donuts. They are made a la minute, so if you are ever in need of a warm, light and fresh donut you will never be let down. Only complaint I have is the cleanliness of the place; I live in the Mile-End so I like the antique and mismatched vibe however I don't like the idea of my food being handled by the same person who gives me back my change. 

Besides that it's a cute place and I will definitely be back when I need to satisfy my sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"This cute little coffee shop serves some of the best doughnuts in Montreal. They are fresh fried to order, with a slight crisp, not too sweet, and deliciously light. Since they are small Russian style doughnuts, they don't have all the crazy fillings and toppings yeasted doughnuts usually have. They come in 3 flavours, Chocolate, cinnamon or sugar. They are all delicious.

The coffee is amazing. The beans usually come from small roasters, and the Baristas are talented. They have a unique variation on the drip coffee, in which they put condensed milk instead of milk or any sweetener in the coffee, known as a soviet coffee. This version is probably more luxurious than what they had in Soviet Russia.

I do go there once in a while to write and enjoy doughnuts and a coffee."}

{"text":"We arrived a few minutes too late after the kitchen closed, so the beignewichs were not available. However the friendly guy behind the counter offered to whip up some sweet doughnuts for us instead. That gesture was enough to have me coming back the next day.

And so we did!

What we really came for were the infamous: Beignewiches. 

Order 1) Smoked salmon, capers, creme fraiche, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes
Order 2) Pulled pork belly, sprouts, scallions and hoisin sauce

Both served on savory doughnuts buns.

IMAGINE THAT.

I loved that the doughnuts were made to order. The beignewiches came out steaming hot -- tongue-burnable. The doughnut sandwiches were not overly saturated with bold flavors, but just enough to leave the palate wanting for more... and more. They also gave us a healthy sampling of a Russian salad that they were working on adding to their menu. 

Again, outstanding.

Thanks for the great service and delicious beignewiches!"}
{"text":"Les beignets sont frais, abordables (80 cent l'unité ou 6$ la douzaine!), ils fondent en bouche et se mangent vraiment tout seul. Le café est vraiment excellent aussi; ils utilisent le café de 49th Parallel, un pur délice. Je ne sais pas si c'est toujours Boris qui est derrière le comptoir, mais il était présent et souriant à chacune de mes visites! On y annonce un accès wifi mais personnellement j'ai toujours de la difficulté à m'y connecter au début, que ce soit avec mon téléphone ou ma tablette, mais après un petit moment ça va. En bref, vraiment, c'est un endroit tout à fait charmant! Laissez tomber les beignes du Tim (ou le Tim au complet tout court.. Oups j'ai vraiment écrit ça?), c'est ici qu'il faut venir!"}
{"text":"I can't emphasize enough how happy this place makes me feel, so much so that I am writing this review excitedly while sitting here. Walking into this place made me instantly feel at home (even though I don't have a drop of Russian/Soviet blood in me) and brought a sense of inexplicable comfort into my body. The unpretentious nature of this place and the combination of Soviet relics and decorated skateboards adorning the walls give it an artsy vibe without trying too hard. But enough about the atmosphere, the food is the real star of the show.

I used the Yelp promo this time around, in which you can get two free donuts with the purchase of a drink upon checking in. I ordered the Soviet coffee (basically drip coffee with condensed milk) and chose the cinnamon and chocolate donuts to go along with it. The coffee alone without the milk would not have been that great quality-wise, but the milk gave it that extra charm that bounces off the tip of your tongue, and I savored it to the very last drop. And the donuts - I'm internally crying tears of joy from experiencing them. They are a bit on the smaller side compared to big chains like Tim Hortons or Dunkin Donuts, but they are so much better and not overbearingly sweet by any means. The cinnamon donut had the perfect balance of sugar and nutty spice, and the fact that they were made fresh in front of my eyes made the sugar melt in my mouth in the best possible way. The chocolate donut's toppings brought out the chocolate flavor in a very natural and nuanced way, in which I could actually taste cocoa and not just plain sugar. Again, it was piping hot just like my other donut, so the chocolate melted in my mouth and I died and went to heaven. 

It takes quite a bit to impress me enough for me to give a place a five-star rating, and Chez Boris did just that (first five-star rating by the way!). If you ever get the opportunity to visit the Mile End, this place should be near the top of your list. It's cheap, satisfying, and will leave you wanting more. Now that I'm thinking about it, I'm really tempted to go order some more food (did someone say beignewich?) and continue the state of absolute, pure bliss I'm in right now..."}

{"text":"Salut, Boris! Tu es si hip et branché! 

Ton employée est toute seule. Pourquoi?
Elle court entre la friteuse et les cafés, et j'attends mon espresso depuis une quinzaine de minutes déjà alors qu'il n'y avait personne en file avant moi. C'est après que les choses se sont corsées !

Ton décor est drôle et hétéroclite. Un jeune couple joue au Scrabble. Des étudiants pianotent sur leur MacBook. Une horde de jeunes femmes en fleurs vient d'entrer. Apprécieront-elles l'odeur de graisse de beignes? Ça ajoute un charme à la place, non? 

La barista s'excuse pour l'attente avec un timide sourire. Le café est okay. J'ai le rhume un peu, je trouve qu'il a un arrière-goût de jambon frit. Cela dit, j'aime le jambon frit.

La file s'allonge et j'ai envie d'aller donner un coup de main à la pauvre barista. Allez, courage, vaillante jeune femme! À nous les beignes! 

PS: c'est bon, les beignes."}
{"text":"Chez Boris -  a Hipster joint @ Parc & Fairmont. Though I'm not a big fan of the hipster scenario (Maybe I'm too old for it), I decided to give this place a try. Their specialty, Doughnut sandwiches!!! Sounds out of this world?  It is. We tried the pulled pork doughnut & the cured Salmon doughnut sandwich. The doughnuts aren't too sweet, so you can taste the meaty flavors without the sweetness overpowering it.They taste really interesting. Also all the doughnuts are made onsite. After finishing our sandwiches, we were in a food coma. I donut wanna talk bout it. Tired of the \"hole\" thing.  Definitely worth a visit


Food : Good
Service :Friendly 
Ambiance : Casual
Worth the price : Yes"}
{"text":"Chez Boris, I am a huge fan!!!  This small little cafe offers the freshest Russian doughnuts, great coffee (Kittel and 49th Parallel), and teas (PureTea).  I had a Pour Over coffee, which was made strong and smooth; organic cream was provided so you can pour to your heart's content.  The hubs had a Chai Latte - this was creamy, yummy, and made with the house's chai concentrate - it was lovely and had the perfect amount of spice!  We also shared their famous beignes, which comes in 3 different flavors: Sugar, Cinnamon/Sugar/Cloves, and Chocolate.  We opted for the Sugar and the Cinnamon/Sugar/Cloves - these donuts were made-to-order, super fresh, and super delicious!  The sugar one was simple, but my favorite was the Cinnamon/Sugar/Cloves, as it had the right amount of kick from the cloves and had a nice spice tint to it.  These were addicting, and I can see why most of the patrons ordered a big bowl of it while they worked!  Service was super sweet, friendly, and lovely, and the place has a nice comfortable vibe to it - slightly dark, but plenty of tables where you can plug-in, use their free wi-fi, and do some work/studying.  Lots of local art pieces on the wall, and I really liked their Super NES console holding the cafe's business cards :P  Definitely a place not to be missed! :D

{"text":"Very popular doughnut place, gets a little crowded after lunch time, so it is hard to find a seat. The lighting is not that great to study in the evening. But good coffee and doughnuts"}
{"text":"Loved this place!!!  Terrific espresso, delicious doughnuts made to order, friendly staff, board games, books, and plenty of couches, chairs, and tables to hang out at.  A great place for families with children looking for a place to relax at on a weekend morning.  Did I mention the terrific espresso and delicious doughnuts?!?"}
{"text":"Sandwich au beigne, c'est bon mais pour moi ca manque de saveur. Par contre, c'est moilleux et croustillant en meme temps. Les beignes chaud au sucre sont tres bons. Ce que j'aimé le plus, les produit locaux et meme organique. Pour moi manger local et boire local c'est primordial!"}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighbourhood and had walked by this unassuming spot (looks more like a music club than anything from the outside, but always noticed people milling about the doorway) many times until finally I read about their donuts (\"beignets\") online and decided to give one (or two!) a try. AM OFFICIALLY HOOKED! At the advice of the sweet girl who worked there, I got a couple of 90-cent donuts, one sugar and one cinnamon to take away and they didn't even last 5 minutes out the door. Eat them while they're hot and get more than 2. They're absolutely delightful! Tim Horton who?"}
{"text":"Pas vraiment emballé pour ce café.
L'expresso sans plus, le café russe sympa mais rien d'extraordinaire.
Les beignes sont bonnes car fraiches et chaudes :)
Le service n'est pas trop français friendly si je puis dire, pas toujours facile de se faire comprendre ;)
L'ambiance n'est pas vraiment à mon gout mais cela n'engage que moi et je comprend que d'autres personnes aiment !"}
{"text":"Donuts made fresh to order! Pretty good, but the ones we had from Cremy Patisserie outdo them by far. Nonetheless, chez boris has a cutesy fun atmosphere, and is a great place to come with a friend or a book -- or both!"}
{"text":"Si vous voulez vous régaler de petits beignes frais, chauds et délicieux, vous êtes à la bonne place. Il faut adorer le sucre car c'est ex-trê-me-ment sucré! Chez Boris, c'est local, un petit café de quartier sans prétention, pas cher."}
{"text":"Holy crow I love it here, I love the donuts and I love the Boris. First let's talk about everything but the obvious: Friendly, bright mellow place with big windows on Parc Ave and comfy mismatched chairs and a lending library. Plays hosts to events for good causes, good conversations, even the occasional sing along. The coffee is outstanding - I'll take a lovely latte or shot of espresso when the mood strikes, but if I can get a truly good cup of filter coffee that's my poison of choice, and Boris uses the 49th parallel beans to make you an individual cup dripped fresh in front of your face and smelling and tasting like awesome. 

OK, now the donuts. These are made in front of you every time. Tiny hot little darlins served in a basket, not heavy or oily or too sweet. The not too sweet basic flavour is key to the magic things Boris does with these donuts, turning them into a base for innovations like donut poutine, donut au canard, donuts with cream cheese and smoked salmon, and more. Go try, check the chalk board, hang out and give the smiling gents behind the counter a high five."}
{"text":"The coffee is delicious and the waitstaff is adorable. It's a cozy atmosphere too. What's not to love? I gotta go back and try those donuts."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Inexpensive. Great coffee and hot chocolate. Beignets are made to order and delicious."}
{"text":"Really like their fresh fired donuts, they were crispy on the outside, which is really unique. However, the atmosphere wasn't the best, it was a bit dark and felt a bit dirty. And they can't make cappuccino."}
{"text":"I know Chez Boris is closing oh so soon but this place always deserves love. Stop by in the next days and donate towards the staff's plans for an new co-operative cafe and keep the donuts coming. Thanks for all the memories, Boris."}
{"text":"Chez Boris is a really cool coffee shop that has the added pro of having some of the greatest doughnuts in the city. They may not be as fancy and as eccentric as some other spots in the city but they are simply delicious. Small enough to be practically bite size, which is an issue because they are very addictive. 

The place it self doesn't look like anything special when you walk in, but I think that is on purpose. It all adds to the appeal of this little coffee shop and I think it is the main reason it is always packed with people studying and just chilling. 

If I had to give an atmosphere to it, I would describe it as more of a fun hipster like environment then other quieter, peaceful coffee shops. It's one of those places where you have conversations with everyone around you rather than just sitting in the corner with your earphones on. 

Great spot and a must try !"}
{"text":"Chez boris has been my go to coffee place for a couple of years now. I don't really like talking about it because it's hard enough finding a place on their tiny terrace. Their iced tea with mint and iced coffee are amazing but that's not the real reason people flock to chez boris, their doughnuts are what makes this place! They are the best doughnuts i've ever tried in Montreal. They're apparently done the russian way and I'm pretty sure this is someone's baboushka recipe. Besides dougtnuts, they have a Russian influenced menu with dishes such as pierogies and bortsch. I tried their benwich with salmon gravlax, sour cream and dill and I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I'm not really a donut fan, but when it comes to Chez Boris donuts, I cant really stop eating them! They have 3 types: sugar, cinnamon and chocolate donuts, but my favorite is the cinnamon one, especially when its warm and just made. Their donuts are always fresh! If you go there for a coffee, or to study, they have a really nice place and a lovely decoration, and will start making the donuts there just in front of you!"}
{"text":"Café très décontracté et relax. Plutôt minimaliste mais sympa/grano.
Les beignes sont délicieux."}
{"text":"Amazing donuts with a grungy-cool coffee house vibe. Chez Boris was pretty empty when I arrived and I wasn't actually sure if donuts were available. Turns out, they make them to order, so soon I was all set with 6 assorted sugar and cinnamon donuts. 

Basically, I recommend the donuts! They're obviously super fresh: really hot, crispy on the outside and just the teeniest bit oily. If you're picturing heavy Dunkin-style donuts, think again: these are light and airy, a little smaller than palm-sized. My friend ate 3 of them, which is good because it's nice to share, but bad because I could have eaten all 6.

I also got a chai latte which could have been a little stronger, and my friend got an egg sandwich which was a fried egg, some bacon, and cheese served in on top of a large donut with a smaller one on top. They have other small food options as well...or you could just get more donuts."}
{"text":"Popular study place, but gets super crowded and noisy with people constantly coming in and out. It's hard to find a seat , with limited amount of outlets. Wifi is pretty consistent. The famous donuts are alright, nothing special. I'd recommend cinnamon + cloves one. Slow but friendly service."}
{"text":"I went here after reading all the amazing reviews and was a little underwhelmed. 

The place looks like it's really just worn-down and in need of some renovating. I ordered a mixed basket of donuts and a tea and found the donuts to be a little hard and the tea to be very average. 

Definitely not a bad place but I really wasn't excited by it. 

Maybe I'll be more convinced after a second try - not sure just yet!"}
{"text":"I actually met \"the\" Boris at a Yelp event ages ago. I was so surprised that a donut shop would exist in Montreal, I always kept it in the back of my mind to check it out. Sadly other things got in the way, and after I missed their one-of-a-kind poutine, I decided that was enough!
So I went on a beautiful Sunday, and got myself a salmon beignewich (a sandwich where donuts replace the bread) and kvass (fermented apple juice). All was delicious, especially the kvass - totally unexpected. The donuts are homemade, in plain sight, a couple of minutes before being eaten, so they are light and crisp! My only little gripe was that the sour cream in the beigne (too much of it, and a bit cold). I'd love to go back soon and taste the rest of their offerings!

Also, pack lightly, the place is cramped!"}
{"text":"Je ne suis pas un amateur fini de beigne, j'avais plutôt tendance à trouver cette pâtisserie un peu dépassée, un brin trop fade pour la quantité de gras et de sucre qu'elle vous fait ingérer.  Mais les beignes de Boris semble être l'exception qui confirment la règle: servis chaud, sans excès dans la garniture, ils fondent littéralement dans la bouche!  J'ai eu l'occasion de tester hier leur nouvelle formule du vendredi et samedi soir, où les beignes font place à un repas santé, qui change chaque semaine (hier: paella aux fruits de mer, brushetta et salade greque), et tout était excellent et à un prix très abordable.  Définitivement une bonne adresse dans le Mile End."}
{"text":"Heard SO MUCH about Chez Boris before heading there when I was on the verge of 'hangry'dom' the other day. I've sampled their home made donuts at a few events and they are quite nice although I'm more a fan of light fluffy yeast donuts and they are on the heavy dense side of the donut spectrum. The atmosphere was sweet and the servers were relaxed and warm but my order being filled was on the slow side. 

I ordered the savoury breakfast sandwich - smoked trout, cream and donuts. It was, of course, on the heavy side, but more than that surprisingly bland. No lemon, no capers...very little flavor. Perhaps it was an off day or that's not their specialty but was honestly a little disappointed. Would return for a coffee though (smelled delicious)."}
{"text":"Very  funny  and  I like  it.  Awesome people working  there,  awesome  clients going  there  that  are not shy  to start  a conversation and all of that  makes  the simple  experience of getting  a coffee and a bagel  an awesome  one! 

The place  totally  lives  through the image  of being one  funky joint  and  I'll  be surely coming  back..."}
{"text":"A Chili con Car... No carne ? Beets ? Well... Ok sure, why not.

*first bite* : OH MY GOD YES

So yeah I had a \"chili con beets\" and it was awesome, really.

So not only do they have some pretty decent donuts (chocolate, cinnamon or plain sugar, an excuse to eat three when you get there) they also make some pretty interesting meals, I don't need to say more, you'll see the pictures posted on here and you'll be like : Damn !

Damn indeed."}
{"text":"Tiny donuts. They're warm and decent, but I wouldn't say they're good, but small price to pay to use the washroom."}
{"text":"Boris's cold brew was a perfect mid-afternoon treat on a humid August day. The coffee ice cube/popsicle was a nice touch, too. Next time I won't be so stingy with the beignets -- I had a single beignet de cannelle and wished I'd ordered six. Super hot and fresh! Miam miam."}
{"text":"I always go for the fresh doughnuts. Be ready to wait as they are cooked to order but they are so yummy and well worth the wait. I get a mix - half of them tossed in sugar and half of them tossed in cinnamon and sugar. Be ready to burn your mouth a bit because you won't be able to wait to consume these delicious pockets of fried dough. Make sure to grab napkins and it can be a little messy to eat. I love eating them while walking around the plateau. A great snack to keep the energy up."}
{"text":"Je me suis laissé tenter par l'affiche sur la rue qui fanfaronnait \" les meilleurs beignes de Montréal \". Je suis donc entré Chez Boris pour en commander une demi-douzaine au prix de 4,50$. Première déception : que deux saveurs différentes offertes ; citron et sucre. Pour un endroit qui prétend être le meilleur du genre, c'est un départ un peu lent. Une fois servi, j'ai été étonné par la petitesse des beignets. Minuscules. Oui, ils étaient bons, frais et légèrement croustillants, mais j'ai vu mieux ailleurs. Et je passe sous silence le service dans un français minimal, pour ne pas dire difficile.

En bref, il s'agit plus d'un café que d'un resto. L'ambiance est un peu trop Hyptster à mon goût. J'apprécie plus ou moins le vieux sofa déchiré près de l'entré sur lequel nous avons carrément refusé de s'assoir tant il est repoussant. C'est sensé faire cool ? L'ensemble du décor, des tables et chaises fait un peu brocante. À défaut d'être confortable, c'est charmant. Personnellement, je ne ferais pas un détour pour revenir chercher des beignes ici. Ils sont bons, sans plus."}
{"text":"This place is great. Apparently they serve Russian donuts, but all I know for sure is they serve Awesome donuts here.

The coffee is good too, and the combination of caffeine and donut is hard to top. My favourite is the 'blueberry berliner'. It's not that fake blueberry stuff you get in EVERY OTHER BLUEBERRY DONUT YOU'VE EVER HAD - it's the real deal.

The staff here are really cool too. It's a good place to come and chill and get some work done. Highly recommended if you're anywhere near by."}
{"text":"Found Chez Boris on yelp before arriving to MTL and had it on my \"must try list.\"

Came here for 'brunch' on a Tuesday morning around 11am. I am def a fan of the hipster green-thumb decor! The donuts are called beignets, Russian term. I already forgot how to pronounce it (my bad!). The pulled pork beignet sandwich was totally legit, the hoisin sauce paired well, especially with the beignets hot and fresh! My bf had the egg & bacon beignets sandwich, equally good. The coffee served was the MTL staple. We wanted to try the regular donuts, but we were stuffed. 

Cool art on the walls, assorted random board games, random table map decor, and strong Wifi. We wanted to buy one of the posters behind the counter as a MTL souvenir,  but they were sold out :("}
{"text":"Amazing pour over coffee, super nice staff, free wifi and the doughnut sandwich was a uniquely awesome experience. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Came to chez boris with my friend every other morning when we studied abroad in Montréal.  Their ice coffee was absolutely delicious, their donuts were freshly made and tasted like heaven (especially the plain and chocolate donuts) but what really surprised me was how good their pierogi were. I grew up eating authentic polish and russian pierogis but theirs are just as yummy (the addition of dill sauce is awesome). To top it all off the prices were affordable and there was wifi!"}
{"text":"As someone who loves donuts, I have been on a mission to find some of the most delicious homemade donuts in Montreal and came across Chez Boris. After walking 3 km to get to Chez Boris, I was excited to try what I thought would be an unforgettable donut.

Sadly, the freshly made cinnamon and sugar donuts they offer are forgettable. I've made better donuts at home, myself. The cafe filtre I had with my fresh donuts was a little disappointing.

I brought some of the special flavors home to try for breakfast tomorrow (one flavor is double chocolate, the other is lime + juniper) simply because I took the trouble to walk  a half hour there and did not want to leave empty handed. When I tried them the next morning, the chocolate was okay, though the lime + juniper tasted like a gin and tonic, and it was not very moist; almost too dry to eat.

If you're in the area, it's worth checking out once. However, Chez Boris does not make a 'destination donut' worth a special trip. 

I was disappointed that on my walk home, I was able to find incredible donuts for half the price of the Chez Boris specialty donuts at a small place called Boulangerie Patisserie Nouveau Samos on St. Laurent. It doesn't look special from the outside, but their donuts are amazing and not to mention huge!"}
{"text":"The Russian donuts were pretty good and the Soviet coffee was good. Vintage Russian food selection was limited.

The only thing that I didn't like was the fact the people who work here are not Russian which is very misleading. I came to Chez Boris expecting to see some Russian people and have Russian food. So having ordinary non-Russian bland people working there is a thumbs down for me.

Not sure if I will go back to this place."}
{"text":"I wanted my 100th Yelp review to be a good one and a good one it shall be!  After hearing so many positive things about Chez Boris I knew I had to go.  Normally I am not a fan of doughnuts but that's because when you normally only ever have them from Tim's (as I do) you have no idea what you're missing out on.   Chez Boris has changed the way I see doughnuts though.  What makes the experience even better?  The prices are very reasonable for the product you get.

I ordered a latte and a cinnamon doughnut which was made fresh to order so it was piping hot.  It was sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and tasted divine.  The exterior was nice and crispy and the interior was soft and chewy.  I think if I had opted for a half dozen or dozen to take home for the next few days they would have been gone in a heartbeat!  The latte was also pretty good.

The staff are friendly and the service is good.  I'd highly recommend this place and I know I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Such a fun bright space! We took a break from walking in the area, ordered 6 donuts and some hot drinks, and did a puzzle. Only in MTL for 6 days but we'll probably make our way back :)"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe on Parc! Walked past it before and knew I had to come back, especially with the check-in deal on Yelp! I arrived an hour after opening and while it fairly open then, it got busier quickly with people coming in and out for food and drinks. 
Their menu is small but suits the cafe-goers needs. I had the iced chai tea latte, which could be made stronger upon request (and which I did request), the beignewich, and a sugar donut and cinnamon donut. The iced chai latte was nice and spicy, but creamier than I normally like. The beignewich was delicious and very rich and filling, definitely a must-try on the menu. The donuts were delicious and you can tell (and see in the kitchen!) that they're made fresh.
The inside space is adorable, with a sort of industrial Russian feel to it. Lots of good seating for chatting, eating, and getting good work done. Love the decorative lights hanging from the ceilings and posters and art on the wall. Definitely would and will recommend!"}
{"text":"An eclectic Russian donut shop that's great for solo dining or groups.  Come in and try the beigne breakfast sandwich along with some good espresso to start your day . I also had the beets borsch which was rich, savory and full of beets and cabbage."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this café! Their donuts are amazing and affordable, the service is quick even when they're making a fresh batch of their donuts plus the staff is really nice"}
{"text":"I arrived at Chez Boris at 9am with my kid in his stroller, and was delighted to find the place almost empty. When you have a toddler, you're always fearful of crowded places where your little hellion is going to wreak havoc and get you kicked out, or at the very least, scorned for all eternity with the burning stink-eye of the proprietors. 

Not so here. We went to the counter, ordered a coffee, two donuts, and a glass of milk, and pulled up to the big, well-worn couch to enjoy. I plopped the kiddo down and stripped off the ten million layers of outergear that one must dress your child in to avoid hypothermia in this city, and the barista/donutmistress brought us our treats. Fantastic. Crispy, hot, tender donuts with sugary topping, a nice drip coffee, and the milk was a hit with the kid. 

We sat there, eating our donuts, drinking our beverages, and giving a last read-through to the books we planned to return to the Mile-End library down the road, and I thought, this is as close to perfect as it gets. Afterward, we looked at the Snakes and Ladders game they had on the table, and studied some of the old maps plastered on other tables. Great atmosphere, great space (enough room for a stroller! hallelujah!), and great fare. They even open early enough to enjoy a treat before the library opens. Fantastic."}
{"text":"Freshly Made to Order Donuts!

They were just so delicious and just made my hike worth my while.

Vanilla, Dark Chocolate and Sugar (@ 80 cents) were all so good. Warm and Fluffy, not too oily and not too sweet. Perfect with my coffee. I can eat a dozen myself no problem.. but I guess I shouldn't...

Chez Boris has quite a laid back vibe. Free Wifi and of course a lot of people with laptops hanging out here for hours...."}
{"text":"Very yummy donut sandwiches - I loved my pork belly/hoisin/green onion combo. My date found his egg and bacon one a little off-putting. You have to be ready for the sweet & salty excitement, and also know that the sandwich is quite heavy even if it looks small! Fair enough price, good drink options, but the vibe was that of study hall. I wish it had been a little more upbeat, but it would be a great place to snack and study... alone. The place was full but we were the only ones having a conversation!"}
{"text":"Quick hitter here. Woke up on Saturday morning with a strong desire to try something different on my way to the market so I decided to finally go try a place that has been on my radar all summer: Chez Boris.

Chez Boris is in the Mile End district on Park Avenue between Laurier and Fairmount and their speciality is doughnuts. For 75 cents each, you can get amazing fresh made-to-order doughnuts coated in a variety of different options. For my first visit (and it certainly won't be the last...), I got 2 sugar, one cinnamon and one raspberry. Each was perfectly cooked with a nice crisp exterior and a light fluffy interior which is all that you can ask for in a perfect doughnut.

So you're interested in something outside of the usual donut shop for a quick hit of sweet, give Chez Boris a shot. You won't be disappointed. Also, any place that uses a SNES as a card holder deserves your attention ;)


Cheers!"}
{"text":"Excellent cafe! This is the first place where nothing is overcharged and has great quality. I would highly recommend it if you are around! (If not just hop into bus #80 and go there!)

The stuff is extremely friendly, coffee can easily compete with Olympico.

I'm not even talking about the fresh donuts! Try the cinnamon ones.

All in all, if you are looking for good coffee and the best donuts in town this is the place to be."}
{"text":"We discovered Chez Boris by a fluke. We were on Yelp and found that they had a great beignet. We were nearby so decided to give it a go! 

The beignets did NOT disappoint. We ordered the cinnamon and clove sugar beignets and they were amazing. They are small so order 2-3 for yourself. They come in a cool brown paper bag. 

The atmosphere was very Russian, which I loved growing up in Russia. The coffee was just okay.

4 stars for the beignets!"}
{"text":"Great place!!!! We had a Yelp Elite event to taste their new Friday-Saturday \"after dark\" dinner menu. I decided to come back on my own the following week! Featuring TACOS $4 for 1, $7.50 for 2. Healthy and tasty is their objective. The dinner is different every week.

They made meat taco and a veggie taco that night, I went for two beef tacos. Very tasty. The restaurant smelled delicious. Just a warning that their dinner is very, very, very small. Tapas style.

I was there to study, similar to so many people. There is one communal table and many four-person tables. Well... you could separate the tables and they become two-person tables. Anyways, if you're alone (like so many Chez Boris customers), you can sit with another lonely stranger and share the space. Chez Boris is sometimes crowded and sometimes not. It's really just luck. Customers at Chez Boris tend to stay longer but they are very nice and will happily share the table. The WiFi unfortunately is extremely slow.

The staff at Chez Boris are fantastic!!!! With the After Dark event (which is a dinner and a short horror film) they turn off the lights and quiet the room. I was the odd person studying with an actual book!!! and papers and pencil, not a laptop. They gave me a personal lamp so I can keep on reading during the film!!! That's so kind! I turned off the lamp after 5 minutes into the film, I felt awful keeping this bright light.

Donuts are freshly made and delicious. $0.90 for one or $4.50 for 6. You can't beat this! I love the chocolate ones. I also had their donut sandwich with egg and bacon for $7. SO DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!

I love it here! I love Chez Boris for the vibe and the donuts, and also the dinner if you stick around after 7pm."}
{"text":"Une visite chez Boris c'est aussi une visite de nos propres souvenirs olfactifs. Les beignets sentent les fêtes de Noël chez grand-maman. Chaque beignet est confectionné lorsque la commande est passée, frais et chaud à tout coup! Tellement délicieux et siiiiii réconfortant! À 8$ la douzaine, c'est toute une aubaine!"}
{"text":"Their donuts are perfect in all ways. We've looked for great donuts in Montréal for a long time with no luck until we found Chez Boris. They come in 3 flavors, all fresh from the fryer right in front of you: sugar, cinnamon, and chocolate sprinkles."}
