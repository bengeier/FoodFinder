{"text":"DISGUSTING!  I got chicken shwarma, and it was tasting alright until I bit into a large piece of plastic. I went to the front to tell the employees and they all just kind of stared at me and said nothing for a full minute. Finally they begrudgingly offered to make me a new one. Moral of the story is the food is gross, and the employees are horrible."}
{"text":"The shawarma here is sooo good. It's their sauce that they r using . It's just yummmm.  The reason I am giving it 2 stars is because if the service . For some reason it feels like the servers give me n my friends attitude. It doesn't look like they r happy to serve us . So the customer service is bad. They never smile to me when serving it's like a straight face with an angry look. Anyone else get that ?   Also I hav found a fly in my shawarma a once ...so I am on the look for a new shawarma place to give business too.  But no lies so far this is the best shawarma iv tasted...sucks the service is bad"}
{"text":"With all the Ali's baba stores over the city, I had very high expectation. I was happy to see that the place was still open at 9 PM and went there for a late dinner. The place was Si's clean, which is one of my pet-peeve. Also, the food was not as tasteful as I wished it was. I had better shwarma. The food was somehow not very tasteful, mostly blend. Overall, it was not bad, just average. Be careful of their \"deal of the day\" as some will not save you much money (something like 50 cents for 2 sandwiches). The servers behind the counter were friendly, which is always a nice thing. Not sure if I will go back to that specific location."}
{"text":"I go here frequently for the falafel sandwiches. I made the mistake of getting the daily specials which was 2 falafel sandwiches. Complete rip off and waste of time. they are missing half the ingredients and are dry and tasteless. I was completely unimpressed. Normally would give them a thumbs up but this was appalling."}
{"text":"I used to eat at this location a LOT. Until I got food poisoning from a chicken shawarma sandwich in July 2012. That being said, I can't give this place a bad review because I ate there probably upwards of 50 times without incident and the shawarma and lentil soup are fairly good. Just be advised that if you eat at a place with this type of hygiene, (i.e. no air conditioning in 38 degree heat with two huge spits pumping out heat) you are rolling the dice and taking your chances with food-borne illness. Stock up on charcoal caps!"}
{"text":"Cheap prices, but the shawarma is just too small for an entire meal. The staff is not friendly at all and asking for extra tabbouleh on my shawarma resulted in the guy asking his manager if it was ok.   I would avoid this place and walk a little bit further to Pita Land."}
{"text":"Well it's always crowded and I always see Ryerson students come and grab a quick bite, so decided to give it a try.  Inside you line up and all the usual dishes are on order.  Schwarmas and salads seem on point and pretty much what you expect.  I got the falafel and was not disappointed.  DÃ©cor and service are pretty much what you would expect, for a schwarma place, and given the reputation, they have nothing to worry about.  Bonus points for the counter at the cashier that specializes in many types of baklava."}
{"text":"Felafels are amazingly tasty as in other locations, & the felafel sandwich is a great quick lunch option that's full of deliciousness and flavour. Handy to Y&D Square, Ryerson university.   More like a 3.5 because of the layout of the place (it can get really crowded around the counter area); there's a little bit of seating if you'd like to stay and stuff your face."}
{"text":"Just tried chicken shwarma once and it was too good. It had all the flavors required being spicy, tangy, smoky chicken, crunchy veggies. It is a big wrap that fills your tummy enough. I am not surprised that they are quite famous in Toronto with multiple branches. Since its middle eastern food I will definitely want them to bring kababs, seekhs and some more variety of rice platters. Happened to mention the same to the lady at the store.  Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I just dummied a falafel from here that I ordered through Uber eats. It only took 20 mins to get to my place (and 2 mins total to get into my body) and it was friggin great- veggies fresh and crunchy and falafel balls moist and flavorful. Garlic sauce I'd like to bathe in. Ughhhhhh I want another!!! Mind you it might be 1 am, but I'm sober- the food exceeded expectations (enough for me to write my first yelp review at 1 am). Bf got a chicken shwarma platter and he said his was pretty good (\"not unreal tho\") but if it's late and you need something delicious then my official recommendation is: Ali Baba's falafel 11/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Run of the mill Middle Eastern Shwarma and  Falafel chain. I came here for the Shishtouk special. Two sjisj touk for 10.99. Was both my breakfast and lunch. Got both of them all dressed with pickled cabbage, lettuce, hummus and tahini plus hot sauce. They were filling but nothing to write home about.   The menu options at this location are limited with no roast potatoes (a staple of every cuisine it seems) or lentil soup."}
{"text":"My mouth says \"Open Sesame\"--that's a literature joke, and you're welcome. Seriously, I don't get the hate for this Ali Baba's.  The food is good, the service is fine, and prices are cheap. Good, fine, cheap--just like me! Plus, they play music videos of Middle Eastern Britney Spears wannabes behind the counter, and I appreciate such fine musical offerings."}
{"text":"Never thought someone could mess up a falafel wrap but these guys achieved it.  I went in for the special. (15% off wraps) The owner suggested it.  When paying, I asked about the specials price. The lady who helped me asked the owner and then informed me \"it wasn't ready\"  and proceeded to charge me full price.   I ate my wrap, if you could call it that- it was a soggy, flavourless thing.  Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"I hated this Ali Baba, the quality seems to have dropped dramatically. The choices were mediocre. The bathrooms and place is dirty. The taste of the food was not fresh. I say avoid."}
{"text":"I went here for a falafel sandwich on the weekend. Really tasty, and only $3.99. My friend had a falafel salad, which was an impressive serving size, but I didnt see how much she paid. And one other friend had the chicken platter, he said it was good.  Service was friendly and fast. The place was pretty busy. We didnt stay in to eat as there is no a/c  So today I went to another shawarma place in the area (queen and church). I had a falafel, although it was slightly larger, the Ali Baba's had better flavour (and was .50 cents cheaper!)"}
{"text":"Got it delivered. Chicken is cold. Also hardly no chicken just potatoes. Asked for extra garlic not only did they cheap out but they put it on my salad . Um .. Why ? Super small portion of salad is ruined . Maybe enough garlic sauce for two bites of chicken. Asked for ice tea got a sprite. Also no fork. Come on, when someone is getting food delivered just put a fork. Obviously they are cheaping out. I am at work so I have no access to a fork. Go to the ali babas on danforth instead, their food is amazing and they never cheap out. Don't recommend."}
{"text":"Their chicken shawarma never disappoints. Hassle free meal with lunch time specials for $5. Also tried their beef, and although it was decent, it wasnt as good as their chicken. Highly recommend to satisfy your hunger, and/or your drunk cravings"}
{"text":"Felt like shawarma tonight while my buddy picked up some tacos around the corner. Ordered the Chicken shawarma plate. Tons of salad, great portion of rice and some dark meat chicken. All of the food was super tasty and priced right. $10 for a huge portion with left overs for lunch. All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"Ali's is about cheap eats. It's a quick-fix solution for when you're urgently in need of some tasty arab food. Beef is a bit dry, chicken shawarma is decent but the chicken shish tawook is awesome. Made from chicken breast it's skewered chicken breast (like souvlaki) tossed onto a fresh pita with your choice of fillings. Want more chicken? Try the Ali's half chicken dinner and get 2 legs of chicken on a bed of rice with salad for like $8. With a little side of hummus and that killer garlic sauce is mmm mmm good. Not recommended before a date though. (garlic)"}
{"text":"i am a big fan of this place.  it was a long time since i had schwarmas, but upon visiting TO, they were everywhere.   we tried Ali Baba first since it was a couple of blocks from where we staying. wow it was good. i really enjoyed it. the guys working there are friendly, they grill the meat upon ordering it, and they grill the sandwich w/o the foil paper so it gets nice and crispy.  i tried a couple of other places in TO, but i still enjoyed Ali Baba the most."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots for a late night snack. The chicken shawarmas are the best. I'll admit the place looks kinda sketchy but I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Yes, just like everybody else I am a fan of the falafel special on tuesdays! Two falafels for the price of one $4.50 now I think. The good thing is because of the demand the falafels are fresh too! I will sometimes pick it up for the family and take it home for dinner.   The falafels are good and great for students because you can eat one right away and save the second one for later. You can also discretely eat it in class and don't have to worry too much about your food smell spreading across the class. Their rice and other meats also look good but I have never tried them. They sell baklava as well, for the days you are craving something sweet but crunchy!"}
{"text":"I am a big shawarma fan and the thing that brought me into this little joint was the amazing smell that hit me while I was walking by. I quickly ordered a chicken shawarma with everything on it. Getting their specialty sauce (made in-house) is a must. The man behind the counter swiftly put my food together, wished me a good day and assured me that I would be back.   He couldn't be more right. It was the best shawarma I've had in a long long time."}
{"text":"I often stop at this location for a late night schwarma. Last night I was greated by a very friendly server behind the counter. I just grabbed a couple chicken schwarmas with all the toppings, including the spicy sauce, because it's a must.   On this particular occasion I questioned the server on the extra charge for the pickled turnip. I mentioned that the last time I was in they told me there was an additional charge for the turnip and I asked if this was something new or if it had always been that way. I was informed by the server that sometimes the day staff like to \"make a little more money\" by charging extra for certain toppings. Just something to be aware of it you ever go in during the day.   What I like about this location is the close proximity to my home. I do find their schwarmas to be a bit salty, but that goes for most schwarma places I've eaten at.   I'll definitely continue to go back again and again for a late night snack!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Ali Baba's.  Ali Baba's is a chain but I've never been to one before today.  I found it odd the server didn't know what kind of sauce the chicken was sitting in.  I ordered a shawarma.  The choice was either chicken or beef and I got chicken.  Lots of fresh ingredients could go on it ... I just got tomatoes and a creamy garlic sauce.  This is only the third shawarma I've ever had and it was good.  It was grilled like a panini so the outside was a bit crusty and the insides were warm.  The garlic sauce had a nice bite to it.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"After waiting on slow service from a restaurant down the street, we decided to eat at Ali Baba's. We were both hangry and this hit the spot both on a customer service level and tummy wise! We were immediately greeted with two warm and friendly smiles. They gave us time to place our order. Upon making my veggie wrap, they asked me what I wanted and didn't want, they were clear, not rushed and made sure my wrap was tight to perfection; especially since they gave me extra toppings in place of the eggplant. This is the only Ali Babas I will go to in the city so far. Too bad other locations don't put enough time and care into their customers orders."}
{"text":"This Ali Baba's is literally terrible. They can't take an order correctly at all. Their shawarma sucks. They are cheap when it comes to adding the good ingredients, and due to the location you can't get a shawama anywhere else. Ive ordered a chicken shawarma plate, I kid you not, the plate came with a teaspoon of chicken - place sucks"}
{"text":"Opened earlier this year, this recognized franchise now occupies an old cheque cashing store on the popular Bloor W strip. This is one of those go to franchises that I frequent to get a decent meal while on the go, and though over the years there have been really good franchises there are pretty lousy ones too.  I came here a few weeks ago while waiting for a craigslist contact and despite being a newer store it still needs a lot of tlc to get it up to the standard of the others within walking distance. The chicken shawarma itself was good and it was everything I've come to expect but the sides here are dry, overcooked or completely stale. I ordered the garlic potatoes and it was extremely salty and dry, it was clear that they have been out for days and reheated. Needless to say I had to bin it.   If you're looking for a great experience this isn't the place. Want a good shawarma cheap and fast it for take out? Then this place might be for you, but you wont want to stick around for a while."}
{"text":"The employees don't care and the food tastes like it. It's hit or miss. Sometimes the food is decent sometimes you feel like Anthony Bourdain exploring some sloppy street food. Some employees go cheap on toppings, some are fair.  I know I know, shawarma is Best enjoyed by drunk people. But when you can get something in Montreal like Amir or Basha, this place place could be much better."}
{"text":"Walking into this place, it feels like a typical middle eastern place. Walking up to order some food, you really feel like it. The staff were very quick and wanted everything as fast and efficient as possible. I barely had time to think of what I wanted before they had thrown everything together and stuck it on the toaster. Fast food indeed.   The food itself was good. Nothing amazing but good. Also very fast. Just would be expecting a few more smiles from the cooks in places like this."}
{"text":"I've frequented this specific location a few times and have spent good money there. Overall, the food to me is okay, nothing spectacular but you get what you pay for.  Usually I get a chicken plate without rice as I can't digest Heavy carbs well. The lady there who appears to be a manager or owner is always yelling at the staff to charge people for extra. You can't even get a tiny bit of tabouli in a wrap without her yelling to charge customers 50 cents. She also only will give you two salads and won't give you anything extra to sub the gross potatoes or rice.  The last straw for me was the last time I went in there. I was about fifth back in line. Ahead of me someone ordered a falafel wrap. They made the customer a chicken wrap and asked the guy if He'd take that instead. Like any normal human being he said he did care because that's not what he ordered. The lady then put it to the side after and then tried to offer it to me and was mad when I wanted tabouli in it because they couldn't sell it. Oh and guess what! 50 cents!!  The staff there are really unpleasant. Every time I go in, I feel like I'm asking for a million dollars if I ask for something extra. The staff disregard people, treat you like you're extra work for them and are super rude. There is one younger girl that works on the weekend that is super nice, she should be on the only one allowed to work at that place.  I just noticed a middle eastern restaurant a little more west down the street. Funny, one of the guys that worked at that Ali Baba's now works there! Save your money and go to a restaurant where they actually value customers!!"}
{"text":"Small portions... Couldn't believe how small the shawarma pitas are. I ordered a beef and chicken and the pitas were basically flat. Service was crap I asked for no radish and cabbage and they proceeded to put both. I heard another person order and they asked for extra everything obviously they have been there before and experienced Toronto's smallest shawarmas. Funny how when I went to another alibabas on the north end of the city everything was great. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"Disgusted after my last experience! I've been frequenting here for a while, despite the lackluster food quality, as I live nearby. However after my last visit I will not be patronizing this location ever again.  I arrived at around 7pm on a monday and ordered the the Chicken Schwarma wrap. Although it was close enough to dinner rush, the chicken \"schwarma\" was scooped out of a bin (not taken directly from the schwarma), and was placed directly in the wrap (not grilled). As a result, the schwarma was cold. Further, the chicken tasted to be rancid and had a foul odor. I took a few bites, and had to toss the entire thing. As I write this, one day later, I now have painful stomach cramps and indigestion, which suggests to me that the chicken was in fact compromised.  I've been to other AB's, and have been mostly satisfied, however this location is the exception. Each time I've gone I've been disappointed, as the food is lackluster and lacks freshness. The service is also poor.  Suffice to say I will NOT be returning"}
