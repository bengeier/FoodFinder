{"text":"My wife and I just happen to stumble upon this place and man it was great! Family owned business and they make you feel at home. I had their white rice and beans with the fried plantains, my wife had their chicken. The meat just fell right off the bone. Bring your appetite because the portions are heavy! She loved it! I live in Gilbert and now we're regulars at FrinGos kitchen."}
{"text":"Tastes like Abuelas. No complaints here. Very happy I found this place. Very happy! I got an alcapuria and it's pretty tasty, arroz con gandules and I can't tell the difference from this and my grandmas or tia's. I really hope this place sticks around."}
{"text":"I ordered food from yelp eat 24 it said they were cookie g my order I walked over to pick it up and they were closed even though it said 11 7 they didn't notify anyone  including eat 24 that's bad business practice I tell everyone but not any more disappointing unprofessional business practice"}
{"text":"This is an absolutely wonderful restaurant. I had the traditional rice with beans and pulled pock. It was amazing."}
{"text":"Was craving fried plantains and this place hit the spot. I loved the rice and beans they serve. very full of flavor, savory and fresh. I'm not a huge meat eater but my husband loved the pork. I wish there were some veggie options but for now I will keep coming back for the flavorful dishes available. I appreciate the seasoning and cooking that goes into the \"side\" dishes and for me they make an amazing meal!"}
{"text":"Must say that the food is fresh & portion size is fair. The family business is great, love seeing a new small business in town.   location not bad to drive to. Great Latino food.   Thank you chef for a job well done & my family is pleased with the great tasting food.   May God bless this business & the owner's in front of it.     Happy to be a client . Ortiz Family."}
{"text":"Omg the food is delicious. Try the pollo guisado! It was very flavorful and they give you a lot of food. The owners were so friendly and walked us through the menu explaining all the items which was awesome. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I took my co workers for lunch today. The food was great. It came close to my mom cooking."}
{"text":"Tastes just like abuela's food! Nothing like finding a place that has home cooked food. Prices are just right too, with the amount of food you get (which is a ton)."}
{"text":"Best Puerto Rican food I've ever had. Great atmosphere, great people, great food. The staff is so personal and helpful. I was having a bad day and the owner, Urias made my day. This place is a must go!! Love this place! Love everything about this place. :)."}
{"text":"Great food!  I was a bit apprehensive at the appearance of the place, but am really happy that I tried it.  Very tender slow-cooked meats that practically melt in your mouth.  The combo plate was a perfect size, though of course we overdid it and tried a few appetizers as well.  Nothing disappointed, and the leftovers were something looked forward to.  The outgoing guy running the joint - Urias I think it was - gave us a thorough rundown of the menu and showed us most everything before we ordered, so we wouldn't get something we didn't like. That was VERY helpful.  He was a great host!  The place is tiny, and they close awful early for what I'm used to, but there's only a couple of them that run the place so understandable.  We got the feeling it wasn't the cleanest spot in town, but then again, if you've ever dined in Puerto Rico, this place is actually spotless in comparison. :)"}
{"text":"I was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico and I was raised in Pennsylvania. Ever since I moved to Arizona I always look for a place to sit and enjoy some good home cooked Puerto Rican food. This is just what I was looking for, great food and a good environment to sit down and enjoy a good meal. The food was excellent . They make a delicious alcapuria."}
{"text":"We found this place through PHX New Times weekly feature. I just happened to notice it and told my other half about it whom just happens to be Peurto Rican from NY - he has been here for 5 years and literally jumped at the chance to have food from home. He is a tough critic coming from a heavily traditional Puerto Rican family.  We got a little lost the first time, but eventually found it. My bf just about cried when we spotted the Boriqua flag over the entrance.   Eating here is like having dinner with your family or at a friend's house. 100% genuine Puerto Rican hospitality. The owner was so very kind and welcoming. A humble man that clearly has a passion for what he does and his heritage.  Everything was fresh, hot and generous portions for an affordable price.  We ordered nearly everything on the menu -including Arroz con Gandules (which they give you a choice of either white or Yellow pigeonpea rice),  Bistec Encabollado which was cooked perfectly not too tender not too tough, Sweet fried plantains crispy on the outside, sweet soft and piping hot on the inside, Hot Pulled pork,  and Pinchos which are served glazed with your choice of one of 3 tropical savory sauces.  my go to every time are the Pastellios (fried stuffed meat turnovers) which come in steak, ground beef, chicken, pork or potato. They are affordable, BIG and the perfect snack.    Long story short, We quickly became regulars here."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and authentic!  I had the Pernil which was moist and delicious and perfectly seasoned I also had the arroz con gandules and it was fluffy and delicious. I will be back!! The restaurant is clean, bright and inviting and the staff were welcoming and very nice."}
{"text":"Tried this place looking for ethnic food. Is not what I expected. No flavors, just a different \"mexican style\" food with a lot of fillers. The cashier/server was very friendly. No plates just to go boxes :("}
{"text":"Authentic Puerto Rican food! Actually, I think it's better than some of the food I tired in Puerto Rico. I have gotten the Pernil with arroz con gandules a few times and it is consistently amazing. The guy who works the counter is always very friendly. Great good, great service, and low prices."}
{"text":"I was standing outside reading the menu, feeling intimidated since I was totally unfamiliar with Puerto Rican food. The door shortly opened and the nicest gentleman ( the owner) asked if i would like a sample!  I am impressed when an owner is engaging and takes time to come invite you to try his food! He carefully walked us through the menu, nuances of Puerto Rican food and proudly gave us sample after sample! SOLD! The food was amazing, flavorful and plentiful! Highly recommend this proud family run restaurant!"}
{"text":"I ordered dinner to-go. The young man who answered the phone wasn't very personable when taking the order. I also mentioned the free 20 oz. drink if I mentioned Yelp. He said he didn't know anything about it, but that he'd put my food order in. Once I arrived to get my food, another man (owner?) asked me what drink I'd like. That was nice that he honored the free drink. My husband and I really enjoyed the food. I'm glad to have Puerto Rican food in the neighborhood and will return to try other entrees."}
{"text":"First legit spot I found so far in AZ. couple other spots I went to n they were ok but this places tops! the most legit I've tasted since leaving NY! if you want real deal Rican food, check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is delicious, the owner and his wife are super friendly and easy to talk to, and the portions are definitely worth the price.  I've been here a few times, order a few different things, and have never been let down. For delicious Puerto Rican food this place is a stellar choice."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the tostones and pastellilo! Food is good and priced reasonably."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic P.R. food. My daughter and I both ordered the Pollo Guisado, tastes just like my grandma's recipe!  Now I have a place to go when I am craving \"eat at home\"!"}
{"text":"We've tried other Puerto Rican restaurants in the valley and although they were OK, they seemed to lack in authentic Boricua flavor. Fringo,'s has it pretty good. The pollo guisado was fantastic and the habichuelas were made just how I like them. The alcapurrias needed a little bit of help but not everyone can replicate that flavor unless it came from a dirty black pot in pi√±ones. :)  Overall though I think they have something good cooking at Fringo,'s."}
{"text":"Pernil (roasted pork) with arroz con gandules( yellow rice n beans) tostones (fried plantains) and potato ball deep fried stuffed with meat, OMG!!!! Stumbled upon this place via yelp. It's amazingly fresh cooked to order hot and delicious. Give it a try. Puerto Rican at it's finest. Topped off with coco rico and goya cola champagane"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Awesome service! Very friendly.  Got the pork shoulder, will be back to try the next dish."}
{"text":"Great PR food! If you are in the area, it is worth the stop. Prices are good especially for the dinner plate size."}
{"text":"Had the pollo guisado with plantains and yellow rice - salty, sweet, and delicious! Love Puerto Rican food! Friendly service here, too."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!! I ordered the Pernil with Arroz con Gandules and I ordered a side of Maduros! So so good!!! I used to live in NY and miss eating Puerto Rican food. So glad they made it to AZ! Gotta try it!!"}
{"text":"So good! I got the pork plate. It reminded me of home cooked food from my childhood. The hot sauce is something special!"}
{"text":"Excellent pork and chicken. The rice and beans and stuffed meat pastry were also quite good. I ate my fill and went back for seconds. I'm glad to have tried this place."}
{"text":"Went back to try a few more entrees for dinner tonight. We took our order to go, and when we got home found the chicken kabobs to be severely undercooked. We had to \"nuke\" them to a temp they were edible. They tasted OK but we were a bit turned off at that point. The pernil and tostones were so salty I took a few bites and the rest went in the trash. So disappointing. I sooooo want to love this place. Their rice and beans are THE BOMB, but I highly doubt we'll be back just for that."}
{"text":"I found this place on Twitter and brought my friend from Lebanon who was anxious to try something totally new.  We both enjoyed the great tasting food, sampling many different items and bringing back lots of great memories for me of grandma's cooking! Everything was fresh and great portions, I am so happy they are conveniently located in Chandler. I have to admit I was disappointed when I heard they won't be serving pasteles yet but it will be coming during the holidays :)"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Puerto Rican food since I've never had it before, and per recommendation from a friend, I ended up at FrinGo's Kitchen. Think of a small family owned restaurant and this is the perfect example of that! I had gone closer towards closing time to pick up a meal; I was warmly welcomed in & received a brief rundown of the menu.  I finally decided on the Pollo Guisado (chicken with potatoes) with half Arroz con Gandules (rice with pigeon peas & ham)  & half Arroz Blanco (white rice) and the Habichuelas Guisada (beans). The chicken & potatoes were definitely the highlight of the meal - the chicken was perfectly cooked & was just falling apart perfectly off the bone. The beans were tasty as were both the rice items; each had its own unique flavor. If you get the chicken, I'd recommend getting just the white rice since it went really well with the broth. The only note I had was that the food was a little bit salty, but otherwise delicious.  Everything was already made & served cafeteria-style so it was a quick trip in & out. There were a lot of interesting items on the menu so I'll be returning to give those a try."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was friendly.  We were not familiar with Puerto Rican food, and the gal at the counter patiently described the dishes and gave us an array of samples to try.  We loved every bite, and are planning a return trip soon to try some of the other options."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident. I was in the area and smelled something really delicious. When I looked around, I saw Fringo's, serving Puerto Rican food. I walked in and started looking at the menu. The owner was behind the counter and explained the whole menu, giving me several samples. It all tasted great and I knew my husband and son would like the pork.  I brought them back for dinner that night. Everything was delicious. Son had pork, husband had the chicharones and I had a chicken kebab, glazed with their homemade mange BBQ. The owner also offered their homemade hot sauce. I was vinegar based and definitely hot. Son and hubby loved it.  This place is super friendly, locally and family owned, clean and inviting. It is well priced for delicious food that tastes like it was cooked at home. It is also very fast. We will be back many times in the future."}
{"text":"My first time having Puerto Rican food, and it was pretty epic :) I wasn't sure what to expect, but what I received in a return was more than I bargained for. I came in to get food, and I left having received an experience!  Not only is this a locally/independently owned restaurant, but its ran by a family doing what they do best and putting mama's recipes out there for the neighborhood to enjoy. For someone who is always eating on the go, the distinct taste of the food stood out to me; it was of a very high quality and like something you'd expect eating at someone's home. The staff is very friendly and makes you feel very welcome, which serves to make everything even better.   I've attached a picture of what I ate. Shredded pork and Arroz con Gandules (Yellow rice with pigeon peas and ham). Muy delicioso!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't say that I've ever had Puerto Rican food and this was better than I could have imagined! I ordered the ground beef pastelillo, tostones, and pernil with arroz con gandules. The portion sizes are extremely  generous. One pastelillo could probably be enough for lunch and the pernil is enough for at least two people.  Everything was flavorful and the pernil was tender and moist. The beans have green olives which gives a nice salty and briny flavor. The ground beef pastelillo was out of this world! I highly recommend ordering one, no matter what else you get. I ordered takeout and the man at the counter was very friendly confirming my order and offering condiments."}
{"text":"Boricuas on the set! Just ate here and was pleasantly surprised. After reviewing the menu online and making my mouth water with anticipation, I decided to catch an Uber and make my way to Fringo's!  Upon arriving, I knew it was legit, because I caught a sneak peak at the caserola aka cooking pan and noticed the familiar patina.   I ordered online and was able to sit down and eat while chatting with Vanessa, one of the owners who was welcoming and friendly. I briefly met Urias, the owner, not because he didn't want to come out of the kitchen but, because he was throwing down in the kitchen!   Alcapurrias, Empanadillas and Arroz con Gandules brought me back to the Isla Del encato and to The boogie down Bronx. I now live in California, and travel to AZ on a monthly basis and this will be one of my go to spots. Well done on the food, I look forward to your success!"}
{"text":"I have lived in AZ for 8 years and have been dreaming of a place where I can get authentic Puerto Rican food!  Not Cuban, not Mexican....Puerto Rican!! I found my place....AND I don't have to go to Phoenix or Mesa to get it.  I am Puerto Rican and this place is ridiculously good.  My plan is to try everything on the menu and so far everything I have had is delicious, it really reminds me of Mami's cooking.  The beans are outstanding, the arroz con gandules has a true Puerto Rican flavor with the perfect amount of seasoning...I almost cried when I first ate the food I was so happy!!  If you want to know what Puerto Rican food really tastes like, you need to come here.  If you are Puerto Rican you need to come here. The owners are super nice and really want you to ensure you enjoy the food!  If I could give this place 10 stars I would.  Truly recommend this place if you love Puerto Rican food!"}
{"text":"Came in and ordered a bunch of items... Pork empanadas, potato ball, fried steak with rice and beans... Every single thing was off the chain delicious! Full of flavor and fresh... And so inexpensive considering the high quality of the food.  Heard about them from Best of Phoenix... I highly recommend swinging by for some seriously tasty grub!"}
{"text":"This place gets great reviews so we decided to give it a try.  The owner is great, tells you what everything is and is personable.  He said they have been open about a year and his sister is the cook. We each ordered something different that way we could try a variety of items.  We got the Chicharron which was cubed pieces of pork, and while it was tasty it was pretty dry and needed some kind of sauce.  Another dish we got was the Bistec Empanizado which was a breaded cubed steak, which was tasty but again a bit dry, the Pollo Guisado  was tasty and very juicy and the Pernil which was a shredded pork was also tasty.  The dishes come with white rice or the Arroz con Gandules which is a yellow rice and has olives and peas in it.  The beans are soooo good though.  We also tried the Relleno de Papa which is like mashed potatoes and ground beef in a ball, it was good.  The Maduros which are the sweeter plantain were done perfectly."}
{"text":"Holy criminy this place was awesome! I love plantains and these were exceptional. Their pastelillos were so savory and delicious, and the hot sauce was like biting right into a habenero - so good. The pinchos with mango bbq sauce was moist and a little smokey, and tasted just like REAL barbecued chicken. My friend had the bistec encabollado with yellow rice and is adamant that I try it next time. We will be adding this to our weekend take out rotation."}
{"text":"just like my grandmas cooking! Amazing food, this is the best Puerto Rican restaurant I've went to Arizona. I was born in PR, so I know what real Puerto Rican food is, and hands down Fringo Kitchen has it!"}
{"text":"Wow -- what a find! Had some outstanding Puerto Rican food here last week: Pernil (slow-cooked pork shoulder) with rice and beans, plantains (both sweet and savory), and flan.  This is a very small place in one of the many look-alike strip malls in Chandler, but it's definitely worth seeking out."}
{"text":"Ahh my gosh! I truly dont even know where to start. I just spent an easy $40 here and it was so worth it! Ive been looking for a puerto rican kitchen out here since i moved here 3 years ago! I FINALLY found it! Being inside felt like home! And the food was incredible!!! The meat just falls apart or right off the bone!  I was disappointed by NOTHING! The gentlemen that assisted me did a great job also! At least try it once, thats all it takes! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  Their beans are the closest I can taste that reminds me of my abuelas beans back in Puerto Rico. The owner is very nice and staff is awesome.  I have taken many friends and coworkers and ALL have loved it and come back.  Lately I go and it's packed, love to hear people talking with my accent, listening to salsa eating good food.... Props!"}
{"text":"Best I've had in a while thought my sister in law  was in the kitchen cooking. Puerto Rican cuisine at its finest comfort level. So close to Panama food that was lime mamma use to make."}
{"text":"As Adam Richman has said, \"OH my goodness.  Oh.  My.  Goodness!\"    I've had FrinGo's bookmarked for awhile and finally made my way over there this week.  I was  craving comfort food and this certainly fit the bill.  On my first visit I had the chicken and potatoes with yellow rice and beans.  Pollo Guisado, arroz con gandules y habichuelas guisada. ($8.00)  And of course I got an order of maduros ($2.50), which are fried sweet plantains.  I haven't eaten like this since I lived in Florida and it took me right back.  The chicken and potatoes have been braised to perfection and the flavorful yellow rice and beans are the perfect accompaniments.  The maduros were fried perfectly, soft and sweet with a caramelized edge.  I'll probably get those every single time I eat here.  What a treat!  Today I tried the pernil (slow roasted pork $8.50) with the same two sides.  White rice is also an option.  And the maduros.  AND a relleno de papa ($2.50) which is a ground beef stuffed potato ball.  That relleno was perfect.  Fried golden brown on the outside and then full of potatoes and seasoned ground beef.  Everything was delicious once again.  The pernil was tender and they gave me a huge portion.  Besides being a great tasting meal, the prices are reasonable and I've been able to get 2 meals out of each one.    The staff has been very friendly and helpful on both visits and there are about 8 tables if you dine in.  My preference is to bring it home, have a beer with my meal, rub my full belly for good luck, and then take a huge nap.  Oh my goodness."}
{"text":"Amazing food! So happy to have a Puerto Rican restaurant so close. .the chicharrons were on the money, perfect place. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!! I felt like I was back in the Bronx,NY at one of my Puerto Rican friend's house. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you for bringing a little of my New York memories to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Food cooked with good intentions all share the same depth and richness regardless of the culture from which the food calls home. The food at FrinGo's is simple, fresh, delicious, and cooked with good intentions. It's like having a home cooked meal without having to be at home. I ordered the pernil and arroz con gandules for lunch, and decided to try the Malta Goya and Coco Rico to drink. The pernil  (roasted pork shoulders) was simply seasoned, which let the wonderful taste of the pork shine through. The arroz con gandules was also simply seasoned, but in its simplicity accompanied the pernil quite well. I wish I had ordered some plantains too, but it was a bit too late when I realized that I was missing it. The Malta Goya is a soda made of malt (think malted shakes or Whoopers). That's exactly what it tastes like: A rich, carmely soda...and unlike what one of the diners at FrinGo's suggested, no it is not a prune Soda although it may taste like it to some. I haven't tried the Coco Rico yet, I'm saving it for later; how can one go wrong with coconut soda. I spent about $14, which included tax and a $2 tip, and I left with a happy belly, a smile on my face, and a a nod to the \"prune soda\" lady. LOL. :)"}
{"text":"Love Puertorican food?  Maybe you've never tried it before and you are sooooo curious about this savory island fare?  Either way, you should give Fringo's a try, you'll be happy you did!   Up front..I am Puertorican, born on the island and have been eating this cuisine my whole life...all 3+ getting closer to 4 decades haha! I am a harsh critic, these flavors are the ones that molded my palate.  I am writing this based on those flavors in puertorican cuisine, not how trendy or creative the menu or location is etc.   The ambiance is non existent.  Its a small hole-in-the-wall type place with a few tables and chairs. It was kinda warm inside and the food is served in styrofoam containers.  You come here for the amazing flavor of the food and I didn't mind as the prices were in line with that feel and the quality of the food was excellent.    I had the alcapuria, an ice cold Coco Rico, arroz con gandules, pernil and even tried thier habichuelas guisadas and pique (a spicy and flavorful vinegar), since it came with my dish. The alcapuria is an appetizer or snack. On the island you can find these sold near the beach. They are made of green plantain, which is starchy, yet packs much more flavor than a potato, it is seasoned and filled with a picadillo of ground beef that was cooked with sofrito (its a combo of veggies, ususally culantro, cilantro, green bell pepper, onion, garlic, aji dulce (as sweet small pepper that looks like a scotch bonnet but is not spicy), stuffed green olives, annatto seed (for color and flavor) and depending on the cook some tomato sauce.  The alcapuria was seasoned very well, it was a deep fried crispy on the outside and so soft throughout until you got to the ground beef mixture. The flavors in the meat really complemented the plantain and the juxaposed textures were basically a party in my mouth.  Well done Frigos! Making this in my kitchen is a pain in the you know what, so its GREAT to know I can come here if I only want a few for myself or my immediate family.  The arroz con gandules is a MUST try, really, do it, forego the white rice and take a chance, you'll LOVE it.  Its a yellow rice (it gets its color from tomato and annato seed) with pigeon peas (gandules) which taste the the love child of a lentil and pea.  There were pieces of stuffed olive and ham in my rice and it was just the right texture--again, OMG well done Fringos! The habichules guisadas were tasty as well.  Very true to traditional, but not typically something eaten with arroz con gandules. Usually this is eaten with white rice, however it came with my meal, tasted good, so I ate it! =) Last but not least was the pernil.  I have to be PERFECTLY honest; typically this is a roasted port dish and the hog can be roasted whole or it can be just a cut, which is most usually the pork butt.  This tasted like it was braised or more like chuncks cooked in the oven. With that being said, it was DELISH. I could taste the mojito seasoning in it as its usually prepared with garlic, vinegar (which tenderizes the meat), salt, pepper, olive oil and again annatto.  SO. DARN. GOOD. I may have scared the staff, I ate EVERYTHING, even the pique, which is suggest as the acidity in it complements the tastes of the pork and savory flavors really well.     The lady up front was very nice and brought me all my food.  The food was also FRESH. I got there 5 mins after opening and they were still cooking up some of the items, plus my alcapuria was fried fresh. It was brought to me literally steaming hot.   Definitely give this place a try, it is well worth it whether you can make it yourself or have never had it before. Don't be afraid to ask questions, they were really nice!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Coming from someone who grew up on authentic Puerto Rican food, this food is legit. Seriously, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"this place is amazing everyone should try this place it is hands down the best Puerto Rican food in az"}
{"text":"The Pernil was very nice as was the arroz con gandules and the frijoles. The bistec was a bit tough and the platanos were a tad salty. Other than that, it's very authentic."}
{"text":"So glad there is an authentic Puerto Rican restaurant in Chandler! Service is great, food is delicious and even my friends daughter, who is SUPER picky, loved the food there! Can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Cute small place next to the Chinese take-out restaurant, Red Dragon.  I ordered take-out on line and paid with a credit card, a simple process.  Even able to put in a pick up time, very handy.  The cashier was pleasant and friendly and right on time for my pick up.  I had wonderful fried sweet plantain MADUROS, & Pastelillo, a Puerto Rican meat turnover, plus a main dish - Pernil a Slow roasted pork butt, which came with yellow rice and delicious juicy beans.  So much tender shredded pork I kept half for a sandwich tomorrow!  I'm stuffed but will return to try other menu items in the near future."}
{"text":"Happened to be in this plaza and saw this place.  A quick check on Yelp and I was intrigued.  Puerto RIcan food, and some good ratings.  So we decided to try it!  The place is tiny.  The owners are a brother and sister.  The brother is out front, and very gregarious.  And very helpful.  After some discussion we ordered the pollo guisado and the bistec empinazado.  Both come with beans (like kidney beans) and rice (either white or \"con gandules\").    The pollo was almost like a chicken stew.  The flavors were simple, but good.  My empinazado was almost like a chicken-fried steak.  Again, simple flavors but good.  Maybe a little salty.  The beans were surprisingly good.  They aren't just beans, but have other stuff (and seasoning) in them.  Same for the rice.  Good stuff.  Portions were large, and service was responsive.  It's nice dealing with the owner.  He actually cares about the business!  I also got to sample the pork pernil.  The only reason I didn't order it today is because I wanted to sample as much as possible this visit to see if I wanted to come back.  The pernil was really nice.  I think we will be coming back to try a few other things.  The food is simple but good, and I like supporting one-of-a-kind restaurants as opposed to chains.  A sampler platter would be a good idea for the menu."}
{"text":"Very friendly service and delicious food! The portion size of the Pollo Guisado and Chicken Pastellilo is substantial with the amount of meat, rice, and beans. It takes a bit of effort to consume in a single sitting but worth it to taste both dishes while they are fresh. Prices were very fair and in-line with expectations."}
{"text":"You know how some places advertise serving authentic regional cuisine (Italian, Greek, Ethiopian, Chinese, etc) and say \"Just like grandma used to make\" - then it turns out grandma couldn't cook worth sh*t?  This is NOT like that!   Everything we sampled (Pollo Guisado, Pernil, Arroz con Gandules, Tostones, Carne Molida Pastelillos, Bistec Encabollado, and more) was not only authentic but flavorful and truly tasty!  This family owned and run place resisted the temptation to over spice with regional flavors and instead let your taste buds enjoy the subtle interplay of the multi-cultural influences which contribute to good Puerto Rican cuisine.  The beverages were standard fare and they do have malta available, but I missed having some good coffee with my meal.  Definitely a must visit again!  I hope their business is successful because I'd like to see them expand their hours and maybe add some traditional seafood offerings to the menu."}
{"text":"Such a great new place! We did not know what to expect walking into a Puerto Rican restaurant but it did not disappoint.  Not only was the service excellent, but they let us sample their other entree options while we waited for our food to be ready. The chicken kabobs with the guava BBQ sauce were delicious and the portions were huge, left more than enough for a second meal and it was so reasonably priced for what you are getting.  Will definitely be returning in the future, great place for a quick and yummy meal."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, even better employees. awesome customer service. Food is absolutely fantastic. Taste just like home made like Abuela is in the kitchen cooking. Great portions. Must try the arroz con gandules with the pollo guisado."}
{"text":"Thanks Fringos for the BEST plantain lasagna!!! This is a divine ground beef plantain stacked lasagna with a side of rice and savory beans for $8. Love love love. We've been to Puerto Rico many times and this food is exactly alike. The alcapurrias are exactly like what we use to get in Pi√±ones. Thanks guys for the delicious food and smiles!!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and was referred here by a friend, I fell in love. The food is amazing so far I've tried two dishes and plan on trying everything. Not only is the food amazing but the overall environment of the restaurant is comforting. Family owned business and very kind people. One of new favorite spots!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have eaten here and both times I am leaving very satisfied! Tasty Puerto Rican cuisine! Mofongo special today was delicious with yummy plantain and chicharrones. Staff is extremely helpful with the \"lay\" person here. They explain what each dish is and walk you through what is what. Portions are also big so bring your appetite! My wife and I can't wait to try some pasteles during the holidays!"}
{"text":"For Puerto Rican food its the place to go. There are a few Puerto Rican restaurants in the east valley now.  If your close you should try it. I suggest you call before going to see what's on the menu for that day."}
{"text":"We wanted to try something different and we were so happy we did! This service was so helpful and kind. The woman explained the menu and showed us the foods that were cooked. She also made suggestions for us when we ordered. I got the pollo guisado and it was absolutely delicious! The chicken fell right off the bone. My mom got the pernil which was slow roasted pork with rice and beans. We shared both. We also got fried plaintains and they were my favorite! I high recommend this place."}
{"text":"Just like New York style nuyorican food"}
{"text":"Everything was delicous & tasted like it came from Mom's kitchen. We had chicken and potatoes with rice & beans & empanada type thing."}
{"text":"My daughter and I absolutely love this place! The food is always delicious. I've not had a sit down experience there, we always call in our order.   I ordered from their catering menu for my daughters graduation party last year. Everyone invited was thrilled with the food. The catering was reasonably-priced and it was a lot of food.   The staff has always been friendly and welcoming. I highly recommend this establishment to all."}
{"text":"I just loved this place!!!! Food was great and service was fantastic!!!!  So thankful I found it. Finally a place where I can eat real, tasty, Puerto Rican  food. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I am a native New Yorker that moved to Arizona 10 months ago and I am so happy I found this place. I was there today with my family and the food was simply amazing. I did not think I could find a place like this good here. I will be back often."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when I was have a pregnancy craving for really good Puerto Rican food. I'm so happy with this place. Very friendly staffed and family owned. Food was very flavorful and had many authentic options. Try this place. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Second time here, it won't be the last. My Dominican and Cuban heritage is in need for good tostones and chicharones. Bringing my family here was excellent. Good people working here."}
{"text":"We came accross this place while searching for Puerto Rican food in the Phoenix area. We decided to give it a try and we are glad we did. As soon as you walk in the aroma is delicious and they have ready made food, as well as a la carte items to order. This is the second time we come in because it is delicious just like back in Puerto Rico. The taste is authentic and the owners are very nice! They usually have a special of the day going too. Everything tastes fresh and the portions are big for the price. I reccomend trying the pinchos, the sandwiches, and the fritters to get a real taste of Puerto Rico!"}
{"text":"So bummed this place closed.  I'm from Buffalo, NY and this was the closest place I found to PR food that tasted like home.  If you ever re-open please find me and I'll come back"}
{"text":"My husband & I tried this place. Family owned. Tastes very homemade. We ate the Bistec encebollado and Pollo Guizado, both con Arroz con gandules and it was really delicious. Very friendly service. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in the first time today and will definitely be back. Super tasty pork, rice, and beans and the hot habanero sauce ties all together. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for lunch.. excellent food!! Mofongo was A++ my favorite are tebtostones.. Bistec and arroz con gondules were in flic as well.. it DEF satisfied my my Caribbean tooth!!! Excellent service as well"}
{"text":"I am so happy I tried this place out. The food is absolutely amazing! We had a chicken and beef entree, both came with your choice of rice and beans. We also had the fried plantains and the stuffed potato ball. The food was full of flavor and very satisfying. Service was fast and friendly, and the food was well with the money! I highly recommend this place, I can't wait to come back and have more!"}
{"text":"Meat and starch! FrinGo's is a tiny little shop that has slow-cooked meats and fried foods. We browsed through the menu before deciding on sharing the pollo guisado, chicharron, and bistec encebollado. Each was flavorful, and expertly prepared. We were all oohing and ahhing over each bite!   Service was friendly and warm. The only negative I found was that the cleanliness of the restaurant could be better.   Overall though, we left as very satisfied customers.  P.S. If they ever offer mofongo I'll be at this restaurant in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far. I would go alot more if it wasnt for one minor detail... I LIVE IN TUCSON!!! Thats how good this place is, I will drive almost two hours now just to get a plate of some good home cooked food.   This is a small place and the owner/ his family are very friendly. My first trip in there he made me feel like family not like a customer. I've never went to a place where someone was as passionate about their food as them!!! He went through the menu with me because I had never been there before. He told me the most popular by customers and he told me his favorite. Well I went with the Chicharron cause he said it was his favorite. Im no fool if he as the owner is willing to tell me his favorite is something other than the favorites he must be sure of greatness. I had Chicharron with yellow rice and beans, a generous portion might I add for $8.50. The Chicharron was fried on the spot and food was out in about 5 minutes. My first time eating Chicharron and I must admit it was heavenly for a better choice of words. Oh to even speak further about how much he made me feel like family, he even introduced me to the cooks... his Mother and his Sister. I have zero complaints about this place from beginning to the end. He was super friendly and his family was too. More people need to be passionate about the food they cook and serve people.   This place is amazing and its definitely worth a try! I hope he stays true to his passion and I hope the community supports his company."}
{"text":"The food is great, must try. Arroz con gondules was yummy, platanos was delicious. Fast and fresh."}
{"text":"This tastes like good home cooking. I can't explain the amazing flavors that just hit my tongue."}
{"text":"This was the first time I ever tasted Puerto Rican food.  I am now a fan.  I ordered the pollo guisado and my husband ordered the pernil (slow roasted pork shoulder).  Both items were very flavorful and cooked to perfection.  We also ordered the Maduros (fried sweet plaintains) which were delicious.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  I was undecided between two dishes and was able to taste both before making a choice - it was hard to decide because both were tasty.    Prices for entrees were extremely reasonable.   The restaurant is small and doesn't have much ambience but the food and friendly service makes up for that.    We will return"}
{"text":"I found this place through just Yelpin' restaurants close to my house and Fringo's popped up. I am not Puerto Rican but my T√≠a is so I have definitely eaten some yummy food like my favorite Pernil! I ordered the Pernil with arroz con gandules and also the potato ball. The pernil lacked a little flavor but the arroz con gandules and potato were amazing! The customer service was great very nice ladies! When the owner came in he greeted everyone in the restaurant which was really nice. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been in the area for a year now and we just discovered it today. Truth be told, I have not tried Puerto Rican food until today and didn't expect to see it in the valley when searching for new restaurants. So today's experience was all about exploring various items on the menu. We ordered the Pernil with the artoz con gandules, habichuelas guisada, arroz blanco, pinchos with guava glaze, maduros, alcapurria, and pastelillo with chicken. Every bite was beyond delicious and the serving size was generous. The owners are friendly and the place is tidy. The location doesn't have a lot of foot traffic and if you drive too fast on Alma School you will miss it. So slow down and grab a seat inside - you will be well fed and planning your next visit before leaving. (They do have a service that delivers within a 5 mile radius which is a bonus for locals.)"}
{"text":"You could probably count the number of Puerto Rican restaurants in the Valley (worth going to) on one hand. And when we get a new one, it's a BIG deal.   FrinGo's Kitchen is a new place that opened up last week in Chandler. The restaurant that used to be here moved a few miles away. The new owners of this location gave the place a makeover. As you would expect, the inside is very colorful and inviting. There's plenty of seating and it's all comfy. It's clean inside as well. It's sort of fast casual I guess - you just walk up and order what you want and they will either call your name or bring it to your table depending on how busy they are, I'm sure.   I sampled a bit of everything while I was there. The owner was super nice and friendly (and bilingual), and he let me try a small amount of each of the chicken, the pulled pork, and the steak. I also bought some Pastillos - which are basically Empanadas - a few of each kind. The pulled porn was insane. I don't ever really get pork often, but this is some of the best I've tasted from any type of cuisine. The Pastillos were awesome. So much food inside each one, and they are large. I liked all of them, but my favorite was the ground beef (steak and chicken were excellent though - can't really go wrong). On food alone, they get a 5 from me.  It's obvious that this is a family-run place, and I'm told that they were originally from Puerto Rico. I've been crazy about Puerto Rican food since I visited there with my fiancee a few months ago. I can't tell you how happy I am that this is only a few miles from my house. I mean, I would prefer if it was walking distance of course, but we don't always get what we want. They said they might start delivering at some point... for now though, you'll have to go in to get it."}
{"text":"If you want real Puerto Rican food with no frills this is it! Easy, reasonable and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food! Boyfriend is Puerto rican and he loves this place. \"taste like home\" he says. It's a great little spot and I love there sweet plantains and shredded pork :) this is right down the street from us, so we will be visiting a lot"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  As a fan of Puerto Rican food, brought in my wife who's never had it before.  Only other places I've had Puerto Rican outside the Valley were in LA and NYC.  This is place.  Quite good.  Not the best (that was NYC), but good enough that even my wife said she'd come back  for the food.  First off, the owners are super personable, very friendly, and will tell you everything you need to know about the food if you've never had Puerto Rican before.  We ordered the tostones, pastelillo, the pernil, and the pollo guisado.  Both come with beans and we opted for the arroz congandules.  The tostones were perfectly cooked.  The owner gave us a side of hot sauce/mojo and dipping the tostones in there made them even better.  The pastelillo was deep fried deliciousness.  Super savory, good balance between crust and filling.  Both the pernil and pollo guisado were tender, moist, and flavorful.  Some might complain - you mostly get beans and rice and not enough meat.  Welcome to the real world fat America, where most people around the globe eat mostly beans and rice with not as much meat.  Would the value of the platter increase with a little more meat?  Sure.  But is it a bad thing that they serve food as they normally would everywhere else in the world?  Nope.  You eat a little of everything and believe me, there is enough meat to notice, to taste, and to fill you up.  We finished with a flan, which was good.  Not amazing, but good.  My wife hates flan but she liked this one.  I also ordered a Malta as my beverage because, you know. Puerto Rico.  Try it.  If you like Moxie, or sarsparilla, you will like Malta.  They don't serve mofongo or pasteles, which I was really hoping for, or soups.  So the menu is a little limited, but they hit most of the highlights and we enjoyed what we ordered.  We'll be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"We have PR friends and family and have been to PR twice. In fact we just got back last week!!!!!! Coming from the Bay Area and experiencing Sols in Marin County and Peredes in SF makes us wonder. Owner not so personable. Didn't feel the Boriqua spirit!!!, don't know it its a PR thing but we noticed someone walking in after we did, sat down and was served before us and given extras. I even conversed in Spanish to the owner as to how we liked the food....he didn't seem responsive!!! We are only hoping that his attitude changes with time because it would be bad for his business.  \"The Man wearing an original White Fedora\""}
{"text":"This just became a new favorite spot. Puerto Rican food at its best since my days back in PR!! Coworkers from the DR & PR say it's like home cooked food."}
{"text":"We got two different meals here and both were perfect. The chicken was seasoned as it should be and the steak and onions was tender. I will absolutely be going back."}
{"text":"Some of the best food ive had in a long time. You can taste the heart and soul in each dish. PR food at its finest. Just like grandmas!"}
{"text":"First time at the FrinGo's Kitchen and I love my Puerto Rican food, so I am happy to have one not to far from me.  - Food and appetizers was delicious - It is super clean - The FrinGo's Kitchen team member is super friendly - Bathroom super clean - Menu items reasonably price - Decor is very simple and basic yet clean - Great place to just chill out with friends"}
{"text":"It may be the only Puerto Rican food in Phoenix, but it is some of the best we have had since being in Puerto Rico.   The Pollo Guisado was spot on!  The Pernil was so tender and flavorful.  All the portions were generous.   The Alcapurritas was done to perfection.  Great filling on the inside.   The coconut custard was just incredibly creamy and good.  Loved the rice pudding with just the right amount of cinnamon.   Only gripe ... Needs to keep the brewed ice tea going all day."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Puerto Rican food, you can't go wrong here. The place is small and the owner makes you feel as though you are eating in his kitchen. His friendly attitude makes the food taste that much better. Nice portion sizes  are a bonus. The pulled pork was amazing and we had plenty of leftovers for dinner."}
{"text":"The food here is good. That's right ... good. We loved the chicken and potatoes, the rice and beans, the plantain wrapped (tamale??), and the friendly service. It's small. It's clean. It's just right - try them out!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying Puerto Rican food. When we first arrived, we thought we were crashing someone else's party. Another huge table was pulling all the chairs from us and literally there were only enough tables for us four and the huge party. The owner was such a good sport. He tried his best to make both tables as comfortable and as happy as possible. I admire his work ethnic and politeness. We ordered 3 different combos and my favorite was the chicken leg dish. The chicken was so tender and delicious. I'll definitely order that again. However, I am not too sure how much I like the beans mix with the rice. It is delicious but I am not a big fan of beans. My companies definitely enjoyed the food. I agree with other yelpers, some cleaning might definitely help this place   If you want to try Puerto Rican food I'll recommend this place."}
