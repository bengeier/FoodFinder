{"text":"This place serves Syrian food and is new so it needs a lot of improvements and here is an honest review of my experience. I went there with my wife and kids on a weekend afternoon, the place was not crowded but it had around 4-5 tables. The location is not really ideal and it is in an industrial area but I thought I should give it a chance as a friend of mine told me about it. 

Atmosphere: it is a family friendly place and the decor is nice, if you are with kids then you are on the safe side (parents know what I mean). With a Syrian style / traditional atmosphere and wonderful traditional Syrian music that sets a beautiful mood. 

Food: it was really nice and tasted, some plates were wonderful however I would have preferred if some other plates were a bit bigger compared to the price. I guess the dishes were very tasty that we wanted more. I have tried a lot of Arabic restaurants and I can honestly say that this is a place that would be in the \"Top 10\" list. 

Value / Money: as mentioned before some plates would be better if they were bigger... but in general it is a little bit over priced, however the food is tasty and it balances things. 

Service: this is the only reason that I did not give the place a 5-star rating. The server was very friendly and nice, however the overall service was slow, we waited a bit for the menus, for the food and for the bread (which was not as fresh as I hoped it would be) 

I would definitely go back again there and I hope I would update my review then. I surely hope it would have a 5star service and again the portions should be slightly more. 

I would recommend it"}

{"text":"I had dinner last night with my wife. The food and service was great. It is one of favorite restaurants in Montreal. If you like Syrian cuisine then this the place to go.  We had the traditional hummus, baba ghanouj, lintel soup, and fatoush salad. All we great! For the main dish we had Daoud Basha and Bameye with meat. It was well done and delicious. We had Amar El Deen (apricot juice) and Laban 3yran; a traditional Syrian drink which refreshing. The owner was checking on us all the time. A very friendly gentleman. I highly recommend this place"}
