{"text":"The original business closed down and was reopened by new owners, now calling it Jade Star Chinese Cuisine. Not sure how it was before but nothing here to bring me back. Here is a tip - do not order the fried wings. All (fish?) batter, not good all the way and floating in grease."}
{"text":"Since moving to Arizona, I've yet to find a Chinese restaurant as good as my favorites back home (Toledo, OH) and after experiencing the cuisine of Golden Star on Bell Rd, sadly, the search continues... 

I had my fingers crossed for Golden Star. The restaurant is fewer than two miles away AND THEY DELIVER! The menu is typical fare, and like the menus at every Chinese restaurant, doesn't bother to list the individual ingredients (vegetables) of each dish. Fortunately the person who answered the phone spoke wonderful English and spared me from getting the Hunan beef (cabbage, he said--YUCK!). 

I ordered Kung Pao Beef, extra spicy, General Tso's Chicken, extra spicy, and Chicken Egg Foo Young. The Kung Pao and the Egg Foo Young were combination dinners, which were 75 cents more but came with fried rice, crab puff and egg roll. The General Tso's included half a pint (I think) of white rice. Total bill including delivery charge and tip was $36, which averages out to $12/dish--too much. (Note: The menu said the combination dinners came with Egg Flower Soup--but I was informed that's a misprint.) 

I was told 30-35 minutes for delivery, but it was closer to 20. In the bag: three fortune cookies, a few packets of soy sauce, wontons, and two tiny containers of sweet & sour for the egg rolls--not even enough for one egg roll, never mind two. The nail in the coffin: No hot Chinese mustard! Unforgivable! The crab puffs and egg rolls were in the same containers as the entrees, and the moisture made them soggy. They could have easily been wrapped separately. Lastly, the entrees came in environmental unfriendly Styrofoam instead of the traditional cardboard.

The Kung Pao Beef was... decent. The sauce was gloopy and the diced vegetables (zucchini, water chestnuts, carrots, peas, celery) a replica of the meals served at Good China on Union Hills (another restaurant I don't much like). However, there was some spice to the beef as I requested. Not a lot of spice. And not a lot of beef. The ratio of meat to veg was heavily in favor of veg. 

The Egg Foo Young was like Egg Foo Young, Deconstructed. This dish typically has a patty topped with gravy, but this was two patties underneath an avalanche of vegetables (same as above) and chicken. These ingredients are supposed to be within the patty, like an omelet. Presentation aside, how did it taste? Well, frankly, it tasted BURNT.

Lastly, the General Tso's. I requested \"extra spicy\" but like a lot of the Chinese restaurants I've been to in the West Valley, Golden Star doesn't bring the heat. Mild, mild barely-there flavor. There were no vegetables in the dish, which means the saving grace was there was actually a lot of chicken. (Unlike the beef in my Kung Pao Beef.) 

Overall, a crushing disappointment. I can get better food for less money from Panda Express. If you're going to try Golden Star, my advice is to eat at the restaurant so you can send back the dishes that are displeasing and go for the slightly-more-reasonable lunch prices."}
{"text":"This place was the best Chinese food I've found in the area. I ordered the vegetable fried rice and received a heaping portion with large chunks of vegetables. Yum. Everything tasted fresh, and seasoned well.

Our waiter was polite and attentive throughout the whole meal and I felt very taken care of--which is abnormal for most Chinese restaurants. Am I right?

He also brought us some complimentary freshly fried chips with sweet & sour sauce.

The price was very reasonable. I will eat her many more times."}
{"text":"I use to stop in here once in awhile back in '05/'06 when I had caseload with some homes out in the NW Valley, at which point I would have rated it a 4 or 5 star.  Now that I have been relocated to our new Peoria office, I decided to swing by for lunch and give it a try again. Unfortunately, after my revisit I would now only rank it a 3 star, as my food tasted pretty much like any other decent Chinese restaurant.  I do admit I may be partially to blame, as for some reason I chose to order one of the most Americanized dish in Chinese/American cuisine, Lemon Chicken.  The chicken is done in the nugget style, not the whole breast sliced style like I generally prefer Lemon Chicken.  Although it was nugget style, the pieces were not grease and the quality of the chicken was good.  However, the sauce was pretty bland with very little citrus flavor. I did get the lunch combo. The fried rice, soup, eggroll and wonton were all decent with no heavy grease taste.  Portions were a little smaller than most Chinese places in the valley, but it was a good lunch for $5.25. I will probably revisit soon and give another dish a try.

The service was great, they had my food out quickly and I was finished with lunch in about 40 minutes.  Lunch combos are $5.25-$6.25 and most diner entrees are $7-$10.  For Vegetarian/Vegan they have a few choices of the typical vegetable dishes found at most Chinese restaurants for about $7, but at lunch you'll have to ask for the dinner menu to order them.  Also, they are promoting their food as no MSG and low sodium, which with the smaller portion sizes probably makes this restaurant a slightly healthier choice for Chinese food.  If you are looking for a quick Chinese sit down or to go lunch at a good price in the NW valley, Golden Star is a good place to stop in."}
{"text":"My last visit there ended in a total mess. 

I was on my way home, and stopped in to place a pick up order. I had wanted to go to Line Thai, but I was talked into going here because someone really wanted their egg rolls.

The item I had problem with was the bean curd family style with vegetables. The gentleman that took my order insisted that no such item existed. So I had to point to him where that was on the menu. Once I did he said that must be a new item. After I told him it wasn't as I have ordered that every time I visited in the last 2 years.  His excuse was it was new to him as he had not seen the item in two years. Despite the flaw in his logic, I decided I would rather just place my order than debate. After telling him my full order, I had to once again point to him where on the menu this tofu dish was. Since he had trouble remembering where on a three-page menu the item was I advised him to write the number of the item down. His reasoning for not following my advice was the cook did not go off of that.

When it was done they handed me a 4 item meal in one bag.  Given the drama I had with placing my order I should have checked my order there before rushing out the door. I
live about 20 - 25 minutes away, so I was in a bit of a rush to keep the food as warm as possible.

When I got home the very top dish I found was not a tofu dish, it was a shrimp dish. I called them, and the waiter asked if i was sure it was wrong.  Just a hint tofu is generally square, shrimp is not. After another extended discussion on how I was sure my dish was not made with tofu but with shrimp, he told me he would have to find the cook to see if she would replace it. 

I was tired of debating so I decided I just wanted my money back on that item. For which I was told he would have to talk to the cook to see if that would be ok.  But as I am talking with him I realized. The egg rolls were on the bottom of the bag soaking in fluids from the other meals. At that point I insisted on a full refund and that I would be bring back the mess they had handed to me. 

When I got there I had a replacement to my order, despite the fact I stated I wanted a refund on the phone. When I got there I showed them pictures of the mess I found in the bag they gave me. The excuse I got was the guy was new that he had been there for three months. I am not sure how a server can be new at their job after three months.  Especially when they are counting on tips to boost their income.  But if you are going to use being new as an excuse you don't argue with a customer about what is on the menu without actually looking. 

To make matters worse it was my fault that fluids from my food leaked on everything according to the manager. Perhaps they may want to visit their neighbors Line Thai for tips on how to package take out.

I got a refund, but after all the issues that I went through I will not be going back again."}
