{"text":"Aubrey was an excellent bartender. Very accommodating to my friend and I. We asked her for cocktail suggestions. She quickly jumped to respond to such a request with a perfect old fashioned and a unique secret high ball. Go here and ask for Aubrey!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved to the area and we stumbled upon this bar.  We instantly fell in love and knew we'd be back!  The place has an old, charming atmosphere.  They offer a menu till 11 pm, live music on certain days of the week, and they have a great patio!   Normally, we visit certain bars, certain days of the week, because they offer drink specials.  Parkview does have a happy hour, (being in the service industry, we can never make it to happy hour) but unfortunately no other specials on drinks.  This is the only reason we do not come more often.   Regardless of only coming in once a week, by our second visit, the bartenders remembered our names and our drink order!  Joe, Jason and Mary are definitely bartenders that make you feel welcomed! The kitchen staff is also extremely friendly and accommodating.  The staff is our favorite part of this place!"}
{"text":"My local in-the-know buddy took me here for Saturday lunch.  It's the kind of restaurant I like to eat in when I'm in town, but I need a local to steer me to the ones where the food will be tasty and not give me ptomaine.  As an example, we passed a place a few miles away called \"Mom's\" that looked \"colorful\" but my friend told me to avoid it at all costs.   By the way if you think the Parkview is a \"dive bar\" I have some actual dives to show you.  It's just an old, slightly dusty vintage neighborhood bar and grill, not a dive.  Although it will probably look divey to people who generally frequent sports bars in Rocky River.    I guess from reading other reviews this place was on some food show.  I couldn't care less.  If I wanted foodie food, I'd go a few more miles to Tremont.  There were a couple unusual things on the menu (pork tacos) but mostly a lot of the old standbys like burgers and tuna melt.   Our sandwiches were good.  It was quiet in there with just a few tables of folks eating, and of course we had no problem finding parking.  This place is well off the main drag, plus I got the impression the rest of the neighborhood was still asleep.  I guess the raucous nite club scene happens later and I can't say I've ever dropped by for that,  since it seems to be a jazzy-bluesy place and I'm not a jazzy-bluesy person.  I did notice they had  a big square room which should be good for a band compared to the noise dynamics of the more typical little long-narrow-room setup many of these joints have.   My only real complaint was that it would be nice to order a quesadilla with both chicken AND black beans in it without the price jacking up a whole five dollars.  Aside from that, this is a decent burger and hot sandwich stop that's a cool change in atmosphere from a diner."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been already said?  This is a fabulous establishment.  Period.  Food - Above average bar food.  Way above. Service - Always friendly and courteous.  They are on top of their game. Music - This is where this place shines.  Go for the music.  It's great to see such talent."}
{"text":"I am not a big taco fan, but the tacos here for taco Tuesday are the best in town! Me and my girlfriend have been going almost every Tuesday for over one year, without complains .   The service is excellent even while being short handed at times . The vibe is always positive and happy. This is great place to go on a date or take a whole work party for drinks and dinner. I look forward to taco Tuesdays !"}
{"text":"The atomosphere is great.  Beer was reasonable; $4 for a pint import.  The place wasn't too crowded but a few people were at the bar.  Depending on where you are coming from, this place can be a hassle to get to.  I was there for taco night.  Walked out under $15.  Could have been cheaper if I didn't order the $3.50  pork tacos.  The $1.25 bean and beef were actually bigger.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Parkview is a gem! Classic Cleveland with awesome food, beer and music. Cleveland Institution!"}
{"text":"Wow...very cool place as far as location. The customers seemed very nice, outgoing and humble...OPPOSITE of how the bartender was for the last night I was in there. Its no wonder WHY alot of people do NOT want to sit at the bar there (and its not because they just want to sit 'closer' to the band!-lol; wait, unless you are a man...you are NOT ignored...only if you are a woman!) What a shame. I hope the owner considers hiring NICER female bartendenders...and I am not the only one that thinks that..just ask around. Thanks"}
{"text":"Dive it up. Place is great. Fast and super friendly bar service. Stopped in New Year's Eve and had a great time.   Dive atmosphere, real jukebox, affordable menu, people you probably know. All of it make up a pleasurable experience. If you like showing up and shooting the proverbial shit with employees then you'll have a good time here. Lots of regulars. It's worth a stop if you're a little thirsty or if you want to eat. Get the provolone.   I'll Be back that's for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome live music.  Awesome atmosphere.  Staff is hilarious and caring.  Jam nights are the nights."}
{"text":"Got the blues burger. very good Cajun spices and blues cheese. MMMM second time.   the bar maid was great too. great place great people.  band start just a little to late. but over all great place"}
{"text":"Inexpensive drinks. Better-than-barfood. An eclectic local crowd ranging from pipe-fitters to hipsters to Det-Shor nuevo-kinda rich the parkview .    Two of the best bartenders you will even see in Jason and Mary."}
{"text":"If I could give the Parkview 10 stars, I would.  The food is incredible and the staff makes you feel at home.  Taco Tuesday and Pizza Thursday shouldn't be missed.  If you haven't gone to see Debbie, Katie or Joe yet, then you are missing out!  Burnin'!"}
{"text":"Met friends for brunch at 1:30 today.When I have been here in past visits the Blood Marys and Food were fantastic. I dont know if personnel in kitchen or management has changed but this was NOT the Parkview of old. The server was not friendly. I had the hash in each of my previous visits and the eggs were PERFECTLY poached. 3 of the 4 of us ordered items with poached eggs. Al lof them were overcooked, not slightly...the yolks were hard no runny at all. I explained to the server that the eggs were terribly overcooked and I would like an omelette. She returned to our table and asked me if I would like something that wouldn't take so long too cook, the frittattas took the longest to cook. I appeased her and settled on the breakfast burrito. What a waste of a tortilla and my brunch budget...Scrambled eggs with onions in a shell with some off tasting tomato \"salsa\" I guess it was. The potatoes served with it had been over griddled and used to be shredded I think but when I received them the were broken shrapnel over cooked awfulness. SHe brought the check and we paid, we sat and caught up with our friends and she interrupted us 3 different times to do her sidework ...sugar caddy, syrup, etc....RUDE and inappropriate!"}
{"text":"An okay alternative for breakfast on the weekend. Great view of the cleveland from outside."}
{"text":"I usually love this place for the live music... which sadly, due to budget issues, they don't do anymore. So- we happened to order the polenta succotash dish which was gourmet and felt like this dish could have been served in a very fine dining establishment with tablecloths and cloth napkins!  The interesting and different flavors were an amazing surprise as was the friendly staff - all in a non-pretentious low key little pub."}
{"text":"the bluuuues, baby.  the bluuuuuues.  and damn good food, too. some of the juiciest burgers you'll have.  big honkin' steaks.  healthy delicious salads with goat cheese.   and a brunch that makes your mouth water.  not to mention that bowling game in the corner.  i'm so good at that damn thing.  ...after a few drinks.  and the bluuuuuuues, baby.  the bluuuuuues."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit to Parkview.  They offer a good dive bar feel if you're into that sort of thing (I am ).  The restaurant/bar itself is clean and the staff is friendly and efficient.  Good pours of JD which always puts a smile on my face.    On to the food.  We got to sample a lot of different things...we started with the pulled pork tacos and fried asparagus; which was really similar to fried green beans if you've ever had those- not an overwhelming asparagus flavor at all.  The tacos were a big hit.  Most everyone at the table got burgers for their mains and they were all really good.  They don't over charge for cheese/bacon/additional toppings which is a breath of fresh air.  If I remember correctly, they only charged .25-.50 cents extra for BACON.  What a deal!  I hear the halibut sandwich is tasty as well.    All in all, the next time I am in town I will be going back to Parkview for lunch/dinner and some drinks.  The folks sitting at the bar looked like a fun crowd to hang out with.   Protip: Get the pulled pork tacos.  AWESOME."}
{"text":"Good enough food. Some really good, some well....good enough. Great vibe in the bar most the time. Been there a dozen times and only felt like the locals were creeping one time. Moderate drink prices.   Kinda like beer and shot dive meets Lakewood hipster/ Sports bar and Cheers."}
{"text":"We didn't mean to eat here.  The Brad and I are big fans of Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, and on a Sunday we planned to go to a Mexican place a few blocks away and have lunch. I take the blame for being the idiot who didn't check the hours. Sitting in the parking lot of the closed restaurant, we pulled up the Triple D map on the phone and found Parkview Nite Club only a few miles away and decided to give it a shot.  Did I mention that it was Sunday at lunch time? Yeah, Parkview only serves brunch (and limited lunch items) on Sundays until 3.   At this point, I was too annoyed to try finding another restaurant (breakfast foods are not my favorite), so I grudgingly ordered Eggs Oscar (it's like Eggs Benedict, but with crab - or in this case, krab - instead of Canadian bacon). It looked pretty delicious when she sat my plate in front of me. One bite, and I deeply regretted my earlier desire to leave. It was absolutely the best breakfast dish I'd ever eaten. The sauce was rich and flavorful, the english muffin was toasted just enough to keep it from getting soggy in the sauce, the eggs were cooked perfectly and did that lovely little burst when I cut them.   Brad ordered the Hash Lafayette (creole seasoned hash), and much as that's not really something I would ever order, I thought it was great! The seasoning was just right, the meat was flavorful, the potatoes were spot on, and it was just a well done dish.  I will have to go back someday for the regular menu, but speaking as someone who just isn't that into breakfast, that Sunday brunch menu was definitely worth the trip from Columbus."}
{"text":"As dive bars go, the Parkview is as good as it gets. The bar service was tops, the walleye and pirogi dinner special was delish, and the prices were astoundingly cheap in the eyes of this Bostonian. Awesome."}
{"text":"This place is sketchy looking from the outside, complete with an entrance that would violate any building code from the last 30 years. So, of course, I love it.   The beer is reasonably priced, the atmosphere is comfortably divey, and the food is really good. The goat cheese salad and the pork tacos are good for any restaurant, let alone a hole in the wall."}
{"text":"I love this place. Ive been here many times. Everyone is so pleasant and nice until yesterday. Its still eating at me. I guess im the asshole for wanting my own bill to pay, instead of my tab and my buddies. She literally threw a fit like a child for me asking for such a thing. Wow."}
{"text":"i'm a total foodie.  My wife drove me to this little hole in the wall on a Saturday during an OSU game.  The drinks were cheap, the food was AMAZING (Deep fried provolone?  Smoked Chipotle Pork Tacos?!) and the atmosphere was warm and inviting.  Between my two beers, three appetisers and what my wife ordered, our bill was less than $30 -- seriously, you can't beat that.  The only bad thing was that the only waitress was also the bartender, but, I'll gladly take slower service (which was excellent) for food and drinks of that magnitude."}
{"text":"We were in town for the night, Sat 6/23, and wanted to give this place a try. They were open late which was great because we were starving but didn't get into town until late! We seated ourselves and the server came right away with menus! She was super friendly too! We ordered 2 Stellas, a lemonade, Country Fried Asparagus, Fried Cheese, The Burger, Cuban and Winner Dinner. Everything was delicious! The homemade chipotle ranch and the homemade original ranch are a must try! The total bill was $52 and we left stuffed! Our server was very attentive as well! If your on the fence to try this place let me push you over into a table inside! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had one drink here before leaving ASAP. We pretty much over heard (?) a pretty loud conversation between two bartenders. Some very racist language, made me feel extremely uncomfortable. The one drink I did have was good. Maybe in the future some professionalism will prevail?"}
{"text":"I love live blues music and this was a great venue! Cheap food and drinks, good service, great music, diverse crowd, divey in a good way, nice and laid-back."}
{"text":"I went here not knowing it had been on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, but I had heard that they had a taco tuesday and wanted to check it out.  For those who walked in expecting it to be upscale (I saw an M5 out front), it is totally a dive bar.  I had a couple coronas out on the \"patio\" out back (really some concrete and a chain link fence), and the wait staff made a special effort to bring the tacos out to us since they didn't usually serve out there (it was mostly smokers).  HOWEVER.  The tacos were absolutely delicious.  The vibe is totally laid back and every song that came on the sound system was awesome.  The servers were friendly and helpful, and not overbearing.  The beers are cheap and they had a good variety on tap.  I will definitely be back to check out the rest of the menu (hence the 4 stars, so far).  Quit being snobby about your dive bars people.  Parkview is a total gem."}
{"text":"I have been here many times for lunch, dinner or just for drinks during live music. I always enjoy this historic bar because it feels like stepping back in time. Yesterday we decided to have dinner at Parkview and it was the greatest meal I have ever eaten there. Kudos to the chef! The fried chicken was the absolute best I have EVER eaten. Deliciously crunchy and juicy with a seasoning out of this world. It BEYOND better then Soho + Chicken & Whiskey in Ohio city and better than the Greenhouse Tavern on 4th. (Which I always thought  was awesome) I highly recommend coming to eat here! They have an updated menu that is not on their website but hopefully will be soon."}
{"text":"The ParkView is, without a doubt, my favorite neighborhood bar in my neighborhood.  The feeling inside is worn, dark, & comfortable.  In the winter, there is a wood stove for warmth and flickering light. In the summer, there is a nice little patio w/ a small tv screen.  You can hang out on the patio in the winter, if you want.  If your into the cold, there is a great sledding hill out front.  Every Wednesnite is an open blues jam featuring a house band and some of the best, if you stick around long enough, blues musicians in the city. The food is definitely a few steps above the average bar food with dishes like house smoked salmon and pork shoulder; several creative vegetarian selections (inclu country fried asparagus), and some really great sandwiches.  Daily specials are featured each day at lunch and Taco Tuesday features fish, bean, beef, and pork selections! Beer selection always includes at least two options from Great Lakes. Bicycle parking out front."}
{"text":"Chipotle pork tacos are fantastic. My service was great so it sounds like the issues are a difference in personality or isolated workers if anything."}
{"text":"This is a dive bar with pretty bomb fried chicken. My friends warned me the chicken was hot, but holy moly this was some of hottest chicken I've ever had. That said, it was delicious and I was VERY grateful for the side of white bread that I initially scoffed at.   I had bites of my friend's dishes and everything was very tasty. Prices were SO cheap. Service was little slow, but I was catching up with friends, so I didn't mind. If you're a fried chicken connoisseur I definitely recommend this place, but be prepared for the spice!"}
{"text":"Aside from their annual reggae brunch I'm not sure what the mass appeal is to this place.  More times than not I've walked in and said to myself, \"it feels like I've walked into a senior citizen center.\"  The beers are cheap and can always be counted on being ice cold, the menu has a lot of sandwich offering, and the staff are always spot on with the service.  Everyone always talks about how the Parkview is \"blue collar\", but I've seen more BMW's, Mercedes', and Audi's parked outside this place than I've seen at an upscale place.  I can attribute that to the difference between their day crowd vs. the evening crowd.  Overall, I would have to say that if you're in the area it's worth the stop in, but there's no way that you should make this your evenings primary destination - unless you live in the area."}
{"text":"I go to the Parkview for one event and thats \"REGGAE BRUNCH\" and its very good time.I can say the bar staff is very fast at getting your drinks and they get you drunk real fast.The only draw back are the bathrooms because the place was so crowded they all became coed...."}
{"text":"Oh, Parkview... You know I'll be back soon right? Are you ready for it? Because this time it's on! I'm talking the full-case... lots of Beers, tasting the entirety of your menu. You just wait and see.   Anyways, I did enjoy the Parkview the 2-3 times I happened to stop in. Normally, late at night after being housed at other locations. I like it. I think it has great potential. And I didn't get the chance to try much food which is really bothering me.   Last time I stopped in I opted for a snack, the Battered Asparagus. Pretty freaking tasty. Although - asparagus is difficult to bite pieces from since its so fibrous and the only way to break down the fibers is to cook the hell out of it. Parkview made my asparagus very well. Some of the stalks I bit off nicely others I wrenched on like a dog with a bone. Enjoyed every moment of it. Quite tasty.   Beer selection was good and priced very well. I could eat and drink there all night for cheap if I wanted. I could also splurge on some of the higher end beverages if I wanted. And whoever was in that night was playing Bruce Springsteen and let me just say that it was the perfect accompaniment.   Go there. Its good. And I've heard the live music is pretty kick-ass."}
{"text":"One of those places the \"locals\" frequent. Was in Cleveland visiting and had a party of around 12 people. This place is great. Just a fun old time bar with great food.   Sorry we didn't get food pictures - one friend had the fish sandwich huge."}
{"text":"I have been going to the parkview for over 20 years and it just keeps getting better! Love the old school bowling machine, and craft beers as well as pabst! The vegetarian succatash lures me in everytime while my better half enjoys the fish fry or strip steak!!! Yum!!! Countdowns to reggae brunch and dingus day for the regulars and friendly barstaff for the newbies moving in downtown....LOVE LOVE LOVE this place...oh yea you can catch live music on some nights!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's right close to my house so I walk here all the time. Which is good because it seems as the night goes on, the drinks get better. The servers are always nice to me and everyone who works here seems really stoned happy all the time. It's pretty funny. Go here on Wednesdays or Saturdays for the music - it's refreshing watching all the more mature folk get up and shake their rumps. This is seriously the best place for people watching in Cleveland. It's gets really packed on music nights though, so get there early if you want a seat. Taco Tuesdays are amazing. I always regret not ordering more because they tend to run out of certain options around 8:30-9:00 pm. I love all the weird decor, but there are way too many pictures of Guy Fieri in this place. Take the time to look around at everything they have hanging on the walls, ceilings, and even behind the bar.  A lot of reviews call this a scary looking dive, but it isn't. It's just dark on the inside, it's not dirty or anything like that. This place is great."}
{"text":"You can't beat the Parkview as your favorite neighborhood bar ... It just has great food, a fun, casual vibe and all the drinks you could want. They have a small patio, live music and TVs galore to watch whichever game you need to know about. Their salmon BLT is my favorite, but the Shoreway burger and those giant onion rings are just what you need when you are neighborhood hungry! Tucked at the north end of W 58th St, you have to come looking for it, but seriously, come look for it!"}
{"text":"sad face. sad face. Please don't hate me as I am obviously not in the majority with my low review here but I like to keep it real and respectful at the same time.  I didn't love my trip here. Its not in a great location and is very deceiving as the name is \"nite club\" which doesn't really represent the place inside. These days when you hear night club you imagine some crazy dancing, loud music maybe even a DJ, and neon lights or something lol   The location is pretty dark and not very visually appealing. It is a lot of stuff shoved into the small location and not in a focused way, more cluttered. The bathrooms need some love both in cleaning and updating, I didn't like going in there.   Our server did a great job handling our mid sized group making sure to check in with us, let us know the timing of food, and filling our waters as needed.   I love a good friend chicken. I wish they would have told us before receiving our meat that it was all dark meat unless specified. We all at the table would have gladly paid the up charge to receive the white meat breasts but we didn't know that was an option. I didn't end up really eating mine, I gave it to someone at home. The mac and cheese was a bit gritty and I prefer a creamy mac. I did like the slaw though!! that was great!!   I probably wont be back, but my friends loved it so maybe its just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Great Chefs  Great Chicken Fingers  Bar Bowling  Salmon BLT is Money  Pork Tacos are Dynamite  A Gem"}
{"text":"Yelp told me to rate this place and I truly thought that I already had... Turns out I've only dreamt about it since we've been there. TRY. THE. HOT. CHICKEN. SANDWICH. The wait staff will warn you of its hot-ness but trust me, it's worth it. Don't get me wrong, it's very, very hot! But boy is it good. Oh, and their Bloody Mary's pair perfectly with one. Don't let the outside fool you, this place is the place to be! Don't be afraid to hop in for a meal. You'll absolutely regret it."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with anything here.  At lunch, the smoked salmon BLT is just plain awesome, as is the grilled vegetable sandwich.  At brunch, the steak Benedict is beyond incredible.  No ambiance, very dark with uncomfortable chairs - but who cares when the food is so amazing and very reasonably priced.  It's easier to go for lunch - less wait and easier to park."}
{"text":"Onion rings rock. Steak salad grisly. Music great."}
{"text":"I'm going again!  I went there 4 years ago on Labor Day Weekend, one of my biggest Labor Day let-downs of my life...but I tried the things Guy Fieri had...fried asparagus...the best!  A good dive with a good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I haven't lived in Cleveland in almost a year and the Parkview is the one thing about the city that I truly miss.   The place has excellent food and beer menus that are fairly inexpensive, which is a great thing for young professionals such as myself who don't have a ton of money to spend on dinner. Though it gives the appearance of a dive bar it really isn't one.  The grilled chicken sandwich is awesome, and I'm definitely going to stop at the Parkview when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about the first visit!!! Great staff, Awesome food, and Cold drinks.  Can't wait to come back with my bud... @pmow8.  The Pork Taco....crazy good!  The Provolone Wedges...the best!!! The special tonight is garlic mussels.  I may have to pack a pound of that in also!!!  Must visit.. Don't let the outside scare you off!!!!"}
{"text":"Gather round people, I've got a story to tell. First part: Hole-in-the-Wall Food. Second part: I'm Being Haunted by My Online Dates.   Part 1. Parkview is a definitely hole-in-the-wall place with an outside that seems like it might be a bit sketchy and a dated inside full of locals singing Mariah Carey Christmas songs. BUT do not let this deter you! As long as you're not stuck up Parkview will greet you with character and a little dusty charm. We had our monthly supper club here the other night and our server, Debbie, did an excellent job of taking care of a group of ten. She kept my water filled, answered any questions I had, and no issue with the many checks.   The food here comes from a partnership between Parkview favorites and creations from the owner/chef, Joe, of the now closed Chow Chow in Lakewood. I started off with sharing an order of the deep fried piergoies $7 accompanied by burnt onion dip. You get three large potato pierogies that are very tasty. Next up several of us ordered the fried chicken with mac & cheese and a side of coleslaw instead of french fries. I had the original from Chow Chow, and while this version was okay, it was not as good. They are no longer able to get affordable meaty chicken breasts so they now go with one thigh and two legs (I prefer white meat so this was a little disappointing). Batter is still hearty with a good crunch. The mac & cheese is different, not as smooth, more of a gritty texture (roux issue, heat issue, type of cheese issue, or done on purpose, no idea). Overall though for $11 it was a decent meal that won't break the bank. Those who ordered this had plenty of leftovers to take home.   I also ordered the corn succotash with polenta cake $11 to-go and I am so glad I did! Like the pierogies this dish was just like the original and still just as satisfying. I can't wait to go home and eat it for dinner tonight! It's a heavy meal but they give you assorted pickled veggies which helps cut the fat. As for other items on the menu I would definitely come back to try the French dip $9 (always in search of the best one) and the friend goat cheese salad $9. I might stay away from the pulled pork dinner $11.50 though because it came out with the fries swimming in the pork juice which left them soggy. There was also some sadness over the fried cheese curds from Chow Chow not being on this new menu (bring back that smoked banana corn ice cream sandwich!).  Overall I had a nice time in a chill environment surrounded by friends and I would come back for certain menu items. Plus Joe is a nice friendly guy so I have no problem supporting this local business.   Part 2. Roughly 3 years ago I went on a date with this guy who called himself Jeff the Butcher (he liked fondling raw meat, jk). He's an attractive guy and in all honestly the date was good: some SideQuest trivia, a kiss, and plans to meet again. It was his negative drunken follow up call a couple days later that killed things. Don't randomly complain about friends/family and excessively curse at someone you just met.    Fast forward like a year and half later when I'm having a feisty Sunday with a friend at Banter and it turns out he is the cook there. Read that review for details.   Present day Cleveland Supper Club is at Parkview. I notice this guy in the kitchen keeps looking at our table. I'm looking back wondering if this guy is familiar and who the heck is he? It's JEFF THE FREAKING BUTCHER. The kicker here is that the prior week Butcher man is showing Joe my yelp reviews.   Moral of this story is that I eat out too much and I'm gonna die alone. On the bright side I live a fun successful life so sugar mama status is not far away. Soon I'll be able to afford Raúl the handsome \"handyman\" so don't feel bad for me."}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood dive bar with some great food.  Tucked a couple of blocks off of Detroit Road near Gordon Square, is the Parkview, an old school corner bar.  Less decorated than lived in for decades, the bar is dark and welcoming.    The menu is relatively straight forward, but there is some serious culinary skills in the kitchen.  I ordered the Walleye Sandwich with a side of fries.  The sandwich came with two nice pieces of Walleye, perfectly fried with a light batter.  The fish was moist and flaky, with a nice mild flavor.  The batter is wonderful, thin but crisp.   The biggest issue was keeping the sandwich together since there was too much fish for the bun.  The fries were also good, fresh and crisp outside with just enough potato flavor.  The Parkview is well worth a visit any time you are looking for some good standard food."}
{"text":"Love this place. The chipotle tacos are awesome as well as the fried asparagus. Fun place to go on a Friday or Saturday night before or after a movie at the Capitol theater. Love the old school vibe of the place. Good beer selection too."}
{"text":"This is where our night began.    Chipotle pork tacos and fried asparagus = a happy nosh.    It's a dive and a bit on the ghost-town side mid-week.  The place smells like stale cigarettes, but I imagine it's part of the history.    Think, old Vegas.  Really old."}
{"text":"What a Gem!! Great Food, music, and staff. I cant honestly say EVERYTHING on the menu is to Die for esp the Fried Asparagus with chipotle rance as an App. Wednesday is the perfect night to go with Blues all night long."}
{"text":"So the pork tacos here on Tuesdays are awesome! I used to come here a lot with some of the guys I work with. Check em out. It's worth the hunting that you'll need to do in order to find this place."}
{"text":"Love the parkview.  Wednesdays are my favorite night to come.  They have live music where anyone can play with the band.  The food's pretty good as well.  I like the fried asparagus.  Everything tastes pretty fresh.  They have bowling.  I suck at bowling.  Even bar bowling.  I've never had any problems with the service.  Everyone's usually nice.  Everytime I come I always wonder why I don't come back more often."}
{"text":"I really wanted this to be my new spot for wings and burgers after Reddstone closed up.  Unfortunately, service is so hit or miss I just can't come here on a regular basis.  There are two really great bartenders, and then some really shotty servers and one bartender who I don't get.  Ask him what flavor wings they have and answers like, \"any flavor you want\" comes out his mouth.  Really, then make me a diet coke and bacon flavor wing!  Just tell me the damn flavors.  Knowledge of menu ingredients is minimal across many of the servers, which means I risk getting really sick given my celiac and food allergies.  I've had some pretty odd looks when I just wanted to know if the chili was safe for me to eat.  Table service is painfully slow ever time I've been here.  Just getting a refill or the check can take upwards of ten minutes even when it's slow (I've timed it).  I love the live music and I love the vibe of this place, but the service just kills it for me.  I'll sometimes swing by when Emily is working since she's an awesome bartender.  Beyond that, I just can't do this spot."}
{"text":"Great Staff, Great food and some of the best music around.  Been coming here since 1997 and they have never missed a beat!  Absolutely LOVE this place!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here after seeing this place on Diner's Drive-In's and Dives.  The place was what you would expect for a bar, dark with large tvs over the bar and a Projection screen at one end all with different sporting events on them.    My husband tried the fried provolone and their Kings Hill Burger (bacon & bbq sauce).  I had the pulled pork tacos (one of the things Guy raved about when he was here) and a burger as well and both of us got the onion rings with our burgers.  Now my husband and I both agreed that the food was fine, some parts were even better then average (the tacos and the onion rings), but for sure we have had better burgers (Herb's) and we aren't thinking we would go out of our way to come back.    Certainly if your in the area and looking for something to eat or even looking for a bar this place is a good option.  They had plenty (over 30) of beer varieties to choose from and a full bar besides.    The prices at Parkview are very reasonable, as our total was under $40 bucks and we both had a beer."}
{"text":"This place is the \"literal\" definition of \"hole in a wall\".  The Tacos...Let me say that one more time.... Those TACOS!!!! are Fantastic... Within every bite, you feel like the Taco  is making love to your tongue (Seriously That good)! OK, I loved the food however our male server was awful. I would very rarely write reviews about a place but I think this place deserved credit for their food. And I still overdid it on the gratuity in hope that he would at least smile and be more courteous to the next customer..."}
{"text":"You'd have a hard time entering this place if you were alone outside in a dark night...  That said, once you go in, you feel much better. The food is really good. I've been there several times, the sandwich I recommend the most is the Salmon BLT. It's delicious.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Decent place in Cleveland. Showed up on a slow cold Saturday night. Was able to get a table right away. The burger was ok and staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Great little place with really delicious food. Best fried chicken I have eaten - EVER."}
{"text":"Would have liked to give it 2.5 stars.  Went on a Diner's Drive-In's and Dive's (DDD) recommendation for a late lunch.  Atmosphere was as expected (I was with two girls who did not like the dive-like setting, but I didn't mind at all).  Service was not so great, but not horrible (they forgot a couple of things we asked for, but were pleasant enough) and the food was so-so.  I had the salmon BLT, the other folks I was with had pirogies and a steak salad.  The salmon BLT was the best item, but still nothing to write home about.  The pirogies were highly recommended from our server, but were overall bland and dry.    The price was appropriate for the quality of what we got.  I've been to dive-y bars in my hometown (Chicago) with better food than Parkview and those Chicago bars are considered middle of the pack in food quality for bars here in Chicago.   Bottom line: Maybe we caught them on an off-day, but I expected more from a  DDD recommendation.  Maybe I shouldn't set my expectations so high for Guy Fieri."}
{"text":"ok food, ok service, but not a place to go for night out unless you like old style vibe"}
{"text":"A great pace to relax and have fun! Their deep fried asparagus, perch, and pierogies are super! Service was terriffic along with the music and old time bowling game was fun to play between sets! Will be back whenever in the area!"}
{"text":"This is what a neighborhood bar should be. I come in here a couple times a month, and each time I'm treated like a regular. The food is fabulous, the servers are friendly and personable, and the place just has a great vibe. Prices are very reasonable. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"When we were driving to the Parkview and a block away we saw a pig grazing in front of a closed factory building we knew it was going to be a special day. The bar wench was a delightful girl, she was friendly & nice and I cannot for the life of me recall her name, thus she did her job well! Friendly drunks hang out here and drunks at other bars mentioned they go here too! Imagine that. Anywho, they have a spectacular brunch, though I find the menu a bit scarce. They also have a great regular menu with the occasional lucky times they serve up their excellent wings! Typically those are football nights/days. I like the Parkview a lot because it's one of those that are open for the majority of the day, offer food and at night they have live music! In the daytime it even passes as kid friendly."}
{"text":"Things have changed as the next Generation takes full control. Mike what have you done? No music, changed up the Kitchen. You can only get Catfish, no Brisket, onion rings ect.. The Hot Fried chicken was good. Honey had Pulled Pork dinner, it was a very small helping looked like sandwich portion with out the Bun. Seriously missing the BBQ Smoke flavor and smell. Even skimped on the fries. Oh yes how can you be out of Ribs at 7:30 on Rib night?"}
{"text":"Great food!  Service was iiiinteresting but became better as the night went along (maybe from the drinks?).  The drinks were eh, but food is really good (hints  why it was on triple D).  Great spot to hang out!"}
{"text":"Once the narrow street beared little more than overgrown lots and chain-link fences cordoning off the edge of urban oblivion, but now an ominously polished range of condominiums looms beyond Parkview, an augury for future gentrification. Let's hope it doesn't alter the aesthetic of this top notch corner haven. The PV is grand as it stands: a sacred dive if there ever was one. Curious drinkers scuttle up the few stone steps to slip through the weathered entryway. They're confronted at once by the jolly barkeep who pours shots of rye with practiced ease and who can hold forth for eons on the merits (and occasional irritations) of the good old Cavaliers. Juxtaposing lights both icy blue and sinfully crimson, Parkview feels, at first blush, more than a little noir-ish. One wouldn't be surprised at all to see Billy Bob Thorton's barber-that-wasn't-there brooding at the bar or dear departed Denis Johnson scribbling down the lamentations of a motley of demented Falstaffian raconteurs in back. There are red checkered tablecloths that lend a welcome air of joviality, however. Ditto, the Cheshire-grinning likenesses of old world celebs gracing the walls en masse. The other day a makeshift scullery had been erected for the timely prep of mammoth hoagies and chopped salads and so forth while the kitchen undergoes renovation. Behind the bar proper, nighthawk smokers, resurrected by hooch, patrol the cozy patio. Everyone knows the nobility of the dive, the wood-paneled wizardry. Make your way to Parkview while the magic remains and say a prayer that it might just stay this way forever."}
{"text":"I'm going to amend my previous review for the Parkview.  On Wednesdays, I love everything about this place.  the music,  the food, and the service.  Saturday nights are a very different story. the current Saturday staff consists of some of the rudest bartenders and waitresses in the Cleveland service industry. I honestly have no idea how they still have jobs with the way they talk to customers, and in particular the regulars. Pathetic. Avoid on the weekends."}
{"text":"The Parkview is as Cleveland as it gets. The atmosphere is very friendly and warm, and they have bar bowling and pinball. Really, that's as much as I need, but it gets better. The food is pretty amazing. I had the walleye dinner with golden fries and a crunchy, creamy coleslaw, and my husband enjoyed a nice smoky barbecued pork plate. The drink menu has something for everyone, and the prices are more than fair. Two great dinners and one drink apiece set us back $26 before tip.  Our server for the evening was Debbie, and she could not have been more attentive and friendly. Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"Pro-This place is wonderful. Great atmosphere, friendly service staff. Kid friendly during business hours. Vegetarian friendly. Delicious food! Wonderful portabella burger and onion rings.   Con-The only thing I can think of is that the dishes are somewhat inconsistent. I've gotten the same dishes a few times and they seem to always be different portion sizes and sometimes just not made the same. But always delicious."}
{"text":"Alright this place is cool because of the environment and they have live music most weeks. I came here on a taco Tuesday. Anybody before me that said this place has amazing tacos is out of their mind. The taco shell is like cardboard and served with fake grill marks in the shell. Taco Bell has more delicious tacos than this place. I honestly believe that this place has a reputation for being decent for so long that anybody who comes here pretends to enjoy it. Good luck"}
{"text":"LOVED this place- we visited Cleveland in July and went to Parkview for dinner one of the nights we were there. Nothing to look at from the outside and I am sure we would not have gone there to eat based on the appearance. However the service and food more than made up for this.The waitress was super nice, not too clingy but very attentive. I had the battered asparagus and the pork tacos- both of which i have dreamt about many times since.My boyfriend got the pulled pork platter and a bowl of beef taco soup- we both had a beer on tap and the bill was just over $40. Customers were a mixture of tourists and locals and all seemed to be having a great time,I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Do you ever wish you could just find a bar that when you walk in you instantly have a smile because you know this is a local placed filled with proud clevelanders? Parkview is that place. It was on \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives\" and the food just keeps getting better.  Now this is your perfect Cleveland dive. It's in the middle of a run down area of Cleveland (even though recent apartment buildings were just built near by so get in while you can before it becomes the hottest joint). You first drive down this run down street where you get a little nervous, especially when your dad is taking you and you just think he took a wrong turn. But now I see it as the whole experience. It truly feels like the Cleveland the rest of the world pictures us.   Then you walk in to the restaurant and it's a darker venue with wooden tables, bar, and booths. It has some great games in the back corner and a music box of you feel like you can choose the right song for the whole restaurant. The servers have been there since day one and even though they don't know our names, we go there enough we talk to them like an old friend.   The food is bar food but all Cleveland focused. Pirogies, walleye, sausage, and more. It's all good but nothing beats their fish and chips.   If you want the true Cleveland experience, go to Parkview, and also be sure to try their Sunday brunches! Can't say enough about the wonderful Parkview that represents Cleveland so well!"}
{"text":"Seriously the worst wait staff ever. Serve brunch until 2:45 in Sunday and won't let you order from The regular menu until 3. Then at 3:05 we are told our new waitress isn't there and we have to wait another 20 minutes because the lunch cooks area T there yet. Asked for a manager and he acted so annoyed we were like wtf on the to miring after waiting an hour to order from the lunch menu. Used to love this plan but the last couple times we came here, it's the same shitty ass service."}
{"text":"Yep. Park View is a solidly friendly neighbourhood bar with live music and good food. It's a great place to go on Wednesday or Saturday nite for a blues jam and a bowl of mussels."}
{"text":"Best Salmon BLT ever! i love me a dive bar and this one is huge. Its incredible family friendly and boosehound friendly. Either way all the food is homemade and decadent. They smoke their own salmon for cripes sake. Yum yum yum. Being from Chicago drinking Great Lakes Brewery beer is great. You definitely can't go wrong with it. They could use a bit more craft beers. While in Cleveland for 3 full days I went there twice. Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch one Sunday with five friends. After being told by the rude server that we could not put two tables together so we could all sit together, we sat, 3 and 3, at neighboring tables. After ordering our mimosas, a group of seven came in. The same rude server put tables together for them without hesitation! NOT COOL. We had to flag down someone to get our second round of drinks, after sitting with them empty for fifteen minutes. The food was good, but the terrible service will keep me from ever going back."}
{"text":"NO LIVE MUSIC. .  One of our favorite places we would listen to live music. Try to support the restaurant but it's just not the same for us going back."}
{"text":"Two Things: Chipotle Pork Tacos, and Bar Bowling  Those alone merit an \"A-OK\" in my book.   All my fellow reviewers have adequately illustrated that this is NOT a high brow place. And, while I usually prefer a little more polish on my bar top, I'm not above heading out to the Parkview to get a little live music and pork taco on.  =)"}
{"text":"This place has everything you could ask for in a local bar. The food, which is mostly sandwiches and burgers, is excellent and you can tell it's fresh and made to order. The cost of food is low as well. There is also a great variety of draft beer and it's served cold right off the tap. The environment is very welcoming and I would highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Came here for the yelp supper club with a group of yelpers. The service was fantastic, never had an empty glass and she was so attentive.  Parkview has partnered with Chow Chow on the menu so a lot of fried chicken and other indulgent dishes. I didn't get a chance to try Chow Chow when they were in Lakewood so I can't compare old menu to new. I am not a fan of fried chicken because mainly it is all dark meat and I prefer white boneless meat. I'm happy I decided to try something other than fried chicken because everyone else got some and it was all dark meat. I tried the pulled pork. The pulled pork fell really flat for me. It didn't have much flavor and the pulled pork was piled on my plate with a bunch of pork juice. I had fries and all my fries were soggy from the juice. I did try the fried chicken (hot) some Mac and cheese and coleslaw and everything was great.   The ambiance of the venue was a type of dive place I like. It had character and history. Warm rich tones in the wood and decorated so nothing was bare. The place has ample seating and the bar is quite large as well. Bar games such as bar bowling were available as well. Definitely excited to check out this place again and try something new."}
{"text":"I love the Parkview for many reasons.   The location is great. The vibe is very relaxed and comfortable plus there is always a diverse crowd. The food and music are excellent. Great place to eat, grab, and drink, and best of all ...to go for Sunday brunch! Best eggs benedict in town at the best price. Best bloody Mary's and best pancakes in town too! The only thing I can do without is their taco Tuesday.. not really a fan of their tacos, I find them to be dry. Saturday nights and Wednesday nights are great bc there is live blues too. I just love the Parkview and recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Best dive bar in Cleveland.  Get the chicken fingers or the winner dinner and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has put on a few great events in the past year.  I've been here for two Dyngus day's and one reggae brunch. Even though it's been packed as hell, I'm getting whipped with pussy willows, leave smelling like patchouli, and getting quirt with water (I  hope), I've always enjoyed myself and the crowd in general.    I like the long bar and the setup in here.  It's comfy and great for making friends.  Their patio is nice, too.  Quaint and friendly.   I'll go back and get a real experience before Dyngus Day 2013, I hope."}
{"text":"You walk in and immediately you are taken back to the days when longshoremen needed a watering hole to wet their whistles after a long day on Lake Erie. This old westside neighborhood joint does not disappoint. Accompanied by vintage Cleveland sports memorabilia and general Americana nostalgia.  The food itself was a treat. Starting off with the honey chipotle tacos presents the palate with a sweet starter with a nice kick. Plus, the dish was featured on Guy Fieri's, Diners Drive-ins and Dives. Great dish.  For my main course I had the Cleveland Steak voted Cleveland's best Cheese Steak in 2007. Great flavor all around but a little steep in price for the size. Parkview also features local beers on tap from Great Lakes Brewing and other domestics.  Overall, Parkview is a local dive with a storied history with a great atmosphere and vibe. Great lunch and dinner spot for any foodie who dabbles in great bar food. Also, a solid live music spot on weekends."}
{"text":"Parkview Nite Club provides everything you're looking for in a local 'hole in the wall'. Dimly lit ambiance is super casual, red-checked vinyl tablecloths, a nice long bar in front of awesome bartenders, an array of live music (lots of blues) and great food. This past visit I had the Italian sandwich with fries. Everyone at my table was happy with their food- especially the burgers.   This place really is a Cleveland institution and has transcended through generations to deliver a great experience. When my uncle saw my check in, he asked if they still had a fried baloney sandwich on the menu!  There's lots of beer to choose from... but I always choose the Polish one who's name I can never remember! Don't worry- your server will know what you're looking for and make sure you have a nice cold beer in your hand to complete your Parkview Experience."}
{"text":"Parkview is the cool, kinda divey bar that you see in movies. You go in and no matter who your bartender is you are bound to have a great conversation. That being said my favorite bartender is Jason. He is just a badass, nuff said.   The crowd is quite random depending on when you go and I love that. The food? Always great. The chefs are always on point! I would tell you what I recommend but seriously it's all good. Can't think of one bad thing I've had.  If its wednesday they have live music. If its a big game night they will project it for you to watch. They also have a pretty nice patio for all you smokers! Add a skeeball machine and you have a great night set up for you. All you have to do is go there and they will take care of the rest!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here more regularly lately. The fried provolone and fried asparagus are good appetizers. The steak dinner is good for $10. The pulled pork platter was great, a little on the spicy side, but delicious. My friend had the cuban sandwich, he said it was good. I will continue going here. A great, relaxing place to grab dinner."}
{"text":"Local dive bar with the best chicken fingers I've ever had. It's nothing fancy but it's a good local spot. I've only ordered the chicken fingers here because they are THAT good. Their buffalo and honey mustard sauces are awesome too. Also very good prices for being in the Gordon square restaurant scene which is a bit pricier. Been here many times and will return... for the chicken fingers of course."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my trip here. Not had the food here, hence cannot give it a 5, but as far as drinks go, we were served a kickass Moscow mule by Raquel who was a spectacular bartender. Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Cheap beer, basement decor, grandma's food...been there, done that. It's not awful, just not a very stimulating destination. I don't know. I had heard rave reviews and was slightly underwhelmed. Just kind of sad in it's blue collar chic. Maybe it was the night( Thursday) that just did nothing for me. Conversely, I had been at Reddstone just before and had a great time there( always do). Am I a snob?"}
{"text":"Been my no. 1 spot since moving to the area. Live music every Wednesday and Saturday (sadly coming to an end, rumor has it) Better food selection than the average tavern. For anybody wanting to watch them featured on Diners, Drive ins and Dives, It is season 7, episode 10."}
{"text":"I loved the feel to this place. Our server was really nice and super attentive. This is definitely a fun neighborhood bar that I could see myself coming to hang out in on occasion or stopping in for a drink or two. Beer selection is good.   If I do come back, I'll have to try a regular menu item. The Taco Tuesday tacos however...I wasn't a fan of. I tried one of each: bean ($1.25), beef ($1.25) and chicken ($1.75). The pico on them was good. The meat tasted good as far as I could tell. The thing I didn't like was the shell. It was a hard shell of Styrofoam consistency. The flavor and chalky consistency overwhelmed the entire taco and each bite. The tacos were of average size - think boxed Ortega sized hard shells - but they were very narrow. Four tacos would be a good portion in my opinion.   MasterCard and Visa only."}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior (or interior) fool you because this place has some of the best bar food I have had in Cleveland, and it always has an interesting crowd at the bar.  The wings are great and the fried chicken is fucking awesome."}
{"text":"Late night the pizza is on point, could be the alchahol..? The crowds a little bit out of my league but I can hang around for a drink or two. My buddy stays right across the street and I think I went once all summer, try Fat Guys down the street and let me know how it is..."}
{"text":"The Parkview will have a special place in my heart.  It's where I first went out with my boyfriend, but also a great place for me to send other people out on random blind dates.  ha!  Anyway, I've been there mostly for drinks, brunches and taco Tuesdays.  The Tacos are okay...nothing special in my book.  I'd probably say the same for the brunches.  Overall though, I like the Parkview because it's the whole package.  Kinda like what you'd be looking for in a date, only it's a date LOCATION!  They even have bar bowling, which is pretty clutch in awkward date situations.    I know it's been on triple D, which is a little surprising because I don't really see it as a Dive.  It's old and kitschy, but not especially divey.   Not one to complain though, at least it got on some sort of Food Network list!"}
{"text":"My mom was giving me directions here, and I was like, where the bleep are you taking me!  Despite the back-alley location, Parkview is a pretty cool little spot.  Reasonably priced food, relaxed atmosphere.  We enjoyed the Fried Asparagus for an app.  It's served with a Chipotle Ranch sauce which is delicious and really compliments the fried goodness.   I had to go with what Parkview is known for as my main dish, the Smoked Salmon BLT.  I did like the smokey flavor of the salmon.  Two of my other dinner-goers complained that there wasn't enough salmon, but I was satisfied with my portion.  The bacon wasn't as crispy as I like, so I did end up taking it off.  Overall, the sandwich didn't blow me away, especially when served with out-of-the bag chips on the side.    Parkview has a decent beer selection, most of them in bottle.  The draft list included about 6 options, mostly standard national domestics.  I was happy to see two versions of Great Lakes on draft, however.  You have to drink a Great Lakes if you're in Cleveland!  Plus they have a Happy Hours special even on Saturday - dollar off drafts.  The server was attentive and friendly.  The band scheduled to perform that night was setting up right as I was leaving.  Parkview seems like a fun place to listen to live music.  If I make it back to Cleveland, I'll be back to try some of the other extensive options on their food menu and absorb the local music."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Out of towners were quite welcome. We are coming back!  Had the provolone wedges and the fried asparagus to start. Unbelievable!  The Huelett burger was amazing. Great music too!"}
{"text":"Came here for Supper Club with a great group of Yelpers and had a laid-back evening. Although Parkview typically doesn't allow split checks, our server Debbie was very accommodating because our party had called ahead to make arrangements for our group. She did a great job of making sure our needs were met throughout the night.   I started with a Blue Moon ($4 during Happy Hour) and shared the chipotle pork tacos with my +1. They had great flavor but were a little too wet for my liking, as the sauce on the meat leaked out of the taco with every bite. I think they were $7.50 for two average-to-small sized tacos. I also had a bite of the fries pierogi appetizer, which was crisp and tasty with its onion dipping sauce.   I ordered the Winner Dinner for my main and holy cow was this thing huge! For $11, you get mac and cheese, french fries (I subbed coleslaw for the fries), and three pieces of dark meat chicken (two legs and a thigh). The mac and cheese was on the grainier side, but I ain't mad at it: it was super tasty and hard to not keep eating. The coleslaw had a nice spicy kick that I really liked. The chicken had a hot, super-crunchy outside with a tender, juicy inside. I don't mind dark meat, though I know a couple of my dinner companions prefer white (you can sub a boneless breast for an upcharge). I enjoyed my indulgent meal and was stuffed after having about half the mac and coleslaw and half the chicken thigh (you know I finished the thigh).   I had the leftovers for dinner the next day and they didn't disappoint: some of the breading on the legs was still crispy even after sitting in the fridge overnight.   Parkview is a great little dive with lots of menu options, good beer deals, a low-key atmosphere, and plenty of room to find a place to relax. I could definitely see myself coming back when in the mood for some delicious bar food!"}
{"text":"The Parkview is Cleveland. My first time here was 20+ years ago. This place has seen me through a divorce, raising two kids and now my older years.   The look has pretty much stayed the same which is a good thing. It feels comfy and welcoming in that dive bar kind of way when you walk in.   The food is good bar food, but the music is great. Where else can you have some good eats cheap, listen to live music and and dance.   Every time I go, I say to myself that I need to come back more often than I do."}
