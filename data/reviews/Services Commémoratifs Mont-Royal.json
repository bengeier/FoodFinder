{"text":"I've have never been in such a beautiful, calming serene location. Popular for walks, bike rides along the universit√© de Montreal campus across from Beaver Lake. There is much history woven into this community of loved ones that have passed on.  I look forward to taking a stroll in this wonderful place of rest."}
{"text":"Just plain cool. Aside from the awesome view on the hike up, the cemetery itself is full of neat old tombstones and crypts. As Anthony K. mentioned, it has a very Victorian era vibe and is the perfect place to have a picnic lunch and take some pictures."}
{"text":"My friend Rob from McGill U. said: \"Of course we can get to Mont Royal Parc, follow me, it's a really short walk this way.\" 

That little short walk turned into a 2 hour trek through 160,000+ tombstones, 3 religious denominations, a crematorium (creepy), 100 ft. in elevation change and some gorgeously quiet scenery...in fact, I would venture to say it was dead quiet. 

But c'mon!!! Two hours? This is a lesson for all of you. When a guy friend says trust me, it's this way, don't unless you want to get somewhere the long way! Well worth a visit...although you might want to do so on a bicycle."}
{"text":"A beautiful Urban Cemetery equal to any in it's class.  I loved the personal nature of many of the tombstones.  Many told the story of a life worth living.  

We even got to watch Shakespeare in the Park on evening.   And don't forget to stop by the office and buy their beautiful pictorial and historic book."}
{"text":"My new favest outdoor spot to just \"be\" in this city (well, its a tie with a particular spot on the Lachine Rapids...but thats a more ambitious, greater time commitment outing).... And see the sunset. Miss the westcoast sunsets! This eves was the most orange awe Ive enjoyed in MTL in the 20 months Ive made MIle End | Plateau Mount Royal \"home\". 

Perfect evening spin up the east park side and then meander deliciously down through the beautiful old tomb stones, mausoleums and rolling greens with great old deciduous trees, the 'at peace', birds, marmots, raccoons, vultures and crickets on the west side. Cant wait to conjure a deer or a stag in there.  

Perfect.

an aside...if ever in Vancouver in the summer...and if you're comfortable with your own & others nakedness (or wish to become so_no wankers pls)...go to Wreck Beach (Trail 6 UBC)...cleansed by the the Pacific's salty H2O and bathed in twilight hues, true Wreckers applaud the setting of Helios; nature is so revered here."}
{"text":"A beautiful cemetery with a suitably Victorian vibe (Edward Gorey fans take note) that doubles as an arboretum.  Great place to enjoy the Mountain away from the throngs."}
