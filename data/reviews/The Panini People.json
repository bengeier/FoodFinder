{"text":"They brought their food truck to our school district's art showcase. Their food is delicious and a definitely reasonable price. I would I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Delish!  The bread is nice and toasted and the French fries are hot, crisp and seasoned just right. Had a quick chat with the owner who is super friendly. Come back soon."}
{"text":"These lovely people showed up at work today for Food Truck Wednesday and  I am SO glad they did!  I've been craving a grilled cheese so I ordered one with bacon and tomato and it was just delish!  Perfectly crunchy bread, fresh tomato, and the bacon was perfect as well. Pair that with some nice hot fries and you have a fantastic meal!  These are lovely people and the food is very reasonably priced,...think gourmet lunch with fast-food pricing.  Show the Panini People some love when you see them...you will NOT be sorry.  One suggestion: onion jam would be a great add-on selection.  ESPECIALLY for the grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"This truck was at our work today and I usually don't purchase anything from any of the food trucks. Today I decided to go ahead and try this one out because I love Panini's. I SWEAR TO YOU THIS WAS THE BEST PANINI EVER! I will definitely be purchasing from them again. I ordered the southwest panini and man is it good! Not only is the food really good but the service was very fast. The line was extremely long and I was afraid that it would take awhile since there is only 2 people in the truck but I was presently surprised! I love it"}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't eat from a food truck, but they were at my workplace in Mesa and a coworker wanted to go. Oh my gosh! It was so good. I had the turkey jive. I don't remember what was on it except for the pesto and the turkey, of course. I could actually taste the basil; it was so fresh.  I'm not normally a fan of french fries, but theirs were good. They were fresh out of the fryer and didn't have that fried food taste. The sandwich bread was the perfect amount of crispy goodness. I also didn't get that sick bloated feeling that I would normally get after eating fried food. Not a fan of the spicy ketchup because it was too spicy, but I'm not a fan of ketchup either. I would definitely go back and try some of their other sandwiches. Very good food and by the taste, they seem to take pride in using fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Bought on a whim, absolutely blown away.   Cleanest food truck I have ever seen, and well put together.  Got my food quickly, and was very happy.  The fries are easily the best I have had in months, and the pesto is superb. Be sure to grab some of the Chipotle ketchup if its available, very nice smokey taste, good heat.   10/10 would buy again.  Food truck game on another level!"}
{"text":"This truck rolled into our work parking lot today, I love paninis. I got the turkey and I love the flavor, but for $9.50 I expected more than two thinly sliced pieces of turkey. I had to open the sandwich to find the meat. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch from Panini People! I ordered the jive turkey with fries.  The sandwich was fresh and toasty, and had a delicious sauce on it that was a nice complement to the turkey.   The fries were pretty good too. They were lightly seasoned and cooked just right.  Fast, fresh and flavorful. All the Fs you'd want out of a food truck."}
{"text":"This was today's truck for food truck Thursday at work. Was on the fence to go down and order,  but am glad i did! Had the Godfather. Pretty tasty sandwich consisting of Genoa Salami, Spicy Capicolla, Black Forest Ham, Melted Mozzarella, Roasted Red Peppers, Peppercinis and house made Garlic basil Mayo. Was not overly salty like one would assume.  I'll be glad to order from them again if they end up in the rotation on Thursdays."}
{"text":"I just love the Jive Turkey. I'm not a cheese or pesto fan, so they leave it off but add this awesome chipotle mayo and it's perfect!  Did I mention the fries? Perfect cut and cooked just right. The nicest people you'll ever get to know. Every time I get the email at work telling me when they will be there, well let's just say I'm a happy camper!"}
{"text":"Yea!!!  I hired these folks for a private party on a weekend.  They showed up earlier than expected (what, like 20 minutes) but so what.  My guests were blown away by the crew's friendliness, the food was excellent and the bill very reasonable.  I had the Southwest chicken and previously had the Godfather.  You know it's good when your guests are sharing amongst themselves.  Chris and the gang are all right in my book!  Thumbs up for the spicy ketchup."}
{"text":"Has a really tasty southwest chicken panini with fries. Try the spicy ketchup, it's way better than the vinegary stuff that whataburger serves. I'm from Pittsburgh, trust me I know ketchup. Looking forward to the next time"}
