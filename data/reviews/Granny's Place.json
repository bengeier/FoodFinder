{"text":"I usually get the jerk chicken which is AMAZING - but INCREDIBLY HOT (spicy). I still love it though. They make THE BEST rice and peas (not a simply task to get it right). For roti it's just ok - I'd recommend the place just north of Dundas on the same side for roti. My BF has had the oxtail and curry goat and loves it! Plus, it's cool to see Granny siting there sometimes when you walk in. Yes, there is a Granny."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER!!!!!! I Walked in behind a girl who didn't know what she wanted therefore she was reading the menu an a guy who went to get bread at the back of the restaurant nobody looked at me or said hi so I waited patiently at the cash register until it was my turn the server then looked at everyone but me who was feeling sick and sweating from walking a long distance and all I wanted to ask was a question she then served the guy who went to the back of the store then he paid I still stood there patiently then when the guy was finished paying,  the girl (server) still didn't look at me or smile All I wanted to know was if a certain soup was available then the girl (customer) proceeds to ask if so and so is available meanwhile I'm STILL standing at the cash register still just wanting to ask a question!! I walked out stating that I guess my skin isn't dark enough to even warrant a hello! Being half Bajan I'm truly insulted and I've never encountered such Rude type of ppl!!!!! never again don't waste your time unless you are black (dark pigment ) or have been raised in a barn with no manners you will fit In!!!!! Too bad I heard the food was okay too, but I would rather have mediocre food served by nice people then to be disrespected by a fellow human being!! Shame on you!!"}
{"text":"The pastries... well I would never try them again. I once went there for the Roti, it took forever to prepare. And it was mostly bread and potatos. nothing really special."}
{"text":"If you love your curry goat with pea rice this place is for you.
Also grab some fried chicken it also good."}
{"text":"Good food good prices. Has a lot of variety to choose from.  My favourite is the beef soup on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS JAMAICAN FOOD IN THE WORLD!!!!! Myself and my man are hooked on the chicken roti and beef soup!! Next is oxtail and I know it'll be epic."}
{"text":"Nice place. Food is good. Didn't give five stars because they don't always have every item that's listed on the menu. Small with limited parking but the customers are regular and dependable."}
{"text":"Read positive reviews, then was so disappointed. Better to go up to burnhamthorpe and Dixie."}
{"text":"great west indian food...my fave place actually...now wheres my callalou? lols....luv the curry chicken and the coleslaw with the raisons......ahhhh yumm"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant about two or three years back. I have had some experiences with West Indian restaurants, but this was by far the worst. I tried asking for no rice, but it was starting to turn into an argument, so I just took it in my container and went home. The food was super salty and tasted awful. The food was not seasoned well at all. I remember me and my family laughing at how bad the food was. I distinctly remember telling my family that the granny who cooked the food must have been senile. I still shudder when I go past that restaurant. It's a no for me."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places for carinbbean food. You can only take out but trust me it doesn't even matter the foods the good"}
{"text":"One of the better Roti's you will ever have. It's huge, and full. It's a very name-based situation in there where everyone knows everyone so it's a little off putting at first. But so worth it.
I kinda wish they had more Roti options and $10 seems a bit much for the large considering I wasn't asked for a size. And also the lineup \"ordering\" process is very strange and all over the place that some guy completely budded in front of me with ease."}
{"text":"Tip:  Unless you're coming from the South, this place is pretty difficult to access due to the fact that it's on the East side of the very busy, Hurontario.  Lot is also a bit tight.  

I thought this place was awh-ight.  As soon as you walk in, the owner (??) is sitting at the counter on his laptop with Family Feud playing in the background and the lady who takes the orders is just slouching over the counter.  This just gives you an idea of the setting.

As I ordered, the lady told me, \"It'll take 10 minutes\", then she picks up the phone, calls someone to relay the order.  I think their kitchen is downstairs or something.  It was funny though!

I ordered Goat Roti - $8.50, but when I got home and cut into it, it was chicken.  (The person ordered after me's item.)  I just hope that chicken was the same price!  Otherwise, I was too hungry to give a damn.  Took approx. 10mins.

Contrary to a lot of roti places in 'ssauga, roti at Granny's Place is parantha.  Very flaky and buttery.  Definitely heavier than the daal puri style.

Filling was seasoned right, with a bit of a kick, but SAAALTY.  Again, I find most West Indian, as well as Indian, places love their sodium.  So if you suffer from high blood pressure or diabetes, this ain't the place for you."}
