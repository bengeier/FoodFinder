{"text":"Cela fait plusieurs fois que je passe devant ce tout petit kiosque à café et que je me dis que je devrais passer le tester ! 

Aujourd'hui, n'ayant pas encore pris mon café du matin, J'ai décidé de donner sa chance à ce kiosque à café. 

Vous avez le choix entre Americano, latte ou espresso. J'ai choisis un latte, très bon et à un prix très raisonnable! J'adore!

Parfait endroit pour prendre, le matin, son café à emporter.  Dommage qu'on ne puisse pas prendre autre chose que du lait de vache et que le choix soit si restreint! 

J'adore, j'y retournerai!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best hot chocolate I've ever had. Not too sweet, not too bitter, just perfection on a cold day."}
{"text":"Great place! Coffee is delicious, service is always friendly and efficient. Makes a big difference with some other coffee shops like Neve where the coffee is amazing as well but employees are soooo unpleasant! La Distributrice is definately a hit!"}
{"text":"Si la micro échoppe cachée ne paye pas de mine, l'espresso servi est de haute volée. En somme, la distributrice offre une dose de caféine de qualité, pour le Coffee addict en mouvement."}
{"text":"Inspired by coffee stands in Italy, la Distributrice delivers a great espresso promptly! 

Designed for people in a hurry (finally!), this coffee \"shop\" is essentially a slide window from which you can order your coffee to go. The inside is about 3 feet by 1 foot, just enough space for a coffee machine and a barista. 

They deliver a smooth tasting coffee. The owners also wanted the coffee to be affordable, so everything is under $4."}
{"text":"I've had more than a dozen lattes form this place. Always excellent, and the people are nice. it's hilarious that it is as small as it is."}
{"text":"Apparently, this café is the smallest café in North America. It looks very cozy and cute, but not just that, the coffee is also outstanding. Latte is my favourite there, I was always satisfied whenever I ordered latte there. Staffs are also friendly, I strongly recommend you to try coffee there. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMCNhgBu0EM I recorded a video there and combined with some other ones."}
{"text":"Very cute spot that makes a good latte. The gal at the counter was very friendly.  It's a great place if you're in a rush, which people in Montreal don't seem to be.  I only wish they had soy milk to offer."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a coffee as you walk around the vibrant neighbourhood! Quick service and delicious latte."}
{"text":"If there's anything these guys have to prove to anybody, it's that size-doesn't-matter.
It occupies a Pick-up Take-out Crawlspace the size of a basement entrance-way.
Afterall, it is exactly that, as someone came out beyond the cold dark underground.

Un Cafe Latte et Beignet.  Merci.  Cafe Latte($3.00).  Beignet($2.00).

Dude made my Latte as I spoke about Dark Horse(Toronto)-Blend I see on the wall.
The Beignet he described as old-traditional family-made Donut, makes it all the better.
Latte is c'est bon and way better than other Cappuccinos I've had in Montreal so far.

Sam James Coffee Pocket(Toronto) was a small hole?
Check out La Distributrice."}
{"text":"So tiny, so delicious - don't miss it! Stopped here for iced lattes on a hot day after climbing Mount Royal. They offer soy, almond, and coconut milk options which is a plus. Great little find!"}
{"text":"A literal hole in the wall. takeout only since the gentleman has about 20 sq feet of space to make espresso based drinks. Just before the Mont-Royal Metro stop on Avenue du Mont-Royal Est. In our 5 days in Montreal, I think we stopped there 4 times on morning walks, or getting on or off the subway. Nice gentleman running this. Great coffee. Strong! Everything made to order. Hot chocolate also. Liked his Americano coffee the best."}
{"text":"Great tiny place, if you're not paying attention , you'll miss it. My latte ($3.00) was piping hot & very good, my sister , who is a big coffee drinker, had a regular coffee,($2.00) really liked hers... and she's very fussy about coffee!  Both coffees were made FRESH, you can watch the barista do this right in front of you. Service was quick, prompt & very pleasant. A great place for coffee on the go."}
{"text":"Très bien! I passed this tiny hole-in-the wall on my way from the train to my AirBNB after a long day of travel to Montreal, but it was closed for the day. It's like the coffee shop version of Harry Potter's broom cupboard under the stairs! I went back today and caught the owner returning from a quick lunch run with a sandwich. He greeted me in French, and when I didn't understand and asked if he spoke English, he responded, \"Oui. How's it going?\" :) He was very friendly, and when I told him this was my first day in Montreal, he gave me his recommendations for the Vietnamese sandwich shop around the corner and also filled me in on all the happenings this weekend. Oh, and he also made a great iced americano. 

Who knew such a tiny, easy-to-miss gem would be such a great resource. Stop in if you need a caffeine fix (or local recommendations). Merci, sir!"}
{"text":"The espresso was extraordinary! Prepared at the perfect temperature, the brew was creamy, smooth, and carmely, without any bitterness or burnt notes. It was so good I went two days in a row :)"}
{"text":"La distributrice is my new place to go after barre class for strong caffeine. Their latte is so wonderfully good that I hardly ever think of looking for another coffee shop in the area, it is milky and smooth, but believe me the coffee itself is strong. The espresso will certainly wake you up in the morning.  I once tried their classical potato donut and is not my thing really, still looking for the sweet potato one. 

So people,  go and buy your coffee from La distributrice. Yes, it is hole in the wall, there is nowhere to sit, except for the little municipality bench at the pavement in front. Yes, it is coffee to go, but believe me Good coffee."}
{"text":"This place just proves that great coffee can come out of a hole in the wall. I've been here a half dozen times now, and it's never once disappointed. 

For $3.00, you get a delicious latte made fresh. The barista obviously knew what she was doing, and made one of the best lattes I've had in this city. If you're on the go and know what you're after (a great coffee), then this place is worth seeking out."}
{"text":"I will miss this place so much. I've gone there every day on my week long Montreal vacation. The iced Americano is such a lovely summer afternoon pick-me-up. The people who work there are always so charming."}
{"text":"This is a cute little take-away coffee shop. I grabbed a latte on the way to Mont-Royal metro station. It was really convenient and the taste was quite good."}
{"text":"La Distributrice was one of the first welcoming sights on our first apartment-hunting trips to the Plateau, seeing the lovely sign, \"Cafés Glacés à Emporter.\" Yessssss. You're speaking my language - the language of iced coffee. To go!

Despite its proximity and convenience, it took me almost a year to go check out their fare. I think that being just west of the Metro did it...I'm always coming from the east, and there's Flocon just there...and what would the coffee from a literal hole in the wall be like?

But one day, I was in dire need of caffeine, and was headed westbound, so I swung over to La Distributrice and ordered an iced latte. $4 later, I had a cup of sweet, rich coffee and milk that did not disappoint. In fact, the quality of the drink far surpassed my expectations, ranking among the best iced lattes I've had in the city. 

This is, de facto, a no-frills experience, as you're literally exchanging $$ for a plastic cup full of coffee through a window on the sidewalk, but there's something delightfully honest about the process. No pretense, no hipsters angling for table space, no ironic music playing over the speakers, just coffee."}
{"text":"One of the most convenient coffee fix in the city, L Distributice is a hole-in-the-wall type of coffee shop--literally. It's basically a counter which opens to the outside, with enough space inside to allow only one or two baristas to stand. The coffee menu is rather simple (espresso, Americano, latte, hot chocolate), but it offers a quick and cheap solution for any caffeine craving after exiting the Mont-Royal metro station, since it sits in an old brick building corner Mont-Royal and St-Denis, in the heart of the hip neighborhood Le Plateau. Since it was a hot day, I ordered an iced latte, which came in one size fits all, for $4.50. It was around the size of a Starbucks grande. The coffee, however, comes from a microroaster, so it had a strong, distinctive bitterness that complements well the creamy, dairy taste of the cold milk. The amount of ice was just enough to cool the drink without waterig it down. The latte was served in a transparent plastic solo cup with a lid and a straw--perfect for strolling around with a drink in hand. That day, there were also small snakca that were sold: it was $1 a piece and I think that they were coconut-chocolate balls, but the only thing that I'm sure of is that it was handmade and gluten free. Will definitely come back for the efficient, friendly service despite the long line."}
{"text":"I wish there are more Hole in the Wall like La Distributrice that makes excellent espresso drinks around town.

It is nice to sit in a coffee shop that has wifi, comfy seating, perfect cup ware but if the drinks that are not well made, I would rather give up all those perks.

La Distributrice is just so simple, good coffee on the GO.

This is one of the rare time I don't mind drinking out from a paper cup."}
{"text":"lovely coffee window or stand? very Simple but cute. They offer espresso based beverages on the street which was cool"}
{"text":"I come by here every weekend day when I walk my dog. Friendly faces and baristas that know what they are doing. In the summer, the iced coffees are great, but I am a sucker for a great latté and I have never left here disappointed. Am more than happy to help out a local, hole in the wall place versus the Goliath Starbucks down the street."}
{"text":"NOT A CAFE!!! It's just a window!!

wow I didn't read the reviews so I didn't know what to expect! it was an ultra cold day, bought my (delicious!!) latte from here, took it to the subway station and hid from the wind.

Fantastic service. Fantastic coffee."}
