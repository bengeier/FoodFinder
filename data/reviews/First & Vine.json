{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants, their food never disappoints. The service is fantastic and the atmosphere is super chill. I love going there because they always have new things to try on the menu, and if you come eat here, they had a drink called Meadjito and it is absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant I have been to in the area, hands down.
After a day of appointments and a long drive from Edmonton I had two things on my mind. A bathroom and a great meal. The first was taken care of in a very timely manner. The great meal experence in Calgary has eluded me in the many years I have been comming to town. Well that changed tonight! I ordered the ribeye which came with golden potatoes and fresh asparagus. In a great presentation. The meal had great flavor, the steak was barely a little over done but it was still very juicy and had great flavor. Sandra took great care of me and was very pleasant. Overall the service was outstanding, the food is the best I've had in the area."}

Chef Mike has created a great menu and although not my typical food choice in the past, it has introduced me to a whole new dining category and I'm becoming a bit of a \"foodie\" now."}

{"text":"Without a doubt my favorite restaurant experience I've ever had. The food and service are beyond awesome and 5 stars are simply not enough. The tapas style food is fun to order and try different combinations. The staff is attentive and love giving recommendations about food. And the recommendations were spot on. Incredible evening and I can't recommend them enough !!"}

{"text":"We recently booked a large table with First & Vine for a surprise birthday party for my mother. I spoke directly with one of the owners throughout the process and he was extremely responsive to my (many) questions.

They allowed us to set up decorations for the event and even bring our own desserts to the event. Overall, First & Vine was extremely accommodating and made the event a very memorable one. The drink selection was great as was the food. The tapas style food offerings are a great fit for larger groups and despite being in landlocked Alberta, we had some of the best mussels I've ever had. We'll definitely be visiting First & Vine again in the future!"}
