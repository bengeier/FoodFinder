{"text":"Pretty good for a take out place. I have ordered here few times, never been disappointed. Love their curry fried rice."}
{"text":"Great service , good value for money always a good laugh, cater well for large groups. Chicken dishes are always good but other meats could be improved. On the whole thoroughly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Food is very good and reasonably priced. Plenty of flavor and always fresh. Great place to get take out!"}
{"text":"I've been living over 6 1/2 years in N.C. and have tried many local Chinese restaurants and found this one to be the tastiest of them all. Their prices are reasonable staff is friendly and they offer great quick takeout. You can't really go wrong with any of their combo plates because you get alot of food for the money. Check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was just ok  and the customer service could be a lot better.   It wouldn't hurt to smile or even speak to the customers.   I like that it is close to me but I would rather drive a little further for better food and service."}
{"text":"For carry out it is fine, hardly the best.  Location helps because little competition.  Food is pretty good, my kids love the sesame chicken, few veggies in fried rice. We well continue to order about 4 x per year because it its easy and local."}
{"text":"novel Chinese restaurant.    you can select dishes from the set menu, or go for two all you can eat options. The first is similar to the to the set menu but you have a smaller set of dishes to choose from, you can eat as much as you want but new dishes will only be brought out once you have finished all of the current ones.    The second option allows you to create your own dishes, you are given a bowl and you fill it with the ingredients you desire from a buffet style arrangement. Then the chef will cook the dish for you (rice is also provided) the menus and walls are covered in different recipes for you to try if you get stuck.    Unfortunately the quality of the meat can not always be guaranteed. However it does make for a novel and fun night out."}
{"text":"This is by far THE BEST Chinese fast food in Concord!!!! It's clean and the good is always so good, hot and fresh!!! Their steamed dumplings are to die for!!! They are very pleasant and nice all the time and every time I call they know what I'm going to order"}
{"text":"Back for a second visit. Had to order the fried dumplings again. They were just as tasty as I had remembered them being. We also had the chicken in garlic sauce and the house special fried rice... both were delicious. The chicken was prepared perfectly and very tender. The sauce was sweet and slightly spicy just the way I like it. Very good!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food and great prices. There are a few local Chinese places but I always choose Red Dragon.  My favorite go-tos are the lo mien as well as the general chicken. They also deliver to Highland Creek which is a great plus if you want to stay in."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was far from impressed with the food at this place. I ordered sesame chicken with fried rice and an egg roll. The most positive part was the reasonable price but the smell and the flavor of the food was subpar. The rice lacked any flavor whatsoever and the sesame chicken, the sauce was just not good. I have been to better chinese restaurants, my usual being Hunan Park and I will definitely be visiting Hunan when I get the taste for Chinese and not this place."}
{"text":"Grabbed some takeout after work and was greeted by an unfriendly woman who didn't even attempt to crack a smile. When I saw the 95 sanitation score I should have left but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. My food came out quick and when I got home and started eating, I found a long, gray strand of hair in my lo mein. Needless to say, it made my stomach turn. At least if the service was great I might have considered going again but bad service AND hair in my food is a no-brainer. This place is not even 5 minutes from my house but going somewhere with better service and sanitation is worth the drive."}
{"text":"I have been to the Red Dragon Restaurant loads and I love it.    You have an option of either ordering your main course from the menu or go down to the front and gather your ingredients and get the chef to cook it for you right infront of you.    Personally im lazy and and would probably put too much of something in that would make it taste horrible.    I love the food the staff are friendly and the service good.    So heres to many more trips to my favourite Chinese"}
{"text":"Good meal and affordable.  Lots of food. The lunch portion is plenty for two."}
{"text":"Typical local Chinese restaurant. Good menu, good service, food has always been fresh and well-prepared! What's not to love?!"}
{"text":"Our first order.  Quick, efficient process on the phone, food was ready in 12 mins, order was correct, food was yummy and service was good.  The egg rolls were not as good as I would have liked them (they were overcooked), but the rangoons and Mei Fun chicken were yummy. Very reasonably priced.  Definitely worth another order in the future."}
{"text":"They have good Chinese food. Of all the ones in the area I would have to say that are the best!  Friendly staff, fair pricing and good food"}
{"text":"Very popular place and because of this their standards have dropped. Mixing starters on offer plus main courses on an eat as much as you want basis. Eat as much as you can bare may be more apt. The starters are nothing mind blowing but at least they are consistent. The main courses are just bland, tasteless, MSG laden dishes of surprising similarity. Only the main ingredient changes. Give it a miss"}
{"text":"Best kung po chicken I've had in years. Fresh and fast."}
{"text":"It's pretty typical Chinese food.  The taste, flavor, texture is all equivalent to other Chinese places in the area.  And by that i mean i enjoy it.  The tables and chairs are good quality.  A lot of Chinese places in Pittsburgh have cheap tables that are falling apart and not level.  But Red Dragon has good quality.  Red Dragon also uses real plates, silver-wear, and glasses; which again not all Chinese places in the area do.  So thumbs up for the tables and plates.  I was a little confused for a second though, because this place was called \"Tasty Chinese Restaurant\" in the past, and now they're called \"Red Dragon\".  It's the same address, phone number, it just has a new name now.  Other yelp reviewer Joel A, says in his review that the old lady who Ran Tasty is not at Red Dragon; that's unfortunate, she was really nice.  A small problem I have though, is that \"Sherry F\" on Yelp is clearly a fake review.  And on top of that Sherry F stole my picture.  I took this picture of their General Tso and put it on Google Maps https://tinyurl.com/yadtd6o4 over a year ago.  And now Sherry F stole my picture and uploaded it to Yelp https://tinyurl.com/y8pyffw3  My photo was for \"Tasty Chinese Restaurant\" not for \"Red Dragon\".  In Sherry F's review she mentions a new chef from Taiwan.  That's fine, but if it's a whole new restaurant now, why are you using photos from the old restaurant???  Not only are you stealing people's photos, but those photos don't even represent the food at Red Dragon, because they were taken at Tasty Chinese.  As I'm writing this Red Dragon's Yelp has two 1 star reviews, and one 5 star review.  The one 5 star is from Sherry F.  Sherry seems to be copying many photos from many other people online.  And the only review she ever wrote on Yelp is for Red Dragon.  Yelp's Content Guidelines have a general guideline that says not to review your own business, and doing so is a conflict of interest.  And Sherry F doesn't disclose her connection to Red Dragon in the review.  I came to Yelp planning on giving them a 5 star, but am lowering it to a 4 after seeing them try to deceive customers with a fake review."}
{"text":"The food is kind of light tasting compared to most of the Szechuan food in Pittsburgh, which is great! It tastes like the food that you cook at home, not greasy at all, and not as salty as that can make you thirsty after eating a meal. People are complaining how bad the general tso is...I mean come on.....General tso isn't even real chinese food...anyways I'd choose to eat here for a regular chinese lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place after reading some reviews on here. I'm beginning to wonder if I went to the same Red Dragon or somehow got trapped in a wormhole time continuum and ate at a alternate universe Red Dragon.  This review will be simple and short. Pretty much like the experience.   I ordered sesame chicken. I have no clue if they ran out of the traditional sesame sauce and substituted it with my Grandmas sweet tea or Vermont pancake syrup. I literally ate two bites and couldn't handle anymore because of the bottle of soy sauce I had to pour on it to even choke those down. The fried rice and the egg roll both had the dyed almost fake looking pork type product in it that I distain. I even asked if it had it in it and was told NO!!!!!    As far as the service. What service?  Only thing I got was a rude order taker with 15 employees playing some game on their phones. I'm assuming it was sesame chicken crush. Yeah that was a lame joke just like this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food...below average service.  Came in tonight with my family.  Really disappointed in the service.  Great location though... So I guess they'll continue to get business, but it won't be mine"}
{"text":"Not very good. The chicken fried rice should be pretty easy to make taste good but it was flavorless. The place smelled like a restroom. The man working the register appeared to be pretty sick although it may have just been allergies.  I would give it a solid 2.5 starts.  Not awful,  but I won't rep at."}
{"text":"I have been here a half dozen times, I always get the sesame chicken combo.   It has always been very consistent in freshness and taste.    I like the sauce, it is perfect.   They have smaller dinner combo's, served in square dishes.   The dinner combo is $6.45ish.  The portion size is perfect, but the part that sucks, no leftovers.....  My wife always gets the beef and broccoli.  She says it is the best in the area.   My son gets the pepper pork, extra spicy.   He reports that it is pretty darn good.  The pepper pork is in a savory pepper sauce, kind of like sweet and spicy.   If you do not like onions, avoid, this dish has some large ass onions, just sayn'  For comparison, go down the road to Chon Chin, which you pay a little more but get huge portions.  Unfortunately, Chon Chin is super inconsistent, either rocking or soggy and crappy tasting."}
{"text":"I was very unimpressed by the red dragon. My general tsos was all fatty chicken. The rice was over cooked and chewy. This used to be a great Chinese place and now I can't say I will go back."}
{"text":"We have ordered from Red Dragon for several years. They have quick delivery and the food is consistently tasty."}
{"text":"After just moving to the area (and out appliances hadn't been installed!) the family wanted some quick take-out from a close-by establishment.  I remembered seeing the little joint on the way to the neighborhood and thought, \"Why not?\"   We were presently surprised.  Now, it's your standard American-style Chinese fare; fried rice, s&s chicken, egg fu young, dumplings, etc.  It wasn't too greasy as can happen often, and the portions weren't super gigantor like many places make.  The ingredients were fresh-ish (it's cooked, so...), and I have to say that it was some of the better tasting Chinese I've had in recent times.   The pricing was on the cheap-ish side, so that's always a plus.  Service was great, as the woman that worked there was very helpful for a wet-behind-the-ears transplant. The most impressive thing from Red Dragon was the fresh homemade mustard sauce.  It was intense!"}
{"text":"This is pretty good take out Chinese food. It's the best one we've found in this area. Service is fast and food was hot & good. Prices are decent and portions are plenty big. My husband and I can even share a take out of chicken with broccoli and rice."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a Zero Star Review I would. This is NOT Tasty China which used to be in the same location. Having read the reviews of others, we cautiously tried Red Dragon, placing our same order as we did at Tasty. First, this place is NOT cheap. The prices for Red Dragon are much higher than Tasty's and the food is of such a lower quality.   We ordered General Tso Chicken, Beef Chow Fun and egg rolls. I honestly don't n ow how you mess up egg rolls but these were inedible. The taste was of something rotten. The General Yao's was full of fatty pieces with a sauce that didn't taste like any General Tso's that I've ever had before. Red Dragon's tasted more like I was chewing on a dirty dishrag. The Beef Chow Fun was soggy and mushy and lacked any flavor.   We couldn't eat the food that was given to us because of how bad it was. The worst part is that the friendly older woman who manned the front desk is no longer there.   Unless things drastically change - we'll never go back to Red Dragon.   Losing Tasty China is like losing a friend- I've been going there for nearly a decade.  Edit: They  Don't Give  Out  Fortune  Cookies"}
{"text":"Red Dragon is my family's favorite delivery take out asain restaurant. The food is always very hot and fresh. They person who delivers it is alway very kind and if they make a mistake on the delivery they always come back around with what they forgot. The vegetarian spring rolls and steamed dumplings are my favorite side dishes. When I want something made spicier they always add more red chili sauce into whatever I order. Go here for local highland creek delivery food!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm biased because I like convenience. It is your typical neighborhood chinese fast food joint. It's nothing special really...it's food that tastes good, is quick, and cheap. I do like the fact that the food is also not overly greasy...it's still greasy, just not overly greasy haha. The things I order most are the chicken wings and boneless spare ribs. Big portion sizes!  Cons: I wish the fried rice that comes with the combos had some kind of vegetables in it."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. It opens recently but I would say the food is fresh and delicious! The chief is from Taiwan and he is good at various kinds of Chinese food. They offer American style Chinese food, wonderful Taiwanese food and other popular Chinese spicy food. I like them most because they can really provide you healthy, tiny oil, not salty food. I tried fresh fish and Eel and I think the eel is amazing!!"}
{"text":"As far as cheap Chinese goes, Red Dragon had good food. I would never eat in though; always take meals to go. The decor and atmosphere sucks."}
{"text":"Food is decent, unless you happen to get a metal shaving in your wonton soup. Which is what happened to my 12 year old. She realized it once it was in her mouth and luckily didn't swallow. That will be my last time going there."}
{"text":"Food was very bland and not fresh. Ordered Chicken in Garlic and it wasn't Spicy. It was sweet. Barf Never again"}
{"text":"Called and a child answered the phone.. I asked for delivery the child handed the phone off and they said \"it's about one hour, busy night.\" Didn't mind waiting so I said that's fine and then I hear \"ugh ok.\" Do you not want business? Damn."}
{"text":"Family run establishment.  As far as Chinese takeout goes in the Concord area, it is pretty darn good!  My son and I always get the Fantasy Shrimp and my husband orders various beef dishes.  Food is ready shortly after ordering.  So far they have not disappointed!"}
{"text":"We go to Red Dragon all the time and the food is much better than the other Chinese restaurants in the area. They have all the usual American Chinese dishes like General Tsos but they also have some more authentic dishes as well, like steamed sea bass with ginger and scallions and the salt and pepper shrimp. The food isn't super oily and over salted either.  Family owned with friendly service.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"So glad to get some decent Chinese food delivered to my door today.  They said it would arrive in 35 minutes and in 35 minutes it was here.  Yes, a sweet, polite child answered the phone when I called to place my order.  When I gave my order an adult woman took it, and an older man delivered the goods so I guess this is truly a family run business.  The food tasted nice enough.  There was only a little chicken at the top of the chicken lo mein - not one morsel throughout.  The egg roll was a little bit mushy.  The sesame chicken was the best thing I had, as it wasn't too sweet.    Hubby says his Curried Chicken was nice.  The order was priced fair.  Twenty dollars to feed two adults.  It was tasty, but there were no chopsticks in the bag.  Good thing I had my own.    They earned three stars because they didn't hit the meal out of the park, and the woman taking my order was less than patient. I would order from there again and wouldn't discourage anyone from patronizing The Red Dragon."}
{"text":"This place is going down hill. The beef is crap and doesn't taste real. It's chewy and fatty. The bourbon chicken is always dry. There's never any sauce on it. The General Tso is not the least bit spicy. The only thing that's good are the dumplings and the wings. The spring rolls are the size of my thumb. And the egg rolls are only good if you haven't eaten in a day and a half. Tonight we are officially done with this place. Another boycott added to the list."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst Chinese I've ever had. I drove 20 minutes because the reviews were better than those of other Chinese places in Concord and figured it's pretty hard to mess up veggie lo mein and hot 'n sour soup. Wrong. In addition to having an old, almost stale taste (if this is even possible with soup), the hot 'n sour was bland and unremarkable. The veggie lo mein? No flavor, greasy and again - STALE.   My husband got the General Tso's chicken and said it was the worst he'd had.   I wanted so badly to like this place because I'm always looking for decent Chinese in the area but sadly, we will not return."}
