{"text":"This place is amazing. I mean, you really can't go wrong with a place that serves poutine 24/7. The staff are definitely friendly (once they acknowledge you - see my last comment below) - maybe more so once they realized I didn't speak francais and thus was clearly a tourist. This was my second time to Montreal and I'm glad I did a little more research on Poutine (thanks, yelp!). My first time, albeit good, was certainly not the best considering I probably ate at a tourist trap.  I had a small \"La Jaco\" and it was enough to send me into food coma by the time I got back to my hotel.   La Jaco = Ground Beef, Onions, Mushrooms, Cheese Curds (of course), French Fries (well, obviously!) all drenched in a black pepper sauce. Excuse me one moment while I wipe the drool off my face while typing this....   ....and i'm back.  Seriously - why are you still reading this? You should be on your way there already!  My only real beef was that I was kept waiting at the front for almost 5 minutes even though there were plenty of tables and several waitstaff who clearly saw me yet didn't even say hello."}
{"text":"La banquise, arguably the best place in Montreal for poutine. I believe this could be true. The staff is really great and they have a great selection of poutines there. There's nothing better than going there after a night in the bars when you're craving for a poutine. Their portions are very generous. Whenever friends from outside the country come visit, I make it an obligation to take them there."}
{"text":"Maybe we tried this place on a bad day or something but we came, we saw, and we were disappointed. We split an order of the la classique poutine and it wasn't awful but it certainly didn't live up to the expectations based on all the reviews. Honestly, I've made better at home and I'm not even Canadian."}
{"text":"Expect to wait as this place is popular (though it is open 24 hours so maybe 6am is a quiet time). Service was pleasant and attentive, though the star is the pouting.  Absolutely delicious and what to expect from poutine in Montreal.  You need to eat this."}
{"text":"*(New photo uploaded!)  My dinner companion and I had heard many mentions of La Banquise, however, neither of us had ever had a chance to visit it yet.  We made a last minute decision to check it out, as my friend was in serious need of a poutine that chilly winter night.  We were lucky enough to find street parking directly across the street. Considering that it was a rather busy Saturday night, we were seated almost immediately. I believe they accept cash only. There is a small ATM on-site, located near the door.  My friend ordered the \"Three Amigos\", which is a poutine topped with three types of sausages. I chose a Club Sandwich made with turkey meat and opted to upgrade my side of fries to a standard poutine. Although there seems to be a variety of local and microbrewery beers available on the menu, we ordered soft drinks with our meals.  Between the background music and the chatty crowd, the atmosphere was a bit loud for our tastes, making it a bit difficult to have a conversation across the table. Some of the decor is a bit kitschy, as we were seated under a pillar with a large artificial branches with a few oranges hanging down. Our waitress looked like a throwback to the 80's -- complete with big hair, bright scarlet red lipstick, overdone makeup, skintight black leggings, short booties and a huge bejewelled Madonna-style cross necklace! Luckily, she seemed to be the only one of the sort; the rest of the wait staff were dressed very casual and normal in style.  Our meals arrived relatively quickly; although I had to ask for mayonnaise (which is unusual in Montreal, most places almost always bring some with Club Sandwich orders). I also had to ask for a knife for my mayo, as we were only served with napkins and forks.  I am rather picky about my poutine and I was rather disappointed by the \"standard\" one served by La Banquise, as it wasn't exactly to my preferred tastes.  There are several sides to poutine lovers -- some absolutely demand the grease-drenched soggy fries, others prefer slightly floppy fries with theirs, and I am one of those that prefer my fries to be somewhat crisper and still have some shape to them.  The poutine had somewhat floppy fries and were a bit more greasy than I prefer. The sauce was a touch heavy and almost chunky in texture. At least the cheese curds were fresh, if not overly generous in quantity.  My dinner companion was fairly satisfied by his poutine, however he mentioned that what \"made it\" was the variety of sausages that topped it -- otherwise it was a rather standard fare poutine for Montreal.  For most people, the \"regular\" portion is more than enough; only order the large is you are *really* hungry or are sharing between two people.  Overall, we were slightly disappointed by La Banquise; mostly because we had heard such marvelous things about this place. If you have never experienced poutine, or have not had much variety in types of poutine, I could see how this place would seem heavenly.  However, as a long-time Montrealer, it was actually only a little above average -- the only major saving grace was the variety of styles of poutine offered on the menu. The prices were a little on the high side, especially for the more standard poutine styles -- you can get better for less money elsewhere in the city.  We're not sure if we would bother returning, as neither of us were particularly impressed by our dining experience."}
{"text":"Best poutine in MTL  ? Not really but the atmosphere is nice and its always crowded so you have to be a bit patient with you order ."}
{"text":"Big portion! I d wish they have 3 sizes because I can't even finish half size! Their specialty is definitely the many options you can choose. We pick the Elvis and the one with all sausages. We like both! 24 hr service is just perfect because we can go there any time for a quick fix! Highly recommend it and will go back next time we visit!"}
{"text":"C'est extraordinaire !! Ces poutines sont magiques !! Elles sont délicieuses !! Il y a un large choix! On a pris la savoyarde et la danse et c'était absolument fantastique :)  De plus l'ambiance dans le Resto est vraiment Cool et détendu !! Parfait pour passer un bon moment !!  Je le recommande fortement !!"}
{"text":"Poutine is a Quebecers food that (very) slightly resembles American Gravy Cheese Fries (Uuukkkk), but is actually very, very different in many respects. The best place to try it in Montréal is at La Banquise."}
{"text":"Found this place because of Yelp and it certainly did not disappoint!  When we got there the line was out the door (which said a lot cause it was freezing that day!)  The line moved fairly quickly but even once inside there was still another line on the inside to wait for a table, the place was packed!  The gajillion types of poutine were a welcome site on the menu!  Everything was really good, the waitress was helpful, and the drink list was pretty solid (for Montreal that is).  Everything was really good (including the corn dog)!   The only two things I could point out that made it not a 100% 5-star review was that the fries seemed like they were just freezer fries, which with that kind of volume I can understand, they probably go through 75 lbs. of fries a day.  And the place a pretty tight, was really hard to not be rude and hit someone with my jacket or scarf since it was the middle of winter.  Other than those 2 minor things, I would 100% recommend to anyone visiting Montreal or anyone who lives there for some reason has not yet decided to go try this place!  Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Meh.   Disappointing. Over hyped. Over priced. Somewhat bland.  Soggy fries. Squeakless \"cheese curd\"... (if you have ever had really good poutine or even just fresh curds you will understand what this means... )  Maybe it is the purist in me... but the gimmick of too many varieties didn't hide the mediocrity of their poutines. I get that fries will get soggy with gravy... but the parts where the gravy didn't cover them... they were ALREADY soggy. The fries should not be already soggy and mushy before adding sauce or gravy.   Not the worst poutine I have ever had but will not be going back. Where the food failed the service matched ... it was just as bad. We could not figure out how this place stays in business.   I suppose this resto fills a need....Let the tourists and the hipsters enjoy the \"coolness\" factor and pay more than they should for mediocre product and lackluster indifferent service.   I'll stick with classic, well made and un- snobby poutine from an old school casse croute, TYVM."}
{"text":"For putin, this is the place to go. My family ordered several variations, all of which were excellent. Friendly staff, comfortable setting, nice neighborhood. I had a salad."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Not very crowded on a Thursday afternoon as I found. Great atmosphere.  I enjoyed a Cidre Mystique while I eagerly awaited my poutine. I ordered La Taquise. A Mexican poutine? What?  On a small plate that held so much more than what you'd think, comes my poutine. Covered in dollops of guacamole, sour cream, and diced tomatoes, it's a \"Frenchcanexican\" treat. Dipping the oil-brown 'frites' in the sour cream proved to be my favourite bit. The Cidre Mystique paired surprisingly well with it, followed by a quick swig of water.  I'm a mechanical, gastro-adventurer, so I eat in a certain process in order to satisfy my taste buds the most. So as follows: poutine, cider, water, repeat! Your dish will warm you, your cider will excite you, and your water will cleanse you for another go.  They've got a great selection of music here, too. At one point, you hear Johnny Cash, then Daft Punk, then hardcore rap? I don't know how they made it all work, but they really did!  Not even half of my regular sized portion is gone and I'm already full, so I don't suggest getting a large unless you're sharing with a friend. They've got two large columns of different poutine that you can choose from. Additional sauces are available if they don't originally come with your choice of poutine.  If you're foreign and eating here, don't make the same mistake I did; La Banquise does not accept credit, nor foreign debit. If you have Canadian debit, you're fine. I ended up having to come up with the idea of giving the waitress my driver's license as a sort of promise that I'd be back in a jiff after going to an ATM to withdrawl Canadian dollars (they accept USD, but I preferred CAD). Banque Laurentienne has ATMs that will accept any card, withdraw CAD, and they only charge 2$ as with any ATM. The waitress was very understanding and didn't make me feel like a bumbling fool.  La Banquise is a very nice place to go if you're wanting to take a little time to yourself in the afternoon and indulge in wonderful, cheese-curd-covered goodness."}
{"text":"Had the ground beef and onions poutine. Mmmm so good. Lucky for us we didn't meet a queue. Ordered the Greek salad as well ( trying to have a balance diet) . Lettuce were crisp and fresh! Chilled at the right temperature"}
{"text":"Très bonnes frites, fromage et sauce! Excellente ambiance, le prix a beaucoup augmenté vue la popularité de l'endroit! Si nous acceptons de faire la file dehors lorsqu'il fait -30, c'est parce que ça en vaut la peine :-)"}
{"text":"La Banquise is one of my favourite places to go in Montréal! I always go there in the middle of the night after partying.  There poutine is just so damn good. It might be the time, or the fact that I was drunk, but it was delicious."}
{"text":"As far as poutine goes, this was pretty tasty. I'll be honest, I'm not a huge poutine person, but this was pretty good."}
{"text":"Leurs poutine est bonne. Leurs frites tombent un peu sur le coeur à la longue car elles ont un arrière-goût sucré. Ne pas prendre de pogo car ils sont mous et pas très bon mais sa dépend des gens."}
{"text":"I often heard the Banquise was one of the best Poutine places in Montreal so I had to try it ! I was honestly a bit disappointed ; not that it's not good, but maybe my expectations were to high. There are so many different poutine choices there, and most of them are so different from what a poutine usually tastes like ! I guess their reputation is mostly due to the fact that they're open 24h : late-night opinions on this kind of food tend to be quite biased. Also, it's one of those places that are reeaally crowded, due to their reputation."}
{"text":"Great poutine for sure! The gravy was fantastic, and the cheese curds were very tasty. The fries tasted well-cooked and fresh as well. We would still need to try more (I mean, there are a lot of different types of poutine on the menu), but so far this was the best poutine that we have had in Montreal."}
{"text":"Good selection of different poutines but otherwise nothing special.  Fries weren't the greatest and couldn't taste the pepper sauce.  Plus is that it's open 24h for those times when you got the munchies post bar hopping."}
{"text":"do i love poutine? not really. i don't get the big hype so i tried this place out to settle the \"is poutine amazing\" debate.  this place was really fun to go to on a saturday night with all the hustle and bustle of clubbers. got a fun, young mtl vibe.  ordered La Miam and added mushrooms. was defs the best poutine i've had.  with that being said, i have settled the debate. poutine is only good when you're sober but only amazing when you're drunk."}
{"text":"24 hr real quebec very own poutine, what more can i say, staff friendly, vast options, food basically ideal for after hrs, solid all around"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that as a Quebec child (and therefore, a connoisseur of poutine), La Banquise is by far the most delicious Montreal poutine place I've ever eaten at, and if eating and thinking about eating poutine there all day long is wrong, then I don't want to be right.   This place is open real late, so if you're looking for a place to clog up your arteries after bars close, then this is the perfect place to go.They only take cash, but no worries, there's an ATM Machine if you don't have any. If you don't have debit though, well, you're pretty screwed. The service is fast, the place is big and clean, and I've never met an unfriendly waitress there. My favorite is the Poutine Frank, which is a poutine with Merguez sausages, but the Poutine Dan Dan (pepperoni, onions, bacon) and the Poutine T-Rex (bacon, pepperoni, ground beef, sausages) are also awesome.  If you're visiting Montreal, make sure you check this place out; and if you live there and haven't experienced this place yet- well then, maybe you ought to consider not calling yourself a Montrealer anymore."}
{"text":"No disputing the poutine is incredible. My only word of advise when taking an order to go, is to double check your order before you leave. I certainly will be doing it whenever I take my food to go. I've had at least 3 orders prepared incorrectly over the last couple of months and there's nothing worst when you take an hour of your time to pick up an order only to find out they did not prepare it correctly. Just recently placed an order with extra cheese and extra sauce only to find it was prepared without cheese and sauce. Really! No one found it strange preparing a poutine without cheese and sauce! Maybe a bit more concentration from the cooks and a little less talking and singing.  Nothing worst then when you're looking forward to a plate of great poutine only to find out there was some disconnect between the order being placed and being prepared. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Recommandé par des amies l'année dernière vraiment pas déçus un large choix de poutine , bonne ambiance petit moins c'est le manque de place j'ai trouver qu'on était un peu à l'étroit , sinon un endroit à découvrir après une bonne ballade au mont royal ."}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered 'La Miam' for takeout. Great flavour. Cheese curds melted nicely. Very busy location, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Completely overrated. There are much better places to get poutine in Montreal (Poutineville! - way better quality and so much more choice than La Banquise).  The quality of the food and service has gone completely downhill at La Banquise. The last few times we went (at various times of the day and night) we weren't super happy with the service and food quality, but it's not exactly fine dining, so we didn't really bother too much about it, but after my experience there today I will never go back.  My husband and I went in for breakfast just before 10am. There were only about 5 other tables in the restaurant, and at least 4 people working in the kitchen. We ordered our food, got coffee and watched for an hour as everyone else got served, including two tables that arrived after us, before the waitress finally came to tell us there was a mistake with our order and it would only be a few more minutes (at about 10:40am). Not only did we watch as the other guests were served, BUT we also watched as various kitchen staff members left the kitchen with their own plates of poutine and other things both before and after the waitress came to tell us this news.  After another 15 minutes, our food was still not there, so we decided to leave and go to Poutineville since they open at 11am. To top it off, they actually charged us for our coffees before leaving and didn't seem to feel badly at all about what had happened!!   Terrible customer service. Seriously, never again."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars, but they only take Canadian debit cards or cash for payment (no credit cards), and this is not indicated on their website.  Unfortunately, there are no banks nearby, and the ATM machine in the restaurant would not accept our credit cards or American debit cards.  Luckily, we pulled together enough cash to pay for our meal.  Visiting Montreal, we were so excited to try poutine here, and the food and service were definitely worth the trek from the Metro and the wait (we waited for over an hour on a Monday night!).  The servers were very polite and happy to deal with our questions about the food because of food allergies.  Between four of us, we tried La Classique (with vegetarian gravy) and La Taquise.  We preferred the latter - the Mexican toppings really made the dish more interesting.  I would have liked to try more variations, but the portions are generous, and poutine itself is very filling!  I'm glad that we got a chance to try poutine at such a fun and friendly place. :)"}
{"text":"What more can be said about this place that hasn't already been mentioned in the other reviews. Fun atmosphere, good service, great food, nice local bottled beer selection, all at reasonable prices. Best Poutine in Montreal!  I ordered the regular sized Smoked Meat Poutine. Fries were delicious, cheese was melted to perfection, and perfect amount of gravy. Nicely cooked and well seasoned smoked meat to top it off!  Hard to go wrong with the Poutine here, but if you're not in the mood for it they also have burgers that looked delicious."}
{"text":"There are interesting variants on the poutine. I wonder if this is why La Banquise is so well-known in Montréal. But I actually found the poutine to be pretty average, and I wasn't sure why it was so special. I prefer Frite Alors (because their fries are fried in lard!) or Chez Claudette (for the hole-in-the-wall atmosphere). La Banquise tries too hard with the hipster atmosphere in my opinion, and they should spend that time on improving their food."}
{"text":"Busy, loud atmosphere BUT... The BEST poutines in Montreal. I've been there multiple times and I've never been disappointed. Flavourful, scrumptious poutines. Happiness! The only other front runner would be Poutineville."}
{"text":"Menu is very interesting, offers lots of varieties. I enjoyed their poutine while I was in Montreal. Will go back to try more.  Services are good too."}
{"text":"Not the biggest fan of greasy food but I had to try poutine while in Montreal. I ordered the poutine with smoked meat (L'Asterix) and it was enjoyable. Greasy as hell, but the fries were crispy and cheese curds were just the right amount of gooey and stringy. Sour cream at the top was a bit over the top, but I just scraped that to the side. Ordered the small and didn't finish. Went on the Saturday before Halloween, so the atmosphere was fantastic. Service was fine."}
{"text":"Fries were overcooked and soggy (not just the ones  in gravy), kind of bland. Very busy, packed with locals and tourists alike. Glad I went there to try their poutine, but will try elsewhere in search of better poutine next time I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Decent poutine. Stopped by with family, recieved good service and relatively no wait to get in (it was a Sunday afternoon, so that helped).   The menu is glorious. A variety of toppings will overwhelm you upon first viewing. When you get your order, you will experience that tenfold. They really stack their toppings up. I generally like only a bit of topping, like NY Fries does, but La Banquise smothers their crisp fries with a heaping serving of topping. If you're a fan of decadent poutine, this will be right up your alley. If you're more into a surplus of fries, the rest of the menu besides La Classique might be too rich.   Some family members and I ended up ordering our meals to go. We spent the later evening polishing off the mouth-watering remnants. Yes, even their cold fries were good (albeit still too rich)!  Since the trip, my sister has been craving their poutine. Will definitely drop by next time we're in Montreal, but will ask the staff for less topping."}
{"text":"Perfect!!! Friendly service, busy and on the ball. The food is fresh, fast and made in house. Very affordable...go with the trio deals section of the menu.  Cheese curds were squeeky fresh!"}
{"text":"Meilleure poutine en ville! Je recommande la savoyarde! Imbattable! Service 24h pour ceux qui travaillent de nuit! Service toujours avec le sourire! C'est une plaçe absoluement a faire si vous êtes de passage à Montréal!"}
{"text":"The poutine was amazing! Loved the food, and the staff was very helpful and friendly.  My complaint, however, would be that the establishment always has some sort of line-up which can get you a waiting time for a minimum half-hour. In my opinion, the poutine was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon around 3pm after our hotel recommended this place. We had both never tried poutine before. When we arrived there was a line that went outside by about 5 people. We waited maybe 20 mins for a table, so not bad. Warning: this place is cramped when busy! If you're claustrophobic or can't stand sitting next to others while you dine, I would recommend getting your poutine to go! After reviewing the menu of over 30 poutines, I settled on Le Matty: onions, peppers, mushrooms, and bacon. My husband got La Savoyarde: bacon, onions, swiss, and sour cream. Our food arrived quickly and was piping hot and fresh. The regular size portion is HUGE, we definitely could have split one. This being my first poutine experience, I thought it was pretty tasty! The fries were hand-cut style and cooked to a dark golden brown. The cheese curds were melted slightly, and the bacon and veggies were grilled. The addition of the sour cream on my husband's went really well with the fries, gravy and cheese! My only complaint: I was a bit under impressed with the gravy as it did not taste homemade. I was glad I got mine with the veggies and bacon because they added some of the flavor that the gravy was missing. I would like to try poutine again with a creamier homemade gravy. Overall, it was a good experience, but don't expect gourmet flavors here! It is what it says: gravy, cheese, fries, and toppings, nothing more or less! Would be perfect for a hangover! The service was good. Waitstaff was attentive and cleared our plates and delivered the check promptly. They have a French and an English menu, so ask your server for your preferred menu language! Bonus, they are open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"In all my trips to Montreal, I'd never had poutine before but we finally decided to try the local grub and when I say grub I mean GRUB.  I wouldn't describe poutine any other way. Maybe \"slop\".   Anyway, les gens du coin all said this was the spot to pop your poutine cherry, with its extremely long list of poutine plats and 24-hour 'round the clock service. So we plunked down around midnight and ordered a monstrosity... I believe it was called the T-Rex? A heaping plate of cheese curds & fries, doused in a deluge of gravy and in this case, topped with a couple animals' worth of meaty bits. To be honest, the meaty bits were pretty gross. I LOVED the cheese curds, and the fries with gravy were...well, fries with gravy. Tasty, but you never feel good about eating such nonsense. In retrospect, I would've been -much- happier with the \"Classique\", sans meat.   I'm going to give this place 4 stars because I imagine if you LIKE poutine, or you're a first-timer like I was, you can't get better dished up 'round the clock in Montreal than at La Banquise, nor can you get more varieties. However, it misses a 5 star review because it has just about the nastiest bathroom I have ever encountered, anywhere. Truly, it was awful. Two were out of order, and the one available had no paper, suspicious pools of liquid all over the floor, stench...needless to say I fled.  Oh, and after 22H you have to pay your waitress up front, in cash. Just FYI"}
{"text":"Late night / early morning poutine with friends after clubbing is a decidedly Monreal-established tradition.  Phenomenal drunk food served fast and pretty much unbeatable at that time of morning!  I wish I had access to this place 365 days per year but my fat ass is thankful I don't."}
{"text":"Je ne suis que depuis 2 mois au Canada, mais j'ai déjà goûté quelques poutines et celle de La Banquise était vraiment délicieuse?!  J'ai pris celle avec le fromage à raclette et c'était très bon, sans être écoeurant?! Les portions sont assez généreuses et le service très sympa et efficace.  L'endroit est assez grand et malgré qu'il soit assez connu et touristique, nous avons eu une place assise directement. Le cidre et les bières proposés sont bons et pas trop chers.   Un vrai coup de coeur?, j'y retournerai bientôt pour tester une autre des nombreuses poutines proposées!"}
{"text":"Solid Poutine. Great Selection.  Whether you're looking to introduce an out-of-towner to poutine, or simply want to spice up your usual craving for fries and curd cheese, this the place to be. With something like 20 different options variations, moreover, you won't easily get bored of the menu."}
{"text":"Poutine was good, but expect a bit of a wait and this place was VERY difficult to find/ hard to get to by public transportation. I got lost multiple times and it is more in a neighborhood, not a busy commercial area. I am glad I went since this is supposed to be the best of Montreal, and the food was good, service decent. But it was a bit of a production. Another option is to get take out and eat it elsewhere. Not very well air conditioned either."}
{"text":"Not a poutine expert here: But if you're looking to try the Canadian staple maybe look somewhere else.   They messed up or order which is fine I don't care as long as it tastes good but it  didn't. If you're in town and just looking to try poutine for the first  time you can do better. The line is always long and the place is way out of the way if you're in downtown or old Montreal.   I wish it was great. It just wasn't."}
{"text":"In Montreal, I had to try the poutine. After all, the Mexican poutine (AKA carne asada fries) was a staple college food when I lived in San Diego.  I ordered the Matty Poutine, which was topped with gravy, curdled cheese, bacon, green peppers, mushrooms, and onion. I did enjoy lying to myself that the vegetables made the poutine a healthier dish. Still, it was very enjoyable, but frankly, I still prefer carne asada fries. I rather have the yellow shoe string fries and cheddar cheese.  My family also ordered an omelette Merguez (Merguez sausages, mushrooms, and onions with green salad and wheat toast) and  BLT sandwich on wheat bread with salad. The omelette was very good while the BLT was pretty average.  The cups for water were pretty small, but they give you an entire pitcher, so you don't have to keep asking for refills.  All in all, the price was great for the portions I received. The service was okay. The waitress wasn't particularly friendly, but she wasn't rude either. However, it took quite a while to flag the waitress down. The decor was very cute and artsy, and generally, the restaurant was pretty clean."}
{"text":"I've been to La Banquise several times and always enjoy it. The servings are huge. I find the regular is a struggle for one person, but the large is a good portion for two people.   I like the variety of different poutines. The T-Rex is usually my go to. Plenty of toppings and curds. Yum!"}
{"text":"The poutine was good. But not the best Ive had. I stopped by there only because everyone was talking about this restaurant and how their poutine was amazing.  Their poutine is expensive for what it is, the place is noisy and full as hell and be prepared to wait a long time before you get your order.  If youre not a tourist, you wont be impress. And if you are, go to the Belle Province, its better and less expensive."}
{"text":"Best poutine ever! Ordered the poutine with guacemole, sour cream and tomatoes. Was quite impressed with the creativity and effort put into making a regular poutine look and taste different. Cute decor with an overall chill vibes. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"This was my first Montreal poutine experience and it didn't disappoint! Resto La Banquise was at the top of my \"best poutine in Montreal\" searches, so I was a little worried that it was simply an institution and was rated accordingly. We went on a Friday afternoon just after the lunch rush and were seated immediately. The server and hostess were very friendly and graciously communicated in our mixture of English and French. Another women (perhaps a manager), also checked on us once and made sure everything was good, so five stars for the service.  We tried two of the regular sized poutine plates and had two Quebec beers. The \"La Bacon\" was rich and hearty with a generous portion of bacon. The \"Poivree\" was also excellent. We stuck with the traditional cheese curds on both. The amount of sauce on each was inconsistent (much less on the pepper than the bacon), but that was OK and gave us a chance to decide how much sauce we liked. The fries were crispy and well done.  The IPA and the Hefeweizen were fairly bland, but were nice with the poutine.  Since this was my first poutine experience, I don't really have a great frame of reference; Resto didn't overwhelm me with flavor, but it was a lively atmosphere, great service, and tasty food."}
{"text":"The poutine is good! Lots of different options. Need to work on cleanliness of the Resturant.  I don't really recommend it.  I'm sure you can find something better."}
{"text":"Simple hommage à l'une des quelques pertes attribuables à mon déménagement en France... La poutine! Ici, à Montréal, la Banquise se veut être, à mon sens, la Mecque de la poutine. Présentée à travers moult variations classiques et parfois déjantées, cette dernière se veut le baptême idéal de tout voyageur curieux... Ouvert toute la nuit!"}
{"text":"I am a local here in the Plateau and have ended up at this restaurant one too many times. I think the place is terrible.  There are always long lines, service is highly impersonal and you are rushed in and out, and treated like a huge inconvenience.  The poutine with guacamole sounds interesting but it is terrible - processed mushy packaged guacamole. I tried this one when drunk at 3am when almost anything tastes good. Especially a poutine. This did not taste good at all.  The last time I visited I left my phone and when I called the next day I was told to call the 'office' who don't seem to ever pick up the phone. After anxiously waiting all day, someone FINALLY let me know that they DID have my phone! It baffles me how the people answering the phone weren't aware that there was a phone in lost and found should someone call about it.  It appears this place has just gotten too big and it has no local, traditional Montreal feel it just like they have capitalised on their name too far.  Do yourself a HUGE favour. Go to Chez Claudette instead. That restaurant is the real deal and their poutine is a million times better than la banquise. Vegetarians, ask the guys at Chez claudette for their delicious lentil gravy and homemade hot sauce. Friendly, fresh (you can see the cooks here) even with a great little patio. Avoid la banquise everyone."}
{"text":"Love their many variations on poutine. But even the classic is worth the detour.  The fries are perfectly crisp and soft inside the sauce is super tasty and the perfect ratio of fries to sauce to cheese makes it a standard.  The fact that it's opened late isn't a bad thing either of course. .."}
{"text":"This was the best poutine I had while in Canada! I came here alone and still really enjoyed myself. The staff was really nice, hopefully they appreciated my attempts to speak the language. haha  I ordered the classique poutine and it was incredible! Would absolutely go back. I got the Boreale blonde for my drink and that was great, too! Definitely had a bit of a line to wait in, but it was 100% worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for poutine at whatever time you crave it. Went with my sister and aunt and we all ate a different poutine. I had the one with bacon, which was crispy without being burnt. Sister had the vegetarian version (they have vegan options as well) which is why we went (she believes it to be the best veggie poutine sauce) and my aunt had the original as it was her first time and she wanted to try the basic. The cheese isn't as plentiful as one might want but the fries are spot on. Also it's not a spot to sit and chat as they are always busy and those waiting at the entrance for a table were staring at us with hungry eyes. But the price is decent, the options are vast and it's always open and for that it's a place we will be frequenting."}
{"text":"Cold everything, long wait, food served cold, and to top it all unhelpful and rude  staff... Definitely won't be back at this dump! Save yourself the trip and go to McDonalds... Honestly."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm too much of a health freak or just don't love fries but I didn't find the poutine here earth-shattering.  We trekked here in the very snowy Canadian weather to be greeted by a long line inside the restaurant.    The wait went fairly quickly and then we got to the fries. We ordered the classic and the 3 amigos which had 3 different types of sausage on it.  I found the 3 amigo poutine more flavorful with the original falling flat on flavor. I also thought that it was quite expensive for a simple dish of fries.   If I were to go back to Montreal, I would not need to come back for the poutine."}
{"text":"Overated poutine spot. People like it because of the hype and most of the time their drunk and hungry at 4 am and its one of the only place you know the party will continue."}
{"text":"Poutine is very good. No complaints. They even have Shepard pie! 7.5/10. Costaud burger is decent but pass on the chicken burger. It's a cheap generic frozen battered patty .. If u go late at night, you must pay them in advance (to prevent dine & dash situations..lol it's true tho). Their slaw on the hot dogs and burgers is really good! It's different from the other slaws elsewhere. This one has carrots in the slaw. I always bring my relatives from out of town here for poutine. It never fails. They are constant on their quality. Except that one time I had a huge hair on my poutine!!! Barff!!! But they changed it as soon as i spotted it! You couldn't miss it.. God! It laid beautifully on top of the cheese curds like a mint chocolate on your pillow at a 4 star hotel."}
{"text":"Very wide selection of poutines on the menu. The place always gets packed after the bars close. Young crowd."}
{"text":"Best poutine in town! the meat lover's is amazing, as is pretty much everything else there. Portions are really big, so make sure you're hungry. Its usually crowded, especially on weekends, so you might have to wait a little, but service is pretty quick. Nothing like fatty greasy food to satisfy you're hunger, especially after a few drinks (or many lol). ENJOY"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to have poutine on are trip back to Montreal.  Decided to give this place a try based on their appearance on Bizarre Foods, a good place to go with different options of poutine.  their was a line to the door at 10:30pm, our hopes for good food were really high.   I gave this place three stars based on the average of my dish (poutine with chicken) and my husbands (poutine with turkey)  I didn't like the breaded chicken they used for my dish but the turkey was outstanding."}
{"text":"So too start off, we are a couple of Canadians and we have definitely had our fair share of poutines in Toronto. We decided to take a ski weekend in Jay peak and knew we were going to stop in Montreal for some Poutine and smoked meat sandwiches on the way home. So after reading through many yelp reviews we came to the conclusion that this must be the best. Now let me tell you we were not disappointed. The poutine experience starts from the minute you walk in the door. It was a little bit busy, but you get to watch them make the poutines while you wait so time flies by. You get to your table then make sure you grab a beer they are all locally brewed and delicious. Next up... The poutine, now you may think wow so many options, trust me I had a tough decision deciding. First of all my brother wanted to share, however you defiantly need your home so I refused.  I got the rachelle poutine with green peppers  onions mushrooms and let me tell you I finished every last bite on the plate regardless of how full I was. My brother got the classic and it was mouth watering. Don't be afraid to ask a stranger for a bite or two in order to try it out. The entire atmosphere and servers were all wonder. And don't forget no matter how full you are make sure to stop by for smoked meat sandwiches and bagels,after all that's what Montreal is for"}
{"text":"Went today, a Saturday at 7PM, waited 30 min outside which was fair given the huge line up. Expect lots of noise and no service (order extra water if you drink a lot). My biggest disappointment is that the cheese curds in my poutine didn't melt at all, for a 11$ poutine, I mean... Ok, portions are great but still, the cheese doesn't melt! Onion rings were great though. PS. Credit cards aren't accepted!"}
{"text":"C'est un endroit incontournable pour le touriste français qui visite Montréal et souhaite goûter l'un des plats typiques du Québec : La Poutine. Ambiance chaleureuse, atmosphère type Pub anglo-saxons. En contrepartie, il vous faudra faire la queue pour obtenir une table. Ce restaurant typique est très courru. De nombreuses variétés de Poutine, toutes aussi bonnes les unes que les autres. A déguster avec modération (c'est calorique) accompagnée d'une bonne bière canadienne. Bonne soirée."}
{"text":"Went to Montreal for the day and wanted to seek out the two best things Quebec has to offer (other than beer and hockey) smoked meat sandwiches and poutine.  Narrowed down my selections to Schwartz's for a sangy and La Banquise for poutine.  After downing the most delectible smoked meat sandwich ever at schwartzs, we headed over the La Banquise to pile some gravy and cheese curds on top of it!  Although poutine isn't very complex, I wasn't all that impressed with La Banquise. They have a huge menu, with all kinds of adaptations on traditional poutine, we stuck to the traditional. It was average, but I was a little disappointed after all the reviews I had read. Although I think anything would have been sub par after Schwartz's.   Be sure to bring cash if you do have a Canadian credit card (not even my TD Bank (Toronto Dominion) card would work)."}
{"text":"I didn't think the food was that great.  But, I had the Classique', the regular, I didn't go for a fancy poutine, because it was my first poutine.  Maybe the others are better.  I also did not like the fact that I couldn't sit outside because I wanted to drink alcohol.  So I sat inside.  The service and price makes it worth the trip."}
{"text":"I came here about three years ago and had a great time with friends and the service was wonderful. On my recent trip to Montreal, I made this my first spot to visit.  What a disappointment it was!  Service here is terrible, and it absolutely ruined our experience. My boyfriend I had just finished driving from Boston to Montreal and were starving. We didn't have time to exchange our money to Canadian, but we figured the place would take credit cards since it's such a tourist favorite.   The minute we ordered the waitress came back with the bill. We didn't make much of it, but she kept coming back and pestering us about the bill. So we decided to pay, but we hadn't even received our food yet. I gave her my credit card, but she wouldn't take it because she said the restaurant does not take American credit cards. We explained to her that we had a Visa and everyone takes Visas. She then changed her story and said that the machine that takes credit cards was down so that's why they couldn't take cards. It was cash only, but we told her we didn't have any only american, which she eagerly said she would take. I didn't to do that, but we were starving so we gave her the money. I understand since it's busy and she wanted to get paid that she didn't have time to convert the correct change. But we definitely did not receive the correct change, and she took much more than was on the bill. We figured we didn't need to leave a tip because she had already taken most of it and more.  When we finally received our food, I was so disappointed, not at all what I remembered. The food was terrible. I had the T-Rex and it was just lukewarm. We left a little defeated, and then the waitress ran after us telling us that tip is not included. We tried to explain to her that she took more money when she gave us the change in Canadian, but she didn't understand or wanted to take more of our money. When my boyfriend asked if we could speak to a manager she quickly declined and let us go. Overall the entire interaction with her was incredibly sketchy and I do believe we were taken advantage of because we were tourists. Later during our trip we talked to a lot of locals who said that this is not the place to go for poutine, I would try other places if I were you."}
{"text":"OK poutine.  We were intrigued by all of the toppings choices, but were disappointed with the results.  Would have been better if the veggies were cooked/sauteed instead of dumped on raw.  Very hipster atmosphere- crowded with hand painted tables practically on top of each other and good prices.  However, we didn't think it was worth the line out the door and have had better poutine."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Visiting from the States and this place came highly recommended. Definitely did not disappoint. Only if I could find a place in the States that made this."}
{"text":"YAY poutine!  I got the classic poutine to go. It was really fast service. Noticed that you don't get as much for the to go boxes compared to if I had dined in. But nevertheless, delicious! Wish there were more cheese!"}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with late-night poutine. That said - there are many poutine places in Montreal that can serve you up something just as good or better, without the lineup."}
{"text":"This place is a TOURIST TRAP.  Don't waste your time here. The food is average, and the service terrible. It's dirty, loud (bad music), and overcrowded. Get a chicken Poutine accross the street."}
{"text":"I dont know why oh why everyone is so boncus about this place! Nothing nothing is special! The place is a regular drop in diner and their poutines??? Some of them taste good, but they leave your stomach in trouble- i head heart burn for 2 days after. I don't think they change their frier oil- ever!"}
{"text":"NO trip to montreal is complete without a poutine pit stop.  Came to montreal during a weekend getaway for the Osheaga music festival and HAD to get a 6-hr post road trip serving of poutine (aka french fries with deliciousness all over it!).  NOTE: not sure if this is always the case but at 11 PM this place was not taking any major credit cards (and for road trip travelers just crossing the border.. this was a slight problem.. luckily the US dollar goes a long way!)   Decor:  nothing fancy.  what you expect a 24-hr joint to look like.  lively with mouth watering smell of fries coming from every table!   Food: fries with gravy.  need i say more?  recommend the one with turkey and gravy.  tastes like a thanksgiving meal.    Future endeavor(s):  ABSOLUTELY!"}
{"text":"Best place in town if you want to eat the famous Poutine."}
{"text":"We researched the best poutine joint in Montreal and this was one of the best. Lineup can get pretty long but its worth the wait. Incredible place to dine, great staff, and great food! Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting poutine."}
{"text":"Great poutine! So many different flavours and open very late! Must try it out if you're visiting Montreal"}
{"text":"Après un mois à faire le tour du Quebec, on en a gouté des Poutines!!  On nous avait prévenu, la Poutine tu aimes ou tu aimes pas! ET toute la famille a adoré! Nous finissons donc ce périple par Montréal, et une amie étudiante à Montreal, me  conseil La Banquise, donc on prend un vélo avec toute la petite famille et on part à la recherche de cette fameuse banquise! Le moins que l'on puisse dire c'est que l'endroit est CHALEUREUX seulement son nom apport une petite brise de fraicheur!  On a eu de la chance, pas de réservation, debut d'aprem, on a pas trop attendu pour avoir une table pour 4! J'étais bien contente que mon amie m'ai conseillé la Taquise, comme ça je n'avais pas trop à réfléchir! Pour le reste de la famille plus dur! Pour le petit frère la Elvis et les parents ne font pas les fous ils restent sur la Classique!   Personne n'a pu finir, mais tout le monde s'est REGALE! Si on était pas à l'hotel on aurait prix le doggy bag!!   LE PLUS PLUS: Ouvert 24/24h!!!! Ils en ont de la chance les Montrealais!!  BREF: Je confirme c'est le TOP DU TOP!!"}
{"text":"Endroit un peu sale sol glissant mais un service agréable! J'ai pris La Taquise mais Honnêtement j'ai vraiment pas aimé mais je pense que c'est une question de goût. C'était vraiment gras je me suis sentie mal ensuite et écoeurée.  J'ai des amies qui ont adorés leurs poutines mais pour moi ça a pas été le cas"}
{"text":"This family-run poutine spot has been my favourite since my very first visit six years ago. La Banquise serves more than 30 varieties of poutine. For this visit, I ordered the L'Astérix (right) with smoked meat, mushrooms, sour cream & pepper sauce, and my boyfriend ordered the La Folie (left) with mushrooms, corn, sauteed red onions, spicy sausage, bacon, sour cream, Jalapeno Popper & pepper sauce. Both were so filling and satisfying. Amazing portion size too - their regular is just right!"}
{"text":"Ils ont pleins de sortes de poutines. Elles sont bonnes mais pas à se taper la tête sur les murs comme certains le prétendent.  Ça reste de la poutine."}
{"text":"Am not a poutine person everywhere I go they don't do it well but when I was in montreal and saw this poutine place and I heard that montreal has the best poutine so i decide to try it. and it was really really really good poutine the best I've ever had.  This place is a MUST either you like poutine or not because they do it in a perfect way and they have a lot of options you can choose from so defiantly you will find something you like in their menu   Price is perfect  Portion is more than perfect Service is great and friendly"}
{"text":"So I heard this was one of the best places to try poutine. My girlfriend and I were excited to try this place since we only experienced poutine once in Toronto and were a bit on the fence about it. So we went and got seated fairly quickly considering how busy it was. I have to say that I might not be a huge poutine fan but my two stars is based solely on service. We ordered two regular size poutine dishes and it took over an hour. 4 tables that came in after us ate and left before we got our food. Not a fan of the service and probably not a fan of poutine but I was hoping for more out of this place"}
{"text":"A very popular Poutine restaurant in Montreal, probably among one of the most popular. Some of my friends label their Poutine as drunk food and have other preferences but I myself like it. The French fries are reasonably good but I won't miss it if I won't go there for a while"}
{"text":"La Banquise is another Montreal's must do.  Personally I am not a great fan of poutine but there are some, especially in la Banquise that are great even for no-poutine eaters."}
{"text":"OK let's be honest... easily one of the best poutine joints in Montreal. This is my GO-TO spot for anyone visiting out of town who wants to try out our greasy, nasty, famous plate. Plus it ALWAYS hits the spot after a night of drinking and for that alone I give it a 5-star. Do not go here expecting a high quality meal because you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"OMG! La Banquise was recommended to me by my manager so I decided to go there during my recent trip to Montreal. They are not lying when they say it is the best poutine in Montreal. I had a Bacon Poutine which was amazing. The cheese curds melt in your mouth and they have that squeaking sound when you bite into them! They didn't shy away from adding lots of bacon as well. The service was quick and I love the fact that they are open 24/7 (I went at 3 AM after the bar and didn't even regret it the next morning, it was that good!)."}
{"text":"This was my first time having Poutine and it was delicious. We had a traditional one and a bacon one. Both were great. I felt like you could taste the bacon flavor throughout. The proportions were fairly large. We ordered two large ones and it ended up being a lot for two adults and two kids. I would not hesitate to come back. This place is cash only so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"La Banquise... Connue comme le loup blanche    Des Poutines excellentes un rapport qualité prix extra. Pour avoir essayé son principal concurrent Poutineville il n'y a pas photo !   Certes une fille d'attente, mais elle est victime de son succès. Néanmoins l'attente se fait plutôt bien et on peut même prendre à emporter, le service est rapide, souriant et efficace. Un très grand choix de Poutines, il y en a pour tous les goûts.  Avec son ouverture 24/24h elle convient à tout le monde!!  Pour manger une Poutine à Montréal c'est là qu'il faut aller absolument!"}
{"text":"This poutine thing is a real death trap, but so good! I tried the Poutine Dan Dan : Regular Poutine with Onion & Bacon. The cheese burger was nice and cheap. They have good taste in music too!"}
{"text":"La Banquise serves \"gourmet\" poutine in the sense that not only serves the tradional style with curds and gravy. They have at least 25 different variations but all the different variations are very \"down-to-earth\" unlike the poutine that I once had in a fancy restaurant with lobster, brie and bernaise suace.  I tried the one called \"Mart poutine\" with smoked sausage, bacon and sauteed mushrooms as well as the curds and gravy. That was one delicious combination!  This is definitely a place to try if you are in Montreal. The decor is very casual and funky... a great place to hangout with friends. Great place for lunch, snack, dinner, or after a night of partying."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely life changing. I went here today around 2:30 with a group of 12 and everyone LOVED their meal. I got the vegan poutine and the gravy was to die for. The fries are also so good!!! It was really busy but we didn't wait long to get in and the service was awesome. Our waitress was really friendly and patient with us when we tried to practice our french with her. If you're in Montreal you need to check this place out!!"}
{"text":"While the line was at least a 30 min wait, it was well worth it. Best poutine I've had, ever, never mind Montréal. However, given how crowded it gets, I'd go on the Terrace in the summer or take it to go for the parc across the way. It was my first time so I had the La Classique with vegetalienne sauce. It is the only place I've been to that had a tasty vegetarian option let alone multiple options to try. Will surely come back to try others on my next trip to the city."}
{"text":"Best poutine I have ever had anywhere!  I will admit I still have a lot of places with great reps to try in MTL but so far this is the standard I will judge all poutine on.  Great fries, great gravy, great cheese , lot of other topping options. I tried a few they where all awesome.  so glad I went here. It had a lot of hype going in and it did not fall short."}
{"text":"Great for a midnight poutine if you are in the area. Otherwise, I don't think it really stands out."}
{"text":"Cute diner-y place. Fries, gravy and all the toppings are really good. Really casual and very busy.   The cheese curds did not melt at all, and they were squeaky...I read that this is the sign of fresh curds, but the fresh curds I had back in the day were quite soft, melty and chewy."}
{"text":"If you really want to eat a poutine... The place to be, even at 2am (open all night)"}
{"text":"Ah, Poutine. Sure, people try to imitate you all across Canada and in small pockets of the United States but nothing beats a poutine in your home province. There are, of course, fierce debates as to which establishment has the best poutine in La Belle Province and La Banquise always pops up as one of those places that has some of the best poutine in Québec.  I love La Banquise because it serves up some high quality poutine* at all hours of the night. The curds are pretty good and their many poutine combinations/types seem to work pretty well. You can have a classic poutine if you'd like or you can be adventurous and try poutines such as the Duleton (minced meat and onions), poutine galvaude (basically a Hot Chicken sandwich in the form of poutine) or the B.O.M. (bacon, onions and Merguez sausage... sort of like a heart attack waiting to happen). It's definitely not fine dining but after a night of drinking with friends, I don't think fancy food is what one craves.  Last but not least, La Banquise is so cool that Omnikrom (and TTC) feature it heavily in the excellent \"Danse la poutine\".  * - Just because we're in Québec doesn't mean that there isn't any poor and disgusting poutine, either."}
{"text":"If you have friends or family visiting from abroad, this is a great place to introduce them to local flavor. Good choice of poutine  It's recommended not to eat anything before and eat as much fruits, vegetables and tea before and after, since it's really fat, salty and will tax your body."}
{"text":"If you do any research before visiting Montreal, you're no doubt going to come across lots of people telling you to go to La Banquise for the best poutine in Montreal. It's true it's very good, but for all the hype I wasn't blown away. I went there with some friends around 3 am and we were met with a line about 20 people, luckily the weather was very nice and we didn't mind waiting. It only took about 20 minutes for us to get seated, but when we went to put in our order we found out that they only accept canadian debit card, this was frustrating but they did have an atm conveniently in the restaurant.   I got the classic poutine and the la banquise burger, the poutine was good not great and the burger was awesome. I would recommend, but there are a lot of other poutine shops that will be just as good."}
{"text":"Whenever I have friends coming to town from out of the province, I bring them to La Banquise. This place is open 24/7 and is almost always jam packed. The few times I went, there were always a line so nowadays I just make my life easier and order a take-out. It's at least twice as fast, I get to avoid the noisy and overcrowded tables, and the poutines are just as generous.  The portions are huuuge. The poutines are very rich with gravy and the portion of cheese and meat on each one is more than worth the price. The fries are nothing spectacular but they were also excellent. I would recommend being a bit adventurous and wander outside the Classic for some of their more exotic offerings since that's what they're known for."}
{"text":"You NEED to go here at least once. Especially after a night out. Such good POUTINE at a reasonable price. Quick easy service. You pay when you order so you can leave when you are done. Get anything with sour cream!"}
{"text":"Came for our first and only Montreal poutine experience. Long line outside told us we were in the right place. Tons of different options but we went with a reggae and Savoyarde. Small plates were satisfying and loaded with toppings. Bonus highlight - the kitchen crew belting out the soundtrack filling the restaurant."}
{"text":"Should you eat here? Yes.   Another Montréal staple, if you haven't been to Banquise, you haven't lived. Widely recognized as the best poutine in the world, La Banquise is a restaurant you must visit.   There is an endless selection of poutine for everyone from the meatlovers to the vegetarians.   Although personally I prefer Poutineville, Frites Alors or Décarie Hot Dog - the poutine here is must try."}
{"text":"Like Jean Chretien said, le plus meilleur poutine au monde. Best poutine place in Quebec Try the BOM The ambiance representant the quebecois culture. Special Scooby is delicious"}
{"text":"Pros: - Good variety. More kinds of poutine than you can dream of! - Food is tasty and in good quantity. - Reasonable prices.  Cons: - Service is not excellent, but they have many clients so it's hard to blame them. - You can't book a table. If you go during rush hour you'll have to wait up to 30 minutes in line."}
{"text":"Il parait que la banquise c'est The place to be pour manger la meilleure poutine de Montreal. En suivant se conseil je me suis rendu 2 fois lors de mon séjour et je n'ai jamais été décu. Dans un premier temps par l'accueil avec de charmante serveuses et dans un second temps par la poutine. Il faut dire que pour un lieu ouvert depuis des années et que c'est 24h/24 donc ils ont eu le temps de progresser et de développer leurs recettes. Pour mon premier passage on m'a proposé deux tailles différentes et je dois dire que j'ai bien fait de prendre la plus petite. Certes ce repas n'est pas des plus équilibré car il s'agit purent de frite de viande de fromage et de sauce mais ca n'est pas un étouffe chrétien (désolé pour l'expression).! (Voir photo ci-dessous) ! Concernant les recettes il y a un large choix mais comme c'est la sauce qui donne le principal du gout. En tout cas il y a en a beaucoup à tester. Pour ce qui est du service rien à redire il est souriant et rapide et tout cela est fait pour un prix raisonnable il faut compter 10Dollars pour une poutine sans les taxes."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect, but it definitely seems like a homey sort of place where I imagine people could head after a night of drinking. The poutine menu is pretty serious, and I don't remember what I ordered, but it was delicious. The portions are pretty large, though."}
{"text":"The poutine selection here is fantastic! It accommodated  vegans, vegetarians and non-vegs too! The poutine is great tho my cheese curds didn't melt enough but that could jus be a one-off. Regardless of that, it didn't stop me from enjoying my poutine! May visit it a second time during our stay"}
{"text":"Though not super well-known, the Shepard's pie is actually delicious! (also not to mention a large portion)"}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed by this place. I went on the recommendations of so many Montrealers. Two bites of a classic poutine, and yes it's yummy. But as a meal in itself? A few bites later, and I found myself wanting the sour contrast of ketchup for the fries that missed the gravy. Terrific snack after a night of drinking: absolutely. Foodie haute cuisine, deserving of the title of best poutine in Montreal? meh. Not really. Ultimately regretted wasting one of our precious nights in the city on this dining experience that left us feeling like we ingested a cannonball, when there are so many interesting places to eat in Montreal."}
{"text":"Yum the Mexican poutine is so good... I haven't been there in a while but every time I go I love it."}
{"text":"It's great for a drunken (or hungover) meal, but as far as poutines go, there are better ones around. Banquise wins points for being open so late and for having so many 'toppings'. If you want a basic poutine though, go somewhere else"}
{"text":"This is the poutine heaven! A lot of variety, from the classic, to the vegetarian sauce and variety of add-ons. Sometimes, there's a line up outside. I would defenetly recommend this place for a classic poutine or any different version they offer and have."}
{"text":"This place is like a must-go-to while in Montreal and specially late at night... however, after 3 visits, I keep behind disappointed every single time :(  There are a few places where a much better poutine can be found."}
{"text":"Went with a large group. Very well worth the wait! We got 5 different kinds. All delicious! Good price. Even better, they treat their staff well."}
{"text":"potine heaven .well established resto"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS POUTINE but share it!!  My boyfriend and I ordered two regular Poutines.  They might look small but have in mind you're eating starch and carbs and soon after a few bites (very soon) you wouldn't want more Poutine in a while as your stomach will be painfully full. So share one plate with another person, you won't be able to finish it yourself."}
{"text":"There was a line out the door and about a 20 minute wait in the freezing cold Montreal winter just for take out!  Lines often signify quality and I wanted to try poutine for the first time, so I waited. I ordered the vegetarian poutine and didn't enjoy it, but poutine may not be my thing. I found that they used too much gravy, causing the dish to be sloppy and its fries soggy. I did, however, like the flavor of the cheese curds and I will say two of my friends enjoyed the dish quite a bit."}
{"text":"Oh god, still thinking about this gives me the sweats.  We ordered three different kinds so we could properly sample the selection, and the taco poutine, which was the special the night we were there, was awesome.  This isn't classic poutine at it's finest--this is load-up-the-toppings-and-feed-the-drunkards kind of poutine.  (That might just be the best kind.)  The place offers a ridiculous selection of poutine with a ridiculous selection of toppings (four different kinds of meat? guacamole? corn dogs? why not?).  Well worth the lineup."}
{"text":"Best poutine in Montréal! Portions are really big, the poutine is delicious. If you will be visiting Montréal, La Banquise is the place you must try. Cannot miss it!!!"}
{"text":"If you're visiting Montreal, this place is a must go. If you live in Montreal, it is still a must go! The best poutine place in town. Whenever I have a craving for poutine, I come here. I don't bother trying other places anymore because I always end up saying: it's better at La banquise.   There are 2 pages of different kinds of poutine but my favorite is the \"La mart\" with bacon hot dogs and mushrooms. The small plate is a good portion and price is good. The only downside is the long line-up and it can get very very loud depending on the crowd. Also, they don't take credit cards but that's pretty much a lot of business that is super busy. Interac and cash only."}
{"text":"First few bites were good and then it got a little difficult to eat so we picked at it for a little bit and then just focused on our beers. Somehow managed to finish one and a half orders anyway haha... The waiteess came around to ask if we were done. We said yes so they bussed the plates away and then came back with the check even though we didn't explicitly ask for it. Not sure where the miscommunication came from but we were not please with the place overall so we took that as a \"go away\" gesture and just left without finishing our beers. Place was empty so they definitely didn't need the table. Got sick later on from all of the grease, but that isn't a cleanliness issue or anything, just the nature of the food. I would avoid the dishes with a lot of meat in it if you are new to this kind of food. It runs right through you."}
{"text":"The line is long, and it's definitely worth the wait if you are in the neighbourhood, but I don't think it warrants a special trip unless you a very dedicated to a specific poutine (I'm partial to the very delicious Miam.)  The many options and the atmosphere are a cut above your typical poutine joint, but expect it to be crowded, even in winter."}
{"text":"We came here on New Years day to find an extremely long line, so we decided to return today. It was my second time here and I was not disappointed.   Today we came around 11:30 AM and there was no line up. The food was amazing and came to us in good time. Their fries are crispy and delicious and really unlike anything I've had before. Veggies were cooked perfectly and the cheese curds and gravy were like a little slice of heaven.   We ordered the regular size poutine and I found the portions to be quite large, but I am certainly not complaining about that since they were able to wrap up whatever you don't finish. Perfect food if you're hungover and very reasonably priced.  Staff were very friendly and they all spoke English which was helpful for someone who speaks no French. I was pleased with how attentive the staff were - I never had to wait for water because they were always coming around with pitchers of water to fill us up if we were running low. Will definitely be returning next year!"}
{"text":"This isn't a review of their poutine, because I have no poutine. Why? Because they don't accept American credit/debit cards. They don't announce that on their splashy website, you find out when you walk up to the take out counter.   You can be sure they take American cash if you don't have Canadian, but you can also be pretty sure you're paying the Canadian price in American dollars (i.e. +20%).   Not sure why I'm surprised. One has to question how many of these businesses would exist if it weren't for Americans spending money here."}
{"text":"Seriously............poutine.  SO MUCH POUTINE!!!!!!!!!!!!  I pretty much have made a point to eat poutine as much as possible while visiting Canada, and let me just say, this poutine was outstanding.  Admittedly, I feel as if I ordered wrong since the smoked meat looked amazing and was more realistically what I was wanting to have, but I couldn't resist bacon (who can!?).  Granted the service was pretty much crap, but that seemed to be a theme in Montreal, and it didn't take away from the experience.  I think it was most excusable in an over-crowded resto such as La Banquise.   We were lucky to beat the crowds, because within minutes of sitting down, the herds came a'flockin.  I'm really only sorry I didn't eat here twice!!!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say? This place is a standard late night spot in the Plateau. It's not my favourite poutine in the city, but it's very good, and their wide selection of weird poutine variations are all great. If you're in the neighbourhood in the morning, they have a good, cheap breakfast, too. The menu includes a couple breakfast poutines, and you're tougher than me if you can eat one of those first thing in the morning and then do anything with the rest of your day.  The only problem is that this place is way too popular. The food is good, but I don't think it's worth lining up for. It's not unusual to see a half hour wait for a table with people lined up down the street, and while the food is good, it's not THAT good - especially in a neighbourhood that has so many other great options."}
{"text":"What can I say about La Banquise? It's money in the bank. Whether its 4pm \"afternoon delight\" or 4am \"forget about that night\", one thing you can count on is solid poutine from this place.   My go-to is the Elvis (ground beef, green pepper, mushrooms). The gravy is tight, the curds are squeaky, and the fries are a touch on the crispy side. The small size is just enough to fill you up for a few hours. The large size is definitely an artery clogger and should only be reserved for comfort food or letting yourself go moments. Add a burger if you're really going to fall off the wagon.   If you're here in the summer, opt for the patio in the back. It's the only way to enjoy a steaming hot pile of goodness."}
{"text":"Considering all the hype about this place, I was not that impressed.  Sure, it was fine, but definitely not the best poutine I've ever had.  The fries were good, but the curds were not melty-gooey enough.  I had the vegetarian gravy, but also tried my husband's regular gravy, and found them both to be too sweet, too cornstarch-enhanced, and not quite \"meaty\" enough.  Actually, I found it to be very similar to the gravy from that pariah of the poutine-snobs, La Belle Province,--orange-coloured and a bit too translucent.    I don't think I'll call off my search for the best Montreal poutine just yet......"}
{"text":"I think la Banquise is a victim of its own popularity.  Yes, there is an incredible selection. Yes, the poutine is delicious. Yes, it is great that it is open 24hrs.   But all this being said, unless you have a desire to wait in long, long, longggg lineup of rabid tourists, then go somewhere else.   I'm also not convinced this is the BEST poutine in Montreal. The most popular, certainly. The most variety, of course. But the all-around best? I'm not so sure. Personally, I have little desire to wait in the requisite lineups to get into this place."}
{"text":"When I went to La Banquise with my buddy, he was trying a poutine for the first time ever. The poutine that he got (just the classical one) was a bit too salty. My chicken burger was good, but the fries weren't very hot. We were outsidd though, so it may have cooled down to fast. Also, cash or credit only. I'll still try it again someday!"}
{"text":"Les meilleurs poutines en ville. Ma préféré etant celle au porc effiloché Parfois beaucoup de queue, et peut de place à l'interieur, mais c'est tellement bon... Ne partez pas sans un bout de leur pudding chomeur également."}
{"text":"ready 2 Kms bc of my latest experience @ la banquise- extremely overrated as being named #1 poutine in mtl. last time I was there the poutine was covered with slimy onions and uncooked bacon THIS TIME I did a to go order of the classic poutine which should have fries cheese AND GRAVY, but low and behold I opened the box after making the trek all the way there to find average fries and rubbery cheese curds and 0 gravy - was ready 2 Kms and call 2 complain, u would think that after making poutine ALL DAY u would remember the only 3 Ingredients necessary to make the dish !!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious poutine with a variety of toppings and styles. Didn't get to try their house pepper sauce, but was very happy with their gravy. Cheese curds were extra squeaky! The regular portion was huge--certainly more than enough for one person if not two!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch at La Banquise in October 2011, my experience was memorable for all the wrong reasons. I ordered the T-Rex poutine in regular size and was happy when I was served a massive portion. A couple of hours later  however I was being violently sick. This continued for 24 hours totally debilitating.  The restaurant has a greasy dirty feel about it and I can only imagine the meat was off, or became contaminated in preparation.   It wasn't until May 2013 that I was unfortunately coaxed into putting my bad experience behind me as I went again for a dinner. I ordered a different Poutine, totally different ingredients and what I thought was a lighter choice from the extensive menu on offer. After a few bites I found a long blonde hair wrapped around my fries.   The server was slightly disgusted too, I asked for a refund immediately which was granted without question, clearly the kitchen here has some serious hygiene issues.   La Banquise is a place I will never step foot into again, I have been turned off of poutine now and I STRONGLY ADVISE ANYONE, DRUNK OR SOBER TO AVOID THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"A Montreal classic. This poutine spot is recommended by many. We had them seat us on the terrace and ordered the \"Classic Poutine\" with two of their Banquise beers. No beer on the patio so we were seated back inside. The poutine as good, not amazing, but the atmosphere and the wild variety of poutine makes this a good place to stop with visitors. Just be sure to bring cash because they only accept cash or Canadian debit cards."}
{"text":"La MEILLEURE POUTINE de MONTRÉAL!   Un service rapide et efficace, les patates sont bonnes, la sauce est bonne et le fromage est bon lui aussi tout ce que vous pourrez ajouter à votre poutine suivra le même exemple.   À savourer avec une bonne Boréale blonde est vous aurez mangé pour 3 jours!  Bon ap'"}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype.  They were my neighbor for 2 years, and was like my second home. ELVIS!"}
{"text":"Resto La Banquise offers 24hr poutine glory! Their menu consists of soups, salads, sandwiches, breakfast, sides, desserts, assorted meals, and over 25 different types of poutine.  This place is small and kind of resembles Pita Pit- definitely works if you're looking for an informal dining experience. The staff is kind and provides okay service, nothing great.  I had their \"small\" poutine with breaded chicken. I could not even finish it since the portions are so generous. The poutine here is the best! The fries are thick, drenched in hot gravy with a good amount of chewy cheese curds. The breaded chicken was tender with crispy breading,  chopped in little pieces and truly a delicious touch to my poutine.   The downfall about this place is that you may suffer through the service. Also, you may be seated close to other people, especially during peak hours, since the restaurant is cramped. They also don't take visa; only debit or cash.   Despite that, I would recommend Resto La Banquise if you're looking for great poutine and more for reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Poutine was very good, tasty and good quality ingredients it seemed. The la Rachel was delicious, especially after adding the smoked meat. The grande is a perfect size to comfortably share between two people. The regular is great for a single person. The gravy used has tasty and not too salty. Our table also ordered the la boogalu and the la Maty, which were enjoyed thoroughly. The pulled pork on the boogalu had great flavor. Overall we were very pleased!"}
{"text":"Banquise always been a nice place to go for a late night gourmet poutine. We went there on a Tuesday night at 1 am, place was pretty busy for a Tuesday.  I got a La Taquise poutine, pretty much my favourite, with Mexican toppings consisting of sour cream, salsa(which were just sliced tomatoes) and guacamole. And by guacamole i mean mostly this and fries under. I remember going there a few years back and they would have a better sour cream ratio. I ordered a steamed hot dog as well but the bread was dry and old. The poutine was delicious tho.  My husband got La Danse, which was chicken, onions, and pepper sauce, he ate all of it because it was delicious.  When you order after 9pm they make you pay in advance after you've ordered the food.  In total 26$, a bit expensive for two small poutines and a steamie. But they were good at least. Service was ok but efficient."}
{"text":"Hands down the best poutine you'll ever find. The smaller plate is more than enough for one person.   Be prepared to wait but it's worth every minute, especially if you're not from Montreal."}
{"text":"This is THE spot for a classic poutine or even a poutine with a twist. Was looking forward to this place after our night out and it was totally worth the wait! Had La Taquise and added on ground beef, the guacamole was surprisingly tasty and works well with the fries and cheese curds! Would definitely go back again, so many different poutines to try!"}
{"text":"I've visited Montreal countless times as a child (used to live in Ottawa) and three more times in the last few years, and always make sure to squeeze in a trip to La Banquise. If you haven't tried poutine before, go for the classics - nobody does it better. Or if you're looking for something a bit different, the weird poutines they make are also great (like the Hawaiian).  I don't get Eoz's review. Why would you give a poutine place a bad place without trying the poutine? That's like ordering a burger at a Chinese place and complaining about it."}
{"text":"Long lines for great squeaky cheese in tasty gravy, only prob is the lack of consistency in the food. One day had the monthly special and it was so great and tasty. Brought my husband the following week and well it was lacking, still pretty good but not like the previous week. You could see obvious differences in the preparation. When I asked the server she said that happens with different cooks. Portions are very large."}
{"text":"Poutine is another famous Montreal dish, especially after a heavy night of drinking.  La Banquise is open 24 hours and a perfect way to end a night with friends in the Plateau.  There is usually a ton of people waiting at any given time, but especially later in the night.  There are two lines, one for take out and one for sitting in the restaurant.  I usually just get in the to go line.  The wait can be awhile even after you order since the restaurant is so busy.  They have a ton of variations on the poutine and most of the ones I have had are good.  The best I had was one with all the different meats on it, forget the name.  But if you find yourself partying in the Plateau stop by La Banquise for your post boozing meal!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things from this restaurant before I went to try it. So I went to see what all the hype was about and to be honest, the food was not exceptional but was not terrible. It would not be a place I would go to with purpose, but I would fine here if I happen to be in the area. The restaurant is somewhat small and cozy, very little space (in the dining area and bathrooms) if you were there with a large group of people  the restaurant also has somewhat low ceilings as well. It's nice that the restaurant is open 24/7, because it offers convenience for those who want a late snack/meal, those who want to eat after a late night out, or for those who work a night shift and want to eat dinner in the morning hours after the work shift ends. I have to admit, one of the things I disliked is that the music was too loud and I could barely hear what my friends were saying to me, let alone listen to my own thoughts. All in all, this restaurant was not exceptional but was not terrible. It is kind of out-of-the-way for me to dine here, it is unlikely that I would come back."}
{"text":"As the rating indicates, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  Way too much hype for the poutines here.  What I think draws crowds to this place (aside from the reputation) is the variety of the poutine, the kitschy ambiance, and the late-night opening hours, more than for the taste of the poutine.    Granted that I've only eaten here on three occasions, I was disappointed every time.  Perhaps the poutine tastes better while inebriated?"}
{"text":"If you are visiting Montreal, this place is a must! Poutine is the staple of Quebec. I find this place is the best around midnight or 1 am. There will be a line, but it is well worth the wait. They have so many variations on the classic Poutine dish. I enjoy the classic but if it is your first time I suggest ordering a few with some friends. La Hot-Dog Poutine is also excellent."}
{"text":"So good! OMG, and it's open even during night, so when you are a little tipsy, you can eat their great poutines. They have so many choices it's crazy. Yummy! I love this place. And the poutines are HUGE!"}
{"text":"You will probably have to wait for a table here but it is absolutely worth it. Best poutine and creative concoctions. The wait line moves pretty quickly and the staff is fast. Sizes are pretty big and it's definitely cheap. They also do takeout orders."}
{"text":"I must've picked a busy time too go coz I literally froze my toes off waiting outside. Then I found out u don't need to wait for takeout. Ah...(-_-)zzz Potatoes a bit on the sweet side... Cheese is chewy, not the usual gooey stuff. Loved it. Gravy was...just salty... Nothing too spectacular about it...maybe because I had poutine classique? (large for $9.45) try their fancier choices? Don't expect too much then maybe u won't be as disappointed as me."}
{"text":"When you google \"best poutine in Montreal,\" La Banquise is the first search result, and the place definitely lived up to the hype.   Not only was the cheese on the poutine incredibly fresh, but the combination meals gave you a ton of bang for your buck. I expected a small side of poutine to come with my burger and soda, but instead we each got what looked like a full portion - too much to finish at once, but it sure was fun to try.   There was a line when we arrived, and we waited a little longer than usual because we had a large-ish group of 6, but we were seated within 20 minutes and eating shortly after that.   I can't wait to return to Montreal to go back to La Banquise and try a different variety of poutine."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant est toujours plein à craqué de monde, cela dit tout, la nourriture est excellente et le personnel exceptionnel.  Bravo à tous les membres de votre équipe!"}
{"text":"We were driving by on one of the days we were visiting Montreal and saw a lineup outside this place. We were curious and decided to give it a try. We ordered takeout as we didn't want to wait outside in -30 weather. The prices are not cheap for a poutine, but the portions are quite big. There were so many options and different varieties. We ordered the shoot-out to share, which includes smoked meat, spicy sausage, and bacon. It tasted amazing. The regular size was enough to feed the two of us, as the toppings consisted of half the dish. We would definitely come again when we visit the city, and it is very convenient that it is open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Slow service, packed place, amazing selection of poutine! Nice selection of different beers. Try the Asterix!"}
{"text":"Si vous venez au Quebec, vous devez goûter la poutine, un des plats locaux. Une description succinte : frite, fromage sauce, avec toute sorte de viande au choix, que du LIGHT Tous les resto la propose, mais le spécialiste H24 c'est la banquise, plus 20 recettes de Poutine servi en 3 tailles (petite, régulière, grande)  La grande est destiné aux mecs bourrés qui veulent se lester avant de repartir. Eh oui, la Poutine est le plat d'avant et d'après cuite par excellence gras, lourd et spongieux..parfait pour tenir et repartir. Le resto est situé sur le plateau et est donc bondé lors des fermetures de bars. C'est une ambiance fast food, le turn over des serveuses est important, le service corret. Un resto à essayer, au moins pour découvrir ce plat et à retenir pour les étudiants, VIE et autres maudits français qui sortent sur le plateau."}
{"text":"I was visiting canada and heard good things about the poutine here and we decided to on our last day in Montreal. My girlfriend and I liked the food here, but our waitress was kind of rude, she said we ordered too much and that she couldn't finish a small poutine,  that's great information, but we weren't ordering based on what you can and can't finish. We ordered two sandwiches that came with side salads a small poutine and mozzarella sticks, which only came with three and cost $6 (a little pricey for 3).  We ate a small breakfast and saved a lot of room for this place and we're ready to take any leftovers back to the hotel. The poutine was pretty good, the fries were a little sweet.  The food was pretty good, but the crappy waitress ruined the experience.  Next time I go to Montreal, I'll get the poutine at brutopia."}
{"text":"If you want to experience the hype in Montreal. This is the place. I went there around 2AM on a saturday and it is PACKED. Long lines for both eat in and take outs. But this is exactly why I went there! They have a long menu of all kinds of poutines, all of them are absolutely UNHEALTHY. That is probably the most unhealthy food I've ever had. But it tasted great. One thing I notice is that it seems the eat in portion is twice as big as the take out version. not sure if they are the same price. But you gotta try it!  An after party must~ ;-)"}
{"text":"We brought relatives from out of town to try poutine for the first time. Although the flood was amazing and left them satisfied, the service was shit."}
{"text":"The poutine is delicious, but how the hell do canadians eat so much of this? My girlfriend and I were having trouble finishing ONE of these, and all of these thin canadian folks around us were polishing off an order each without any complaints. Beware, if you are not used to the richness of such food its deadly, deadly good."}
{"text":"One of Montreal's best poutine places. This place offers different varieties of poutine. Opens 24/7, great taste, and reasonable prices. If you're ever in Montreal or if you're a Montrealer who's never been there, you've got to go there. One of the best poutines in town.  \"La Petite Vie\" is the hottest poutine on the menu, along with many others. Make sure to check it out, share with others and enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and get one of the crazier poutines. I got the classic poutine, thinking that a classic poutine had meat on it. I was wrong.   And do yourself a favor -- do not order the large poutine. No one needs that much food.  This was a good place. I enjoyed my poutine, the service was good, and the price was totally reasonable."}
{"text":"So many poutine choices and no matter which one you get (ok I haven't tried them all...) you will be impressed.   Under 15$ to get stuffed to the gills with hot cheesy brown sauce goodness.   There is quite a long line late at night, dinner time on weekends but I've never waited more than 30 minutes. If you're fortunate enough to be there during the 3 days of Montreal summer then I suggest the take out line, which is much shorter, and crossing the street to Parc Lafontaine.  Finally if you have any inclination whatsoever for some heat put tabasco on your poutine. It only adds to the flavour, doesn't subtract.    One of the few 'famous' Montreal restaurants I come back to regularly."}
{"text":"Bonne poutine! On y mange toujours bien! Mais. L'attente est longue, nous sommes collés les une sur les autres"}
{"text":"What's the big deal with this place? Been 2 or three times already and each time it was overcrowded and the service was mediocre- slow and disorganized. Just go to McDonalds, it's probably healthier and they won't be rude to you if you don't speak Frenchie."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying: over-hyped. Man if you can believe, I went here way back when for a poutine fixin for the first time. Let me just say i was drunk. Well anyway, story goes me and friends stayed up to see the sun rise and went for an early morning bite. Got seated and someone suggested we get the poutine with guacamoles and tomats whatever. I just thought it was wrong. Been back a few times bringing visitors, always goes over well. FOR ME PERSONALLY fries are not crisp enough and its salty salty salty. Gravy can be strange type of viscous, you know what I'm saying? Well anyway if you like it mushy with lots of toppings or your a vegan W//E this could just be your place"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype is about. I ordered the poutine \"Elvis\". It came with mushrooms, ground beef, green peppers and onions. The cheese curds were squeaky, a must for an authentic poutine. However, what let me down was the fries and gravy. The fries weren't crispy and the gravy didn't have a beefy taste to it. If you 'must' come here for the poutine, get the regular size. Portions are humongous!"}
{"text":"La Banquise is known as the place to get that \"real Montreal poutine\". My friends took me here when I used to visit and now that I live here I bring my out-of-town friends when they tell me to give them the real poutine stuff.  It's a mouthparty and has vegetarian poutine to boot. Good luck choosing from the tonnes of topping options, they all sound delicious, but I recommend keeping it simple. Cheese + gravy + fries. That's all you really need. The rest is just fluff... tasty fluff, but still.  \"Keep it simple, stupid\" should be a poutine rule... I just made it a rule.  It's 24 hrs and almost always busy here, so there may be a bit of a wait for a table but you can always order take-away if you're impatient. I'd avoid going for that 2AM late night fix on weekends after drinking and dancing... unless you like lining up out the door and in the street waiting to get in, surrounded by drunk young'uns and woo-girls like at that bar you just left because you felt old... no? that's just me? ok, nevermind. I mean, I love poutine, but is it really worth all that?  (that was a trick question because it clearly is, since I suffered through it once, whilst gibbled, just to get my hands on some... and lived to tell the tale.)  Service is quick and efficient, slightly rushed even if they are really slammed, and the portions are huge at fair prices. I can barely finish their \"small\" serving. The only downside for me is location; it's out of the way unless you live in the Plateau area.  Regardless, you should give it a go at least once... especially if you're visiting. Get some good poutine in your mouthole."}
{"text":"Great options for poutine the way you want it.  I was able to make up my won Tex-Mex style poutine by adding sour cream to the reggae poutine. It was exactly what I was looking forward to."}
{"text":"La Banquise has always been my favourite place for poutine. I love the crispy fries and the cheese curds are super squeaky. I go for the classic and sometimes trio it up with the banquise burger when I'm especially piggish. Do take-out if the line is crazy long. We saw a line with easily 40 people waiting to be seated so called in our order (four trios). It was ready in 20 minutes and we ate at parc la fontaine. Boom. Best picnic ever."}
{"text":"Je suis allée avec mon copain, on a apprécié l'expérience. :) Le smoothie était particulièrement délicieux. On a chacun commandé une poutine. Il y a tellement de variétés, c'était très apprécié. Je ne dirai pas non pour y retourner si l'occasion se présente!  Petit conseil: Allez-y pour l'heure du dîner, en ce qui nous concerne on n'a pas eu à attendre dans une file! ;)"}
{"text":"Good casual atmosphere, open 24/7. The place to go for poutine. Great and very quick service.   They have many kinds of poutines: guacamole, bacon, bell peppers, or sausage for example. I had the classic. It was good. Of course, don't go there if you don't like fries, cheese and gravy. Also don't go there for a light meal."}
{"text":"LA MEILLEURE POUTINE EVER !!!  T-rex !!!  Un peu serré comme restaurant mais super bon et gras à souhait haahha!"}
{"text":"\"It was long since I had longed for anything and the effect on me was horrible.\"  i remember it vividly, i was a wide-eyed newcomer, zig zagging my way to parc lafontaine for the first time to watch  l'illusioniste. i found a spot on the grassy knoll and tried to be laissez faire, all the while knowing my pants would be susceptible to  grass stains and my skin to mosquito bites, but i wanted to be like one of you, one of them, the locals, the ones that make it look effortless, the ones that  look like they were built on an assembly line, and so i knew what i had to do afterward, what i longed to do, at long last i would have three ingredients i had many times before, but this time i would have them on top of each other.  table for one, my number is called.  there were no numbers, they just seated me.   i realize my first mistake within minutes, i should have ordered take-out, but minor details like decorum, soul-crushing music and those in close proximity to you would  surely  just be a footnote when eating the best poutine in town, yes?  i sit down and go for the classic, no shticks or gimmicks, and when it was all over, i couldn't help but wonder, is that all there is to poutine? is this really the pinnacle of the concoction?   it's fine, i was just underwhelmed, perhaps a victim of bloated expectations, or maybe i'm not that big a fan, it's the perfect 3am stumbling drunk, walking home food, which is by no means unimportant, that has great worth, but it still serves the same purpose as the hole in the wall chinese food place in my old town  i will keep searching for the benchmark , but if this is it, if the bench has been marked, i will only sit on it in the haze of a drunken hour."}
{"text":"Let me just say that I've had way too much of their traditional poutine to ever go back (leftovers from a big order), but even despite the copious amounts of poutine I ate from here, I can't say I share the same lust for their poutine that others do. I don't even think their poutine ranks in the top 5 best I've had here ... and I've eaten a total of 6 poutines here. Their fries were SWEET!  It ruined my experience."}
{"text":"Waited in lin eon a cold night...but was well worth the wait.....Got the vege fries with the toppings.. the reg was good for two ppl if u come in for a snack...as a meal it fills u right up and u need nothing else...."}
{"text":"The food was awesome itself and I was really pleased to eat best Poutine in here. But once I tried to use my US card, they kept saying that they DO NOT ACCEPT US CARD. They didn't explain me about this at all but just keep telling me \"I'm sorry we can't\" Only Canadian dollar or card can be accepted in here. I used my US card for several times in other restaurents but this place was the only restaurent doens't accept US card. Do not forget to bring Canadian dollar!"}
{"text":"Considering the number of Americans posting reviews, I was surprised to see that La Banquise was a charming neighborhood spot full of hungry locals, not just food-crazy tourists.  It's a smallish restaurant, and they're certainly economical about their use of space - no corner shall go unused.  Be prepared for a little bit of a squeeze, but everyone's in such a good mood that it doesn't matter.  Aside from 20+ varieties of poutine, they also have some diner favorites - burgers, omelettes, and salads.  But if diners' tables are any indication, seems like 90% of the clientele orders the poutine.  Had a tough time deciding between the Poutine Mart (hot dogs, bacon, and mushrooms) and the T-Rex (ground beef, pepperoni, bacon, and hot dogs)...but we were very happy to experience the Jaco (ground beef, onions, mushrooms, and peppercorn sauce) in all its gravy goodness.  See if you can snag a seat outdoors.  They can't serve alcohol outdoors, and you might be seated next to a smoker, but it's worth dining al fresco."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Wednesday afternoon and it wasn't crowded at all. We came for poutine, but the chevre burger looked so good I had to order it. Fortunately, they allow you to upgrade your fries to poutine for a few dollars more. I had the chevre burger with a side of the Rachel poutine and my husband ordered the savoyarde poutine. The food was delicious and the service was great. We forgot to look it up, but this place takes cash or Canadian debit so heads up tourists."}
{"text":"Food 3/5 staff&service 3 / 5 decor 5 / 5  Having tried many vegetarian poutines I was glad to go to La Banquise.Their vegetarian poutine tastes just like the traditional one. This place is open 24/7 and somehow always has people dining in at every hour of the day. Whenever I have friends or family coming in from outside the city I always make it a point to bring them to La Banquise."}

{"text":"Excellente Poutine a chaque fois ! Frites fraîches et bon service mais l'attente est parfois très longue. ( La sauce végétarienne est définitivement meilleure que la sauce régulière )"}
{"text":"The best late night Montreal has to offer.   They have a huge selection of poutines from vegan servings to so full of meat you can see the cholesterol buildup already!  A huge choice of food and open literally 24/7 (Xmas and New Years included) they haven't locked their door in many years.  One tip though, try not to go between 2 and 4 am especially on a Friday or Saturday night because you will be waiting close to an hour just to get in, that's just how good this place is."}
{"text":"Really really cool concept. They have a ton of poutine options. We heard a lot of hype and I do think that in my early years I would've loved this place but we were just looking for great poutine and this was pretty underwhelming it tastes like the same as the Toronto poutine. They also messed up our order after we specified it twice but we got takeout so we couldn't send it back.   Still worth checking out its a cool place."}
{"text":"LISTEN.  You DO NOT need to order a sandwich with your poutine.  Your poutine will be huge.  You will look like a pig.  You will not be able to order all the food that comes to your table.  Great poutine.  Burger and sandwiches were disappointing (but face it, nobody comes here for anything but poutine).  Many, many, many options.  What you choose is up to you, I don't see how any of them can be a wrong choice.  Went with a vegetarian and surprisingly, the vegetarian gravy option was really good, possibly even better than the standard gravy.  Fun spot, expect a line, though!"}
{"text":"Red flag: They don't take credit cards at this joint. Whether it's because they take advantage of their popularity to increase margins by avoiding cc fees, or to evade taxes by favouring cash, I couldn't not tell. The tasty Portuguese chicken place right from across from the street offers better value AND they take credit cards."}
{"text":"I love it, just a little bit too much for one person. You can add a lot of things with it, customize your own"}
{"text":"A sure bet for great Poutine. Many Variations. Try the Taquise!"}
{"text":"L'un des restos ou on mage les meilleures poutines sur le plateau. Les frites maisons sont excellentes et la sauce brune vous enverra au paradis des saveurs québécoises."}
{"text":"Lost my poutine innocence to this joint. I ordered a smoked meat poutine. The gravy was tasty and just the right amount of saltiness. I don't think the curds were super fresh because there was no squeek action. If the fries were crispy I would have given this place a higher rating but they were limp and pathetic looking but overall the combination of fries, gravy and curds is a winner for me. The smoked meat was a waste of tummy space, it added nothing to the dish. Next time I would go with the classic. The portions are huge. I split a small among three people and we still couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"I was on a hunt for the perfect poutine and I found it!! the cheese curds melt in your mouth, the sauce is nice and flavourful and not too salty. I had the regular vegan poutine with vegan sauce. My friend had the regular poutine with regular sauce (I think the regular sauce has bacon in it). My friend found his bacon sauce to be bland but, loved the vegan sauce. Overall, the poutine were delicious. If you don't mind lining up to be seated then, I highly recommend this place. Perfect late night escape!"}
{"text":"Yum!   Great drunk food, and it's open 24/7! There was already a line out the door by 10:00 PM but it moved quickly and were seated in less than 15 minutes. The lines in Canada seem to move pretty quickly in general. The poutine was great, we had the Classique and the Kamikaze. Definitely going back the next time I'm in the city."}
{"text":"C'est bruyant, certes. Touriste au possible aussi. Mais c'est pas cher, c'est des poutines pas mauvaises (très copieuses) et un service agréable. Ouvert 24h, possibilité à emporter et doggy-bag.  Touristique mais si vous voulez une bonne poutine, c'est votre adresse (la bière la Banquise est pas mal non plus)."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Montreal a few times over the years and have tried a different poutine restaurant each time. I can say that La Banquise is the best hands down. The different types are poutine are a great selection and prices are reasonable. I was thinking at first to get the large size as the regular looked small. I was wrong..it may look small but I was full towards the end. I won't try any other poutine places as this will be our go to place every time we come to Montreal."}
{"text":"Poutine bonne mais les portions ont diminué et le fait de demander de payer avant de recevoir nos plats je trouve ca exagéré de payer le pourboire de la serveuse alors que je n'ai pas reçu le service de plus une fois que les serveuses encaissent elles ne s'occupe plus de nous mis a part revenir pour déposer les plats"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place while in Montreal. I visited once in the beginning and just before leaving, and both times were excellent. I have heard that everyone has a different opinion of the best poutine, but I think that is because there are different aspects of the poutine experience to like.  I would say La Banquise excels in variety. Their menu is extensive - I tried the 3 Amigos and La Kamikaze. Both were awesome. The service was quick and the servers were polite. The location is right by Parc du Fontaine, which is nice to chill at after such a filling meal."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but the place to go for poutine at a random hour. Their variations on a classic are BRILLIANT!"}
{"text":"Great poutine! They got you covered when it comes to toppings! But you cant go wrong with the classic. What i think makes la banquise standout is the quality of the fries, great taste and texture. Open 24 hours too! Thats a plus if you are out late/early and want some food to cure that hangover"}
{"text":"Definitely a place to go for Poutine lovers. Don't know if it's worth the queue as they have a lot of seating. Maybe they could benefit from some reorganisation.   If you are living nearby go for the takeout line.. It's much shorter and quicker."}
{"text":"Simply put, a no BS restaurant where you can enjoy a wide selection of poutine. Staff is efficient. Poutine is good (that is if you like poutine) If you expect overseas visitors who wants to try a good poutine for the first time, you have a to take them to la banquise. I am no poutine fan myself, but ... my overseas friends like this place."}
{"text":"Honestly the best poutines in the city hands down. I love way they did with the expansion of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Poutine in Montreal, That is saying alot. Oh and they are open when you need ot the most...4am!"}
{"text":"I greatly enjoyed La Banquise when I visited a little while ago.  Poutine is typical winter food for me; when it's -30 Celsius outside, all my body wants is fat in a warm and edible form.  The poutine at La Banquise certainly met all of the requirements.  When we got there, it was extremely busy but the waitress managed to find us a small table within a few minutes.  The décor was brightly funky, bright, and cheery; the music also feel into that category.  There's nothing calm about La Banquise, but it has a fun warm atmosphere that is appealing at 11pm in February.   The waitress quickly brought us menus and we settled in to peruse the options.  The menu hosts about 24 different varieties of poutine, along with burgers, hot dogs, and other fast food fare.  I would suggest going with the poutine though; that's what they're known for and is probably why your there.  I ordered a plain poutine, while my friend ordered the T-Rex.  The plain poutine consists of French fries, cheese curds, and gravy, while the T-Rex adds sausage, bacon, and ground beef on top of that.  The price might seem a little high for French fries, but I found the servings to be more than generous.   The first thing I noticed was that the French fries were made there; you can see the tubs of peeled and cut potatoes beside the deep fryer.  The cheese curds were a perfect combination of chewy, rubbery, and soft.  The gravy was a little too salty, but the endless glasses of water that our waitress poured us made it tolerable.    Overall, I greatly enjoyed eating a La Banquise.  I think that this restaurant is very unique to Quebec.  It's a great place to hit up after a long run, a night of dancing, or as a chaser to an evening of beers."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time visiting the restaurant, the last time I was there was in 2011. Not much has changed still very good. My sisters and I ordered a large of the maty and that filled us! The only downside was that it wasn't as fresh as I had hoped for it to be. Maybe that because we came after midnight? Overall, service was good and I love that it's open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Fattening delicious poutine. Go here late at night but expect a lineup regardless of when you go. Lots of variety and loaded with cheese."}
{"text":"We had la reggae and la Matty. The poutines we had were amazing! Best we ever had so far. We got takeout because we waited in line forever to be seated when we went in a group of 5 but they let the group of 5 after us seated before us. Why?! That's fine, we then got seated and was left there for 20 mins and nobody served us so we got up and ordered takeout. It sucks when a place's food is so amazing but the service is poor. I understand it's a 24/hr place and is constantly busy but at least make an effort in training and hiring the proper servers. This place would have so much more potential if their service improved. I will consider returning for takeout but def. not dining in."}
{"text":"Went here when I first moved to Montreal with some friends. We got our poutine to go and ate at the park nearby, which was really nice, but the poutine was somewhat soggy because of waiting for each other's orders and walking to the park.  I just returned to La Banquise with my dad and sister while they were visiting and we waited during the rush time for a table for only about 20 minutes even though the waiting area was packed with people. They have a lot of tables and clear them pretty quickly during rush hours. The poutine was delicious and not soggy in the slightest. It really was the best poutine I've had, and I've had my fair share. The only rival to it is Poutineville, but that's more expensive in general and marketed as \"gourmet poutine.\"   You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu! Just try something that sounds good, everything they make is a delicious and unforgettable heart attack on a plate! :)"}
{"text":"I have been pondering for a while what to write regarding my La Banquise experience.  We had a friend visiting from DC and we decided to give her the ultimate Quebec treat with authentic poutine.  It was everything everyone told me about poutine, and I have to say, it was exactly what I expected.   Reading the reviews, I guess the poutine is perfection at Banquise.  Are the fries as crispy as they can be under the heavy gravy?  Yes.  Are the cheese curds \"squeaky\" and chewy?  Yes.  Is the gravy beefy and greasy?  Yes.  Does the selection include bizarre additions (pineapple and ham, hot dogs and mushrooms, etc)?  Yes.  Will all these ingredients reform in your stomach like an enormous brick?  Definitely.  Will your friend from DC complain from belly pains all night long?  Perhaps.  Maybe if you grew up on poutine, this stuff hits the spot.  Maybe if you were drinking all night and need a greasy meal, this is your haven.    I am glad I experienced my first poutine at Banquise. But I am not sure if I will ever go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Montreal to celebrate our one year wedding anniversary. We are lovers of food and really wanted to go somewhere that had a distinct food culture. We found a food mecca in Montreal. One of the items on our list of must-eats was poutine, a native dish to Quebec. To us, it just sounded like something we needed to get our hands on!  We tried poutine for the first time at this little diner for a late dinner. We were less than impressed. After doing our due diligence and scouring the web, we came across La Banquise. So on a gorgeous day, we took the metro out to a quaint little neighborhood and walked a few blocks to La Banquise. This was definitely your typical dive, metal tables, benches and random art work and mismatched pieces as décor. The place was packed on a late afternoon, but we were seated relatively quickly. I can see how this place is such a draw, especially for a late night crowd, and with the bonus of it being open 24 hours.  We ordered a large poutine to share, and had it topped with hot dog, bacon and mushrooms. Yes, you can add additional toppings to your poutine. What came out was a gigantic plate filled to the brim and loaded with fries, gravy, hot dog slices, bacon, mushrooms and cheese curds! It may not look like the most appetizing plate, but it was divine! The cheese curds were melting and provided an even more decadent touch to the dish. The fries soaked up the gravy and the bacon and hot dogs gave each bite the needed amount of sodium; it was very savory. It was real treat, and worth my cholesterol shooting up a few points!"}
{"text":"Je n'ai pas goûté la poutine mais les hot dog sont vraiment à tomber par terre. Il était 1 heure du matin, j'avais très faim, mon jugement n'est donc pas forcément objectif mais il me semble bien que c'est les meilleurs hot dog que j'ai jamais mangé. Les serveuses ont un look terrible, elles doivent faire un concours de tatouage. Le service à emporter a été un peu long mais vu l'horaire et l'affluence dans le restaurant, on ne peut pas leur en vouloir."}
{"text":"Ah, the famous La Banquise. Home to Montreal's strangely beloved and most overrated poutine.   I've tried different varieties of their poutine many times and still don't understand the love it gets. Sure, you can get a bunch of toppings, and yes, it never closes...but is that really enough reason to elevate this place to legendary status?  Personally, I find that the fries are always overcooked and cheap tasting, the toppings are abundant but of low quality, and the curds are decent at best. And to be honest, almost every time that I've eaten a poutine there, I felt sick afterward. Yet I would always find myself coming back because of its proximity to my house and my sometimes lowered standards from drunkeness.   Some of the other items I've had on the menu, such as the hotdogs, hamburgers and club sandwiches have been pretty good though. This combined with the great atmosphere and solid service at La Banquise, raised up my review to 3-stars. The poutine though? Don't believe the hype. There are many better spots in MTL to indulge your dirty poutine senses."}
{"text":"From the reviews i have read that this is the best spot for trying canadian poutine.  I thought wrongly, it was a disaster.  Where to begin hmmm...... i decided to order take out since i saw the girls in front of me get theirs within 5 mins after their order.  I ordered two poutines and what the heck they forgot about our order.  We asked 15 mins later about the hold up and they just took our receipt and started to work on it and were informed that it will be right out in 3 mins.  It was not 3mins it was additional 15 mins.  In general 30 mins total for two regular small  poutine.  After that 30 min time frame i still had not gotten poutine.  So i tried to flag down the same person. That person just saw us and looked away which seemed they were tyring to avoid eye contact.  I eventually had to yell across the room where the f is the poutine.  I then found out it was already made in the kitchen and was sitting there on the counter all this time.  How do i know because the gravy was lukewarm.  It wasnt even alot of ppl in the restaurant.  I recommend going somewhere else maybe mcdonalds is bettter than this."}
{"text":"Poutines galore. They are delicious. Typical Montreal comfort food. Definitely a must visit. It's rare that there isn't a line out the door BUT it is open 24/7 so there's that.  Great portions, decent service... just go!"}
{"text":"Best poutine in Montreal. They have a huge variety and are very generous with the servings. It's extra greasy and supper delicious."}
{"text":"If you want poutine, you just can't go wrong with la Banquise! The place has great food!"}
{"text":"Realizing that we never had poutine in Montreal despite being here before, I decided to check yelp to find a place that will represent french canadian poutine well, Resto La Banquise came out on top. It was raining cats and dogs on Saturday, but my hubs and I biked here anyways and arrive pretty soaked at about 11am. The place was full but we got seated pretty quickly.  There were other diner type foods on the menu like sandwiches, but we really only came for the poutine, and judging by what the other tables have ordered, others came for the same thing. We got La Danse and L'Obelix, which was a chicken with bacon and onions poutine and a smoked meat poutine respectively. The  regular size was quite large and definitely more than enough for one. The La Danse poutine came with a lighter gravy than the L'Obelix poutine, we preferred the darker gravy. The poutines came with lots of topping and cheese curds, and was dripping with gravy. The fries had a home fries taste and texture to them. Overall, we like it but wished that the cheese curds were more melted and that the whole dish came out hotter, it was warmish hot and not pipping hot.  When we left around noonish, there was a line to the door for seats, so I guess we got lucky and avoided the huge rush. Overall, I would return to try other poutine dishes here, there were lots of options and you can customize your poutine with whatever topping you want. I probably would not wait in a huge long line in the rain as some other folks were doing for the poutine though."}
{"text":"The poutine at Resto La Banquise is to die for. Each poutine dish is packed with fries and a lot of toppings and gravy. I had the \"3 amigos\" poutine several times (several kinds of meat) and it was incredible. Low prices, big portions, and a great variety on the menu. The gravy is not too salty either, which helps. Always busy, but definitely worth the while to try."}
{"text":"Une bonne poutine. Ouvert 24 heures. Avec un service rapide. Génial!"}
{"text":"24 Poutine. It had to be done.    I had original poutine, I think thats why I am not blown away. My DCs all had fancier poutines, including one doused in avocado and fresh chopped tomato. Amazing.   My classic was ok, but not really salty enough. Or cheesy. But it was good. We went on a Sunday for lunch to meet some friends who already had a table. Thank goodness, the lineup was massive.   It was packed. Service was extremely unremarkable. We were squished into a corner.  I expected more. It was cheap however.   I'd go again, but get something more fun."}
{"text":"If you go mtl tyou have to check out this restaurant. Its always packed but its worth the wait. There are endless possibikities of poutine and portions are generous and delicious"}
{"text":"This was my first proper poutine experience and I am most definitely a fan.  It was rainy and horrible outside and we were all starving and desperate to warm up inside. Unfortunately they were really busy and the wait for a table was too long (there was 8 of us) so we decided to take it out.  There is lots and lots of choice - I had a bit of a meast feast poutine and my friend had a mexican one I think - well there was definitely guacamole, sour cream and salsa on it. They were both delicious. The portions are generous but then that doesn't overly impress me as I can't eat loads of poutine anyway.   Will definitely be returning but this time I think I'd try and get a table."}
{"text":"I really dont understand the hype about this place, it is SO overrated. Sure you get a lot of toppings, and the quantity is large, but the poutine doesn't actually TASTE that good. It is more a quantity vs quality place.The fries are soggy and soft, the gravy tasteless and the cheese is hard. If you want to try good poutine, go to Frite Alors and try their Frite Alors poutine."}
{"text":"There is no better poutine in the entire world. I'm certain of it.   This poutine is so delicious that it even tastes good the next day, cold. Actually though.. that's quite a feat and they should be proud."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday evening. Got sat fairly quick but that was the last interaction the staff had with us. It's as though they sat us in a special invisibility zone. Not one person came to check in or ask if we wanted water. In fact the three tables that got sat around us got served and had their order taken before we did. I get that it can be busy and you forget people, we waved at every passing server and no response at all. Yes, I get you have a tray of drinks or a debit machine in your hand but 20 minutes is too long to wait for a glass of water. Especially when tables that get seated after us get these things before us. At this point we decided to perhaps try for take-out but even that was taking too long. So we decided that people who ignore us don't get to take our money, do we took out business some place else."}
{"text":"Fries were crunchy and hot, not soggy at all. Delicious gravy and generous portions. Definitely a place to return to!"}
{"text":"My first poutine (except for some home-made approximation made with Brooklyn-sourced cheese curds, rapidly-cooling takeaway fries and underwhelming instant gravy) was super. We queued for 30 mins on a cold Sunday afternoon (you always queue apparently) but seating was democratic and well-managed. They do 20 plus types of poutine, and most are a riff on the original, plus add-ons. I had a Savoyarde with bacon, onions, emmenthal and creme fraiche, my wife decorated hers with merguez, and another companion had a less successful iteration bedecked with breaded chicken bits. Portions are generous, they split the bill per diner in advance (student tourists must be a significant client base), and it's cheerful. You can't pay with foreign cards so bring cash."}
{"text":"Have been to La Banquise previously on another Montreal trip. I was visiting again with sister so decided to go again. Be prepared to wait 30 mins - an hour to get in the door if you want to sit down. Some of the poutines coming out looked amazing but we kept it simple with La bacon and a La Classique. Highly recommend both if you are happy to wait for this poutine experience!"}
{"text":"Cute decor and cozy place! They had really interesting toppings for their special poutines and had a regular and large size to choose from. The regular size is a good portion and likely enough unless you are feeling very hungry. I shared two poutines and although the toppings were exciting, one of the combos felt like it had been thrown together \"just because\" and seemed a little gimmicky. However, I didn't get to try more than two items so I can't say for certain! Regardless, I definitely enjoyed and would recommend the Elvis!   I came here for lunch on a weekday, just missed the line, and got seated right away. Of course, it was still busy and although we ordered quickly, food still took some time to arrive since it was the lunch rush. Worth a visit if you're in the city!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of poutine, but Resto La Banquise demonstrates how delicious, beautiful and satisfying a poutine can be! Now, I'm sure I'll have poutine from this place every time I visit Montreal in the future!"}
{"text":"I had incredibly slow service and never got checked on by the waitresses until I asked about my order after waiting about 30 minutes. At least 5 other bigger parties that arrived after me got their orders first and only after I asked about my order did it come out about 5 min later. I ordered the regular classic so it's the most simple one. Not a big deal but it was a little offputting. The poutine itself was quite the experience. While the fries and gravy were delicious, I've learned that I can't handle that many cheese curds...I'm glad to say that I tried it though!"}
{"text":"Excellente première Poutine de ma vie, j'ai choisi la poutine Elvis et mon ami la T-rex! Elles étaient toutes les 2 excellentes! ^^    Ce resto est vraiment le must en poutine, vu la longueur de la carte! Et le monde qu'il y a tous les soirs, jusqu'à pas d'heure ;)"}
{"text":"Yummy poutine. You want it. Quick and easy take out. I lived in the plateau for four months, this place is a gem. Best on weekdays, weekends there is a line"}
{"text":"The line for this place was nuts but definitely worth the wait. I enjoy how they have a wide selection of poutines that you can choose from, with toppings such as hot dog pieces, corn, cheese, etc. I especially enjoy that they are open 24 hours therefore, if you are ever hungry in the middle of the night you can drop by to grab a quick bite. Small interior with very friendly service. I would definitely go back next time I'm in Montreal again."}
{"text":"Great service amazing food. The poutine was delightful & very reasonable price for a family dinner."}
{"text":"i popped in with friends since they had never had the montreal treat and heard about the spot on their bus tour.  when we walked up there was already a line, but it moved quickly and we were seated in 5 minutes.  we had cheeseburgers and shared a classic poutine.  i've had better poutine and maybe i should have steered my friends to some of the more inventive offerings.  i had a great beer with ginger undertones, which i will never forget.  it's nice that it's open 24 hours for that poutine fix."}
{"text":"While maybe not 'the best' in Montreal, it offers a good variety and the atmosphere is nice enough. Perfect for poutine cravings!"}
{"text":"L'endroit idéal pour les fins de soirées. Plusieurs variétés de poutines offertes.  Malgré le fait que je préfère ma bonne poutine de région (ex. Stratos Pizzeria à Shawinigan-sud), elle fait très bien la job (comme on dit chez nous)!!  Accompagnez-là avec une bonne bière de microbrasserie ;-)"}
{"text":"Poutine! Wow this place is awesome. If you are out partying on the weekend and need your poutine fix, this is the place to go.  Be prepared to wait in line though.  Going there between 2-4am can be a mistake because the line can get huge.  My favourite poutine is the classic."}
{"text":"Poutine for breakfast, poutine for lunch, poutine for dinner. If there were a person to do it, it'd be me, if there was a place to serve it it would be La Banquise.  24 hour poutine place that is doing it right.  Classic sauce, classic squish squish (squeaky) cheese curds, solid home fries.  It's all good! They offer adventurous poutine for the adventurous soul, i.e turkey dinner, mexican style, a la pogo, a la smoked meat etc. They have vegetarian friendly gravy for the animal lover.  I don't normally venture far, but I have gone for their pepper sauce a time or two and it's awesome.  The portions are big.  The regular is perfect for one.  I haven't seen anyone tackle and complete the large, no matter how hungry and beastly they are but I suppose it could be done.  Be prepared for a crowd at all hours, the line goes fast though and it's worth it for sure."}
{"text":"ok ok  this is the poutine place, like seriously  THE poutine place! fun place, good ambiance. After clubbing great to go there after. just magical. Yep magical, quebec people can't live without poutine :-)"}
{"text":"Best selection of poutine in Montreal. And the best! A small is great for one person unless you are super hungry then go for the large. A hip, funky place with a great wait staff. Wonderful at 2am or any time."}
{"text":"We came here years ago on a visit an they've still got it. Don't think you can come here and stuff yourself with amazing poutine and leave with no regrets but it is the place to go for it."}
{"text":"If you're looking to treat yourself to a nice meal, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Love it !!!!the small size is pretty big enough for me, the Reggae was bomb as well as the T-Rex! The space is tight but once you are eating you forget about it lol!  Love the music too! A place to eat at for sure! Quick service!!"}
{"text":"Ma première poutine, une grande expérience."}
{"text":"Had to try out their poutine after seeing all the line up outside the restaurant and all the positive reviews on yelp. The poutine did not disappoint. We got the Le Miam - poutine fries topped with ground meet, merguez sausage, onion and tomatoes...delish!! The portions are massive so stick to the smaller portion unless you're starving :)"}
{"text":"Tried to go around 6pm but gave up due to the line.  Went around 4pm a couple of days later and got a table straight away.  Ordered the Rachel. It was very good, the best curds I have had.  Loved the onions too. Would recommend, but go during off hours."}
{"text":"In all my years living in and visiting Montreal, I'd never once been to this place until very recently when I was on a late-night run to pick up five dozen bagels at Fairmount to dole out to friends back in Toronto. Kitchens were already closed in most places so it seemed to be one of very few places to eat (it's open 24 hours, how convenient--AND dangerous).   It's your typical MTL greasy-spoon specializing in poutine, which is something the city does very well. There are about a million poutines to choose from, along with staples like burgers, all-day breakfast, etc. I didn't want to overdo the grease factor as it was quite late and I had my food itinerary set for the next day (what can I say? I'm nerdy like that) for which I wanted to ensure I had room in my stomach, but we ended up each getting a burger (~$5) and the two of us shared a large poutine (~$10). The burgers were standard diner fare--no going wrong there--with the usual toppings and condiments available.   For the poutine, I chose the Savoyarde which is a new item that does not appear on their regular menu, and anyway, the original poutine can be had anywhere so I thought we ought to try something new. The very thought of the Savoyarde brought back memories of a recent trip which included stops in France, so it was a must for me. It turned out to be an original poutine topped with their version of Savoyarde toppings which include things like bacon (instead of lardons), sour cream (instead of the cheese and cream combo), and some mushrooms (not a lot). It was good enough, and definitely hit the spot on that cold night.  The food (at least from among what we had) would normally elicit about 4* tops but the service and atmosphere (young and hip; definitely a post-bar kinda place) take it one star further. This place, with its menu and clientele, really capture the Montreal vibe. La Banquise is in a French part of town but the friendly servers were able to communicate in English just as well (useful for the many tourists I noticed), and they did so very happily, unlike in some establishments. *ahem* Food is cheap, servings massive, and our order arrived pretty quickly considering the place was PACKED. We got the last table upon arrival but when we left about 45 mins later, there was a lineup of at least 25 ppl outside!"}
{"text":"Best Montréal poutine by far.. Over crowded by tourists and avoid on weekends because of the tourists occupying the place. Great servers and service. You want a poutine you need to go there. Also it it open 24 hours which add to the 4 stars."}
{"text":"La meilleure place à Montréal pour manger une poutine !!! Ne soyez pas effrayé par l'attente pour y entrer... ça vaut le coup d'attendre  Ingrédients de bonne qualité! Originalité des recettes! Très bon service en caisse et avec les serveurs. Très bonne ambiance! Je conseille la terrasse l'été, c'est juste génial ! Seul petit bémol : musique d'ambiance très forte quand l'affluence est là..."}
{"text":"Several friends told us we had to eat at Banquise for some \"real poutine\" in Montreal. So it became our first stop soon after arriving in the city on a rainy Thursday evening. There was a 20-minute wait, which wasn't too bad and gave us time to explore the exhaustive menu of poutine possibilities, from the classic to the meat-heavy to a Mexican version.  We went with two small orders: the classic and another version with bacon, steak and sausage. It was plenty of food for two, and it was in fact delicious, and very decadent.  Keep in mind, though, that many quality poutine options abound throughout the city, and you're just as likely to find dishes just as (and possibly even more) tasty at other establishments. We even had a great poutine layered with smoked meat in the Old Port area--and I thought it was even better than Banquise!   In other words: Banquise is worth a stop, but don't feel obligated to eat here if you're just looking for good poutine."}
{"text":"First trip to Montreal, first time tasting poutine, smoked meat, beaver tail pastry (queues de castor), and sugar pie. My sister & I split a bacon poutine and really loved it, though it nearly put us in a salt coma.  We were also tempted by the one with guacamole, sour cream and tomatoes. It's a crowded, fun place with many visitors snapping photos of their poutines."}
{"text":"Une variété de succulentes poutines! J'adore celle avec des merguez! Miam!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with their poutine. good gravy, so even frites sauce ( sans curds) will make you happy. Always getting the Obelix tho (with smoked meat). Lovely terrace in the summer (although no alcohol is being served on the terrace... Don't quite understand why not, but I don't mind). Avoid weekends."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go for Poutine. Eat in or Take out! There's a nice park down the street where you can take your poutine and have a picnic by the lake.   I'm from Vancouver where poutine is simply cheese curd and gravy on fries. When I came to Quebec, the birthplace of Poutine, I had to try what has been immortalized into French-Canadian pop culture.  They have a long list of different kinds of toppings.  You can choose ones with beef, chicken, bacon, hot dog wiener, or even vegetarian.  The presentation would not win any awards for \"plating\", but then this is a comfort food, and what more comforting than your favourite topping on fries.  We had La Bacon, La Taquies (sour cream, tomatoes and guacamole) and the Special of the day (Turkey with onions).  Our favourite was La Bacon.  So good, So filling, So worth the visit."}
{"text":"I had the smoked meat poutine here. This is more of a cold weather dish for me or I would order it again if I haven't eaten all day. Come here if you are hungry, also, its open 24/7."}
{"text":"We never miss a trip here whenever we are \"north of the border\". I recommend the smoked meat poutine. My husband gets the T-Rex (meat toppings galore!)."}
{"text":"Got one of the more simple poutines, forgot the name exactly but with mushrooms, bacon and hot dog sausage. Cannot go wrong with that one. Love the cheese curds too. Tried the Bec cola since it was a local speciality but honestly prefer regular Coke more.   Tip: there's a line for dine in and one for take out!"}
{"text":"De la poutine ! Plein de différentes sortes de poutines, toutes excellentes ! C'est très bon, mais la file est imposante en fin de soirée - mais c'est à ce moment-là qu'il faut vivre cette expérience."}
{"text":"Had better, had worse.The food anyway, the service was excellant for being a late night and filled to capacity. I don't know if it was the type of poutine I got, but Ijust couldn't eat it without feeling nauseated. The fries are oddly sweet, which if you like sweet fries is good; they stay crisp even when covered in gravy! Although I did not particularily care for my meal, for the price and service it wasn't a bad deal, I would probably return to try something else."}
{"text":"The only poutine I have had in Montreal. Agree with the other raving reviews about this place. For as bad as this place is in terms of clogging the arteries, I'd rather die of that then not be able to try the different varieties of poutine they have each day."}
{"text":"We ordered the T-rex poutine. Delicious! I always have to get poutine when I visit Canada!"}
{"text":"Straight and to the point--- the poutine here isn't any better than a good poutine found in Toronto. The reviews are misleading and mostly from people who have never eaten poutine before so the rating is skewed for the people who just had their first poutine really and think it's the tops...well yes! Poutine is great, but this place doesn't do it \"better\" necessarily than anywhere else you've enjoyed a poutine before.  Don't go out of your way from the tourist area JUST for this place."}
{"text":"Bonne place pour manger une bonne Poutine en pleine nuit et bonne musique  si vous aimé"}
{"text":"Simply delicious with their great selection of poutines. Definitely a stop-by for visitors. Service is quite impressive."}
{"text":"La Banquise was our final meal in Montreal. I finally got some poutine after a week of putting it off. It was very good and even the small portion was enough for 2 people. My girlfriend got the shepherd's pie which I was surprised to see on the menu. It was pretty good albeit missing a couple of the standard veggies. We went in the morning and it was very chill which was nice. The decor is really cool and I can see this place really being a local hangout spot. They also had a bunch of different kinds of poutine as well. It says on Yelp that they take credit card but they actually only take debit card which we didn't know until we got there. Kind of a bummer but not their fault. I can't say whether it was the best poutine in Montreal b/c it was the only one I had but it definitely was very good and a lot of food. We will come back our next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"We loved this place, first night in Montreal saw the huge line up we had to try this place and holy smokes it was worth the 40 min wait time, yeah that's how busy and how good it is. We never do line ups for anything but from the street the smell coming out of the place was irresistible. Will keep coming here!"}
{"text":"I think the cheese and the gravy is what defines the poutine in Montreal and not the meat or the fries. Poutine in Toronto is so dry!"}
{"text":"Les mille et un choix de poutines font de cet endroit le paradis montréalais de la poutine ! Impossible de ne pas y trouver son compte !"}
{"text":"The best place in town to eat poutine. 24/7. Great selection of poutine, so don't go there for a regular one. Good for quality/price."}
{"text":"Vegan poutine! Got it twice within a few days - delicious and memorable. Will definitely be back if I'm back in town. One poutine is definitely enough for a meal (maybe too much)."}
{"text":"This place was super crowded on a Thursday night @11:30 pm. You have to wait in line for a table. They haphazardly cleaned off the tables. There were chunks of cheese curds on the seat and the table. Then they make you order and pay before the food comes. I get it this place is busy and they are trying to get as many people in as possible. It was just uninviting service set up.  What if you want to order more drinks or food? Don't they want you to stay and spend money ? The poutine was subpar. Would only go to this place because it's open late."}
{"text":"This is probably the most over rated poutine place I've been to on multiple occasions.   The wait staff ignored us for an extended period of time, the food came 40 mins late (for a single poutine), the corn dogs were store brand Pogos (with the logo on the stick), and the mozzarella sticks were store bought too.  Hopefully this place closes down and becomes a better use of space than this sorry excuse for an overhyped poutinery."}
{"text":"In planning our trip, I wasn't sure about going out of my way for specialty poutine, but I'm so glad we did. This is a must-do in Montreal!   We came in around brunch-time with hopes of beating the crowds. The timing was perfect and we were seated quickly. The restaurant became crowded shortly after we received our order (around noon). I would recommend coming for brunch or a slightly early lunch, especially if you want to avoid the crowd.  We ordered A T-Rex with added guac (to share) and were incredibly pleased with the experience. Their base is french fries (with a unique sweetness), the gravy was excellent, and the cheese curds were perfectly squeaky. Being from SoCal, we love guac on all things, so we thought 'since we're getting creative with poutine, let's add in a favourite'. The dish came and their regular size was still too large for two people to finish. The toppings on the T-Rex were fun and had good flavour; the hot dog was a fun twist.  My favourite part? The fries themselves! Slightly sweet, cooked perfectly, fluffy texture. Next time, I think I'd like to share a traditional poutine (and a specialty, if we're hungry enough!).  The worst part about our experience at La Banquise was trying to decide which poutine to get!"}
{"text":"Okay poutine, but worst service in Montreal. Rude waiters that do nothing but ignore you the whole night. Really, ignore you. I can't even describe. I was shocked. Also is a cash only business."}
{"text":"If you are bored of plain standard Poutine then I recommend trying La Banquise. They have a huge menu of different types of poutine. They have poutine with guac., ground beef, onion ring, different sauces, different cheeses, and veg. The inside was very neat, their decor was rustic, but it was a bit tight. Their drink menu was big as well, my wife tried a coconut/ lemon drink called Lemoncocco. I was a bit skeptical at first but it was refreshing, wish they sell it back home. We ordered two poutines: La Reggae and La Sud-Ouest. Both poutine topping added different flavour to the standard poutine. The La Reggae ground beef and hot pepper add a good protein and heat. The La Sud-Ouest had the onion ring, sautéed onion, and chipotle sauce made it sweet. Both had guac., the guac. was a bit of a paste consistency than chunky avo. The fries was a bit soft and was okay. The topping made it up for fries.   They have other food on the menu but all customer that i saw ordered poutine. If you are very hungry order one regular poutine for yourself. If you are not hungry and with a friend then share one regular poutine, the regular poutine is a decent size (of course if your friend is also not so hungry)."}
{"text":"Alright, I've lived in Quebec for the past 6 years and have never touched a poutine. My first encounter with one was at a theatre, where my reaction to seeing a package of cheese curds unwrapped and dropped onto some anemic-looking fries, then slathered in pork or beef or mystery-meat fat, was a profound and audible \"ew.\" I've avoided it like the plague since then, and berated those who dared suggest I try it myself.  Fast forward to last week: it's 3am on a Friday and I haven't eaten for hours. The restaurant my friends wanted to go to had an unacceptable line-up outside. This was the closet place nearby. We went.  I got a classic poutine with philly steak, checked off from a menu which lets you build your own dish. Rest assured, it was unbelievably tasty, and I cannot wait to come back for more! What had I been missing for the past 6 years?!  The reason for the 4 stars: while this was a poutine place, I was feeling slightly groggy and decided to order a latte. The lady didn't bother grinding beans on the spot, she instead flicked in whatever was left in the grinder from who knows how many hours past. She grabbed a thermos of milk already in the fridge  and completely nuked it with the steamer, creating huge bubbles and no micro-foam. Scalded milk plus old espresso makes for one of the worst lattes I've ever had. Just stick to the poutines and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"I don't know, I've had better poutine somewhere else. Just a disclaimer, poutine is a really heavy meal if you never had it filled with whatever you want to put in it. I came here, and as expected, long lines for both sit in and take out. I opted for take out of a small order of their speciality poutine L'Astérix (smoked meat, mushroom, sourcream, and pepper sauce) Now that's a lot of toppings and let me tell you it was. As open the box, it looked like a pile of random put together with no disregard of what's in it. The smoked meat tasted like rubber and undercooked for my taste, when mixed with the pepper sauce, that spice taste made it a bit bitter in a way that you couldn't even taste the cheese curds properly. By the end of it is my want for this diminish, bit my pocket and frozen hands disallowed me from not eating it so I had no choice but to finish it. By the end of it my stomach was bombed and to give another chance towards this place, I think it's best to try a different poutine dish than this."}
{"text":"A friend of mine suggested this place late night after we were feeling hungry . The ambience of the place was great. The waiters were gorgeous, so as the food . Best thing is they don't wear the uniform as the regular food chains. The menu has the history of the restaurant , that started in 1963. Let me tell u, a place packed on a Monday night at -9 with blowing snow, u seriously need to visit this place . Ordered 4 different items so as to share with my friends. One thing I can say, there poutine was great with all the cheese curds and gravy . If you are a group of 4 people that don't mind sharing food with your friends, each of u should order different poutine and taste it . It's really nice. The menu has different beers that goes along with the poutine . Try them ."}
{"text":"We are so glad that we didn't have to wait in line when we arrived at 10am to eat their famous poutine. We found out that this place is opened 24hours!!  How awesome is that? The space is quite spacious, but was packed by lunch time. There are other brunch type of food on the menu, but our focus was on the poutine.  You can choose between 2 sizes; regular from $7.40 to $12.30 or grand (which is what we got to share as a family of 4) from  $11.75 to $18.75 and so many poutine options to choose from, we got the La Fred Calliou, it was so good. I also had a bottle of kombacha to balance out the grease. Wished we had something like this back in Toronto."}
{"text":"The poutines are good, the strength of the place is its variety and ambiance. I wouldn't say its the best place for poutine however."}
{"text":"In my opinion, La banquise is the best poutine. EVER. I lived across the street from this joint for about three years and it took a toll on my waistline.   Three essential components of the poutine are at their best in La Banquise's poutine:  - the french fries are wonderful, thickly cut and perfectly between crispy and soft  - the gravy is wonderful, not too watery or thick and not too salty. very flavourful  - cheese is wonderful  and they have all sorts of different types, my favorite is the chouxx which adds cole slaw to the traditional poutine. DELICIOUS! the two different textures work perfectly together.  It's at its busiest after bars close at around 3 am."}
{"text":"After reading so many good reviews, we decided to take a trip down the restaurant. The food was ok. I had better poutine in quebec city. I give five star for their selection food, three star for their food and three stars for the long wait."}
{"text":"Trap de touriste! C'est affreux ce place là! Trop de sauces, les frites deviennent tellement molles. Ça même pas l'air appétissant..."}
{"text":"My local coworkers recommended this place for some good poutine. They weren't kidding. It's very popular. Made the stupid mistake of coming by here for a Friday diner. The line up was out the door. The take out line is much shorter. Only had to wait 10 minutes to order.   Went with a large petite vie. Basically, it's poutine with beef, corn and caramelized onions. Pretty simple recipe, but it tasted very delicious. The large is easily a meal for 2 or 3. It's big and will set you back about 15$.   Ended up eating outside under a tree in the rain because I walked here from the metro. I would recommend driving to your destination because you may need to go elsewhere to get your Montreal sit down experience if it is busy.  Overall I loved the product and hope to be back next time to sit down in the dinner!"}
{"text":"When in Canada... Do as the Canadians! One of my customers suggested I visit this restaurant during my business trip in Montreal as it is considered the best poutine in the city. There is always a HUGE line and this is an understatement considering that this place is open 24/7! Yes, you heard me right! We tried the classic Poutine and the Savoyarde (recommended by an adorable waitress, I think her name was Val) and loved them, even if I must admit that the Savoyarde had a more unique taste."}
{"text":"Jamais été déçue par leurs poutines. C'est un peu l'usine selon l'heure à laquelle on y va mais l'expérience est sympa entre amis. Et on ne ressort jamais en ayant faim !"}
{"text":"My friends and I are visiting from Toronto and wanted to hit up a poutine place since our friends from Montreal are always talking about how we don't know what real poutine is. We were deciding between two popular places and based on our friends' recommendations, we decided to try La Banquise. We went at about 530 and there was a line up but it was nothing compared to the line up we saw coming out of the restaurant.  I ordered \"the reggae\" which was not on the menu but my friend from Montreal highly recommended it. IT WAS DIVINE. I am also a huge lover of guac so this poutine was everything I could dream of and more. The service is okay but the place is so busy. The servers however, are super friendly. I would recommend ordering the regular because I found that it was a perfect portion to be satisfied and full.  One thing I really really enjoyed about this place is the music. I enjoyed their old school rap and hip hop playlist that kept me moving to the beat while I devoured my poutine."}
{"text":"This was the most needlessly uncomfortable part of my trip to Canada. Do yourself a favor and avoid the hype of this POORLY managed restaurant. Very disappointing!!"}
{"text":"The BEST place to have your first taste of poutine. Reasonable prices, a wide menu selection and a variety of craft beers. The portions are large and they don't chinz on the gravy or curds. I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"From Toronto. Best poutine I've ever had. Gravy wasn't too salty. Cheese curd to fry ratio was 1:1. Hot dogs didn't seem like the cheap kind out of the packet. took about 15 minutes for food to arrive but was worth the wait. I ate every single bite and even tried some of my cousins. His had sour cream and it really was refreshing by cutting through all the greasier toppings. This is the quintessential Montreal poutine establishment from what I've been told."}
{"text":"La Banquise ne sert pas la meilleure poutine mais au moins, ce restaurant est ouvert 24/24!  A noté, la petite poutine est déjà énorme !"}
{"text":"Wow...this place is out of this world.  Pop Daddy loves all things poutine and this place is the queen of poutine. Whether you're the classic type or you like to jazz it up like Pop Daddy...this place will not disappoint.  It's a must. Pop Daddy got that cravey for the gravy ya feel me?"}
{"text":"The italian poutine was amazing. My second best poutine in montreal and best for the price."}
{"text":"THE place to get a poutine, obviously. Sooo many options available, it's nearly overwhelming. In my opinion, tastes best enjoyed with a glass of milk. Recommendations for the vegan poutine sauce (the last two sentences contradict each other, I know). Very soothing during the cold winter months."}
{"text":"#1 TIP: It is a CASH ONLY or Canadian DEBIT card place!!!! I learned the hard way, when they didn't take my Chase Freedom credit card.  Food: I think sizing is important to mention. Between 4 people, we ordered 2 large poutines and it was more than enough. We ordered the B.O.M. as well as the Fred Caillou. Both are good.....if you like merguez sausage. I'm not poutine connoisseur by any means but I would recommend this place.   Keep in mind that the combination of merguez sausage, bacon, and gravy in the B.O.M. caused the dish to be quite salty.   Fred Caillou was also very salty, due to the combination of smoked meats, merguez sausage, and gravy....kind of like a beefed up version of the B.O.M.   So if you're looking at ordering the B.O.M. or the Fred Caillou, I'd suggest ordering only one or the other due to the fact that they're so similar.   Try the Bec Cola...it was unique. Very sweet. Maple Syrup soda is a good way to wash down all the poutine!   Service: Fast and quick. Try to avoid the weekends.....when the line can wrap around the building.   Would I come back? Probably not. I feel like it's a one-time thing. But if you haven't gone before, you should definitely go! It's a must do in Montreal."}
{"text":"POUTINE!!!  Very busy inside but super family friendly. Staff was really nice as well.  Ordered the La Mart and a large size was definitely for more than one person.   Their menu can be a bit overwhelming at first but if you find what you like then you're all set!"}
{"text":"Toujours ouvert, toujours bon! Notre spécialité Qcoise, la bonne Poutine peut importe l'heure."}
{"text":"This place is just ok! Why does everyone love it so much, really nothing special. Only worth going to if its past midnight and there is nothing else open and you really need a poutine, otherwise theres way better. Even Ma poule mouille across the street has a way better poutine. This place is way over rated"}
{"text":"Seriously people, we all know that Montreal is known for three things: bagels, smoked meat and poutine. Maybe it's also known for its French culture, but that's besides the point. We are talking about food here! People used to tell me, \"Look, you don't know what poutine tastes like until you try it in Montreal.\" My retort was, \"Where's Montreal, and what the schnitzel is poutine?\" I admit, this was many many moons ago. Since then, I have not only eaten poutine many times (I did go to university after all), but I've also had it in one of Montreal's most famous poutine eateries - La Banquise.   On to the bigger question. Does this place live up to its applause? Well, it does and it doesn't. Let's be honest here, ANYTHING tastes good at 2am when you've just had ten drinks. But, in all honesty, the poutine here is a good time. The line out the door, however, is another story.   The menu is loooong and all the types of poutine have names like T-Rex, Elvis, and Frank. I usually get the classic poutine (boring, I know) and leave the bacon, green peppers and beef to other meals that I eat. La Banquise also offers up breakfast, but I'm not sure if anyone ever orders it unless it's to ask for eggs benny on a poutine.  So, will I return to this famous Montreal house of poutine? Probably. I just need to get a buzz on and eventually convince them to name a poutine after me."}
{"text":"La poutine est bonne mais à mes yeux, elle ne justifie pas l'attente assez importante (surtout l'hiver dans le froid le soir)..  C'est tout de même une des poutines à goûter lorsqu'on vient à Montréal !"}
{"text":"Great place near a beautiful park space.   I came here based on other yelp reviews. My friends and I wanted to try the best poutine in Montreal and I have to say it did not quite live up to expectation. Yes, they had a huge selection of poutine. But the fries were a little on the sweet side. Not quite sweet potato fries but sort of in between, which I think didnt complement the gravy and other salty toppings. I asked the server if it was a montreal poutine thing but it was apparently only a resto banquise thing. Either way it was strange.   I got the \"3 amigos\" poutine which comes with three kinds of hotdogs and they gave a generous portion of all toppings. I was impressed by how busy they were even on a Monday afternoon, so people must really love it."}
{"text":"This place is great- and the service is very friendly. There are plenty of options for poutine- and it is extremely vegan and veg friendly! The poutine sauce is vegetarian (according to our friendly server) and there's other choices for sauce including pepper sauce and gluten free vegan sauce. Plus you can add extras and other toppings so all the poutines are pretty much customizable. There a long wait outside at night- but it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"I don't know what I can say about this place that hasn't been said already. La Banquise is an experience.    The poutine, spot on! I've had too many versions where the gravy is too salty or the cheese curds were too big/not spread out enough. I can't rave about this one enough. We also ordered a Montreal burger and that was the biggest detractor from the meal. The condiments were too strong and had a pronounced horseradish flavor that completely overpowered the sandwich. But aside from that, the restaurant is really cute with decorative tables, yellow exterior, fun ads. The lines move fast and the waitresses are efficient, so honestly the waits aren't bad. Until next time Montreal, I have to get more poutine here!"}
{"text":"La Banquise is regarded as having one of the best poutine's in Montreal.  My SO and I made the pilgrimage this past weekend on a weekend getaway to Montreal.  At 3pm on a Saturday, this place was packed!  It is nice to know that they are open 24 hours for future Montreal trips.  I ordered the smoked meat poutine regular which could have been shared by 2 people.  It was huge but delicious!  The cheese was fresh and chewy, good signs that it is in fact Quebec cheese curds!  My SO ordered the vegetarian poutine and he really enjoyed it.  Service was quick and prices were reasonable.  I will definitely be back when I am in Montreal again."}
{"text":"The line was already 30 minutes long by the time we arrived around 3pm. Eventually our party of four was served and it was very good.  I've never had poutine before, so I have nothing to compare it to. However, I know I'll return someday to try the other poutines.  Worth the wait for the experience."}
{"text":"This place has a great selection of poutines that would suit anyone's taste. My favorite poutine place in Montreal. I love that they are open so late, which is rare in Canada where restaurants mostly close before midnight. This place is open until 4AM in the morning, allowing you and your friends to grab some amazing poutine after a long night out."}
{"text":"We didn't come here for a full meal; we just wanted to try the famous poutine before leaving Montreal. Let me start by saying the portions are huge! We shared one \"large\" and it could've been a meal for us. The poutine itself was deeelicious. We had never had poutine before, so we opted for the classic kind, but there were literally dozens of variations of poutine on the menu. (As well as some other things like burgers or hot dogs)   The place itself is very casual and laid backbut it can get really busy. Luckily the service is fast and friendly. People said this was the best place to get poutine and I thought it was great."}
{"text":"Highly overrated. We arrived around 3pm hoping to grab quick poutine. The line outside was over 40 people for a table inside - we waited for 10 minutes and didn't move once. While my friend continued waiting on the line I poked around and learned that there was a takeout line as well. We then hopped on the takeout line, ordered within minutes and got our  food about 10 min later.   We ordered the classic, the one with guacamole, and burgers. The poutine was horrible. The fries were soggy, the cheese was squeaky and not flavorful, and the gravy was bland. I was highly disappointed since we were told this was the best poutine in Montreal. Wouldn't recommend it unless you're totally wasted."}
{"text":"My favorite poutine place in Montreal!  * Open 24 hours * Large list of different toppings for poutine * Fresh curds * Gravy that is not too acidic, salty, or runny  My typical order is the two hot dogs (toasted all dressed) with a side of original poutine!"}
{"text":"This is the greatest poutine place on earth. I had it 5 times in 4 days last trip to Montreal. That was excessive but worth it and I think about you La Banquise every day. Vegan and vegetarian poutine too! If I could move into the kitchen I would."}
{"text":"Good poutine... Great variety of poutine. Nice staff. Lucky that I didn't need to wait."}
{"text":"Always a classic after having a heavy drinking night. Still popular amoung the tourists and non-tourists....try to avoid the crowd at night by going a bit before closing time of the bars otherwise get ready to wait outside in line with the other drunks ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome after a super late night, totally hit the spot. Super cool vibe and amazing poutine!"}
{"text":"Meilleures poutines! Vous en avez pour votre argent. Le line-up est souvent long par contre."}
{"text":"Hey, go ahead and ask me why I hate the poutine at Resto La Banquise?    Well, that's a very good question.  Let's go over the basics of Poutine.  It's fries served with a brown gravy and topped with cheese curds.  Yeah, it doesn't make you friends amongst Cardiologists, I have heard Quebecois refer to it jokingly as \"Montcalm's revenge\", but hey, sex is both funny and kinda disgusting, but who doesn't love getting it on, right?  Right. Poutine is the culinary equivalent of dirty itchy smelly sex that leaves you sweaty all over...so bad and oh so good.  Anyways, In order for poutine to be dirty sex satisfying, a competent establishment should meet several criteria for quality in such a simple (but by no means easy) product:    a) The fries must be crisp on the outside, savory and soft with some moistness on the inside, and not too thin so it'll hold up to an onslaught of gravy.  It should also be salted so it tastes good by itself  b) The gravy should be hot, flavorful and thick, so it'll provide a lipsmacking base of umami.  A good gravy reminds you of a good consomme...you can sip it by itself.  c) The cheese curds should be room temperature, or at least it should not be cold.  It should squeak with milky freshness when you bite it.  It should be an ideal vehicle for absorbing and retaining the gravy flavors, and the population numerous enough to act as a meat-like counterpoint to the soft, crisp but bland potatoes.  d) All 3 ingredients should form a sublime union, the resultant product a greater sum of its parts.  It should be both crisp and soft, potatoey-and-gravy-meaty, refreshingly cheesy - Quebec cheese curds, Nova Scotia/Ontario potatoes, and their confederation in a good, salty and flavorful, very warm gravy, enough to warm you up on a cool day.  And Resto La Banquise...failed on all counts.  Let's start with the potatoes - thinnish potatoes that are inexplicably sweet (did they put sugar in there?  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING), which does not crisp up at all.   There's the gravy - a bit too thin, not much flavor, does not taste good by itself, and in the case of my serving of La Classique?  It was barely lukewarm.  The cheese?  Cool/cold - feels like they just took it out of the fridge.  It's supposed to be returned to room temperature prior to serving so it'll not cool down the gravy/fries when you put it in.  On top of that, it's not an entirely generous portion of it to mingle well with the fries and gravy to make it work.  I wonder if the line cooks preparing poutine hates its very existence and want it to bury it alive.  How else would you explain adding all those crazy toppings onto it to make it appealing to the obvious out-of-towners?  I am disappointed by this supposed landmark, a pretender to the pantheon of culinary achievement, one that does not hold up to scrutiny.  The ingredients of greatness are probably there (the steamie hot dogs from Lesters were delicious, the seating is comfortable and the service is passably good), but their poutine needs work.  Do not make limp fries, add sugar, dump pieces of cheese curds straight from the fridge, pour weak gravy on it and serve it lukewarm.  That's like asking the guys at Wilensky's to cut the sandwich, for the counterman at Schwartzs to cut the viande fumee thin and lean, or for the staff at Le Centre Bell to hoist a Bruins flag.  You don't go to St. Viateurs and ask them to make a salty doughy New York style bagel. You don't do stuff like that in Montreal and expect to get away with it.  I suppose you want a good alternative for Poutine - okay, here's my suggestion: Patati Patata on Rue Rachel and Rue St. Laurent - there's a reason why they are constantly busy.  They have higher turnover, they also show their Poutine respect by making the fries crisper, the gravy thicker/more flavorful, and their cheese curds are not as cold.  The amount of curds were well balanced and the results blend better into the mix.  This is not to say that their poutine is the best, but they are definitely better.    Rotisserie Romado on Rue Rachel and Rue Buillion will do a good version as well, with lots of crispy salty fries, lots of fresh curds, and their gravy is actually spicy.  Damn the lines and order some with your chicken, and get some Sumol or Guarana.    As for this place?  I don't know.  I guess you should try it just to see how bad Poutine could be, just so you can hanker for much better ones somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is THE place for poutine in Montreal.  Poutine is the ultimate drunk food.   Not for the health concious, but when in Rome...I just had to try some."}
{"text":"Line looked long but moved fairly quick. The burgers were super greasy and delicious! We had the classic poutine and it was good. Soda is a little costly (3 bucks for a can). Would recommend to grab a burger and some poutine!"}
{"text":"One of the rare times I ate poutine during the daytime. This is a place where hipsters are bearable. The special gravy for the classic version is quite a good thing. Well worth the trip..."}
{"text":"I don't know what the fuss is with Poutine. We tried a couple and thought it was just ok. This less of a rating for the place and more for poutine."}
{"text":"In summary long lineup outside we waited about 40 mins at 6pm.   Poutine's were good! I would go back! Great after a few beers.    Bathrooms were really gross though,  it didn't smell good and was gross."}
{"text":"I'm probably the biggest foodie ever and I must say, poutine is one of my guilty pleasures. While visiting the land of the great poutine, I decided to save the best for the last. I was told that this place was a must have. I have to say that I was terribly disappointed because the truck stop on Dundas square serves better poutine and doesn't cost $20!! I mean, I would have no issue with the price point if it was as spectacular as people say it would be. I ordered the \"pepper sauce\" with spicy sausage and banana peppers.i know right?....sounds delicious on paper for sure but the recommended pepper sauce had peppercorns that were not properly crushed, the cheese curds were massive clumps sitting right in the center away from the sauce, so it didnt even melt properly, and the amount of banana peppers exceeded the amount of fries. I mean I'm sure the recipie isn't hot peppers, cheese curds, gravy and a sprinkle of potatoes now is it? To be honest, I've never written a bad review because I can literally enjoy anything, especially being east indian, my stomach can handle the spice.  However the drive back to Toronto was filled with acidity and indigestion.  More over, when I asked to take it out in a box, I was handed my package, then asked for it back because the guy in the kitchen \"forgot\" to do something. After handing it back to him, he drops the box, takes it back in the kitchen, does what he needs to and hands it back over to me. After getting in my car and driving off, I start feeling the paper bag leak on my lap! So basically the guy didnt even have the decency to give me a new box after dropping it. I know I should have double checked but hey I thought it is common sense to do that for a customer especially when you slam the box on the floor in front of them! Guess I have high r expectations..... oh and I forgot to mention, the guy went to add extra hot peppers!   The only couple good thing I can say about it were the actual fries, but if you go wrong deep frying potatoes,  then there is a problem. The ambiance was also nice and the poutine orders looked delicious from a distance."}
{"text":"Passage obligé à Montréal pour goûter une Poutine typique. Il fait partie des attractions touristiques culinaires de Montréal. Les poutines sont correctes. On a le choix entre taille régulière ou plus grosse pour les grosses faims. Sachant que la régulière est déjà assez conséquente. Possibilité de prendre une Poutine à emporter. Le restaurant est assez bruyant et beaucoup achalandé. Il y a souvent une line-up à l'entrée. Restaurant ouvert 24h/24 !"}
{"text":"My first poutine ever! And it was delicious, the regular size is really big and they have a wide variety of ingredients. The price is good enough. I tried poutine with ring onions and I totally recommend this place. It is clean and the service is good and you don't have to wait a long time to be served."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd like poutine, and I certainly don't want to eat it every day, but this stuff was really good. Get it with some bacon or sausage on top. Excellent for teenage boys."}
{"text":"Poutine merveilleusement bon. La pop gagne complètement la PoutineWeek de Montréal !!  Bière banquise, mal de ventre : poutine et bière je ne suis pas certaine."}
{"text":"Thank god I don't live in Montreal because this would be my after-party go-to! Came here after bar hopping and got the \"La Matty\". Was not disappointed! It was disco fry deliciousness!! One plate served my boyfriend and I and we left happy. I did end up leaving a shopping bag behind (rookie move) and it was nowhere to be found the next day. Ah, the joys of after-hours."}
{"text":"It was alright. I wouldn't say it's amazing but it's good. I ordered an apricot beer to match the poutine and it was very good. I say it's good to try it at least once but it's not something I would comeback for. There are many more good eats in Montreal to try."}
{"text":"Fantastic poutine, good sized portions and awesome atmosphere. I heard this place gets quite busy but we went around 1145 am on a Wednesday so it was super quiet. Prices are really good.  My boyfriend had the pulled pork hot dog and absolutely loved it! Staff were quite nice and service was quick.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Assez déçue de la première et probablement dernière expérience avec les poutines.  On arrive, tout va bien on nous place rapidement à table et nous sert les cartes.  Puis, sans vraiment nous laisser le temps de choisir parmi les 25-30 poutines on revient pour prendre les commandes. Nous demandons quelque instants en plus pour nous décider.  Ces quelques instants se sont transformés en quart d'heure... Et oui, je demande à une serveuse de venir prendre la commande et elle me répond qu'une serveuse viendra. Chose faite 10 minutes plus tard...  Je n'ai pas encore reçue mon plat que j'étais déjà déçue par le service.  Seul point positif: on reçoit de l'eau à volonté.  Bref, les poutines arrivent après une longue attente encore. Niveau goût c'est pas trop mon truc.. C'est très gras et le fromage ne se marie pas bien avec les frites... Par contre la garniture de guacamole oignons était super bonne!  Cerise sur le gâteau: on reçoit l'addition (on n'est pas encore habitués à la TVA qui s'ajoute). Sur celle ci une ligne \"proposition de pourboire\" de 15-20% du prix total du repas.  Alors déjà que je paye 12-13$ dollars ma Poutine (avec tva), que j'ai un service médiocre, on me fait comprendre que je suis obligée de donner le pourboire \"proposé\" sur l'addition et ce, sur un ton que je trouve inacceptable..  Bref, tout ça pour dire que je ne comprend pas l'enjaillement pour cet établissement. Les poutines sont bonnes mais pas dingues au point de valoir 10. Le service laisse à désirer. Pas de paiement par carte pour les étrangers...."}
{"text":"Now THIS is what poutine is all about!  This place has quite possibly every tasty variation of poutine imaginable. They offer about 30 different kinds, with toppings ranging from healthy stuff such as green peas, mushrooms, and guac, to the wonderfully heart-clogging meats like pepperoni, hot dogs, and bacon. And obviously, gravy and cheese curds are a given.  We ordered La Mart, which had hot dogs, bacon, and mushrooms. So simple, but so good, especially on a cold winter day. It really is the quintessential comfort food, and I don't think you could go wrong with any of the poutines here. We also tried a burger here which was pretty good. If I lived in Montreal, I think I would be coming here at all hours of the day and night (it's open 24/7, which is awesome!).   The wait can be long; we waited about 15-20 minutes on a weekend afternoon, between normal lunch and dinner hours. But be patient... it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"Ah - the best poutine ever and I was luckily enough to try it! Of course with 24 hour poutine we knew it was going to have to be late into the night .. perhaps after drinking.. that we try it and we did.. and there was still a line! Was it worth the wait - hell yes! But be sure to remember cash because if not you are SOL!  Food: 5/5 Service: 4/5 Location: 4/5"}
{"text":"Yum! If you like poutine then it necessary to try this place. They just get it when it comes to making poutine.   I'm not much of a gimmick guy, so I judge poutine by the basic 3 ingredients. Once you get that right,  the rest is child play. 3 ingredients, you say? How hard is it to mess that up, right?  But trust me, the majority of poutine, especially outside of Quebec, is absolutely awful!  I usually go for a classic, along with 2 steamy hot dogs (another Montreal fast food staple) and a beer to finish all nicely.   If you go to Montreal,  definitely go there."}
{"text":"This place is really a meh. I walked all the way from downtown because I heard it's the best poutine. It was very average, and the fries are not even hand cut, they are normal fries that you can get at any take out at 3am. For a place that only serves poutine and has been doing so from 1969 (or somewhere around that time) I'd expect better. It's barely give anything under 5 stars but, this place is really not that great. It's just hype, also the line outside will make you think it's great, but it's not."}
{"text":"Making people wait outside when there is enough room inside to queue by -30°C  is clearly irresponsible.   Simply because the available room is reserved to \"to go queue\" and there is no one queuing to order to go at that moment."}
{"text":"All the poutine here tasted more or less the same regardless of which toppings you get, mostly because the fries that often make or break a poutine plate, were really boring and really sucked.  Despite the friendly service, La Banquise is a big fat tourist trap. I should've known when I was squished in line among a bunch of exuberant americans."}
{"text":"Poutine is a staple of Canada and you cannot visit without having some! We lived only a block away from this restaurant and it seemed, at almost any hour, that there was line out the door. We waited until about 9AM on a Sunday morning and we were one of two families there, so keep in mind you might end up waiting a while at other parts of the day! I had the L'Ensoleillée Breakfast Poutine, which included your usual breakfast meats (ie bacon), and a sunny-side up egg on top. Huge portion and was definetly not able to finish it in one sitting. A very cute place and I would love to come back!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and pay a visit if you're in Montreal! Hopped in a cab and told the cabbie to take me to the best poutine in town. He drove immediately to La Banquise and was he ever right. Maybe im not used to having such a wide selection of poutine in Vancouver but i would move to Montreal if i could eat like this all the time. Got the poutine with hot dog while my friend got the \"healthy\" poutine with chicken and peas. Trust me, dont try to be healthy. Fries and gravy and curds arent evert going to be considered healthy so stop lying to yourself and just indulge in the delciusness that is poutine!! Plenty of seating in the restaurant but a bit of a wait to get your order. I kind of wish i could bottle the gravy and pour it on every meal i eat."}
{"text":"We came here after a short night of experiencing Montreal nightlife after nearly every single bar was either at capacity or extremely shady looking. Our cabbie even judged us as losers for heading out for Poutine at 1:30am. Shucks.   After a quick 10 min wait, we were seated and placed an order for the T-Rex poutine and a couple of beers. The poutine came with sausage, hot dog, bacon, cheese curd, and a gallon of gravy dumped atop french fries. The sad part is that these could have been the worst fries in the world and you wouldn't be able to tell from all that gunk atop of it. I wasn't very impressed...but maybe a few more drinks in me woulda made all the difference!  P.S. They have a weird system where you pay after you order, before you receive your dish. Guess serving drunk people forces you to do that!"}
{"text":"A MTL Classic.   Despite the long line that always winds down the sidewalk, you can't go wrong with la Banquise.  My personal fav is the T Rex, but all the poutines I e tried were very good.   If ever you don't want to wait in line, Ma Poulet Mouillé is across the street"}
{"text":"Malgré la file d'attente inévitable peu importe l'heure, cet endroit vaut toujours le détour d'où que vous soyez sur l'Île de Montréal. Des poutines traditionnelles aux plus audacieuses, le tout peut vous être servi avec le nombre d'extra que vous voulez. Le choix de bière est très intéressant et la terrasse arrière et agréable en saison estivale."}
{"text":"La poutine au poivre est délicieuse et les patates cuites à la perfection!"}
{"text":"This was super crowded and it took us awhile to even get a table. We were drawn to the fact that it was open 24 hrs (though not too relevant to us I suppose) and that it had great reviews on yelp. Also that they had vegan poutine.  We waited in line for awhile, trying to decide what to get while we were in line. I ended up getting vegan poutine with green peppers and onions and it was OK. My friends' poutines looked better, but honestly there's definitely better poutine out there."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night around 10pm.  Line was long but it moves fast. The line starts as one but once inside it divided into take-out and sit in.  Ambience: Vibrant and colorful.  Service: Straight to the point  Food: I got the one with mushrooms, green peppers and bacon. The bf had the one with ground beef, tomatoes, and Swiss cheese. Both quite good. I feel like tomatoes makes it taste better so I suggest you add that to your dish.  I highly suggest if in the mood for poutine, especially after a night of drinking."}
{"text":"La Banquise is the most popular poutine place according to my girlfriend. I was super excited to check it out and even skipped dinner, hoping to fully maximize enjoyment. Seeing the line out the door confirmed its popularity. It was packed at 10 pm, even before the bar crowd got there.  La Banquise definitely has the biggest menu of poutine i've ever seen. There are 20+ different options and includes many toppings that you would not normally think about putting on poutine (ie. guacamole, smoked meat, coleslaw). For the poutine-phobic, there are burgers and breakfast items as well.  I ordered \"La Rachel\" which included green peppers, mushrooms and onions. While all the ingredients worked well with each other, I found it bland and underseasoned. Maybe it was my fault for not ordering a meat topping, but I thought the gravy could be more flavorful.    Good poutine, but definitely not the best i've ever had. I probably should have opted for the classic, or picked one with a flavorful protein topping. Pricing was good and portions were large. I found it weird that you had to pay up front before receiving the food. Maybe too much dine and dashing?    Anyways, I was a bit disappointed but I think it's still worth checking out to get your poutine fix."}
{"text":"Great experience! *Note:* I am dairy sensitive and I ordered La Mart (bacon + hot dog + mushrooms) with vegan cheese & vegan gravy. It was delicious! My partner chose La Reggae (ground beef, guac, tomatoes & hot peppers) and he really enjoyed his dish as well. We were in a rush to leave Montreal so we didn't have the chance to taste the beers they had that was local.  CASH ONLY. ATM inside the restaurant. We came at 10:30AM on a Saturday and it wasn't too busy. Great for brunch :)"}
{"text":"After chowing down on many a ooutine (and hot dog, pogo, merguez, etc), I can confidently say that La Banquise is pretty darn alright. Perhaps not the best poutine I've ever consumed, but delicious nonetheless. The location is good for post Parc Lafontaine frolicking, or night out poutine cravings.  On my most recent visit I discovered I'm starting to feel old. The music was just a little bit too loud, the tables a little bit too close. And the music being played reminded me of what I would have had on my iPod as a teenager ... Because iPods didn't exist back then. The clientele though was a mixed bag, ranging from teens to a couple to older people, so it wasn't the fellow patrons that made me feel old.  The poutine though?  Still delicious!  Some things never change."}
{"text":"I had the T. Rex poutine two nights ago.  I still don't think it has left my system.  I don't think I want it to, either.  Great compliment to a very filthy lap dance down the street.  Three hungry ruggers failed to take this one down.  Maybe on the next trip we will destroy it.  - Juggernaut approved"}
{"text":"amazing poutine, and great portions, hate the wait line but its worth it. Very filling"}
{"text":"Poutine has always been a staple of Montreal fast food. This little dinner opened in the 60's and has since become the most talked about poutine restaurant in the province. ?Even people from out of town quickly gravitate to it once they reach Montreal.  Sure a few have tried to imitate La Banquise by creating a multi-poutine menu with dozens of varieties. But none have ever come close to La Banquise and none ever will. Some even try to franchise themselves, opening a slew of restaurants under the same name to try to make themselves more recognizable, but again, they are only second rate to the original poutine master.  I have to admit that in the dozens of times I have gone to this fabulous restaurant, I have never tried the regular poutine (fries, gravy, cheese). I have always tried a different type of gastronomic perfection, my favourite being the Taquise: a regular poutine combination plus guacamole, diced tomatoes and sour cream. As most who read this will likely imagine, it can be difficult to accept. But the moment you see it presented, in its glorious stacked ingredients beauty, you know you're in for a treat. And the taste is unbeatable. I suggest adding a little Tabasco sauce if you want that extra edge.  The price is extremely reasonable . The only thing that could be improved is the service, but this is to be expected for a place as popular as this. If anything, they could extend their kitchen and double their waitresses on Friday and Saturday nights, but hey, if you're there at that time, chances are that you've had a few drinks already and you won't even see the time go by."}
{"text":"Our first time having poutine! My girlfriend and I came here as our first stop right when we arrived in Montreal. The line moved fast and we were able to get seated within 15 minutes. I'd have to say my first time having poutine, I was not disappointed! The biggest thing I realized was how much New yorkers try to imitate it but it actually taste's nothing like it. They have many varieties of different types of poutine so I'd go big or go home!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and well priced for the large portion. They have a huge selection of poutine with size regular or large. The regular sized poutine will easily fill you up. Get a large to share. The service was great and the decor of the restaurant was too notch. Important to note that they don't accept credit, but they did accept American dollars!"}
{"text":"i've never tried poutine before, and I'm glad I let my virgin experience be taken by the best poutine place in Montreal, its signature dish. Resto La Banquise is set up somewhat like a fast-casual restaurant: you can order your food to go, or you can sit down in relatively cramped quarters and have your food served to you in a jiffy. I got a combo meal that involved a burger and a classic poutine. I would highly highly recommend not getting anything else but the poutine. The burger buns tasted strongly of popcorn, like artificial butter was slathered onto it, and the burger itself was dry and bland.  The poutine, however, was the real star of the show. The fries had a great crisp-to-fluff ratio, and had more crisp since the fries were cut shorter and skinnier than say, Pommes Frites in NYC. I wasn't a fan of the curd cheese, but I think I'm just personally averse to the texture of it. The gravy was quite delicious, though. The entire dish was well-composed of different textures and flavors, and if I ever visited Montreal again, Resto La Banquise will certainly be one of my pitstops."}
{"text":"Food was really good, as expected, but be ready to spend quite a bit. You really are paying a price premium for the reputation of the place.  Also, my girlfriend told me there was alcool served, so I was really motivated to spend a good portion of the night there, but they really offered only 5-6 beer types and all in bottles.  I would recommend it if you are in the area, but I would not recommend you to travel a medium to long distance to go there."}
{"text":"Best poutine in the city. It's that simple. Whether you are a purist and love the traditional fries, cheese and gravy or you prefer to venture out and add some guacamole and hot peppers, la Banquise is definitely the place to eat it. Plus it's 24hrs & always fresh. The only down side is the line ups, especially at 2:00am when poutine taste at it best! I highly recommend: La traditionelle, La Mexicaine & la Taquise."}
{"text":"Wish I could give the place 0 stars. So disappointed, considering La banquise has a good rep.  Hair in my food, poutine arrived cold and when I tried to call over someone they ignored me and walked away....leading me to get up and ask for help with my sandwich that had a hair in it.  No refund offered, and not even one apology!"}
{"text":"Great poutine. Huge portions. Loved the food.   The Poutine gets 10/10 from me.   However, the Staff? not so much. Even after having great food, i left having a bad experience.  Get ready to shell out cash for shitty service..  First off, poutines (Large size) cost upto $15-16 or even more ($19). Being NEW to montreal, FIRST time visit, didn't know how the billing worked. It said on their receipt that a 15% TIP is MINIMUM.  Seriously? 15% tip for what?   We thought it was included in the Bill. But it wasnt. We had left the store. And when we reach half way to the car, this waitress comes running saying it out loud how we didnt tip them. And i explained nicely that i did not know cause we thought it was included and such, and she stood there waiting for a tip.   Wtf?? For this attitude and just terrible service, i wouldn't give you $1 for a tip.   Please learn some manners."}
{"text":"Holy poutine!  La Banquise offers a diverse menu, with many unique twists on this classic dish.  My two favorites are La Taquise (yay guacamole) and La Greque,  a surprisingly refreshing spin on poutine, complete with cucumber, tomatoes and feta, instead of the traditional cheese curds.  Be prepared for a line and a packed restaurant, but it's absolutely worth the wait - and not too loud for good conversation.  Also note, even though they take your order at the table, they ask you to pay upfront."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town our hotel staff suggested we try this restaurant for good authentic poutine.  We came around noon hour and the restaurant had just filled up.  We waited for 10 minutes for a table on a Monday.     The dining room is very packed and very tight.  I ordered the bacon,onion, green pepper and mushroom poutine and it came pouring over the plate! Needless to say it was delicious and packed full of the toppings, gravy and curds.  Must try when in Montreal!   Also note when we left around 1pm there was a line to get a table that stretched down the street!"}
{"text":"Poutine is one of those dishes that someone who doesnt eat meat, usually cant have. But thank you lord jesus, La Banquise has vegetarian and vegan options.  Line too long outside? go to the pick up window and get your food a bit quicker. after a sloppy night of drinking, even at 3 am this place is packed.  for about $10, i got the vegetarian gravy with cheese option. i had to tapp out about half way throught because i felt myself slipping into that coma i love sometimes. it was so tasty, and greasy for sure. guess what? it tastes even better the next day!"}
{"text":"This poutine spot is open 24/7 which made it perfect for post party/late night eats. La Banquise serves pretty classic poutine, local beer, and some interesting poutine combos. It gets pretty busy on weekends and late nights and is pretty much the standard for classic poutine here in Montreal.  It's on my top 3 poutinaries, not my number one but I do enjoy bringing newbies to Montreal here because it's a cool experience (and perfect for soaking up alcohol)."}
{"text":"Famous poutine spot to try after a drinking night out in Montréal. Poutines are over the top and messy with many ingredients, but still very delicious.   Unless you are sharing with someone, get a regular. If you want to share, then the large sizes are perfect for you.  The Sud-Ouest poutine was intense. Poutine was topped with bacon, red onions, guac, chipotle sauce, annnd onion rings! I felt like I was inhaling grease as I was eating it. It could have used a bit more bacon, but then again, any dish could use more bacon.   Place is cash-only so come with some change. There's an ATM machine inside if you don't mind the fees. Restaurant is also a tourist-trap so it gets filled quickly and you may need to wait in line if you come during a busy hour. Seating is available for large crowds!"}
{"text":"After hearing so much about it... it was so... meh I've had better poutine in Berkeley at Smoke's. The gravy here (though at least it was vegetarian) was so overly sweet and tasted like it came from a packet. The fries themselves were fine, not quite crispy. Huge portions and not too pricey, at least. The cheese curds were pretty good and squeaky, at least. I would do a little more research and fine better poutine next time though."}
{"text":"ouvert 24h, Généreuse portion de poutine , plein de saveurs délicieuse MAIS...  vaut-elle l'attente dehors a la sortie des bars,  en hiver ? .. je ne crois pas.  critique mitigée :   Avec les nouveaux restos de poutine récemments ouverts en ville comme poutineville, je crois que la banquise perd de son attrait. Même avec ses heures d'ouvertures alléchantes et sa délicieuse portion de frites & sauces variées, je n'attendrais pas dehors.  En fait, j'attend très rarement, je hais les line-up. Il faut que ça vaille VRAIMENT la peine, et franchement,  non. pas pour la banquise.   Par contre, la sélection de sauces est impressionnante... et la portion est gigantesque, pour le prix. Dur de faire mieux ! Si c'est pas trop plein , ex : un mercredi fin d'apres-midi en basse saison, je vais aller me régaler, c'est sur ! Le personnel est courtois et serviable !"}
{"text":"Horrible. Waited one hour for our food, when it came it was cold ! Cheese sticks, pogo sticks, poutine and service were all horrible. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Not the best poutine in Montreal.. but the most popular place. They have a big variety of toppings and theyre open late, so thats a good thing. But theres always a line and not so much sauce and cheese in my opinion. Not the best fries either. Try Paulo & Suzanne instead"}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by a friend of mine but unfortunately my visit fell flat.   The service was good and prompt, the decor and music were nice. Boyfriend got the Mexican poutine and I got the Asterix poutine. They were nice but nothing to write home about, somewhat unremarkable. For my taste, not enough cheese.   It was very busy; we went around 4pm and the place was nearly full. They have a small selection of some local beer, and they have their own house beer (a pilsner).   I'd imagine the poutine would be better at 2am after some drinks, seeing that this place is a 24 hour restaurant."}
{"text":"i have no idea why this place gets more than 2 stars. if you absolutely must fulfill the need to chuzzle down deep-fried whatever covered in something after a long evening-night-morning of drinking then line up. otherwise you have no excuse for eating here. noting that i went here (three times) drunk and was still disappointed. and i heart poutine in almost any form."}
{"text":"This has probably been the best poutine I have ever tasted! I am not a really big fan of fries and haven't really explored my options in Montreal or Toronto (where I live!) so I can not give it a full 5 stars.   I don't remember the name but I got the poutine with avocado, cheese and sour cream, and it was absolutely delightful! A bigger portion than what I expected with the ingredients stacked on top of each other making it easier to eat with all equal amounts of dips.   It was really filling that I couldn't finish it all, so I had to box the rest. This was the perfect introduction to Montreal poutine. A must try!"}
{"text":"I've had poutine in Montreal previously, but this has blown all the other places away. The classic poutine from this place is AMAZING, and I have been daydreaming about it since I left. These fries were crisp, the gravy was flavorful, and the cheese curds were squeeky. Definitely worth the wait, but they also have a fast line to the left for those who do not want to eat in. Till we meet again..."}
{"text":"La Banquise will always be a recommendation I give to first-timers in Montreal - delicious poutine and open 24/7!  I ordered La Matty and my boyfriend ordered La Reggae, both of which were delicious. It is definitely more expensive poutine, but well worth it for the amount of food you get and the ingredients they add. I actually preferred La Reggae because of the guac and it was somewhat lighter than La Matty. I would definitely recommend something with a guacamole or sour cream topping.   The only reason La Banquise loses a star is because it is ALWAYS busy. Expect to wait at least 30 minutes for a seat inside. The place is very casual and has a very generic interior, but great for groups. However, I ONLY recommend being seated at the restaurant for the patio during the summer.   Tip: To avoid the line, order it to go and head over to a nearby park or back to your place (it's really not that nice inside, so you're not missing out on much!)."}
{"text":"Definitely a place worth trying, however I don't particularly enjoy the type of fries they use for their poutines. Other than that, it's good! They have some good options for poutine toppings!"}
{"text":"There was a line but I was quickly served. This place has a very large variety of poutine but most importantly they have GLUTEN FREE gravy for the poutine. So yay! I was actually able to have poutine in Canada. It was very good, I can't say if this is the best there is but what I can say is it's gluten free and there is a large variety of styles."}
{"text":"If you're looking to try poutine, La Banquise is a great place to do it. Their poutine menu has around 20 different options, some vegetarian and some meat-based. My friend and I had La Rachel (peppers, mushrooms and onions) and La Taquise (guacamole, sour cream and tomato) and both were great. It was definitely a lot of food, so come hungry enough to finish your entree since poutine doesn't make for good leftovers.   While I loved the outdoor seating, I thought it was strange that their liquor license does not allow them to serve alcohol on the patio, only indoors. It would definitely be in their interest to get this corrected."}
{"text":"Definitely a poutine-worthy spot. Not my favorite poutine, but their selection is astounding! Open 24hrs - makes for a great midnight snack cause munchies are life!!"}
{"text":"D-e-l-c-i-o-u-s-! But I died after eating it. It's really heavy food, but so good. I didn't want to leave any left over! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We were seated pretty quickly and served in a timely fashion.. it was pretty busy.   There is so much variety and options. I ordered a regular sized poutine with onions .. pretty damn good! I stuffed my face at 11 in the morning, I didn't eat till about 9. Do not order the burger and poutine combo.. it's way too much.  Sodium Intake - Check Stomach Satisfied - Check  My life is complete.  That is all."}
{"text":"This is my favourite poutine place in Montreal and it's the one place I always recommend people stop by if they're visiting the city. I've tried la savoyarde and la festival, both extremely delicious. Portions are huge - I always got regular size and still had leftovers to take away. The outside seating area in the back is also really nice when the weather is good."}
{"text":"Another gem of Montreal, but rather this gem is caked with mud. A small restaurant that is steamy, tight, and not so pleasing to the eye. We had a big group in and had a horrible time communicating or even getting up. Washrooms weren't so great and the place was a very loud, humid, and steamy air to it. But in spite of an aesthetic failure, why were people still lining up in the fridge winter air? The poutine here is UNBELIEVABLE!!!! The one of the best foods I have every had and no doubt the best poutine on this planet!  Cheap, heavy, filling, and of course tasty. The T-Rex satisfied me in more ways then one. Definitely a landmark in poutine and Montreal eatery. A must if your in Montreal!!!!"}
{"text":"Best poutine in Montreal! The staff is friendly, the service is rapid and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing poutine! The portions are huge and every topping choice sounds delicious. I stuck with the hot dog poutine with extra cheese curds and I was not disappointed. Reviews were saying long lines and we waited about 10 minutes for a table at 2am."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't get the hype. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but I definitely preferred Frite Alors.   We went around 2 on a dreary Saturday and waited for about an hour. My assumption is there's always a wait no matter what time it is, so plan for that. They do do takeout and there's a park a block away, so on a nice day that's probably a more pleasant option.   We were just there for a midday snack so we shared a regular with bacon. The gravy was thick and weirdly sweet - not to my liking. The cheese curds and fried were good - no complaints there. But the bacon was the lame, precooked kind. A definite disappointment. I think the highlight was (surprisingly for how busy they were) the service. Our waitress came back twice to check on us, made sure we got water, our food, and the check in a timely manner."}
{"text":"For my first trip to Montreal and my first time trying poutine, this had to be the place for me to go. Read alot of reviews both here and else where, and despite the haters that come out to bash popular spots, my gf and I made our way here from downtown on a saturday afternoon. It was packed, but a table for two only required a wait of a few minutes.  Friendly people up front and also our waitress. We both ordered La Classique for our first poutine and were not disappointed. While I have to admit it was exactly what I expected, it was quite good and filling for a lunch meal. Would definitely be back on my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Favorite place in Montreal. Easy 5 stars.  Food: 5/5 Classic Poutine and selections are great! Service: 5/5 Extremely friendly. Environment: 5/5 Very fun dive bar interior.  Washrooms: 3.5/5 They have 3. One is always bad. Pick again! Worth it?: 5/5 Great snack while at the market.  This place is easily my favorite place in Montreal. I was here 3 times during a 3 day trip to Montreal. The breakfast is as expected. Nothing too fancy. I would say pass on the breakfast menu and go straight to the good stuff.   All the poutine flavors are spectacular. Classic is always a safe choice. I particularly liked the reggae poutine. That paired with a grilled cheese was my breakfast on my last day in town.   It is not busy during the day but the line starts to build at night. It is very popular among locals. Consider doing takeout if you don't want to wait. They have a great systems for that.   Great place and a great time. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is around my third time here. Great place to come after midnight... For a fatty temptation with friends or even alone. I arrived at 1am on a Tuesday, still a hand full of people at the resto. My waitress was very kind and accommodating... Service was great and I had no issues. I ordered the miam poutine. Fries were Greasy yet crunchy just how I like them... With that sweet&salty taste. This is my favourite poutine because  it's like a sweet and salty. I enjoyed how the Suisse cheese goes so well with meats and fries.... And I normally don't enjoy healthy food combined in my junk food... But man I loved the extra flavour the tomatoes brought to my poutine. Overall, I left satisfied."}
{"text":"I finally visited La Banquise a few days ago after continuously postponing my Rendez-vous galant with diabetes and impending morbid obesity for a few months.  I shared, with a friend that seemed to have been guilt stricken after the meal, a large T-Rex with one hot dog each. The service wasn't remarkable nor was it slow. We were seated quickly and swiftly by a friendly waitress that seemed to know only very rudimentary English. She's hardly to blame since it's located on Le Plateau and half of the residents there look at me like a booger is hanging out of my nose whenever I start a conversation in English.  The meat happened to be better than the actual poutine. The fries were above average but there were more stretchers in the restaurant than there were bits of cheese in my poutine. In my honest opinion, the gravy was inferior to many places I've been to. It wasn't anything close to the thick petroleum tar you get at Decarie Hotdog but it was cheap, thick and tasteless.  The meat was in substantial quantity and it felt like they neglected the rest of the poutine because of it. The hot dogs are cheap and most likely came from Super C's 8 for 2$ packages that sit on shelves for months before a poor sod tests his luck at not getting an indigestion.  The selection of poutine is huge though. You'll find one for you.  The atmosphere and ambiance is nice. Everyone was happy, the restaurant is cozy and surprisingly well aerated for such a small place. We sat approximately 5m away from the kitchen fryers and the air heavy with grease.  Kudos on it being 24 hours though.  This is honestly more of a tourist attraction than anything."}
{"text":"Very good service! Really enjoyed spending my time there. Good food and beautiful experience"}
{"text":"My first poutine experience in Montreal and this did not disappoint. We showed up at a weird hour between lunch and dinner hoping there wouldn't be a line and we were right. We had initially wanted to dine in but the line looked deceivingly long so we placed an order for take out and ate at a nearby park. The wait felt long but our buzzer finally went off and we grabbed our poutine and almost ran to the park. The gravy was a good consistency, fries were a good texture (not too soggy) and the toppings were amazing. The cheese curds weren't melted but I liked them this way."}
{"text":"LA MEILLEURE POUTINE À MTL! c'est un incontournable!  Je ne suis jamais autant satisfaite d'une poutine autant qu' à la Banquise!  La poutine Taquise est tout simplement un délice avec tomates, guacamole et crème sûre!   Le service  est tres rapide,  alors il ne faut pas se décourager devant parfois un long line up!"}
{"text":"MMM! I finally went to La Banquise after being in Montreal for a year! You can't go wrong with their poutine! It was sooo good! They had so many options on their menu and I didn't know what to get. I stuck to the original poutine, but I was very curious about the guacamole on poutine so I got that as a side on my poutine. I didn't realize that the guacamole, tomatoes, sour cream poutine (Mexican Poutine I believe) did not include gravy. So eating my regular poutine with additional guacamole was definitely interesting. It wasn't as gross as it seems. It was actually quite tasty. I would say don't mix them like me unless you make the mistake of doing it or just love weird combinations of flavours. I definitely want to come back for their poutine with ground beef and onions! The line was pretty long. I came in with a group of 11 and they accommodated for us! The wait was about 20 minutes, but by the time we left the was a line out of the door and onto the street!   PS. Don't expect to eat anything healthy here. I had a friend who was running a half marathon the next day and he got a salad. Their salad was literally chopped up boston lettuce with a few cucumbers, carrots and tomatoes and a small packet of Kraft dressing."}
{"text":"J'ai mangé à La Banquise à plusieurs reprises, surtout en fin de soirée ou début de journée lol. Les poutines sont très bonnes, les frites faites maisons et il y a beeaauuucoup de choix ! Ce ne sont pas les moins chers à Montréal mais pour ceux qui veulent de la variété et des options, vous êtes au bon endroit :) Par contre à faire attention car à partir de 21:00 la ligne dehors peut être vraiment longue, dans ce cas là, je ne pense pas que ça en vaut la peine, il y a tellement d'autres restos qui font de la poutine (Belle Pro, Pitarifique, Patati Patata, etc)"}
{"text":"Came here for the poutine, had the one topped with onions, green peppers and mushroom.  regular size is enough for 2 if you plan on snacking other food.  Prompt service and non-pushy servers."}
{"text":"Very casual place but super good. This place was recommended to me by a friend saying they had the best poutine... I don't have anything to compare it to but either way it was delicious! Service was good just really casual nothing fancy. We sat outside it was hot inside and outside but still nice. Seems to be that way in most places we went to in Montreal so we were accustomed to it at this point."}
{"text":"Restaurant parfait pour une poutine de qualité! Je conseille à tous les touristes qui veulent manger une poutine d'aller là."}
{"text":"Classic poutine was amazing. We were blown away by the options. Def a montreal must have!"}
{"text":"This review is based on a late night, after the bar feasting, which can sometimes skew my idea of good food. If you're looking for some good late night eating, this place is for you. If not, it still seemed like it was really good, but again, my disclaimer above.  They have a very large selection of poutines, with so many topping options, it's a little overwhelming. You will want to eat the whole menu, which we sort of tried to do the first night we were here. Six guys, and 4 large poutine orders. Fail. I think we only got through half. But every bit was soooo good.   I'd say a small order between two people would be sufficient. Or maybe a large between three people.   This place does get busy at night, and there is a two lines late night. One for take out and one for dine in, so make sure you get in the right line."}
{"text":"One of best poutine restos in Montreal! You name it, they have it: poutine with guacamole or hot dogs or smoked meat, and they are all yummy :) I've never had to wait in line and the service is quite speedy. Also, the smaller portion is more than enough for one person. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Poutine. Gravy, cheese, and fries. A combination so good that I planned my night around it. After many pitchers of beer, I had set things up so that my friends and I could stumble into this place. Granted, I barely remember getting there, but boy do I remember gobbling fries and screaming, \"Another order please!!!\"  Open all night, you will not find a better late night eats."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in my mouth was already watering and I could smell the deep frying smell from the street. My friends and I learned to take the Metro just to come here as part of our 3 day trip.   Each poutine is very rich with gravy and the portion of cheese on each one is very generous. My friend from Montreal suggested that we share as each portion is pretty filling and I was still full after just half a poutine!"}
{"text":"Well I have always know that poutine is best in Montreal, so I saved my first poutine experience for Montreal. But it turns out no so good..  To me poutine is just like a huge serving of fries, with meat sauce that is not so impressive but salty to me, and cheese. Sorry I really don't find it delicious...  I prefer fries to go with ketchup, and please don't give me so much fries one time... People at Montreal plz don't be mad at me XD. I promise to try it again if I visit there next time"}
{"text":"As a Quebecoise you must enjoy a great poutine, as a human being you must have a great poutine, no better place to get one is at La Banquise, I came here with a few of my friends on St.Jean our National holiday to celebrate our poutine addiction, there are an abundance of unhealthy choices just the way our Quebecois ancester's intended. I had the Fred Caillou and it was Yabba Delicieuse."}
{"text":"This place definitely turned me 100% into liking poutines! I never fully understood poutines until I tried this place,   I mean, it's just fries with toppings on it, what's the big deal? Then came T-Rex with all its meat and cheese curd. WOW. The large serving is so huge my husband & I could barely finish it! The place does not accept credit cards, just debit or cash. Thank goodness they accept US dollars. There is a bit of a wait, but it goes fast (we came around 9pm, Sunday). The seating is tight, we had to sit on a table right in front of the fire exit door. The downside is their service. They ask you to pay right away, right after you order (but this may be because our server was ready to go home from her shift?) and she assumed that the change from our $20 bill was for her to keep."}
{"text":"Every time I go I try something different, every time is great! They have very good beer too! I've gone to eat by myself several times and never felt alone, great place, wonderful food (very hot staff) wide selection of styles and they even have breakfast!. I'm going there now just for thinking about it."}
{"text":"First time I had poutine. Came on a super busy day. Everyone orders poutine here. The gravy was nice as well as the cheese curds. The fries were the best. I can see why it's so popular. However, CASH ONLY!!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the most famous poutine place in montreal. Open 24/7 and the line is, well, 24/7 as well.. 2 lines actually- one to sit there, and one to take away, where you get a device with your number once you placed your order, the device vibrates when it's ready for you to take. Wide variety of poutines, vegetarian or not, the price is about 10$ for the regular size, but you can also get the bigger one. They got some other stuff too- burgers and such, but we didn't try them.."}
{"text":"Cheap beers, open late. What more can you ask for? This place is an establishment and it is a pretty solid one at that. I must say though, service was pretty gruff.  Their poutine is awesome, can't really disagree with that, but you have to be into that to like this place. I recommend this place if you are super drunk and are craving deep fried super salty, fatty food."}
{"text":"For anyone in need of an introduction to poutine, go here. The servings are massive, and there are so many options to choose from. Reasonably busy, but understandably so as the food is excellent."}
{"text":"To be honest I wasn't really looking forward to trying poutine, only because I think fries shouldn't be soggy. But since we were in Canada we had to do it, and I'm glad we did. We got a regular size classic poutine (cheese curds and doused in gravy) to share. I wouldn't recommend eating one by yourself, you might have a heart attack by the end. It was pretty flavorful and the cheese curd/potato/gravy surprisingly worked.   Came during the day and even then there was a long line. Gets pretty crowded since the waiting area is small. And the bathroom was disgusting, but that is another story."}
{"text":"My favorite poutine in Montreal, hands down. Every kind is good! Whether you enjoy classic or funky - my personal favorite being the \"taquise\" (guacamole, tomatoes and sour cream) - this is the place to go if you've never tried one."}
{"text":"More poutine than anyone should be able to handle.   This spot is super intense. The poutine is loaded with so many different toppings, its hard to handle. That being said, its great - the cheese is tasty but not overly rich. The grazy is more of a light bbq sauce, which allows for more consumption. The fries are also very tasty - and if you put it all together, you get success.  (we also had a sandwich, which was completely unmemorable)"}
{"text":"I love the idea of this restaurant, however, my stomach hates it with a passion. Every time I've been here, I've been excited to try something new. However, the nauseating feeling I have upon departure is all too familiar from the time before. The fries are amazing, but seriously, something needs to be done about the copious amounts of oil in those things....Just writing this review is making me queasy....ugh."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurent à Poutine"}
{"text":"On my first night in Montreal I was looking for a late-night snack after drinking at a few places on Laurent. Not being from the area, I asked around and was told that Banquise had amazing Poutine. With two friends in tow, we made our way to La Banquise to find a line out the door (which usually means it's good or it's the only thing open). Thankfully for us the line moved quickly and the food was exactly what we were looking for. Two orders of T-Rex Poutine did the job.   I'm sure the heavy poutine is great any time of day, but I can't imagine it being any better than after a few beers."}
{"text":"On my third day in Montreal I came here.  My first poutine came on my first night in Montreal, late from the airport after nearly everything nearby had shut for the night.  This first poutine came from the mini-chain La Bell Province, which provided a solid introduction poutine, but right away I saw possibilities for this strange mix.  I read about this place in several poutine based sites, so I made the trip.  I had the Poutine Mart (sausage, bacon, mushrooms, with the regular cheese curds, gravy, and fries).  Wow.  Just to look at made my head spin:  it looked like a hot mess, and tasted great.  I might have gone with a little more curd (because I like that fondue aspect of the poutine when the cheese and gravy blend), but I enjoyed this thing.  My colleague ordered the Kamikaze (sausage with what southerners would call \"sweet mix:\"  marinated vegetables).  Both plates came loaded with food and left the table clean.  The staff did not seem to care for us:  perhaps we looked too much like what we were:  business people coming in for a late lunch.  We clearly did not have the cool of many of the other patrons.  This lack of cool seemed to bother the staff more than the patrons.  I am not an expert on poutine (yet), but I feel comfortable in adding my recommendation to coming here for the real poutine experience."}
{"text":"I had \"La Hot Dog\". Not the best poutine I've ever had; the curds were really rubbery and the fries were pretty soggy. They don't skimp on portions though so if you're hungry you'll be well taken care of. The table was stick and a bit gross, it was super crowded but service was good. Glad we visited but felt over full after too big a portion (regular size)."}
{"text":"I wasn't even that intoxicated when I arrived at La Banquise but even my sober self-knew that I was hungry and in need of some late night authentic poutine eats! We walked a fair distance in the middle of the night to find LB but man was I happy when we finally arrived. Admittedly, we couldn't see a sign for the shop, but the massive lineup(s) were definitely a beacon you could easily rely on to assure you, that you were in the right spot.  Yes, I did mention lineups plural because if you didn't know that this spot was a restaurant you'd think that between the two separate lines (one of takeout, one for dining in) and the 2-3 massive black t-shirt wearing bouncers, that you were outside of a popular nightclub.  The wait time to take out took forever. Not because they were slow, in fact, they were turning out orders pretty quick but the lineups were lengthy. After about 30-45 minutes it was finally my turn. Keeping it simple, I went with the Poutine Classique, just cheese curds, fries and gravy. I was so hungry by the time I ordered that I blacked out and ended up ordering the 'grande' aka large - big mistake, that is a massive 2 pounds of poutine.  I chowed down as much as I could but had to leave the rest sitting on my countertop once I got home. It was massive,  That said, the next morning should have been gross to even consider looking at the poutine leftovers, let alone eating them, but they totally held up and were friggen delicious!  Big fan of the food these guys are doing and looking forward to returning for some of their more intricate poutines!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"French fries topped with gravy and cheese curds. This simplistic yet classic dish that is a favorite of late night drinkers and partygoers originated in rural Quebec. La Banquise is arguably the mecca of this classic Quebecois dish and offers variations on it with countless toppings as far as the reasonable mind can think.  It's not uncommon to find lines well outside the door, especially late at night on weekends.  Though the carb/fat heavy nutritional composition of this dish is not what I would personally go for these days, it's an obligatory stop for anyone visiting Montreal - whether you've had poutine before or not.  There simply isn't a place where you'll find poutine of the sophisticated variety that you find at La Banquise."}
{"text":"Resto sympa souvent bondé. Ambiance populaire très agréable. Gouter la poutine pour un touriste français est une expérience à vivre. Compléter le plat d'une bière Boréale blonde. Envisager une bonne marche à pied au parc La Fontaine ou au Mont-Royal juste après.   A tester au mois une fois lors d'un séjour à Montréal."}
{"text":"Yes we were poutine virgins. But we are no more! A great casual place to eat poutine.   We had La Maddy with bacon and La Obelisk with smoked meat. Poor were great and plenty for 3 people."}
{"text":"On our last day we went here  After 4 days we ate pountine 4 days straight  I thought I would be sick of it but this is the best Poutine in the city   They are open 24 hours a day and have over 20 varieties of Poutine   We had the la Marty and we ordered a large and it fed 2 people   Come here for Poutine"}
{"text":"Best poutine in town! I had La Miam, which was fries, gravy and cheese curds (standard poutine) with ground beef, sausage, grilled onions, Swiss cheese, tomatoes and it was excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Très bonne poutine, j'ai testé la classique qui est très bonne. J'ai pris le taille \"normal\" qui était déjà très grande pour moi. Un bon rapport qualité prix ! Un restaurant que je conseille pour les grosses faims !  Really good poutine, I tried the classic one, it was really good. The size \"normal\" was really big for me, so this is a good rate price/quality. I recommend this place is you are really hungry !"}
{"text":"Too overrated, and honestly, a big disappointment! I was looking forward to my experience at la banquise impatiently! When you see the huge line you get even more excited! However the place from the inside is so packed, the service is horrible, and the food quality is just deplorable.  Sorry La Banquise, but you definitely did not impress."}
{"text":"Plus side: open 24 hrs Down side: fries feels a bit soggy.  Toppings: I loved the T-Rex. Good if you've been vegging out too much."}
{"text":"For poutine lovers, so many selection and huge portions! The curds are definitely different from your typical curd you would get from the grocery in ontario (Very squeeky). Fries are also cut thinner than your typical poutine fries."}
{"text":"Quick Summary: Delicious, inventive, and very big plates!  Poutine has made a recent surge in the American dining scene with all sorts of varietys, but if you want to see how it's really supposed to be done you've got to come here. The plates are HUGE and packed full of flavor. The variety is awesome and has a little bit of something for everyone!  I've been to Montreal 2x in the last few years and each visit has been accompanied with a stop here, and I have not been disappointed. I'm amazed at how much they put on each plate! The quality too is excellent nice crispy fries with loads of delicious toppings. There's just so much to choose from!  Schwartz is a classic and a must, but this place better be number 2 on your list of must visit in Montreal!"}
{"text":"We had no idea what poutine is. A friend told us that this dish is a must have when you are in Montreal. So we followed his recommendation to eat the best poutine in Montreal here. The food was amazing, very filling but soo tasty. Personally I preferred the poutine with guacamole, tomatoes and sour creme. The service was really nice. There seems to be always a cue, but you get pretty quickly a new table."}
{"text":"On aime qu'il soit ouvert 24h. Choix très variés de Poutine. À l'heure qu'on y va, il y a toujours une file d'attente. On les prend souvent pour emporter. Celui avec la B.O.M. Et les trois Amigos sont mes préférées. Les frites sont excellentes mais peut-être un peu moins que Ashton ;)"}
{"text":"Had our poutine initiation here. Looked like your typical eatery in the US. Didn't like how we could see many food debris on the floor. Anywhoo....  We ordered the original. Just as expected it was a big slob of  fries with curds of cheese  so much excitement..so much disappointment.   Fries were too dark for my liking, soft, not crispy. The cheese was not a good compliment  Maybe I'm just being a food snob. I like the concept of the dish, but would rather the elements be of better quality. For this place, we should added a meat to the dish to make it acceptable."}
{"text":"Food is great portion for classic French food. Bistro style. It is not kid friendly though. No diaper change station and too many stairs for the stroller. Dishes were very tasty but it's not out of the world greatness."}
{"text":"No trip of Canada is complete without a serving of poutine and this place doesn't disppoint, ordered La Taquise which is a guacamole based combo, and La Folie (which we enjoyed more)."}
{"text":"Great selection, fair prices and top quality.  This place is open 24 hours and I went there on a Monday around 2 a.m. the place was oddly packed!  So many people all enjoying a new spin on a traditional dish!   I personally prefer Poutineville and its a bit closer to the downtown core where I live but if I am in the area I will stop by again.  Give it a shot!  What do you got to lose??"}
{"text":"I'm definitely not a poutine connoisseur nor am I the biggest poutine fan in general but La Banquise was an experience. The menu had tons of variety which was nice. There really is something for everyone and every craving! The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable.  I love that the restaurant is open 24 hours--poutine is THE best thing to have post-bar/club. That being said, I wouldn't come here during normal business hours. It's a little hyped but when nothing else is open or you're winding down from a night out, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Absolute best poutine I have ever had! Tried La T-Rex large portion... It was gigantic and delicious. Worth the cab ride over. So many options to pick from, including vegan ones for those with food restrictions. Definitely a memorable part of the Montreal trip. Good to know that the place does not take credit cards (bank machine inside)."}
{"text":"La Banquise seems to be a popular poutinerie and some friends recommended it for poutine. Since I love fries, why not? We made the trek to La Banquise and the street was quiet due to the snow and construction, but everyone who was out were headed to this restaurant!  There was a line but it moved quickly. You can see the kitchen near the entrance spewing out poutines. There are two sizes available, regular and large, and let me tell you that a regular is quite big!   We got seated and the tables are quite close together so prepare to get cozy with your table neighbours. We ordered a regular to share since we had just eaten lunch. The toppings, gravy and cheese curds were good but not mindblowing. The most disappointing part was that all the fries were soggy (and it's not because of the gravy), which I didn't understand because the kitchen was mainly churning out poutines so I expected the fries to be fresh.  Not too memorable for me, but maybe just the quality dropped when we went. Other people here on Yelp had better experiences."}
{"text":"La Banquise capitalizes on the best \"greatest thing ever since sliced bread,\" by combining delicious poutine and around-the-clock service.   Compared to the poutine-savvy, Quebecois population of Montréal, my poutine knowledge is slightly lacking at best -- other than the fact that I know how to pronounce it correctly, I've only had it a few times in my life at bars and restaurants that serve it as a niche menu item/appetizer because well, it's incredibly easy and cheap to make (Put together scraps of a chef salad, a burger entrée, and a faux-thanksgiving meal and voila! Poutine.)  Despite me being a novice to the cuisine, I can tell when my taste buds are telling me if I'm eating something crotch-grabbingly delicious, in the same way my ocular nerves are telling me that I'm being exposed to something that \"shocks [my] conscience,\" (that's Rochin v. California (1953) for us yanks, Canada v. Schmidt (1987) for you canucks) and Poutine La Banquisois was one that definitely left me in shock and awe.  As per recommendations, I ordered La Classique and the T-Rex with a friend. Even before I had a chance to get half way through my can of Coke Diete, the two massive plates of fries and assorted meats, piled up to heaven with cheese curd and golden brown gravy graciously descended onto our table from the very attractive server's hands and was staring us right in the face.  For those of you familiar with Frank Yang and his irresponsible culinary escapades, (the one where he eats over 4000 calories in a few hours for the sake of bulking) there has not been a better \"eat me, eat me!\" moment in my life both on and off the dinner table so far.  Disgusting visual images aside, cheap and delicious poutine in a very relaxed atmosphere, served around-the-clock by beautiful women in the beautiful city of Montréal. Consider me a fan."}
{"text":"Best poutine in Montreal! Definitely be ready to wait in an hour long line up for a table but I promise it's worth it. Squeaky cheese curds and great gravy paired with tasty fries and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Best poutine in town. Friendly place with a fast service; when it is crowded, though, you could be asked to leave the place immediately after you finish."}
{"text":"The go-to spot for poutine in Montreal, it seems. There's a reason they have the reputation. On a cold day, or when staving off the effects of overindulgence at one of the many local pubs, what could be better than a plate of fries with cheese curds, brown gravy, and whatever meat or veg you want with it? I don't recommend getting the large platter; the standard is sufficient, unless you're planning to hibernate. The service and the space are great here, too."}
{"text":"My first trip to Montreal and this was the one place that appeared on everyone's recommendation list. It was my last night so I had to go. Took took a 20 minute metro and a walk to find it but it was well worth it! Had to go with the classic with extra curds. We're the curds squeaky? Damn rights, the Poutine was delicious! My friend had the pepper gravy, wow that was amazing too. It's a must go for sure."}
{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  What an absolute disappointment of a place!  I don't think I have ever had such a negative experience at an eatery in my life.  It started off fine. We were seated in the outside patio area (which is cute and saves you from the stuffiness of the interior seating). The waitress was friendly enough. I let her know that I don't eat beef but liked some of the flavour combos with beef and so was going to substitute the beef for merguez sausage which I told was lamb. So I ordered the La Reggae substituting the beef for merguez sausage and after a 30 minute wait I got my poutine, with merguez sausage and beef!! So when I bought up the issue to her, she looked confused and asked me  what I wanted with the biggest dose of attitude. She kept insisting that I had asked for both beef and marguez sausage which was astonishing. Then she disappeared.  After about 15 minutes another waitress came over, after I flagged her down. I explained the situation that I don't eat beef and that I wanted the La Reggae with the sausage instead. She then informs me that the sausage is also beef. OK! Well then I asked for the La Reggae with bacon. Keep in mind that this was now altogether more than 1 hour since we had come in and my friend was almost done her poutine. Not an word of apology. No sense of urgency. Nothing.  I chalked it up to a miscommunication. But my bff who speaks French said that it was pretty clear that I said I didn't eat beef, so there was no way the 1st waitress should have mistaken that for an addition and not substitution.  Twenty minutes later, I got my La Reggae with bacon and when I say bacon, you literally could not see the bacon, even after I moved around the fries and the mountain of guacamole. So after trying to flag down the waitress for another 10 minutes, I asked her where the bacon was. She proceeds to point at a shard of bacon in the guac and says that \"There is the bacon, when you substitute you get 3 pieces of bacon.\" This was opposed to the heaping mountain of bacon you get if you just order the cheaper La Bacon which people around me had. Don't you think that would have been pertinent information to maybe tell a customer!?!? The attitude was just flowing out of this waitress like you could not imagine. I tried explaining the situation again and pointed out that I'd been here 1.5 hours trying to get my order right and was told \"what you want me to do\". To say that I controlled my anger in that situation and left ASAP after paying $13 for mushy fries under a mountain of tasteless guac, would be an understatement.  Now my friend who had her order arrive properly, was also very underwhelmed. She used to worked in McDonalds back in her youth and told me that the dark color of the fries are due to reusing old oil which is very unhealthy. She found the poutine to be average at best.  I feel like that this place is a tourist trap, counting of their high reviews as a way of lowering service standards.  I had much better poutine at the A&W afterwards."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about here. There's always a gigantic line-up of twenty-somthing hipsters waiting to get in. The couple of times I have been it was average to slightly better than average. it's crowded."}
{"text":"One of the best poutines I have ever had was here. Luckily when I arrived there was hardly a line but the place was packed! Service was quick, however our waitress didn't speak English to us which would be hard for tourists but it was fine with me."}
{"text":"I think I died and went to poutine heaven. Had the Classic, Veggie, and Dance. All were excellent, though I would go back for the Dance and the Classic. Three large portions were (almost) enough to satisfy three very hungry people.  Make sure you have cash ahead of time - their ATM was not working when we went, and the nearest one is in some weird bar down the street."}
{"text":"Their burgers/sandwiches is the only thing I think may be worth coming back for. We got the classic poutine with the Montreal burger (which maybe should be called sandwich since there isn't a beef patty, all smoked meat), and the chèvre burger. I liked the chèvre burger as I thought it was well-balanced and the bun was nicely toasted. Funny enough we both agree their smoke meat sandwich is better than Swartz. However, we both agree the poutine was meh. Their fries were unflavourful, gravy was unmemorable and the cheese curds/fries ratio was pretty off. In my opinion this place is way overrated. If you want a really good poutine I'd recommend Gibeau Orange Julep.  Also, just a heads up you must pay in advance if you go after 9pm. Also no alcohol in patio after a certain time. Nice that they offer kombucha as a drink option though.   Food - 3/5 Service - 3/5 Atmosphere - 4/5"}
{"text":"This place is (to me) THE place I have to go to, every time I got up to Montréal.  I just love poutine, and theirs is fantastic.  I love that they have clever names for all the different varieties of poutine that they offer.  The service, whether for sit-down or takeaway, is excellent, with cheerful and friendly employees every time I've been there (five or so times).   I can't wait to go back again, it is so excellent!"}
{"text":"This was the place that converted me on poutine!  Never understood it before I tried La Banquise.  Slowly working my way through the extensive and delicious menu.  All of them have been great so far: t-rex, BOM, mart, reggae, probably a few others I'm forgetting right now. Amazing as post bar food, great any time of day"}
{"text":"Classic late night poutine spot of the Montreal area and almost always busy. Been here a few times on my travels but visited Christmas 2017 last. Came by here late at night on an extremely cold -27 night and the line up was still out the door. Enjoyed a delicious poutine with smoked meat, pepper gravy, herbs and sour cream that was so good! Food came out quickly and staff was pretty good considering how packed it was. Very laid back and casual ambience that is good for friends or bringing in the family. A big menu with other dishes aside from just poutine but obviously a specialty shop with really good poutine to choose from. Only thing is alcohol is a little overpriced I paid $8 for a 250ml cider that I thought was a bit much. Also they have a maple syrup infused cola to try if you love a taste of home and don't mind the sugar rush!!"}
{"text":"Unliike Scwartz's, which rest on the laurels of is reputation for smoked meat and merely goes through the motions, La Banquise (french for \"the ice floe\", which is weird) really is the best mainstream poutine in Montreal. Definitely worth trying. I recommend the peppercorn gravy.  However, it loses one star from me because of the stressful dining experience. You have to line up for a long time after 6pm, pre-pay for your food later at night (their way to combat dine-and-dash), and, because of the perpetual queue outside, you feel immense pressure to eat quickly and GTFO. Funny thing: legend has it that the restaurant hurts property values in the vicinity because of the intense grease smell that permeates within a two-block radius. Those who work there probably put on weight by just breathing the air near the kitchen.  If you want poutine that is almost as good, with a much more relaxed atmosphere and a better drink list, try Poutineville. Despite the tacky name, they do a great job, too."}
{"text":"OK. So I had been looking forward to trying this place for months. MONTHS. Ever since I had planned my family's trip to Montreal, I knew that I was going to come here and have my first poutine. I could. not. wait.  We finally get here. My husband, me, and our two kids, one of whom is about 2 years old. We waited about 20 minutes on line. (Got there a bit before 6 pm.) I got to peruse the amazing poutine menu and fantasize about all of the different ways I could enjoy my first poutine. Should I go classic? Mexican? Italian? Veggie? Meat-fest? And then came the magic moment when we were told that there was a table for us. Yes, yes, yes. Here we go.    The 2-year-old basically became possessed as soon as we sat down at the table. Menus were placed in front of us. The 2-year-old swatted them right to the floor. The nice waitress brought over a kids menu with games and a jar of crayons. The 2-year-old alternatively threw the crayons on the floor, put some in his mouth, and then knocked over his water. And screamed and cried. Other restaurant patrons looked over to assess who exactly was destroying their dining experience. The waitress came over and apologized in advance for what would be a long wait for food as there were some complications in the kitchen that night. If ever I wished that a spaceship would materialize and suck me up into the night sky...  We order. Four small poutines among us of different varieties. I choose a classic and a veggie version to share with the 2-year-old, figuring that one of those will satisfy his discriminating tastes. We wait for the poutine. The 2-year-old has become a heartless monster, hell-bent on destroying the atmosphere of the entire restaurant. So many things are flying off the table at this point, I can't even keep track. We resort to trying to distract him by giving him salt and pepper to taste. He likes it. What the...  The poutine comes. Oh   my    gahhhhhhhhh, it looks so good. I take a bite. It tastes soooo good. I just want to dig in and stay in that moment forever. I am there. And then I am not, because the 2-year-old starts throwing poutine on the floor. So the rest of us basically cram poutine into our face holes as quickly as we can, ask for to-go boxes for the rest, and beat it out of there, not daring to look at any of the other patrons.  Sigh.  The next day my husband took the kids for the day. I heated up all of the leftover poutine and enjoyed it by myself. In peace and quiet."}
{"text":"This place is a restaurant known for its poutine. I give the poutine 5 stars, and the restaurant 4 stars. The beer selection leaves something to be desired, and the service was just a little bit slow (fast enough to warrant 4 stars). The menu has a bunch of different selections of poutine, and my wife and I both only finished half of our \"regular size,\" because we were so full.   I repeat: I only give it 4 stars due to the things besides the poutine, if you are looking for great poutine, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Was in montreal on a roadtrip and I was really excited for la banquise because of the hype. We were seated out in the patio/garden area on a nice day. Poutine was decent, but not noteworthy. Good selection, but would I come back? Probably not."}
{"text":"We have absolutely no clue what's the big deal about this local Montreal dish Poutine, but decided to try it cause people raved about it and the Montrealanians were super proud about this. First thing when u enter this place the awful smell of fresh hits u so hard, it wud have been good if we made a U turn from there but we also waned to be adventurous on our first trip first say out in Montreal, so we headed back into their so called outdoor space with all plastic maple trees n plastic plants n flowers which was the 2nd blow. But again decided to be patient n ordered one of their dish from their extraordinaries La Folie n to our disbelief it was one of the most disgusting thing we had eaten. Greasy as hell, well we should have known it.... Potato fries/ French fries topped with some sauce, corn, cheese, sour cream, sausage, onion n peppers..... Who eats lumpu, limpy, soggy fries.....well u get the picture right. I know it's a local favorite, but sorry it does not appeal to many people n travelers to Montreal please be aware n don't fall into the Poutine trap, if u want to try, go on a full stomach, so u don't end up eating this bad food. If you are someone like us try just for the heck of it but don't even think of finishing it, cause am sure you won't. There are many foods to try when in Montreal, so it's ok to give this a skip. Oh n did we mention, it looks disgusting too"}
{"text":"Best poutine you will ever have! They have so many options and two different sizes, so bring a group to try a few types!"}
{"text":"Minus one star only for the funky interior, but the sweet potato burrito is pretty darned good!  The outside was super-crispy, but it held together. Very tasty!  The music for mid-week mid-day lunch is perfect: good music, decent volume so you can both hear the music and whoever you're eating with!  The staff (or was he an owner/partner?) was engaged and into his work. He explained that the trick is to get the outside crispy whole keeping the tortilla together: timing.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My BFF loves pootin.  Oh yes he does.  Fancy or dirty, he'll gobble it up.  So I thought it best I share this thing I heard.  See, there's this rumour, and like all great rumours it stuck.  Whether it be true or not is up to the individual.  Seeing as this is my blog, ergo I am the individual, I am here to call the rumour false.  They say La Banquise is one of the best, if not best places for poutine.  That statement is false.    La Banquise serves poutine 24 hours a day.  That statement is true.  This diner is a favourite for many, likely because of that, and not because they serve the best.  Their poutine is okay.  There are many, many, many choices, and that in and of itself is great.  You can have poutine with merguez sausage, with smoked meat, with turkey and peas, etc.  Basically, you can get it with a whole lot of something or with nothing at all.  Your choice.  After a long day of shopping I wanted a snack so I got myself the Elvis: beef, mushrooms and green peppers.   I ate it all, but don't I always.  It was good but Frite Alors is still my favourite.  Nobody messes with me and my frites."}
{"text":"Poutine, poutine, poutine!   Is it worth braving a cold Quebec winter night to wait in a long line with fellow drunks outside of a diner just for fries with cheese curds and gravy?  With more than 25 poutines including vegetarian options, it was a tough choice.   Of course, we started with the $6.25 La Classique (small) - just fries, curds, and gravy.  We added the $7.90 La Elvis (small) - ground beef, green peppers, and mushrooms - because the Smart Pants Canadian Cousin is dating Elvis.  (Literally, the boytoy's legal name is Elvis, and I'm dating the Queen of Hearts.)  The curds were soft, the gravy was hot, and the fat fries were crispy and didn't get soggy too fast.  Even the small portion was generous for one, and it's worthwhile as a fry lover to come with a big group to try more.  Sadly, the bières were pricey at $5.  Ça va faire une maudite poutine, mais je veux poutine tout de suite!"}
{"text":"Good variety of poutine. Nice selection of craft beers as well. Loud and busy place, but good vibe. We had the La Folie with spicy sausage."}
{"text":"Lined up for poutine ( the Rachel ) there were close to twenty type of poutine . It did not disappoint !!! Their beer selection is good too . Came back for some take aways next day and ordered veggie burgers and cheese burgers. One of the yummiest burgers( both)  I have eaten ! Loved the place , it runs like a well oiled machine. Be prepared to wait especially for the dine in. The bar next door allows you to order and bring food from here it would be an option too. ( wait times - upto an hour on weekends with potential to be longer) Got my poutine fix just here and it was exceptional !  They have an ATM inside too."}
{"text":"Grabbed take-out poutines with friends for lazy New Years Day dinner (not much else was open and would take walk-ins), and was pleasantly surprised by the variety and amount of flavour. The three large poutines were each an entire large square take-out box, and good to the last bite. Would definitely go again! Similar to other tourist spots in the city, definitely go for take-out as opposed to dine-in."}
{"text":"Great place for poutine! If you're coming to Montreal for poutine, this is the place to go, and definitely worth the wait. Hipster-bohemian vibe, open 24 hours. Be Prepared as they accept only cash and Canadian debit. The young waitress serving us was absolutely friendly and polite, a sincere smile and thank you goes a long way!"}
{"text":"Waited 1.5 hours in 35F for french fries w/ gravy + cheese curds.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband while in town on our \"mini-moon\".  We took a food tour through Airbnb and this was one of the stops.  While I'm not the biggest fan of poutine, this was the best poutine I've had.  Being from Chicago, I'm used to \"Wisconsin\" poutine which is really just fried cheese curds on fries with gravy so I was pleasantly surprised to see non-fried cheese curds and plenty of topping options.  Definitely worth trying if you're in Montreal!"}
{"text":"So after hearing all of the hype and everyone telling us it's the BEST place for poutine..... we were a bit disappointed. We got the poutine to go, which may have been our mistake. It was the last day there and we were literally packed up to go and decided to make a stop before our long travel home. I got the corn dog poutine, and I guess the server misheard me because they only put corn dogs and nothing else...no onion or bacon as they list on the menu. And it was SO soggy, not crunchy at all like I've had at every other place. I should have checked. But then my boyfriends chicken poutine had a really weird taste like the chicken was cooked in a sauce that was completely different from the gravy and it was so off... strange.   We would definitely go back and try it again, take our time and order a few. It was super busy so we were rushing too. I'll give it another try for sure.   The gravy was delicious though."}
{"text":"La liste du menu est super. Quand tu as vraiment envie de te bourrer la face dans une poutine c'est le paradis. L'ennui c'est qu'il y à souvent des gens qui attendent en bande alors c'est un peu long avant de manger. Toujours un 10 ou 15 minutes d'attente."}
{"text":"Came as a tourist, it was worth the bus and walking trip, great place to try Poutine, lots of variety.  I wasn't sure at first  I'd make meal of just poutine but indeed it was good and filling. Apparently this can be very crowded for dinner or late night,  we came for lunch on a sunny weekday, still pretty busy but not overly crowded.  Wait staff was attentive and nice.  We couldn't eat outside in the garden  if we were having a beer, didn't get why, it was a small sacrifice, the food made up for it."}
{"text":"Was a bit crowded but seemed like everyone liked the place and was happy. I usually don't like huge crowds because large amounts of people make me angry but this was ok. Service was good, fast, and the food was great. Get the traditional poutine, it's the best."}
{"text":"Este es, según dicen, el mejor lugar de poutine de todo Montreal. Es barato y tiene un ambiente informal. Hay un poco de espera, supongo que eso demuestra la popularidad del local. No puedo comparar la calidad del poutine con la de otro lugar porque era mi primera vez probando este plato. Sólo voy a decir que era rico pero, por lejos, no fue la mejor comida de mi vida. La atención fue correcta. Te cobran antes de traer la comida y sólo se puede pagar efectivo o con tarjeta de débito canadiense."}
{"text":"En voilà un endroit bien touristique!!! Mais ils ont le chic de vous servir une vraie bonne poutine!  Après quelques minutes à faire la file sur le trottoir, nous nous glissons à l'intérieur et pouvons déjà admirer les énormes assiettes de poutine agrémentées d'un tas de \"topping\". Une table pour 2? oui nous, nous sommes seulement deux et hop, après une dizaine de minutes, nous voilà installées.  Pour moi, ce sera une poutine avec oignons et poivrons tandis que mon amie, qui n'a pas froid aux yeaux, opte pour le trois fromages.  Après seulement quelques minutes, nos poutines arrivent et là c'est l'extase. les frites sont bien charnues et cuites comme il se doit, les oignons caramélisés et le fromage fondant. Enfin bref, une vraie poutine. Ce qui fait de la banquise plus qu'un resto à touriste, c'est un incontournable de la poutine!!!!"}
{"text":"Had wanted to try this place for quite a while, so when a rush trip to the Ulysse travel bookstore found me at the corner of Rachel and St-Denis at suppertime yesterday with all my chores done, I decided that supper was going to be poutine.  Showing up at 1730 hrs on a Saturday, I was thinking that Montrealers don't eat this early and I'd have no problem getting a seat.  Well, I was wrong.  There was already a short line inside the door, and the place was heaving- with children.  Seems that parents of  pre-schoolers *do* eat this early, and they bring their spawn in great number.  Managed to be seated immediately, though, by dint of only needing a table for one.  Got the second last seat in the house, as it turned out, in a dark corner.  Water glass (already filled) and menu hit the table as I was seated, a nice touch.  Despite my being in a wretchedly difficult place to reach, the waitress was quick to worm her way to me and take my order.  Asked for a regular-sized classic poutine, a Banquise burger with Dijon instead of the usual orange sauce, and a St-Ambroise.  Did not have to wait long for it all to arrive;  just long enough to notice the extremely repetitive dance-techno music being played just a little too loud over the already considerable din in the room.  It was pounding out a deeply tribal message, and that message was \"please chew quickly and get out, so we can sell some more of this stuff\".  Just a little too obvious a musical psy-op, for what's basically a hip diner.  Dinged them a star while I waited for my oats.  The food and beer all arrived at once, exactly as ordered.  Poutine portion was definitely generous;  my plate was heaped, and almost overflowing.   Burger was a proper size for the price, and well-garnished.  Both tasted fine, while neither being spectacular.  Both, unfortunately, were only warm, and not hot.  Given how quickly they arrived, this was disappointing.  Fries fresh from the fryer and sauce kept on a proper simmer, especially, should have been screaming hot, at least at the very core of the mound.  But the wait at the kitchen push-through and the trip to my table somehow managed to suck the bulk of the heat out of my supper.  My cheese curds were barely melted.  Another star lost, right there.  Restrooms (I tried two) both had trash on the floor, and both had the slipperiest, soapiest floors I've ever put boots on.  The cracks in one bowl's rim must be from someone's teeth.  With all that said, this place isn't without definite merit.  Both the placière and my waitress were alert, memorably courteous and pleasant in the middle of an obvious rush, and good at their jobs.  And the food is taken seriously, ingredient-wise. It tasted fine, after all.   The people-watching was excellent, too, at least while I was there;  it seemed like I was surrounded by groups of good-looking twenty- and thirty-something brunettes, all animatedly catching up on old times and planning new adventures while gleefully pounding pure cholesterol into their smiling faces. The table of sleekly black-haired girls next to me was speaking entirely in an oddly-tinted Spanish.  My idle moments between mouthfuls weren't exactly devoid of wallpaper.  But the not-hot burger and poutine, the roomful of rather loud children, and the 1980s behavioral science music selection... Yes, I'd eat here again, but not without a deliberate motive.    Oh... When I left, the line was out the door.  Be forewarned.  Anyhow.  Banquise:  Been there, done that."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Not willing to say it's the best poutine in Montreal but its very good. Many poutine options to pick from but I went with the classic. Two sizes but the regular is big enough for most. Fries are on the greasier side with dark gravy and lot's of big cheese curds.  A true poutine connoisseur knows the cheese curds should be at least partially melted if the gravy is hot enough. Unfortunately this was not the case on my visit - the gravy was luke warm at best, and the cheese curds cold.  It should be noted that they have a kick ass beer selection - La fin du Monde, Cheval Blanc and multiple selections each from Boreale, Belle Gueule and St. Ambroise.  They now ask you to pay your bill before they bring you the food. This is a little odd but I imagine they get their share of drunk folks sneaking out without paying.  PS - it's 24 hours - perfect for Montreal since the bars only close at 3am.  BK"}
{"text":"Il existe de meilleurs spots à Poutine que celui-ci à Montréal."}
{"text":"After living in Montreal for 6 years, I've finally managed to get myself to eat at La Banquise! It was around 2:30 am on a Sunday night when I was craving poutine (happens way too often!)  There was a slight line up (be sure you are in the right one since there is a take out and a eat-in lineup). I can't remember which one I ordered but i had bacon and sour cream! It was just amazing!   The staff are super friendly and we barely had to wait for the food to finish!  The second time I went, it was on a saturday and it was super crowded! It was 3:30am and happened to be grand-prix weekend. Had to wait in line for about 10 minutes to sit down. Food came pretty quick."}
{"text":"I've been to Banquise a dozen times over the last 3 years. I use to think it was the best vegetarian poutine in Montreal but, after trying many others, it's hard to keep thinking that.  Yea, it's pretty darn good but there's something about their sauce that will make you feel sick after eating it. I don't know what it is, maybe it's MSG in the sauce, the overly sweet taste or just the fat levels being so high. For a lack of better words, It really doesn't taste \"clean\". It's a bit like eating Cheetos: it tastes great but you know it's really bad for you and that you'll regret it later. And just like those neon orange munchies-satisfiers you just won't be able to stop shoveling Banquise's poutine down your throat because it really is addicting... like crack.  While I'd never associate poutine with \"health food\" - who am I kidding, it is what it is right - there are plenty of options in Montreal for poutine that are much healthier and won't make you suspicious of what ingredients are in the sauce.  Anyway......I better stop writing there because the more I write about Banquise's poutine, the more I crave for it. Ugh. I can hear voices in my head, one is clearly drooling while pushing me to go back for more pleasure - and regret - and the other is screaming: \"No! Don't do it! You know it's baaaaaad for you!\"  And clearly, because I rated Banquise 3 stars and not 2, the former has registered a win... yet again.  To enjoy, in very small doses."}
{"text":"Classic, great, and delicious. Perfect for visitors: just remember to bring Canadian cash!"}
{"text":"Great service & the poutine was great! I ordered the poutine with smoked meat on it which was great! The smoked meat has so much flavour (more than Schwartz's) and I would definitely come back for it!"}

{"text":"If you've ever lived in Montreal for a reasonable amount of time, you have been to La Banquise. This establishment is the king of Montreal poutine culture, the emperor of the poutine empire, the gladiator that leaves everyone else in the dust!  Why, you ask.. Why should such grandiose compliments be bestowed upon this institution? Well: - Poutine has never seen so much variety! Mushrooms, peas, pepperoni, guacamole, you name it, they've got it as an option to put on their poutine. They have the largest and most delicious menu ever, that would get any poutine-lover riled up! - It is open 24 hours!! YES, that means after those great nights out with friends, you can come and feed yourself some poutine! - Their portions are so big they are meant to be shared! Eat yourself silly, guys!! You probably need it after all the partying you were doing prior to stumbling in here. - They serve beer! Beer with poutine!! Thank god someone understands us!  La Banquise should not be missed at any costs, its a CLASSIC. If you havent been to La Banquise, please hang your head in shame! And then make plans to go there THIS WEEKEND!   30/30!! YA!!!!"}
{"text":"I love that T-Rex poutine, but every bite makes my heart's coronary arteries cry.  Definitely a tourist spot to add to a foodie's tour of Montreal, but there's no shame in visiting it. A quick Google search will always present this place in the top 3 poutineries of Montreal and when you see the menu of over 2 dozen kinds, you can understand why.  I never officially had poutine before, but the concept of fries, gravy and cheese curds (poor man's mozzarella) is simple to understand. The gravy here has a good flavor and the cheese curds give a mild salt factor. The T-Rex version with added bacon, hot dogs and ground beef is a carnivore's dream (duh).  For these dense dishes a regular should be sufficient for 2 sharing, unless you're starving. My only dislike about the concept of poutine is the mushy fries. Just my personal preference for crispy/non-soggy fries.  By the way, the onion rings here are skinny and super crunchy as a good side order. Service is incredibly friendly as well."}
{"text":"We asked the locals at Mount Royal where to get the best poutine and they recommended us here. It was legit. I'm from Houston and the copycats in Houston do no measure up to the real deal in Montreal. A+."}
{"text":"I'll be dreaming about this poutine until the next time I visit Montreal...  The only downside of the huge menu of creative and outrageous poutine concoctions was that I couldn't decide what to order! It was great that I came with friends so we could get a taste of different dishes. I figured I couldn't go wrong with a traditional flavor so I ordered La Classique and then tried my friend's La Taquise and loved them both! The portions were HUGE. Even though I ate until I was about to pop, there was still a ton left over and I was sad to leave it behind."}

{"text":"Went here right before the dinner rush with my boyfriend and it was great! We walked about two miles to get there, so I thought getting a large would be fine! It was massive! Unless you're sharing, stick with the regular. The space was kind of tight and our server was nice but very fatigued. 7/10"}
{"text":"Best poutine ever.  So good.  I had the poutine with tomatoes, sour cream, and guac and it was amazing. The prices are super reasonable and you can have beer with your poutine!  Because your meal isn't quite the heart attack you were going for, just add alcohol. :)  The waitress was nice and despite the line out the door I did not feel rushed at all.    So good."}
{"text":"Well, drats.  This was just about the last thing I did on a recent trip to Montreal and my expectations were so high.  I'm sure it would have been great as late night drunk food but as a highly anticipated last meal in Montreal, it disappointed.  I have only had poutine once, in Vancouver, which I thought was delicious.  I found La Banquise to be kind of bland.  We had the Classique of course and also ordered The Elvis (with ground beef, mushrooms, and peppers) because hey, it's Elvis week!  The fries were too bland and soggy for my taste, the cheese curds didn't have much flavor (and were not squeaky--were they supposed to be squeaky?) and the gravy was a bit thin.  The Elvis was better because it had additional toppings but again the ground beef wasn't that flavorful either.  So...meh.  Very curious how the other top places would have tasted.  I did really enjoy the pouding chomeur though!!"}
{"text":"Super leckeres Essen! Eigentlich ist es Pflicht, hier zu essen, wenn man in Montreal ist. Ich hatte die La Poutine mit Chicken. Sehr lecker! Das Essen kam schnell, die Kellner waren sehr freundlich und der Preis ist auch fair. Die kleine Portion reicht übrigens ;-)"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by the staff at Schwartz's so I decided to try it out.  The decor created a vivid atmosphere with bright colors, liked it.  They had a huge selections of poutines and I ordered the  la taquise which was topped with guacamole, sour cream and tomatoes. It was very creative and unique.  Price was reasonable for the size and service was good too.  I would recommend this place if you are visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Fries are my kryptonite.  I like 'em crispy or soft, criss-cut or curly.   But fries as a meal?  I'm listening...  During my seven day stay in Montreal, I had poutine three times.  Because we showed up on a busy Friday night, we decided to go to Poutineville for one of those times.  Expect to see a line out the door, but you may get lucky.  On a Thursday night after we got out of the Kings/Habs game, we were able to get sat right away.    I liked La Banquise a little more than I liked Poutineville.  La Banquise's fries are smaller.  Their vegan gravy was thicker and did not make the fries soggy like the ones I had at Poutineville.  The curds were a lot squeakier at Poutineville, however.  The cheese at La Banquise didn't have that squeak factor, but it may have been because they were slightly more melted.  They actually reminded me more of mozzarella than curds.  The portions were comparable.  The plate seems smaller at La Banquise, but they give you a generous mounded serving.  Regular is plenty for one person.  La Banquise has some creative signature dishes and I only had the classic version at Poutineville.  Poutineville has several different gravies and all of them are vegetarian, except for the meat sauce.  They serve Bec sodas, a local company that uses all natural ingredients and sweetens their drinks with maple syrup.  I tried the cola and cranberry sodas.  They were extremely carbonated and the sodas would bubble up through the straw.  It added to the whimsy of drinking soda from a glass bottle.  I'm not a big soda drinker, but I am a sucker for anything maple.  I enjoyed the Bec cola.  The cranberry had kind of an unpleasant aftertaste.  Service was on point.  The servers were sweethearts on both visits.  Even though they were busy, we never felt rushed.  Water was refilled often.  No credit cards accepted.  Cash or Canadian debit cards only.  ATM located at the entrance.  Expect to pre-pay for your meal after 9PM.  Too many drunken dine and dashers, I imagine."}
{"text":"This is the first place that I've been to for poutine, and this should be yours too. It is quite pricey, but it's better than all the other ones and they have a wide selection of toppings.  Once again the price is quite high, so go there for an occasion or maybe for your first poutine."}
{"text":"3stars for everything besides the food! Cheese curds was not even warm , like chewing a hard rubber, no idea why it is so popular, will not return"}
{"text":"Oh my god- heart attack on a plate 24 hours a day! So a friend told me how I must try poutine when I went to Montreal and I thought it sounded a little crazy at first, but I was up for trying something new as long as it wasn't frog legs or pâté!  We ordered two plates and shared- Poutine Duleton and Poutine Classique. Poutine combines three of my favorite things-potatoes, cheese, and gravy! We liked the Poutine Duleton a little better, but both of them were awesome. Not exactly a healthy meal, but a delicious over-indulgence. I had never had cheese curds. Yum! If you are in Montreal and have never had Poutine, this is a must try. There are also vegetarian options so it is friendly for all.   It was busy as other reviewers say. We were there at lunchtime on a weekend so we had to wait a while for a table, but I don't remember how long."}
{"text":"La meilleure place à poutine que j'ai essayé pour etre honnete. Il y a un choix immense, je n'ai jamais eu a attendre tres longtemps (sauf peut-être les vendredi/samedi soir si t'es une grosse gang) les prix sont vraiment raisonnables, ya beaucoup de choix de bieres, l'ambiance et le staff est nice, un de mes restos pref a montreal! Pis je trouve toujours du parking gratuit :)"}
{"text":"At first I thought the portion looked really small. Not at all. I wasn't even able to finish the small plate. Actually it made me sick. I could not eat anything the day after I just felt like throwing up. The poutine was really good though but it didn't sit right in my stomach. I got the matti which has mushrooms, onion, bacon and peppers. I find it pretty expensive for the portion size. I think it's more one of those famous places you just have to go to once in your life."}
{"text":"this place was great...the poutine surpassed my expectations and was truly delicious!!!!!!   i ordered a small LA MART. it was bacon-y, mushroom-y, hotdoggish heaven in my mouth! fries were crisp and brown, and the gravy was not overly salty. it was just right! \"small\" is a relative term at this restaurant. another table seated next to us got their order first and i asked the waitress what size poutines they had ordered. their plates were heaping and massive...and it was a small. after having said that,  i was pretty famished and finished nearly all of the small plate myself.   note that the hot dogs that they serve at this place are pork - not boeuf.   overall, this was a fun experience. the only reason this place gets a 4 instead of a 5 is due to service. the wait staff was pretty surly,  but their service was prompt."}
{"text":"The waitresses are gorgeous!! And the food is even better!!   \"La Matty\" w/ side of smoke meat!"}
{"text":"La Banquise offers a huge selection of different types of poutines and other fast food style options. I have been about five times now and am not really a huge fan. The fries are cooked perfectly however the cheese curds and the gravy could use a bit of work. It is a nice spot to go to for a late night snack. It is always packed so be ready to wait. It is one of those places you go for the experience."}
{"text":"If you're in Montreal,  you have to stop by here for a poutine.  Not just any poutine, you have literally dozens of choices for whatever suits your taste.  There are Mexican, Meat lovers, Veggie, Classic and the list goes on.  All served with their famous fries and gravy.  Be sure to know that you'll likely be waiting in line for a while.  Even if it's 3am in the morning on a Sunday this place is still packed.  The service isn't the best and they do make you pay first before you get your meal, but who cares it's all about the poutine here!   If you feel daring enough they do host some poutine eating challenges from time to time.  If you want to give yourself a personal challenge, try to finish a large T Rex on your own.  I did and I quickly passed out of a food coma afterwards."}
{"text":"Un classique Montréalais et toujours un vrai délice! Nous ne sommes jamais déçus, les frites sont superbes, la sauce aussi et que dire de la variété de choix de poutines!"}
{"text":"I have a love-hate relationship with this place.  I love fries.  Their fries are really good.  I really like poutine.  They have a great variety of toppings, along with the traditional cheese curds and gravy.  I just don't want to eat a heaping plate of the stuff.  It tastes so good but the guilt kicks in at a certain point.  I wish they served a mini portion."}
{"text":"La Banquise has the best vegetarian (red wine) gravy of any place I've found in Montreal that offers vegetarian poutine. I'd even go as far as to say that the vegetarian gravy is better than their \"normal\" gravy. I've let anyone I've taken there try it (some serious carnivores) and they've all agreed that it's superior in every way.  They also recently started offering vegan poutine made with the vegetarian gravy and Daiya vegan cheese. I'm not a fan of Daiya, so I can't tell you if it's any good or not, but the gravy alone is worth the trip.  They're open 24 hrs (one of the few places I've found in MTL) but parking there is *terrible*. It's also right across the street from a police station so think twice about parking illegally."}
{"text":"Super delicious poutine, the way it should be. We had the smoked meat poutine with mushrooms and pepper gravy. I didn't really like the pepper gravy too much but everything else was pretty great. The other poutine we had was the ground beef, caramelized onions, mushroom and jalapeños and this one was perfect."}
{"text":"I really wanted to have poutine bcoz I heard from people that poutine in montreal is the best. Here we are!! I could say I love it!! YUMMY! We took subway and walked there. I didn't disappointed even a little! Service was great. They kept checking us some time. It was crowded, so popular though it was not close to subway. If I come to montreal again, I would go back there!!"}
{"text":"I'm so sorry- I know how much people love this place! I wish I could love it that much too but the truth is there are much better and much more authentic poutines out there. If you want to try a fun variation of poutine though, this is definitely the place to go- their menu is huge and there is something in there for everyone! Their vegetarian gravy option is also a nice touch."}
{"text":"Got the T-REX poutine. No regrets. Fries could be a little salted, it's kinda just covered with a gravy that's overall saltier, but the fries themselves could have been better. Definitely go with a group and order different kinds!  It's crowded even late at night, but this is well worth the wait. Get ready to smell like fried potatoey goodness because it'll stick with your clothes for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"It was good but not the best poutine in Montreal. Have had much better ones. When you do a take out please order a regular if you aren't gonna share it. The queue outside very very very long- a min 90 min wait around the year!"}
{"text":"This is what poutine dreams are made of.   Literally everything on their menu is delicious.  There's always a lineup, which is a sign of how good the food is ;)  Staff are always friendly even if it gets crazy busy.  Good price for the quality & portions you get."}
{"text":"I guess poutine is not a dish for me, no matter how authentic it is.   I did not like the taste of the vegan gravy but neither did my husband who ordered the regular version.  I guess I could not get past how unhealthy this dish is and how soggy the fries were.   I liked the cheese curds though, at least those that were not swimming in gravy...   Yet I am glad I can say I tried poutine once in my life and this place was probably the place to go for it."}
{"text":"I was sadly not impressed. Montreal had so many good places to eat but this is not the best place for poutine. There is usually a line around dinner time but I would suggest to go across the street the Peruvian chicken place for these gigantic poutine dishes. The chicken tasted plastic-y and the cheese cold. Gravy tasted like salt and very watery."}
{"text":"Went there this past Saturday. Was quite the trek from where we started. Once arrived however (30 minutes later), we were greeted to two lines. If you are on the line which is going with the flow of the passing cars and taxis, that line is to sit inside the restaurant and pig out. The line opposite (going against the flow of traffic), is the take out line. Took my friend and I a couple of minutes to realize this but once we did, we were set.  Everyone was professional from the security out front to the cashier who took my food to the one hottie who handled me my food( she reminded me of Agent Hill).  Anyway once we got our grub, took a cab back to the apartment and dug in....good lord, this was deliciousness.  I had something called the \"le matty\" which came with poutine fixings but with addition like bacon, green peppers,onions.... Mmmm hot damn just thinking about it makes my mouth water.  Cannot wait for next visit to try another dish from there. Maybe next time I will sit and stay a while."}
{"text":"Not a huge poutine fan, they do have a lot of flavor options. The wait was very long, so be prepared if you go here on a weekend night."}
{"text":"You are what you eat. If that means my body is a crispy potato with a sour cream center then so be it. So when it was decided that we were to visit Montreal in the spring it was a no brainer to make a pilgrimage to La Banquise.   It's open 24/7 and it seem like there's a perpetual line to the take out counter and to dine in the restaurant. However, each time I queued to eat inside I felt the wait was painless and moved along in good time.  There's seating in the back outdoor dining area but you aren't allowed to order alcoholic beverages outside so naturally we opted for a table inside.  Service was friendly and they functioned like a well oiled machine taking our orders and presenting our food in the blink of an eye. We received the bill promptly when requested, and like every restaurant outside the US we  paid with our credit card at the table.   They have an excellent menu of unique poutines. Since we were stuffed to full capacity trying to eat two regular plates in our last visit, this time we opted to share one regular sized plate. We had the L'Asterix ($10.80 for regular/$16.35 for large) which includes smoked meat(a Montreal specialty), mushrooms, sour cream & pepper sauce. It was absolutely fantastic and if it was my mission to get fat(ter) I would just eat poutine from La Banquise.   Visitors to Montreal should make a pilgrimage to La Banquise to try proper poutine."}
{"text":"Came to Montreal, saw a few friends, and had one friend with me who'd never had poutine before.  The friends who lived in Montreal suggested we go to La Banquise, said it was some of the best.  So five of us went; had a great booth by the window.  Line-up but moved quickly (I assume, we go lost along the way and met up with them once they were already inside).  By far the Petite Vie was the best (steak, onion, corn).  So delicious, great portion size.  Good drink options.  Overall best poutine I've ever had."}
{"text":"I'm in no way a poutine expert or crazy about it (I know wth am I doing in Montreal). Everyone said this is the place to go for poutine in Montreal, and also seeing the line up, my expectations were pretty damn high. I was kind of let down. The poutine is good, nothing exceptional imo. But, the variety they have for the poutine - I've not seen such elsewhere."}
{"text":"Après la poutine faite maison, la meilleur ce ici, chez la Banquise des professionnelles de la poutine 100%, ouvert 24h et 7j/7 Il y a pour tout le monde, t-rex pour les carnivores, la classique et même un veggie avec le gravy végétarien Et en plus deux tailles d'assiettes différentes, car on a pas touts la même faim!!! J'ai hâte d'y retourner un jour!!"}
{"text":"Ehhhhhh... well... I was here at 3 or 4 am in the morning and had just finished a tour of long islands, so I can't exactly say I was uber sober or alert.  This was my first poutine experience and it wasn't the beeeest, but I guess it did the job.  They have an amazing selection of poutines, to say the least.    My next trip, I tried poutine at Frite Alors, which is a direct competitor of La Banquise and preferred it mucho.  And the burgers at Frite Alors ROCK.  I don't know.  Something about Frite Alors poutine excited me more.  Want more of me?  Video foodie blog at http://www.tastytwosome.com"}
{"text":"Like a \"direct strike\" this is Poutine heaven. Enough said!  Imagine the world's best pizzeria with 800 different pizza pies!  This is it with poutine!!"}
{"text":"There was a 30 minute line out the door on a -10 Celsius winter day at 3 pm Sunday afternoon. That is how good La Banquise is.  I had the Elvis and the boyfriend had a (large!) smoked meat. Both were oh-so-delicious. We are big poutine fans in Toronto and frequent Smoke's Poutinerie regularly. Smoke's is delicious but La Banquise takes the crown. For me, it's all in the potato. I think some others here wrote the potato is \"golden potato\". It has a more waxy texture than the usual meal-y french fry potato.  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Nothing beats a poutine at La Banquise.  The Mexican poutine all the way baby!"}
{"text":"Not bad classic poutine. Fries and gravy were not not enough to melt the curds though--amateur mistake. Pulled pork flavor was very good and hot enough."}
{"text":"What can you add to your review to make it stand out after 1,390 reviews already about this place? Not a whole lot, that's for sure. All I can do is share my experience with Yelp.   We came to this place after 9am and this place was pretty much empty. No lineup or waiting involved. Thankfully this place was not closed for the holidays as some places in Montreal right now. I love the fact that this place is 24 hours.   We had the option of choosing from the Breakfast and Poutine menus. We decided for both. My wife chose the Classic Breakfast poutine while my daughter went for La Bacon poutine. I chose L'Obelix which was Smoked Meat poutine.   Our server was prompt and efficient. She came often enough to check up on us to make sure everything was good.   My wife loved her dish. Instead of regular fries, the dish had home fries plus the fried egg made the dish even better. Our Bacon and Smoked Meat poutines were good but it was a bit salty because of the protein. I don't think they had the best fries in our trip either. The fries at Brit & Chips were better. However, the combination with the gravy and cheese curds works. There's an extensive variation of different poutines available for one to try, so a return trip is guaranteed. BTW, unless you are starving, my suggestion will be to stick to the regular size as their portions are big. I couldn't finish my regular size dish and I can't imagine what a large will be like.   I just have to remember to show up at odd hours to avoid the wait time.   Recommended at least to come once when visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"This place was mentioned in all nearly all searches for good poutine in Montreal, so I had to try it and see what all the hype was about.  In our party of four, only two of us have had poutine before, so trying to describe it to them was best if they had it for themselves.  My friends weren't too fond of their selections, but the Duleton I ordered was good.  I'm happy I ordered just the regular size or else I would've had a lot to bring home!  Next time I return to Montreal, I need to try the plain and standard Classique, just so I can compare it to the other versions I've had at other restaurants."}
{"text":"This seemed to be a great trendy spot for locals and tourists who were in the mood for poutine. Poutine wasn't my cup of tea, but if you like fries with various toppings, it might be for you. It's definitely a must try if you're in Quebec.   The line to dine in was outside the door and the eat in area was small. The menu had a large variety of poutines to choose from, as well as, other greasy foods. They only accept cash and Canadian cards so be prepared. They also played really good music while I was standing in line. The line cooks and one of the waiters were getting down!"}
{"text":"Un des incontournables de la Poutine. Plein de recettes différentes pour tous les goûts. Et ça sauve la vie à 4h du matin."}
{"text":"Best best best poutine ever! That use to be my spot when I live in montreal. I will go there 2 times a week for sure. Nothing is better then a poutine when your drunk. These always a line up they should think about opening a second place. The service is ok, you go there for the food. It usually always fast. If you go a friday night after the bar well be ready to wait its busy but ...... it will help your hangover!   Mix crowd you can sometimes spot some hockey players after a game in montreal!  So goodddddddddd am in japan ad am looking at some picture of the banquise and i want a poutine so bad now!"}
{"text":"This place was jam-packed at 2:30AM on a Friday.  Go figure.  We were bundled-up Americans just stopping by on our way to Mont Tremblant.  Everyone else was a club-goer, looking to sober up with some delicious poutine.  We only had to wait about five minutes, though the line was significantly longer as we stepped out.  We ordered the Matty and Kamikaze.  They were great, as I'm sure all the other options would have been.  The curds didn't quite squeak, but they were close.  I would have preferred the fries more crispy, but I guess there's no point if they're soaked in gravy.  Cash-only, open 24-hours (!!!), grungy, but fun."}
{"text":"came here right before it got busy again, but i still had to wait 5-10 min for a table (3pm on a saturday). service was great, i dont see how ANYBODY can eat a large order of the poutine since in the end i couldnt even finish my regular, just ate all the cheese curd. it was really good but i should have gotten something w/ more veggies. i chose to get the beef + onions one... beef is just a hamburger patty crumbled up but overall its good. i would imagine even just a plain one is good. yuuuuuuummmmm"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want a quick casual bite with no nonsense and this place gets the job done.  I thought the poutine was solid - I really liked the heat on the Kamikaze.  The portions were a bit larger than I expected - I was actually concerned that my order came out wrong because I was certain that the regulars we ordered came out as larges!  After looking around I found that I was mistaken that the huge mound of poutine in front of me was indeed the regular size.  I'd eat here again any day especially after heavy drinking as this would be the ultimate drunk food."}
{"text":"That's right no trip to Montreal is complete without having a poutine. We dropped by in an early Monday afternoon while heading back to Toronto from Quebec City. The restaurant was 80% empty. I ordered a Poutine Hawii (ham, pineapple, $7.30) and my girlfriend a Poutine Matty (bacon, green peppers, mushrooms, onions, $7.50). I tried both and was slightly disappointed not because of the potato, cheese curds (plentiful) or toppings but the gravy, which tasted like instant bouillon mix.  I am from Toronto area and have easy access to New York Fries. Its gravy taste more like demi-glace.  Also, I ordered a V8 expecting a regular 12-oz can (355 ml) but when the waitress sent the 5.5-oz can (162 ml) i was speechless. After checking the menu knowing V8 costed only $1.75, same price as other 12-oz pops, there was no more complain.  I will go there again only if it is after midnight as they open 24 hours, otherwise I will try another one.  ."}
{"text":"This is one of the best poutine places in all of Montreal! It's pretty much as good as it gets and amazing after a long night of partying. I've been to Montreal a few time and everytime we loved coming to the place.  You need to narrow down the flavors you like and get it accordingly. I am huge fan of the extra cheese curds, so don't plan to \"eat clean\" around here. Also, extra gravy, you drown in gooooey goodness!!!  I would definatly recommend getting the sour cream and gauc on the side. Remember, the Gauc is extra! ;)"}
{"text":"Poutine is pretty much anywhere and everywhere in Montreal. Sometimes when you have too many options, it becomes difficult to make decisions (at least that's how it works with me). We chose this place because of the amount of reviews.. and it was only A-OK. However, that may be our fault for ordering the \"plainer\" option. The grand size of \"Taquise\" seemed like the perfect choice for us. It was topped with tomatoes, guacamole, and sour cream. We probably should have ordered something with lots of meat and gravy, something packed with flavor. But then, I can also argue that anything with guacamole should be amazing. So 3 stars it is, but it is worth going back to, especially since they're open 24/7!  Make sure you use your google translate and get in the correct line: dine in or take out. There's a line of people outside, but they're just waiting for their take out orders. We got lucky and arrived before a line formed for dining in. For beer, the Belle Gueule went well with the poutine. Lastly, unimportant but strange, we heard the same 3 songs repeat in less than an hour at the restaurant. Create a new playlist maybe?"}
{"text":"The first good poutine that we had between Quebec and Montreal. La Banquise is a local Poutineheaven.   We trudged in at 10 am after a long bus ride from Quebec City and took the regular menu to break our fast. We pleasantly found that we beat the legendary lines and waits by coming for poutine at such odd hour. I had decided before we entered that the perfect Poutine to really experience this affair to the fullest would be:   T-rex with topping of gravy and guacamole. Grande for two of us to share.  And i was not disappointed. It was a jungle of meat and fries and each forkful was a slightly different concoction. In our empty stomach, this mountain of guilt felt feather-like after we finished.   We poutined out and we are ready to go home like we did right. We proceeded to ride the bixi bike to Saint Catherine Street. The rest of the day was not too eventful."}
{"text":"What can one say about La Banquise that hasn't already been said? This place always sports a long lineup regardless of if you are coming here during the day or at 3am on a weekend night.  While there may be a few who would argue the point, I and most others would say that this place is THE place to go for Poutine in Montreal.  It is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian poutine HERE!  Just has to get that out, seeing as it's harder to find the stuff than I thought. Resto La Banquise really took me back to these whole-in-the-wall artsy, with just the right amount of punky, funky style of the college town I grew up in.   We super lucked out and walked in just before the line filled out to the door and down the block. They have packed every possible space in this place with a seat. Little did I know this place was a total institution in Montreal.  I got the vegetarian poutine with hot peppers (not too hot) and mushrooms, a small (which by anyone else's standards is a large)... and I'm so, so glad that I did, because I probably would have stuffed my face with the large if it was sitting in front of me. I've never met a gravy and cheese curds on french fries I didn't like, so this was no different. I must come back for more topping combos!"}
{"text":"Hot.Dog.Poutine.   Yes, you read that right. You were probably thinking, \"Hey, how could poutine get any better?\" Oh right, add processed meats and BOO-YEAH- party in your mouth.   There are so many different kinds so take your time and choose wisely.   Oh, and they're open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"After a club or a late night, my friend introduced me to this kick ass restaurant. Honestly you have to try this place, it fills you up and the poutines are delicious! If you are a die hard poutine fan like me, Try it... its self explanatory!"}
{"text":"Je trouve sincèrement que les poutines coûtent de plus en plus chères. Par exemple leur poutine Rachel: onion, piment et champion coûtent juste 1$ moins chère que ceux avec de la viande. C est ouvert 24h et le service est long lorsque on commande pour emporter. Il y a tellement de gens qui va là bas. Il offre une bonne poutine, mais c est aussi a cause des medias que la banquise a tant de succès. Il y a aussi d autre bonne restaurant de poutine. Il y a deux taille de poutine: régulier et grande. La grande c est fais pour manger à deux sinon pour personne qui a manquer un repas."}
{"text":"Meilleure poutine au monde, tout simplement. Je suis impressionné par la grande variété de poutines proposées."}
{"text":"This place is good, they have an insane selection of poutine. But it's very touristy, kind of over hyped. Very small space with limited seating. The poutine is good but not amazing. I find their fries to be a little wimpy and soggy. Their gravy makes the dish."}
{"text":"Well, I guess poutine is not my thing... at least, Resto La Banquise's take on poutine wasn't. I know there are lots of foreigners and locals alike who love and swear by this restaurant, but I'm just not a fan.  My thoughts on the regular poutine: I wasn't a fan of the gravy. I thought it was bland and watery. Combined with the fries, the poutine was very heavy and soggy. I think it would have been better paired with fries that could withstand the gravy so it won't turn out gloppy. I agree with another reviewer: the poutine had some sort of strange sweetness (not sure if this was the combination of the ingredients, or just one ingredient). Portion sizes were massive. We asked the waitress for her recommendation on portion sizes, and she thought that between two people, we'd be able to eat a small poutine (for a meal) and regular sized poutine to share, plus other food. My boyfriend ended up eating his small size, but we barely made a dent in the regular size. For sure, a regular size would be able to be shared with at least three people.  I did enjoy my Montreal style hot dog though, a \"steamie\" on a buttered and toasted hot dog roll.  The line was pretty long to get seated but it moved. Around dinner time, we managed to stay in line for about 30 minutes. We opted to sit outside in the patio, where we were serenaded by some early 2000's pop and hip-hop music! Totally geared towards the younger crowd. For foreigners: they only take local Canadian cards (No Mastercard/Visa), so cash is best.  Hopefully my next trip into Montreal I'll find another poutine place to try out."}
{"text":"I came here as per a Montreal native's recommendation. There was a wait outside the restaurant (locals and tourists alike stood in line), but the wait is completely worth it.  In my opinion, La Banquise is one of the best spots (if not the best) for poutine. My poutine education happened here, and I judge all poutine by the standard set at La Banquise. This establishment's extensive and diverse poutine menu doesn't disappoint. The French fries are fried just right with the correct texture and shape. The gravy was tasty, and it came with just the right helping of cheese curds. This is going to be a hearty and heavy meal (the portions are large), so when you do come here, do build up an appetite!  The ambiance is unassuming- perfect for a casual meal, and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"We arrived at around 1130am on a Friday and there was no line. We were seated right away. We ordered a regular classic poutine and shared it as we just had sandwiches at Schwartz. We ordered drinks as well...a local beer Boreale Blonde and soda. It took a while for our order to come out. The poutine was yummy! The potatoes had a hint of sweetness, the gravy was rich and tasty and the cheese curds were fresh. We finished the dish and agreed that we ordered the right size. When we left there was already a line."}
{"text":"Je suis arrivé à Montréal en soirée et vers 22h j'ai eu vraiment faim. Quoi de mieux à cette heure qu'une bonne poutine? Pas grand chose, en effet! J'ai donc sauté dans le wagon de métro le plus proche et me suis dirigé vers La Banquise, institution montréalaise, temple de cette extravagance culinaire.   J'ai pensé que le restaurant lui même était plutôt sale et collant. On n'a pas envie de savoir tous les micro-organismes qui pullulent sur sa table! La salle à manger m'a semblé relativement petite et je m'y suis senti à l'étroit de par l'abondance de clients. J'ai trouvé leur système plutôt inefficace : les commandes aux tables ça ne marche pas dans les casse-croûtes de ce genre ; il faut un comptoir où on commande et paie, ensuite on s'assoit si on veut rester pour manger. J'ai aussi trouvé très étrange, étant donné le service au table, que l'on doive payer avant d'avoir mangé...  Pour en venir à la bouffe, j'ai pris une galvaude format régulier. Qu'on se le dise tout de suite : le format régulier est gigantesque! Ne vous laissez pas tenter par le grand format, vous le regretteriez! Au moins, le prix, assez élevé au coup d'oeil, est justifié par la volupté des portions. J'ai trouvé ma galvaude on ne peut plus correct : le croquant des frites résistait bien à la sauce, qui elle était tout ce qu'il y a de plus brun et classique, le poulet était bel et bien mort et bouilli depuis plusieurs jours et les petits pois venaient d'une conserve. Bref, c'était ce à quoi je m'attendais. Le seul vrai reproche que je leur ferai concernant les poutines, c'est qu'ils ont eu l'idée saugrenue de les servir dans des assiettes. Une poutine, ça se sert dans un bol ou une boîte en styrofoam, pas une assiette! Ainsi exposée aux courants d'air, elle perd sa chaleur rapidement et sera immanquablement froide rendue à table. De plus, avec la grosseur ridicule des portions, elle se répand de partout et s'effondre de tous bords, tous côtés, contribuant à la malpropreté des tables.  Maintenant que mon pèlerinage est fait, y retournerai-je? Non. Pourquoi? Parce que ce n'est qu'une gargote comme les autres et qu'on fait bien mieux ailleurs (notamment chez Planète Poutine). Il y a aussi le fait que c'est rempli de touristes ontariens qui s'attendent au saint Graal (parce qu'ils n'ont aucune idée de l'essence d'une vraie poutine). C'est alors que, déçus, ils ne mangent qu'une ou deux bouchées de la masse gluante et puis, s'en retournent  à Toronto prier le seigneur et porter allégeance à la reine, nous laissant avec l'horreur visuelle de leur gaspille alimentaire éhontée."}
{"text":"The go to spot for poutine  when you're in Montreal.  If you plan on going to this establishment make sure to go early in the day to avoid the big lineups as it has become a Montreal tourist attraction over the years because of its high quality poutine.  I ordered the La Mart the other day which had bacon, hot dogs and mushrooms in it and it was awesome.  Tastes even greater with their house beer that also shares the same name as the restaurant, best part of all it's open 24 hours so if you crave poutine for breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner you must dine at La Banquise.  P.S. the portions are large so if you decide to try this place for the first time I recommend getting regular size first before you jump into the large size."}
{"text":"I went here in October 2013 and it was AMAZING! I LOVED the original but the Italian was very good also. Go early in the mornings (like 5am) if u wanna beat the rush and get free parking :-)"}
{"text":"went many times no matter day or night , overall is ok, but I personally like the slim frits more , those really it over sizes , and it also too salty with it flavor."}
{"text":"My first poutine experience was at la banquise yesterday. I ordered the one with smoked meat, spicy sausage, and ground beef. It was fantastic. My date ordered the one with mushrooms peppers and onions and I really liked that one. Cheese curds are a wonderful thing that everyone should experience. I highly recommend this place if you are coming to Montreal and want late night poutine. Notes, the wait time is really short so don't be intimidated by the line outside. Also, they accept Canadian debit or cash only. No credit cards. They do have an atm on location though, so that's what I used to get cash for payment"}
{"text":"La Banquise, 24 hours poutinerie, my god, how do people in Montreal stay so thin and so European like with this type of establishment around?!   FOOD: Got two types of poutines: the asterisk and the Rachel. Let's say, yes. The asterisk comes with ham and the Rachel comes with peppers and onions. The poutine sauce/gravy is to die for too. The fries are warm and honestly, who could not love what is on this dish? Perfectly salted, fries were good, and the cheese curds were also delicious.   SERVICE: Very attentive and spoke good English. I also did not have enough Canadian dollars, but they were happy to accept my USD and my USD tip as well. The line to get in may seem long, but the turnover here is pretty high.   We did not end up finishing the poutine, so I took back to the US, but it really only tastes right at that moment. This place is for sure delicious! I would definitely put this on the top of somebody's Montreal itinerary."}
{"text":"I'm gonna be honest, I was doing the foodie touristy thing with two friends and found this place on yelp. I hope my review helps shed some light.  The wait is real - at 8pm, it took us an hour to get indoors and then half hour waiting on the line indoors. The place inside is like a trendy diner and the crowd is eclectic.  9:30pm- Once seated, the waitress ignored us and served other tables seated after us. Um?! We waited patiently while other servers hushed us like babes and said we'll be served shortly, pah!!! Some tables even got their food before she came to us.  The waitress finally took our order and then came back with a receipt. You MUST pay first- I'm glad Yelpers tipped me off on this :). BUT I don't think we would've gotten our dinner until we waved down the girl to pay and THEN the food magically arrived at our table.  I got \"Le Mart\" to share, the Banquise Burger, and the Pogo (corn dog). The poutine toppings were okay but altogether the meat toppings and the fries were overwhelmingly salty. Even one friend who absolutely loves potatoes, fries, and all variations of the two, couldn't finish the shared poutine. Burger had a spicy thousand island type dressing, nothing superb.  Two stars for 1. eventually getting our food hot and 2. the pogo is delish. Or I just have a corn dog sweet spot. (My friend's Canadian shepard's pie was also good.)  I should've just gotten 3 pogos and called it a night."}
{"text":"La Banquise is always busy, especially in the whee hours of the night when everyone is looking for some good late night drunchies. It's definitely a Montreal staple and has had a few appearances on the Food Network because of its large selection and creativity with poutine.   Despite the massive line ups, don't be intimidated...they move at a pretty good pace and, in my experience, has always been worth the wait. Their Merguez poutine is delicious, get the Kamikaze if you'd like an extra kick of spice due to the added hot peppers and tabasco (it's on my 'to try' list). The T-Rex is quite popular, although I've never had it, which is loaded with a variety of meat. And for my next visit I'd definitely like to try the Taquise, it seems really interesting since it has guacamole, sour cream, and tomatoes. I've heard the combination works well, and I'm eager to find out!"}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????22?????????????????????????????????????????ATM????????ATM??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????...?????????????????"}
{"text":"Some amazing versions of this Montreal speciality.  Rich brown gravy, plentiful cheese curds. Deep brown hand cut fries piled high and then crushed beneath mountains of toppings ranging from smoked meat to vegetarian options.  Quick service.  No beer served on back patio area.  Under hyped hotdogs are a perfect addition to the giant bowls of poutine. Served on a buttery bun grilled to a golden brown and can be ordered either steamed or griddled. Cheese and/or bacon are available and worth adding. \"Dressed\" adds relish, onions, coleslaw and ketchup to the hot dog. Excellent."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST Poutine joint in Montreal! Located right by Parc La Fontaine, this place is open 24H and caters to dine in diners and take out diners. The sit in line up is usually longer while the take out line up is shorter but you can expect to wait a good 10-15 minutes for your Poutine to be ready.   They have a wide variety of options ranging from a classic Poutine to more extravagant choices like La Reggae which has ground beef, guac and banana peppers. If you come in the morning, they also have breakfast Poutines or you can upgrade your breakfast potatoes for a classic Poutine (+$3).   Serving size is quite large for the Poutine. A regular is a good snack size if you order multiple dishes but if you want a meal size to share, the grande is fairly good (especially with all the toppings)!   What I love about this place is not only the delicious Poutine but also the location. It's right next to the park which makes it super easy to grab a Poutine to go and then head to the park for a mini picnic.   A must try in Montreal but be weary of the long line ups in the evening. Also they only take cash or interac and NOT credit."}
{"text":"Being in Montreal, it's only fitting to have some poutine!  To start off our day of tourism, my friend took me to this 24h restaurant known for its 28 different types of poutines - it has definitely been a while since I've had fries, let alone fries w gravy and meat!!  Atmosphere: 3.5/5  The restaurant was quiet when we arrived; I suppose it is still a little early for poutine!  Interesting decor; reminds me a little of elementary school with all the primary colors.  Simple and good enough for a poutine breakfast  Food: 4/5  We looked at the poutine menu and decided to share the regular size La Fred Caillou - with ground beef, smoked meat, spicy sausage, and, merguez sausage.  This is so we can try all of the different meats! I love that the poutine came piping hot!  It was huge...  Delicious and extremely filling... both of us were completely sated by the time we finished.  Service: 3/5  Overall good service; we had to wait a bit to get water refills and the bill but didn't mind too much  Price: 3.5/5  Overall reasonable for the huge portion size!  unfortunately cash or debit only  Overall: 3.5/5  Overall very satisfying and filling breakfast!  It was good to finally have poutine... Not sure this would be my daily breakfast choice but definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"J'aime beaucoup celle aux merguez.  Le service est un peu lent, victime de son succès. Ca reste un incontournable"}
{"text":"Here's how the conversation went between me and my Montrealer friend, in my first visit to his hometown: - Have you tried the poutine yet? - Yes, but I didn't find it too special - well, maybe because I've tried only the ones from Harvey's and Burger King... - Right, so you haven't tried the poutine yet.  If this is how poutine is, it's tremendously good. We had the Matty, and the large portion satisfied me and my wife. All of this for only twenty bucks. The atmosphere is perfect for a good night of talking, laughing and eating.  Surely will come back whenever possible."}
{"text":"We showed up here at 7pm on new years day, when nearly everything else in Montreal was closed.  We got in the outside line to eat inside the restaurant, but after 15 minutes of waiting, we realized the line was probably at least 90 minutes.  *People were waiting 90 minutes outside on a freezing cold night*.  This is a good sign for the quality of food.  At that point I noticed that people were able to walk in and place to-go orders very quickly - and there were cabs waiting out front.  We decided with our hunger, our best option was to order to go and cab home.  Surprisingly, the Poutine stands up very well even when ordered to go and suffering a 10 minute cab ride.  I got a poutine with sausage, banana peppers and tabasco sauce, and it was fantastic.  The three keys of Poutine (gravy, fries and cheese curd) were all perfectly prepared and very high quality.  Prices are very reasonable.  Even the small size was too much food for a meal for one.  Every good food city has a few places that are shockingly good for what they are, La Banquise Poutine is one of these places for Montreal."}
{"text":"Average fries, Average sauce, Average cheese, Average toppings, Average price, Average service, Average waiting time, Average review."}
{"text":"T rex poutine is a must have. It was hot dog, ground beef,bacon.  The original poutine was okay. The gravy on its own is a little bland, but with the meat combination, it was amazing."}
{"text":"My first time in Montreal and everyone said I had to try poutine and I had to go to La Banquise to try it. We walked over from our Airbnb and saw the line from down the block. As much as a long line can be discouraging, I was happy because I took it to mean the food would be good. We waited about 30-45 minutes before we were seated. The staff was friendly and accommodating since my friend and I had never been there before so we took a while studying the menu. There were a few poutine options but we stuck with La Classique (regular poutine), which didn't take long to come out. My first time trying poutine...it was great and worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Was the perfect diner spot after a weekend of eating camp food with my boyfriend. Great veggie options! Im a vegan and my boyfriend is a vegetarian. We split vegan poutine!!! (One of my childhood favorites, except I never had it veganized!) and both ordered veggie burgers. Not expensive at all. Friendly wait staff! Would eat here again next time in Montreal."}
{"text":"So my friend who lives in Montreal told me this was the best poutine around. The first con I have is that I waited for an hour outside in the cold. I heard it is a late night eat so maybe I should've expected that at 3 am. We got the classic and the bacon poutine. It's definitely worth the wait. Both are great. Love cheese curds and they just melt all over. Would've like a little more gravy and cheese but the food was still amazing"}
{"text":"Great variety of poutine... But depending on time of day and which chef is there the crispiness of the fries are not always the same..."}
{"text":"came here and got the veggie poutine, called the Rachel I think. Damn good. The portion was huge, but it was also $15 CAD. They loaded it with fries, cheese, onions, mushrooms, bell peppers and what not. I would add some salt to the poutine, and maybe some tabasco. But that's my preference. Tad pricey if you ask me.   Also, these guys don't accept american credit cards. Can you freaking believe it. Is it 2018 or 1918. Blah. Anyway, yeah."}
{"text":"Pros: Bacon poutine is amazing. Bravo! 5 stars!  Cons: It's a very long line for tourists on touristy days! Poutine with guacamole was bland: the avacado didn't have any taste and had a gritty texture.  So if you order right (and there are a lot of options), it's great!"}
{"text":"This place always hits the spot when I'm in the mood for poutine. It is a staple in the poutine lover's life! They have a pretty impressive scope of flavors in their menu. There is a poutine for everyone's taste. The only downside of La Banquise is that if you stop by late on weekends, you will most likely have to wait in a line to enter the restaurant. If it weren't for this, I'd give it a 5-star rating."}
{"text":"I've never seen so many versions of poutine! If you thought poutine is just fries, gravy and cheese, think again! Whether it's meat (or multiple meats), vegetables or other sauces that you want on it, it can be done at La Banquise.   So many choices, once you can get in of course. I've been a few times, and I've waited about 30 minutes each time to get a seat. Even the time I went in at around 1am.  For delicious poutine (and I use the term lightly cause there are so many different types), stop by the Banquise, but make sure you have some time."}
{"text":"This is the Place you want to go to if your looking to fulfill your poutine fix. They have over 20 varieties of poutine but it being my first time I wanted to stick with the classic fries, onions, churds and gravy. The key to great poutine is crunchy fries and a rich salty gravy which La Banquise more than delivered. My breathe reaked like poutine for the rest of the night but i defiantly wore it proud."}
{"text":"Soooo many poutine options! I chose to keep it relatively simple and just got the smoked meat poutine but boy oh boy was it delicious! One tip for late night visitors is if you dine-in after 9pm they have you pay right when you order so be prepared for that (note: if you're paying by card they only take Canadian bank credit cards, no US credit cards) Great spot if you're looking for some next level poutines!"}
{"text":"La Banquise c'est le spot par excellence pour manger de la poutine, de la vraie poutine québecoise ! Cet établissement est ouvert 24/24 et ne fait quasiment que ça ! En été après une soirée animée sur le plateau ou en hiver pour venir prendre quelques calories de confort, la Banquise est un incontournable selon les Montréalais. Certes, ici c'est ambiance fast food et tout public mais on ne peut qu'apprécier l'ambiance du lieu, la sympathie du personnel et le plaisir que c'est de se retrouver ici autour de ce plat mythique !   Frites et fromage, il n'en faut pas plus pour faire ce plat qui est la star ici ! On peut l'agrémenter de sauces, de suppléments, etc.... J'ai préféré prendre la classique pour me dire que j'avais testé la vraie poutine, la vraie de vraie !  A 1h du matin, il y a encore la queue dehors pour venir manger ici, j'adore l'ambiance de ce fast food que tout bon québécois a dans son carnet d'adresse.  PS: J'ai vu dans quelques boutiques de souvenirs des t-shirts \"I love poutine\"... Ne le portez qu'au Québec hein !"}
{"text":"Best poutine in Montreal, opened 24 hours and reasonable prices  We were looking for an authentic, non-fancy place for poutine in Montreal and this was awesome! We ordered the regular Poutine BOM (Bacon, Onions, Mersquez Sausages)  with Black Pepper sauce, which was perfect for 3 people to share (we had other side dishes too but just could not stomach a whole poutine by ourselves). I'm not sure how other people have 1 poutine to themselves...it's way too salty, rich and 1 dimensional to finish one individually. *shudder*  The black pepper sauce was the way to go; not too peppery...just right.  The fries were crunchy and crispy- perfect fries.   We were there at Noon on Sunday and it was pretty much empty. We left around 1p and still...no craziness.  Not sure when ppl go to brunch in Montreal...but in SF, it'd have been an hour ++ long wait at that time.   Lucky us"}
{"text":"La Banquise has an extensive selection of poutine.  There are other things on the menu of course, but you really go here for the poutine.  After a night of drinking, this is where Montreal'ers go to get their eat on.  All their poutines are traditional poutines with added ingredients.  The last time I went was with a group of friends, where I had the smoked meat poutine (traditional with smoked meat), my wife had the Elvis (traditional with beef, green peppers, mushrooms), and my friends had the traditional and the Dan Dan (traditional with pepperoni, bacon and onions).    They make a great poutine here!  There are two sizes, and the regular is a meal in itself.  The gravy is tasty, you get a good amount of cheese curds and the fries are better than most.  They typically like a flimsy, moist french fried potato in Quebec, similar to a five guys style...Personally I prefere a crispier fry, especially when adding gravy.  La Banquise makes them pretty good, comparatively speaking to other restaurants in Montreal."}
{"text":"Out of all the poutine I had in Montreal, I think this might've been my least favourite. There was a sweetness to the fries that didn't really work with the gravy and curds. At least not for me. It was also pretty bland. Some friends of mine that live in Montreal say it's been going downhill over the past few years. I was kinda disappointed because a Vancouver friend told me great things about it. I didn't even finish my plate because it didn't seem worth it.  However, it was pretty packed in here and everyone seemed pretty stoked on theirs, so there must be something good about this place."}
{"text":"The poutine is delicious. The space is bright and lively and cramped, but everyone is very nice and service is attentive. For Americans going abroad: Know your debit is not accepted here. There's an ATM at the front for you with pretty decent exchange rate!"}
{"text":"Same as my last review 2 years ago; If you want Poutine in Montreal, there's no better option."}
{"text":"Poutine Rachel.  So good you'll want to rub it all over your face!"}
{"text":"You can't do much better for a huge plate of sloppy vegan poutine than this place. Any poutine can be veganized in several ways, including vegan cheese and vegan gravy. The staff was happy to answer my questions. Highly recommended for vegans."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, pretty good service, ok food.  It is such a cute place but the food took forever. Our server was very nice and checked in on our table several times but the kitchen was so slow. The food was fine, my sandwich was a little cold but it was still tasty. Everyone seemed to be having a great time, and it seemed like a pretty popular place because when we left the line was out the door. It was definitely cute but I'm not sure I would return if I visit the  area again."}
{"text":"Oh poutine, where has your creamy fried richness been all of my life?  Resto la banquise is the mecca of poutine spots. They make it practically any which way you want.   A couple hours after landing in MTL, we decided this is where I should have my first poutine experience.  It was about 1pm or so, and there was no horde of people waiting to be seated but we were left waiting at the host area for a good sub 10 minutes while servers walked back and forth, passing by the very obviously waiting US numerous times.  Minus a point for that.   We were finally seated, a nice little booth by a window overlooking the outside.  The menu was a bit overwhelming, not necessarily because it was written solely in french (I have a fair aptitude of the language), rather because there were so many options!   Now I'm undoubtedly a carnivore, no ifs ands or buts, so I had to get myself a meaty dish of poutine.  We ordered the Poutine Mart (bacon, smoked sausage and mushrooms) and Poutine Italienne (meatsauce).    The dishes are large, even their regular sized plates. And their poutine is oozing with toppings.    The fries were cooked well enough, lacked that bit of crisp that I generally like. The gravy was a  nice rich brown gravy. Fair amount of cheesecurds, but you can never have too much of that anyway. I was disappointed in the lack of bacon, and the fact that they used hotdogs (i think) vs smoked sausage. Overall, not bad, but not what I was expecting.  The 2nd dish of poutine with the meatsauce was pretty good. The cheesecurds were melty and the sauce was reminiscent of a filipino meatsauce, with a slight sweetness to it.   Prices are moderate, under $10 a plate.  Would definitely return to gain some redemption for my first experience, as I'm sure they can pull off something magically and deliciously fattening."}
{"text":"Fantastic poutine! We got the classic and the gravy had tons of delicious flavor and the cheese curds were very tasty too. My wife and I split a large which was huge.  Don't bother getting the chicken sandwich. It's was basically a McChicken for 4x the price.  Make the effort to try the poutine and if looking to be adventurous try one of there many variations."}
{"text":"This place is great! We're visiting from Florida, so some authentic poutine was what we were looking for and I think we found it here. They have a number of poutine options that add things like onions, bacon, sour cream (basically the Savoyarde, which is what I got), guac, hot dogs, etc. you can also just go for the classique poutine. The portions were huge, so if you're getting other food like a burger, you could probably just split the order of poutine with someone. I also ordered the Chevre burger and replaced the meat with a veggie patty. The veggie patty was really good, didn't taste frozen, and the burger in general came our beautiful and looked like a picture in a burger ad. The burger came with a really good sized slab of goat cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, and their special sauce. The food was delicious, but we just could not finish it all, so we ended up taking it to go. The waitress was super friendly and they switch from French to English once they realize you don't speak French haha. She was very attentive and we got our order pretty quickly. I'd definitely want to come back and try their other varieties of poutine!"}
{"text":"After spending the night out for drinks, the absolute best late night drunk food to have in Montreal is a poutine. Now I didn't just want any poutine. No, I had to try one of La Banquise's famous 20+ varieties of poutines. While I heard about their notoriously crazy long lines to get in, maybe because it was 3 am, but when I went I was able to thankfully get a seat easily. With so many choices, I quickly ruled out the classic poutine, but I'm sure it's good. I decided on a more unique poutine like La Fred Caillou (smoked meat, ground beef, spicy sausage, merguez sausage, cheese, and gravy). I got the regular size and I struggled to finish it since it was so rich and portions are generous. The poutines here are awesome and they are so worth the hype!  By the way, for Americans like me who don't know how to speak and read French, La Banquise also has an all-English menu too :)"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm.........poutine. I got back from a vay-cay in Montreal after Memorial Day, and I'm still thinking of sinking my teeth into some damn good poutine from this damn good place, and regretting that I've only been there once. First stop on my next Montreal trip: La Banquise!  My traveling companion and I went around lunch, when it wasn't crowded and ordered La Classique, with french fries, cheese curds, and barbecue sauce (which is really gravy) to go. The french fries were soft in certain places, crispy in others, and the sauce? YUM. The cheese was delish, although it didn't go squeak-squeak like another waiter from anther place told me it should. Hmmmm.... should that be my next quest in Montreal: finding poutine with squeaky cheese?  Whatever my next quest will be, I'm sure I'll stick a visit to La Banquise in there on my very first day back. Shame they don't have an American branch in NYC."}
{"text":"Nothing beats walking about montreal during the night and eating poutine. Always worth a visit, although I prefer to stick with the original offerings and never really venture to try out other ones. Great crispy fries with delicious gravy."}
{"text":"Hands down the best poutine place in town! Their poutine is simply on another level compared to any other place. You'll always find something different because they offer a huge choices of toppings for the poutine! Also a great place to crash for an after party, clubbing meal or if you are hangover you should come here and sober yourself with some deliciosoo poutine!"}
{"text":"Delicious poutine and very friendly staff. The atmosphere is great. I tried the traditional poutine, but can't wait to go back and try on of the variations...our Uber driver recommended the T-Rex."}
{"text":"Easily the best poutine I have ever eaten. I got La Classique, wolfed it down, and then felt very sick for about ten minutes afterward. But that's why you don't wolf down poutine-- I should have known better. Be warned: portions here are large! I agree with the person below who thinks three poutines for four people is just the right amount.   We went mid-afternoon on a Sunday and there was a short line, but we were seated quickly and got our food promptly as well. My only complaint was that the place is a bit cramped and after we were finished eating our waitress kept checking back to see if we were all set with the check. It felt rushed!"}
{"text":"Les poutines sont très bonnes, le cadre aussi, très spécial. Le line up peut être des fois horriblement long... Le service est correct pour un endroit aussi achalandé. Ma préférée reste la Elvis, malgré que la Pop, spéciale de la poutineweek, est vraiment super aussi!"}
{"text":"I don't typically go to places that seem overly hyped, but this place was very good. The poutine  (I had classic) was better than expected. If you speak no French, that's okay, because they staff is very English speaking friendly. Not expensive by any stretch of the imagination.   Pas mal, pas du tout."}
{"text":"Wow! The poutine in this place is just seriously good! When we got here, the line was pretty long. We said to each other, \"wow, the line is long, the poutine here better damn good!\"   We finally seated, checked out their menu. They have a large selection of poutine. We ordered the classic poutine & the pizza poutine. The place was packed & almost everyone there ordered nothing but poutine.  The food finally came & wow!! Just like what we said to each other earlier, it was good! So damn good! Now we know why people willing to line up to get inside this place. We can't say anything bad about the poutine here. Everything was just perfect! Flavorful! Delicious! Mind blowing!!!   We were here in a late afternoon & the line was definitely long. This place is open 24 hours. If you are a night owl, this place is probably best if you come late night.   This is definitely a must place to check out for anyone visiting Montreal. Good food, fast service, friendly staff, generous portions, great price!"}
{"text":"24 hours of fried potato, cheese curds and gravy?  With a really vast menu, this place is definitely a must IF you are in a large group and want poutine like nobody's biznass.  It's good, my friends exclaimed the best.  But I'd generally say slightly better than average (3.5) stars.  If you go here do it in a big group, order a few small plates of different things and pig out!  *patio in the back is THE only place to sit, inside is kinda dark feeling."}
{"text":"Really nice place but I don't believe they serve anything other then poutine after a certain hour. Sad because I'm not a big cheese fan but a must visit place !"}
{"text":"This is THE place to go for poutine. Recommended by a local. So many creative options. Must try!"}
{"text":"This is such a fun, hipster poutine joint. A colorful board outlining the poutine variations greets you at the door. That's if a long line extending outside doesn't greet you first. Luckily, we arrived right before the afternoon rush and made it just in time to beat the line leading outside the door on a frigid Sunday afternoon. La Banquise is just that good.   I came for poutine, but easily got seduced by the veggie burger on the menu. Not to fear, La Banquise provides a burger and poutine option. How clever. You can do basic fries, a classic poutine (gravy and cheese curds), or dress it up to a poutine special for a few more bucks. Of course I went all the way and ordered the veggie burger with La Taquise--a Mexican spin on poutine with guacamole and sour cream. The veggie burger is your standard soy patty and sesame bun, topped with coleslaw. It's quite the filler. The poutine side is a hefty portion and food overload. I couldn't even finish, but it was surely delicious. Add a local beer and you're all set to waddle out in poutine bliss."}
{"text":"La Banquise must be the biggest tourist scam for outsiders looking for poutine. Because if you're from here, you'd default to Poutineville if you were really out of ideas.  It's not cheap, the service is consistently slow and terrible, and it's just overall not a great poutine. Average fries, average gravy, pretentious attempt to make a big deal out of the dish with unnecessary combinations. A case in point is their contestant poutine for this year's Poutine Week (an annual poutine contest in February). It's some sort of Mexican theme attempt with pepper sauce, canned corn, and an uninspiring fried jalapeño on top. The only 4 pieces of curds can be seen from the picture. And in case you're wondering, yes they put a mountain pile of sour cream on top of a soggy iceberg leaf. There are no points for creativity if execution is a failure.  I normally restrain myself from giving 1 star for mediocre food when the establishment can redeem itself with good service or atmosphere. But when it's being proclaimed as the best in town and it can't deliver something half-decent - now you're really asking for it. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that it's open 24h. Sorry for ruining the hype."}
{"text":"Montreal staple!  Came here during the winter and got the classic hot dogs, ground beef and gravy poutine as well as the Mexican inspired one with guacamole, cheese, ground beef and tomato! I personally liked the Mexican inspired one better because it was less heavy. The poutine after awhile can get very heavy but having the balance of the refreshing tomato and guacamole certainly helped with the completion of this very satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"Based on Yelp Talk forums, this is the place for some poutine. The best time to come is for dinner or late evening so that what we did. We headed here around 8:30PM and didn't have to wait long to get a booth.  The place was playing some French hip hop tunes which was pretty cool to listen to. We got our waters and menus and here's what was ordered:  -Large size poutine - 3 Amigos ($12.40 CAD): smoked sausage, pork and beef sausage and Merguez sausage was the addition to the standard gravy, cheese curd and french fry dish. It was okay...I couldn't really find the 3 different sausages...only found 2. The sausages tasted like hot dogs and I found the addition of 3 meats a bit too salty for me. -Regular size poutine Classique ($5.80 CAD): the standard poutine dish. I enjoyed this more than the 3 Amigos. The simpler the better! I didn't know  what to expect with cheese curds, but I thoroughly enjoyed them and am now wondering...what exactly are cheese curds? -Cider Mystique ($6.25 CAD): I asked the waitress if this was a fruity cider and when she simply said \"apple cider,\" I knew I wanted it, even though it was more expensive than their beers. Light and fruity...it was tasty, but I still enjoy Lambic!  The portions are adequate. We had 3 people and were able to finish both plates of food. The regular size is a good portion for one person. If you have a group of people, the larger size is probably better. Don't forget, it's basically a dish of fries so you will get full fast...especially if you're downing a cold beer!  They do serve other items than just poutine and the place is open 24hrs so it's a great place for some comfort, filling food. Apparently, after 9PM you're required to pay the bill before eating vs. paying the bill after you've eaten.  This is a great place for groups and when you just want to relax and kick it with some friends. A definite low-key, no frills, local type of place."}
{"text":"This is the best place to go when you are drunk, I will never get tired of their Mexican Poutine. Best place to chill with your friends after a long night."}
{"text":"The holy grail of poutine.  As a poutine lover who sadly doesn't live in QC, La Banquise is a must see on any trip to Montreal... some places in Upstate NY/Golden Horseshoe have poutine but none are as great as here.  The service is prompt and the prices are very reasonable, but let's be real the main draw is the amazing poutine.  The white peppery gravy is a personal favorite, but the pepper stays with you for quite a while.  Its 100% awesome.  And be sure to walk around Parc La Fontaine after for a nice little walk around an awesome city."}
{"text":"Whenever I have clients from out of town, this place is a MUST visit as they have the best Poutine in Montreal"}
{"text":"went there with friends as it was suggested as the best poutine place. and it's TRUE! not only the selection and variety of the poutine is great and the prices are cheap, and the portions are huge but they also have veg sauce as an option for EVERY and EACH poutine they have on the list!!!! how can it get more awesome than that???? the answer is NOHOW=)) hahaha  highly recommended if you love poutine as much as I do=)  the staff is friendly. the place is open late and they serve alcool too=)  oh and a reminder: don't order large poutine portion unless you're extremely hungry! we were two people sharing reg sized poutine and we couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"THE best restaurant for Poutine! You can't even dream of all of the flavor combinations on this menu."}
{"text":"The vegan poutine is not vegan even though it is advertised as such. Yes, they use vegan gravy, yes they use vegan cheese, but the fries are fried in the same oil as their chicken. Vegans beware."}
{"text":"I don't think there's any other restaurant in Montreal that has so much variety in terms of Poutine. There's something for everyone - even the vegans.   I love it!"}
{"text":"I get that they're very, very popular and busy with customers at all hours of the day, but that's no excuse for rude service. We came in around 3 after the line had died down a lot, but it was still packed. We were seated after 10 minutes and were given menus, but that's all we received. No one ever came to check in to give us waters / drinks or ask for our order. We waited patiently for about 20 minutes while people around us got asked their orders, served water and their meals! The table next to us came in a little before we did and they had their meals served and we still haven't even been checked in on!  We flagged down 3 different waiters, who kept telling us that our waiter would be with us shortly. It's one thing if we just sat there and did nothing, but we actually tried to grab someone's attention - apparently not one of them was actually our waiter. I get that maybe our waiter then is maybe just too busy but one of those three should have been able to notify him / her. Still nothing after waiting for about an 45 minutes so we just left. Not one word was said to us as we were leaving - no waiter, no hostess had said anything to us.   The absolute worst service ever, and we didn't even stop at a peak time!"}
{"text":"Being a huge lover of poutine, I was very excited to finally try La Banquise. Unfortunately, the poutine lacked on all fronts. The fries were decent, but the gravy was too thin and the cheese didn`t squeak, a big non-no for me. Also didn`t help that halfway through my poutine I found a blonde hair, definately not my hair color! The experience was very disappointing since I really wanted to love this 24 hr poutine joint, but nothing about my visit would convince me to go back. If you want to try a great poutine, I`d suggest Ma-Am-M Bolduc, it`s a tiny place in the Plateau but serves one of the best poutines I`ve ever had."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever having poutine, it was AMAZING AND DELICIOUS! I got the original since that would be the best for a first time, the portion was massive for just being small and when seeing the large portion that would of just put me in massive food coma. I would of loved to order so many to go so I could take it back home. The prices are great, the service is great and the place atmosphere was fun. I will defiantly come back here again!"}
{"text":"Pour certains, c'est une attrape touriste. Pour d'autres c'est LE spot pour aller manger une poutine. Peu importe, ça reste un must pour manger de la poutine. En plus, le resto est ouvert 24h sur 24. Pas étonnant qu'il y ait souvent des line-up pour avoir une table, et ce même à 3h du matin. Une poutine ça fait un super snack de fin de soirée!  Ce que j'aime moins, c'est qu'on dirait qu'il ont ajouté plus de tables sur le même espace. Résultat, on se sent pas mal coincé dans le resto. Je trouve que les prix des poutines bien, par contre un ajout fait monter vite la facture. Aussi, les bières ont des prix surélevé. Payé 7$ pour une bouteille de Boreale, c'est cher. Bref, poutine mexicaine, un ajoutet une bière 30$"}
{"text":"When you have friends in town for the first time it's pretty much necessary to take them here before they leave. Always a busy spot, always fast service and always friendly despite how busy it is. The variety available is incredible and they even have tasty vegan options! They have burgers and sandwiches available but if you go for that then you're missing the point of even being there!"}
{"text":"Incredible variety of different poutines, all of them delicious! You can get a huge portion, literally huge, for as much as $9. Would definitely recommend T-Rex, but all in top 4 are good."}
{"text":"Poutine was tasty but this place isn't Tourist friendly at all. ATM machine was broken and they won't accept any credit or debit card that's U.S. based. Accepted U.S. Cash at par rounding up to the bill you have. I ended up paying about double. $40 US for a $22CDN check."}
{"text":"Restaurant à poutine, une institution parait-il ... en tout cas, à faire absolument lorsque vous visitez, comme ce fut le cas pour moi, Montréal.  Service impeccable, rapide et souriant. Décoration du restaurant mignon comme tout. Des prix plus que corrects.  Et alors la poutine ? Bah ça reste une poutine, c'est gras, c'est gros, ça bourre, mais ça fait plaisir. J'ai pu tester la poutine T-Rex, à base de viande hachée, saucisse, bacon ... et taille \"Grande\" ... rhaaa je ne le regrette pas, mon ventre non plus même s'il a eu du mal à encaisser.  Attention lorsque vous prenez une poutine \"grande taille\", assurez-vous d'avoir l'estomac bien accroché et surtout vide.  Ô Poutine, que tu es bien grasse, Ô Poutine, tu finiras in my ass, Ô Poutine, tu me bourres l'estomac, Ô Poutine, tu m'as mis dans le coma."}
{"text":"I went to Resto La Banquise to experience poutine for the first time and I must say I was not disappointed. It was everything I expected. Greasy fries, thick gravy and hunks of unmelted cheese.  I had to wait in line for about 45 minutes before getting a table, but that was probably a good thing, I don't think I could have finished a small plate of poutine without being woozily hungry.   The service was fast, but since it was past 9:00 the bill had to be paid in advance. After the order was placed it only took about 10 minutes to get the food and a lot longer to eat our way through that thick mess of fat.   The food was basically awesome. I had the bacon poutine which I gathered was just the regular poutine with bacon on top. If you're going to have grease why not go all the way, right? It was super cheap, about 7 bucks a plate for the small and filled me up for the remainder of the night. In fact, I hardly wanted to move after eating all of that. I would definitely go back, especially after a night at a bar. That would be so amazing. I can't even imagine..."}
{"text":"What's a visit to Montreal without visiting this stalwart. Everything we (over)ate here was good. We shared the \"classic\", the \"elvis\" (I'm from Memphis afterall), and the \"matty\" and left full and happy that we had experienced authentic Montreal-style poutine."}
{"text":"Awesome poutine! I always make sure to go when I'm in town!   I remember loving their original classic, then as a vegetarian I really enjoyed their vegan sauce and now as a vegan I'm loving their vegan sauce with vegan cheese! Nice to know that they can still cater to me and deliver the same happy memory and experience that I'm use to!!!  My favorite is the Rachel- green peppers, mushrooms,  caramelized onions (sometimes I substitute the green peppers for green peas... YUM).  A few of us got a bunch of different vegan ones and shared. The Taquise (substitute the sour cream for caramelized onions) and the Mexican are all very good too. Fun experience and yummy late night poutine!"}
{"text":"I have tried a few different smoked meat sandwiches and A LOT of different poutines during my visit. Needless to say, this place has the best of both. The service was really good. The atmosphere was cute. I was worried about it being busy due to other reviews, so, I did arrive at around 10am just to be sure I would not hit a huge crowd. I am not sure I would wait 40+ minutes for a seat, but if you're willing to wait or go early, it's 100% worth it."}
{"text":"Very long line. Very good service. They have a good selection of beer here all out of a bottle. The sodas are in cans, no soda fountain. The Poutine was very good ... the fries could have been a little better. And the toppings a little more savory.  The burger was delicious. It was the Montreal Burger. I asked the waitress to make sure it was cooked medium rare and she said all their burgers have to be cooked well done. And when I got the burger, I saw that it didn't have a patty , just smoked meat which was like pastrami. But, again it was very delicious."}
{"text":"I had heard of poutine from my Canadian friends who hyped it mercilessly. \"You have to eat Poutine! We're taking you out for poutine first thing. It's the best.\" As a lover of all things food I was excited to try this regional favorite, but nervous it might not meet my expectations.  Nick recommended I stick with the poutine classique as the added ingredients on the specials would mask the flavors of the gravy/cheese curd*. I was absolutely ravenous after my 7 hour drive and dove right in. The hype was well deserved. Rich brown gravy complements the fries - slightly crispy on the outside perfectly soft inside -without overwhelming. Warm, chewy cheese curds round out the dish perfectly. All three elements are critical but none dominates. The perfect bite has all three.   Hungry as I was, I ate George's leftovers in addition to my regular size order. He had ordered the tre viande (\"three meats\"). It wasn't bad at all but made me glad I went with the classic for my first time. The ground beef hash was bland and didn't add anything and the bacon flavor was almost completely undetectable. Thankfully the tangy sausage strips (cut to look like fries) stood out and really added to the standard poutine elements without trying to take over.   There's other stuff on the menu but I wouldn't come for anything other than the poutine. After a certain time in the evening they make you pay right after your order because they get a lot of drunk dine-and-dashers.  Cash is your best payment option."}
{"text":"This place is legendary, but even tough their poutines are great, it's not 'the' best imho. Excellent poutine, mais pas la meilleure!"}
{"text":"Great Poutine and hearty portions, like  a diner which serves only french fries with various meats and toppings. Great for what it is, very very casual open 24 hrs! lots of drunks at night, which itself can be entertaining to watch!"}
{"text":"The vibe starts at the never-disappearing lineup. Busy sitting area but faster to take out. Now as for Putine. Their versions are awesome, we had Taquise with guacamole and pulled pork Putine. Both were great tasting. Also good micro brewery beers.  However, when it comes to orthodox Putine concepts,  their cheese curds did not melt as suppose to. So with this traditional criteria which is the Putine foundation i believe Le Banquise is a tad short of tradition. The service is great and bilingual though.  Give it solid 4 stars for experience."}
{"text":"This place was rated the #1 poutine spot by many source online, so we gave it a try for lunch. At first, we were moderately grossed out by the sheer amount of poutine per portion. Thinking we would simply be overstuffed with grease/cheese, we ended up ordering 2 poutines to share for the table and then individual entrees. Boy was that a mistake! The poutines were delicious and despite our very delicious entrees, we were craving more poutine!   One downside is that this place is incredibly busy, and if you come when you're hungry, the wait time will feel like an eternity, especially when you're constantly surrounded by the aromas of gravy and fries!"}
{"text":"Location: On the Plateau. The closest subway is probably Mont-Royal, street parking available (metered). But, if like me you prefer to burn off the calories BEFORE you stuff your face, I suggest walking from Point A to Point B.   The place: La Banquise is of a decent size but it's not extra-large and seating is a little cramped. Be prepared for someone's arse to accidentally meet your face. Also, keep in mind that you're not going for the decor, which may or may not remind you of the 80s or 90s (and HEY - how about those Backstreet Boys in the background?!). When we got there, we didn't have to wait for a table, which is rarity in these parts. Of course, we chose a random time of day to get our poutine on (around 2pm).  The goods: I wasn't feeling adventurous when I went so I got the Classic. My friend opted for the chicken and peas with vegan cheese. I'm aware of the Banquise's fab reputation, however though very good, I can't say I was blown away by my poutine. Did I enjoy it? Yes I did. The fries were good, the sauce was good - it could have used a little more cheese. I was pretty satisfied with my overall experience but if I were given a choice between La Belle Province and La Banquise, it would be a tough call between the two. All of that said, they ARE the poutine specialist and they offer a variety of crazy options so you should definitely check'em out.   Service: Friendly.  Price point: I think the small Classic was about $8."}
{"text":"J'adore La Banquise. La sauce, le fromage, l'endroit sans prétention :-) De la Classique aux poutines les plus complexes, tout le monde y trouve son compte. Delish!!"}
{"text":"Hype or nah? I'm going to have to say low key hype. Coming from the USA, I feel that I prefer fully loaded fries to this. They aren't exactly the same thing but I was not in love with this dish. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad but not \"wow, I can't wait to come back\"...  I ordered the classic and the la matty. If you don't know what poutine is, it's basically fries, gravy, cheese, and loaded toppings of your choice. I feel like this place would be great after a few beers and 2 am in the morning. Perhaps I'm not a fan of \"wet\" fries. Crispy fries are everything to me with melted cheese. The cheese here is in curds FYI. It might be a cultural difference but for me, id pick fully loaded fries over poutine any day."}
{"text":"Bruyant, bruyant, bruyant ... Mais tellement bon qu'on y retournerais quand même ! Certainement une des meilleures poutines de Montréal.   N'ayez pas peur d'affronter la file d'attente à l'extérieur, les quelques minutes perdues en vaudront largement le coup !"}
{"text":"I see what the rage is about...it's poutine but on steroids. Order as many toppings as you want. We ordered the La Folie but added onion rings...delicious!!! Ps: they only accept CA credit cards or cash!!**"}
{"text":"Literally no better or worse than any poutine I've ever had anywhere. Don't believe the hype."}
{"text":"The poutine wasn't so great, the merges sausages that came with it had a very odd taste and left me unsatisfied with the whole meal. Gravy was too salty and not hot enough, fries were too saugy and the ground beef was overwhelming."}
{"text":"First-time poutiners and we're hooked!  When we walked in, it was packed, and was even more so when we left -- a true local hangout. I got the classique, which is brown sauce and cheese curds, and my husband got the poutine rachel- peppers, onions, and mushrooms, (and we asked for porc saucisse on top) -- yummm!!!  Needless to say, we were proud members of the clean plate club.  A must go when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Excellente. Parfait pour découvrir cette spécialité.  Accueil et service impeccable et très rapide.  Perso j'ai testé la savoyarde =) A quand la prochaine?"}
{"text":"Some of the best poutine in Montreal, and the line outside speaks for itself. This place is open 24/7, so if you can have poutine for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a late night snack. They offer a lot of different variations of poutine."}
{"text":"Took my mom, from vegas, and she fell in love to poutine. Shes not poutine type but she loved their poutine. We waited 40 min.. but worth it. Be expected to wait and very crowded.  Their beer is good and service is very fast!!"}
{"text":"Wow. When people say, \"Be prepared for a wait\", they ain't lyin'! We wandered over to La Banquise on a Monday mid-morning, after a grueling hike up Mont Royal. We were sweaty, probably stinky, and absolutely hungry.  Everybody said that THIS was the place to go for your poutine fix. And they were right - the sheer variety of poutine plates boggled the mind. But, I'm getting ahead of myself.  There was quite the line when we arrived, which we expected. It wasn't horrible - we were all inside the establishment, instead of trailing out onto the street, as I'd heard can happen. The front register area was kind of a cluster, because there's one door with a random glass piece in front of it, which meant that people had to step to one side or the other to enter, which caused a bit of a bottleneck. The register was also right there, so people who were ordering their food to go would end up blocking those entering or exiting.  The host stand is partway into the lobby area, and though they were packed, the two working the stand did a good job of keeping everyone in line and handing out menus to those who needed some reading material while they were waiting. Their menus aren't quite as bad as something like the Cheesecake Factory, but they're close.   So many poutine choices!  We were taken to a table on the patio (no alcoholic beverages allowed out there, in case you're curious), and a waitress was standing next to us before we were even settled. We both ordered water (I tell you, that hike to, up, down and from Mont Royal was beastly!) and set to trying to decipher the menu.  We eventually decided: La Mart (hot dogs, bacon and mushrooms) for me and La BOM (bacon, onions, merguez sausage) for him. It sounded good at the time. We briefly contemplated having \"true\" poutine - nothing cluttering the original version - but neither of us ended up doing that.   We endured quite a wait for the food, but given the place was packed to the gills, it didn't much surprise us. But once the food finally came out, we were stunned. We'd seen plates pass us by - the small variety and the large variety - and made small remarks about each in turn, but once they were set down in front of us...wow. The small was HUGE!   Needless to say, neither of us were able to finish our meals (and I absolutely had eaters-remorse afterwards, knowing that all that walking/hiking and my 3+ mile run around Mont Royal were basically negated by that one plate).   But...I mean. It was pretty tasty. I love hot dogs. I try not to. The French fries were perfectly cooked, the gravy was tasty without being overly salty, and the mushrooms added a nice texture without detracting from the plate. Plus, the cheese curds were melting and gooey, and the perfect complement to all the other stuff going on on top of my plate.  Meanwhile, the hubs was slowly plowing through his plate as well. He enjoyed his, but did remark that the merguez sausage was a little too overpowering for the dish. He snagged a couple of my hot dog pieces and said that he would have preferred that. Conversely, I snapped up a merguez sausage piece, and thought that the bite from the spices really woke up the dish.  To each their own, I guess.  Anyway - the waitresses were all super friendly and accommodating, which was nice. I know they were busy running hither and tither, so the fact that they didn't rush us along or make us feel unwelcome in any way was nice.  If I wasn't at my poutine-capacity (for the rest of my life, I think), I'd absolutely consider going back to La Banquise to try the original version."}
{"text":"BEST poutine experience of my life hands down.  If you were to drive all the way to Montreal, order the Poutine Galvaude and go home, I'd say it was a worthy trip.  Deliciously prepared fries drenched with a deep, rich gravy, topped with pulled juicy chicken and peas.  This thing is a full course meal itself.  I've had wet dreams about this, no other poutine has come close.  On Mont-Royal, La Banquise is an incredible after hours munchies destination.  They're open 24 hours and have over 25 different types of poutine ranging from the Elvis Poutine (Minced meat, peppers and sautéed mushrooms) to their Veggie Poutine (peppers, mushrooms, and sautéed onions).   My only gripe is that Montrealeans have perfected the art of fries, gravy and cheese to a point that Torontonians like me are just bitter and jealous.  Why can't we have a place like this?"}
{"text":"It goes without saying that eating poutine is a must in Montreal. With poutineries all over the city it can make it challenging for a visitor to find the best spot. After reading a few reviews la banquise was the winner for me and my friends.   We arrived around 11:30 with no line at all which was great. We sat got sat immediately to what seemed like the last open table in this super busy spot.   It has the vibe of a diner being open 24Hr and  a menu of basic crowd pleasing food. What is not basic is the long list of the many poutines they offer. The portions are really big and with me not being a huge gravy fan I decided just to steal a couple bites off my friends poutine. She ordered the classic poutine and I ordered a hot dog with cheese.   The food came out very quickly and it was good. Like I previously mentioned I am not a huge fan of gravy so the amazingness of poutine is a bit lost on me. But for what is it it hit the spot. I asked for my hot dog well done and it wasn't crispy at all but it was still tasty.   When we left the line was very long to get in so if you are planning to check this spot out come a little before the lunch rush begins or prepare to wait."}
{"text":"Heard this was the best Poutine spot in Montreal. Coming from Toronto for the weekend we had to try it. Even with the rush of people coming in we were seated in 5 minutes.   There are so many toppings to choose from (tomato meat sauce, sausages, hotdogs, vegan Poutine). I just had to try the classic. And I can say it was so much more tasteful than here in Toronto. The fries tasted fresh and everything about the Poutine was delicious. Highly recommend trying this place out in Montreal.   Lastly it's open 24 hours, that's amazing!!"}
{"text":"Super fun&quirky place! The decor is awesome and the service is good too. Obviously their poutines are amazing. A great place for people who love trying out fun poutine combos !"}
{"text":"This place is so popular, especially early mornings at 4am on a weekend. I thought that it would be fairly empty but no, there was a line up. There are two lines for take out and dine in. We really wanted to go home so we took the take out line. But big mistake. The line went so slow and we waited more than the people who dined in. Anyways, the poutine was amazing. The cheese curds melted with the gravy and the fries were so good. It wasn't too dry or hard, and everything just blended so well together. I don't eat a lot of poutine but this one was wonderful.   Definitely the place for poutine in montreal."}
{"text":"Very large portion for a regular. I got the 3 meat (ground beef, bacon, and hot dog). Very good flavor but fries could be crispier. My friend got the chicken and peas poutine which was very nice. Despite the 20 minute wait, this place is worth it. It really does get crowded.Also, great berry smoothies"}
{"text":"I am by no means a poutine expert, but I quite liked this place. The atmosphere is casual and fun, and the huge selection of poutines is appreciated. Solid."}
{"text":"While visiting Montreal, the only place that everyone told us to visit was La banquise. The Poutine there is a must try. The gravy is delicious. They also have some amazing brownies, with melting chocolate. You should try these also. But beware, it's hard to reserve a place at this restaurant. So plan ahead of time."}
{"text":"how freakin wasted do you have to be to think this is anything close to decent food? the inside of this place looks like a homeless shelter and the staff is no where near giving a fuck."}
{"text":"Of course, when you're in Canada, you must stuff yourself with some artery-cloggingly good poutine. My bf and I decided to share a small plate of poutine cause we had planned an itinerary around food and didn't want to ruin our appetite for other stuff with too much poutine. We ordered La Matty, which was poutine topped with \"bacon, poivrons, champignons, et oignons\" (bacon, peppers, mushrooms, and onions). My bf had had poutine before; I hadn't. He said it was great poutine so I'll have to trust him on that. I just thought it was great heart-attack food in general! My only two complaints are that the fries were a bit too soggy and there wasn't enough bacon. I was expecting crunchier fries; even though they're being doused in gravy, it doesn't mean the fries need to be wilted. Then again, this could be the way Canadians like their fries. Coming from the States, I like my fries with some integrity of crisp. I was also hoping the gravy would have more of a kick; Instead, it was a bit watered down and unflavorful. But, again, maybe I'm just used to American gravy, which can sometimes be overseasoned. Overall, it was still a good plate of poutine.  My bf also ordered a shepherd's pie and two beers: First, the house special, La Banquise, which was too light for his tastes (so I took it instead), and then a L'Ecossaise, a reddish brown beer with hints of caramel and toffee which sat well with him. The shepherd's pie was only ok, nothing exceptional.  Food: 3.5/5 -- good, though I wish the fries were crispier, the gravy more seasoned, and the bacon more plentiful (then again, these may just be US preferences) Service: 4/5 -- great! welcoming, friendly, attentive Atmosphere: 3/5 -- clean, open, brightly-colored space, though a bit noisy  Overall: 3/5 -- good"}
{"text":"Very busy place within walking distance of Parc La Fontaine.  We had been looking for the best poutine in Montreal, and La Banquise fit the bill.  They have the widest variety of poutine styles in Montreal....quite likely.  We had to wait in line for about 10 minutes, and don't dare go past the little sign that says to \"wait here\" or they will tell you to back it up!  So it was our first time trying poutine, what's the big deal?  It's really nothing to write home about unless you're a big fan of fries.  The music playing on their sound system was great, the service was average, and they don't accept US credit or debit cards, so negative points for that.  Still, if you need to try poutine, this is the place."}
{"text":"Un must do pour les touristes de passage à Montréal D'excellentes poutines copieuses et gourmandes Il y a un choix incroyable de garnitures L'idéal est d'y aller un soir après une bonne soirée arrosée! Ouvert 24h, et il y a toujours un line up, même à 3h du matin, même en plein hiver!"}
{"text":"La banquise is very good. The cheese curds were squeaky and melted with the perfect gravy. The poutine is over all very delicious, and this comes from someone who isn't a fan of poutine. It also is open 24 hours, which is awesome for midnight snacks It's perfect for groups and has ok prices. The service is good, not great, but good."}
{"text":"Decent poutine, but over rated. Maybe it was original many years ago, but now many restaurants have better poutine... very cheap."}
{"text":"An institution in Montreal - GO! Lots of variety to try something different if you are not new to poutine. Worth the motherlode of calories to warm your belly on a winter's day or after a drink or three too many."}
{"text":"I wanted to try Poutine for my last night in Montreal. Oddly enough Poutineville was closed so I went to La Banquise and what a wonderful treat it was. Very crowded but they kept the line moving. Lively place, great atmosphere and delicious poutine. I don't know how Canada isn't the most obese or unhealthy country with this devil dish but it's a great winter comfort food!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed. The lines are long. But it is WELL worth the wait to get poutine here. I highly recommend this place, and the next time I'm in Montreal, I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Popped my poutine cherry here during my last visit in Sept 2015. Just had the classic which was a great introduction to the dish for me. Can't wait to come back and try out their other poutine dishes."}
{"text":"Poutine has become something of an art here. And they did not let me down. Came here after a night out with friends and the lines were stupid long but well worth the wait.  There are two lines late at night: eat-in or take-out. Got in the take out and it moved pretty slow but not as slow as eat-in. The menu is out of control. There are so many different kinds of poutine to choose from. Went with the Elvis. Ground beef, peppers, mushrooms and asked for jalapenos.   When i got my order the plate was so hefty. Didn't think a large would be that large considering other things I've seen in Montreal. The flavors were amazing. The gravy was nice and rich and not too salty. The fries held their own and the cheese was above average. The ground beef seasoned just right and there was a great balance of vegetables and just the right amount of jalapenos to make it spicy but not overbearing.  So good I ate it in the park next to it in the rain under a tree. The next time I go to Montreal this is a must stop for me."}
{"text":"Employés gentils et travaillants, portions généreuses, heures d'ouverture pratiques, ambiance chaleureuse !"}
{"text":"The poutine is a bit overrated but honestly i never was u satisfied and the portion are really sufficient. 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Being a non-Canadian, I cannot fully attest the quality of how poutine should actually taste or look since I have nothing to compare it to. However, after being advised that poutine is one of the must-try items when visiting Montreal, I researched poutine places and this was one of the top choices. It is not located in downtown Montreal, but a few stops away when taking the metro.  It is quite a walk when getting off the metro. I was very surprised to see that a line outside the store front was already formed as I make my way towards the end of the line. The wait on the line flew by pretty quick, I don't think I waited more than an hour. - it depends on whether you decide to take out or sit down. The line starts to split into the take out and sit down section. Different type of poutine was painted on the wall, but it was still a bit difficult to see since people were lining up along the walls. As there was 1-2 parties ahead of me, I was finally able to reach for a menu and confirm what I  wanted.   The menu was very extensive and definitely made it harder for someone who has never tried poutine before since I did not even know where to started. After a hard contemplation,  I finally opted in for the La Miam (ground beef, merguez sausage, onions, tomatoes and Swiss cheese).The styrofoam take out box can get a bit messy which is wrapped in a brown paper bag. Luckily, I asked for a plastic bag; it was a bit dirty, but I'm not complaining since it literally dripped everywhere in the paper bag.   It was entirely filled with toppings and the fries were deeply hidden, which I had to dig for. The fries were not how I usually like my fries: crispy. It was pretty good with all the different types of toppings. It definitely gives you the feeling of wanting more because of all the toppings blended  together on top of fries. Seriously who can pass on fries or in this case, poutine?"}
{"text":"It is popular and they offer tons of poutine options along with giant portions. However, you have to expect to feel like garbage after eating here. You can find better poutine in other spots, their optimal market is the late night crowd (when your drunk, grease is your friend) or people who want to try a twist on poutine for the first time."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! I got the original poutine and my mother got one of the burgers and both were amazing! No wonder there was a huge line we had to wait in when we arrived!"}
{"text":"Very good poutine! Extremely filling, we split a few and came home with plenty of extras. They've got so many options you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Bon à 3am après une soirée dans les bars, mais il y a de meilleures poutines à Montréal (et de loin) . Le choix de poutine n'est pas mauvais, mais je ne sais pas si ça justifie le détour. C'est souvent l'endroit recherché par les touristes, ce qui veut dire que c'est souvent bondé.   Ça fait la job, mais je ne comprends pas le hype."}
{"text":"We came here after our late night bar crawl and craving a late night snack. The place was absolutely packed with a line out the door but luckily we had a buddy who had connections. We had a party of 9 and walked right past the line to our table. I've had poutine in the past but never seen a place built around the food itself into a menu. I ordered the three amigos poutine and a cheeseburger. I should've just went with the original or not gotten the burger as well. The poutine was overpowered by the topping of meat but for the most part was enjoyable. The poutine was good but nothing special but I think this is one of those places I have to check out more to give a better review."}
{"text":"It's REAL hard to get poutine, let alone decent poutine, stateside.  On my first trip to Montreal (first of many, I hope), we made this our first stop.  I ordered the BOM.  Bacon, onions, and Merguez sausage.  I could FEEL myself dying.  They should include a free triple bypass with every order.  And yet, one of the most delicious things I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Though I don't have much experience with poutines and can only see myself eating this heart-clogging concoction maybe once a year, if you're in the area, I definitely think that this place is worth a visit.    Poutines come in two sizes: regular and large. But the regular portion is probably enough to feed two. They do not skimp on their ingredients - the portions are massive! I got La Reggae, which came with ground beef, guacamole, diced tomatoes & hot peppers, all atop crispy fries and covered with cheese curds and gravy. I brought leftovers home, and surprisingly they were still very good heated up the next day!"}
{"text":"On y mange assez bien est beaucoup, avec un grand choix de plats mais sa réputation n'est pas vraiment justifiée.. je recommande la nuit à 4h pour être sur de ne pas avoir faim le lendemain"}
{"text":"Really really good Poutine. It's crowded and the waitresses can get your order wrong but they will always correct it. The food can take a while to arrive but the friendly staff will always try to make it right.   The menu is filled with choices. They even have vegetarian Poutine! My favourite is the Obélix Poutine, filled with smoked meat.  If the queue is long, order to go and go to the park. If it's winter, wait in line and go in."}
{"text":"This was our first time in Montreal.  Everyone was telling us to try poutine.  We came here based on Yelp reviews.  The service is very friendly.   I ordered the sour cream and bacon poutine.  It was really good minus the onions.   We also ordered the smoke meat club sandwich.  I wasn't impressed. I think the sandwich needed more meat.   All in all a good place."}
{"text":"This was my first time here when I visited Montreal for the weekend. We went on a Friday afternoon and had to wait about 1/2 hour before getting a table.  I got Le Petite Vie - poutine with ground beef, onions and corn. It was soooo good. The fries were deep fried perfectly - perfect combo of fluffy and crispy. There was a generous amount of cheese curds and the gravy was yummy.   As other yelpers have mentioned, the food makes you feel pretty gross after because it's so greasy. But I don't think poutine should be any other way. Definitely will be returning the next time I'm in the city!"}
{"text":"It's worth the hype. Do you want some real poutine? Go to La Banquise and you will find poutine of any and almost every variety that you could ever ask for. It's a local, casual spot that is filled with tourists and natives alike.   Here's the breakdown: 1. There's a line. Get used to it. There is a heater outside but stay bundled if you're visiting in the winter. 2. This is the Canadian version of no-frills. What you see is what you get. 3. You can find poutine for almost all of your needs ever. 4. Service is minimal. It's a combination of French manners, the no-frills, and volume. Don't walk in with high expectations. 5. You're in and you're out. This isn't really a spot to chill for a while.   It's completely worth a visit here. You'll be able to get a sense of what real poutine is like rather than a lame knockoff to bougie alternatives (in which there is nothing wrong with the latter)."}
{"text":"I normally don't eat fries, but then again this place doesn't serve fries, they serve Poutine!  I loved the variety and the portions were huge. After a long day of snowboarding, extra bacon and gravy was in order."}
{"text":"Is there anything really wrong about a nice hot plate of poutine? La Banquise never disappoints, unless you are looking for a healthy option at this very indulgent restaurant. I prepare myself before I endeavor to eat here, mentally and physically. I eat healthy for days leading up to my meal, I have a light breakfast, maybe no lunch before I embark on a plate of poutine, and I prepare my mental state for the fried goodness that is an experience at La Banquise. They have infinite options to try and their gravy is vegetarian based (super plus for the halal eaters!). I always order a plate of poutine, to SHARE, because let's be real, nobody actually finishes their own, and a side of the mixed appetizer platter which has delicious onion rings, jalapeno poppers and others. The best thing about La Banquise is that it's open 24/7! That means, if you have the munchies late night, are caught in a snow-storm, or just in the mood at 3 am, you have a place to go. The only negative is perhaps that you have to queue up to get a table here, a small price to pay, for honestly the best poutine in town."}
{"text":"Didn't really have a proper benchmark for poutine. But Le Banquise was as good an introduction as one could expect. Hot, crispy fries, proportionate gravy - the flavor or portion not too overwhelming - lots of cheese curds, which had perfect texture - ever so slightly chewy - just right. And my poutine came loaded with meat - smoked, meguez sausage and spicy sausage. All in all, a complete poutine experience.  And it's open twenty four hours. Wool!"}
{"text":"I think that poutine is a very personal thing. For me, it brings back memories of cold winter days in Quebec City. There, the local institution is Ashton, and it doesn't get much better than that.  Poutine is straightforward food. It's messy and cheap. Comfort food implies familiarity, and with that in mind, I think the carnival of toppings that made La Banquise famous is unnecessary and distracting. Their fries and gravy seem to be of secondary importance and quality, whereas in my book these two elements are the heart and soul of poutine, respectively.  This doesn't make the place any less impressive to poutine noobs. Everyone I introduced to the place came out happy and full. I have tried three of their poutines to date, and can now fit an entire regular T-Rex in my poor stomach.  Overall a great place, but there's definitively better poutine in town."}
{"text":"La vanquish is the go to poutine place in Montreal. Great and fast service, consistency and flavourful poutines for all tastes, even vegan! Open 24/hrs, this is the ultimate poutine joint."}
{"text":"Super long line late at night on a Friday, so not sure what they are like during the week. We ended up taking out. I got the one with mushrooms, onions and peppers and bf got the three amigos. The cheese curds were really not good. Very chewy and hard to swallow. The french fries and selection of toppings were great."}
{"text":"I had always wanted to try poutine and finally had the chance to do so.  I asked the concierge where the locals went and she recommended Resto.  I didn't really know what to expect but as others have said it's a combination of comfort food and a hangover cure.  Your tastebuds will thank you as your capillaries slam shut.  Delicious but don't make it a habit."}
{"text":"Came here at like 3am and wasn't really sure what was going on. Last stop of the night!...  There are two different lines, we just got in one. One is take out one is dine in. So, looks like six of us are dining in. The wait probably wasn't that long to get a table, but at the time, it felt like it. They're good at handling the line though.  Lots of different choices on the menu. The six of us got three different kind of poutine to share. I think the group liked the classic er or original or something the best.   I'm giving them 4 stars because it seems like everyone I was with really enjoyed the food, but I'm kinda feeling 3 stars for myself because I don't think poutine is really my thing. It's a little busy with all the toppings. But it's not La Banquise's fault, that's me, so 4 stars!"}
{"text":"La Banquise definitely delivered on delicious poutine. No wait we were seated right away which was awesome especially considering it was noon - lunchtime!  The gravy was just right and not too salty I find that most poutine/gravy is salty so this was just right.  The portions are good as well  I gave this a 4 as I had an experience in the bathroom that turned me off - bad smell and just needed some TLC"}
{"text":"This was our first dinner stop in Montreal at the recommendation of a local. The lines get long. We arrived at 4:45, and the line was to the door. When we left, it was outside.   But it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"The t rex poutine is pretty good,  not amazing. The burger was mediocre at best. The place was so packed and the line out the door took awhile. Worth a one time  visit."}
{"text":"Probably the most fun poutine place out there. So many choices that it's easy to miss the traditional one. I had the BOM, bacon, onion and merguez. Pretty darn good."}
{"text":"True Quebecois poutine! I just returned to Montreal after 10 years in the US where I have been trying to recreate this exact poutine. I have come close but it is wonderful to now have it down the street :)  So far, I have stuck with the classic because I know I like it. For those trying poutine for the first time, this is what I recommend.   Depending on your appetite, a regular may or may not be enough for a meal, but would be perfect as a late night snack. My sister and I shared the large several hours after dinner and struggled to finish.   There is often a line, but it moves fast for eat in! You can also do take-out (clearly marked separate line), but it becomes difficult to wait for your food and hear your number when its busy.  And if you want to add calories to calories, they have beer!!"}
{"text":"Good Poutine. Not the best place for one but it is somewhere worth going to. There are always lots of people though and they don't do reservations so get there early!"}
{"text":"All right so I'm normally not a huge fan of poutine but if you want to have fun with and have a good night there are a lot of extraordinary and unusual poutines at la Banquise. Last time I indulged with a pogo poutine !!! That being said I can't say it is the best poutine I ever or that it is legendary"}
{"text":"So we had to try poutine while in Canada. I already bookmarked this place before getting here and true enough this was one of the places our concierge at the hotel suggested to get some in the city.  Before even walking in, I could already smell the thick aroma of grease in the air. What was I thinking, right? Fried food galore! Very hip and casual atmosphere. The place was loud and packed with a younger crowd mostly in groups. Tables are tightly situated right next to each other. We could hear conversations to our left and to our right but that didn't bother us. It was rather amusing.   After perusing the menu, I decided to get their POUTINE LA SAVOYARDE: bacon, onions, Swiss cheese, sour cream atop a bed of fries covered in \"gravy\". Yes, Americans call it that but I hear Canadians prefer to call it \"brown sauce\". Ok, so it's delicious, but not out of this world amazing. In fact, it's quite overwhelming. Halfway through, I was already forcing it down my throat. It's heavy! No wonder we had people stare at our table when they saw our food. The poutine was only a side dish for my friend and I, while everyone else had it as their main order. And yes, we each had our own poutine!   I got the HAMBURGER STEAK as my main entree. This, too was fried and oozing with the goodness of its juices. The patty was well-seasoned...very yummy! I enjoyed this so much more than the poutine.  Friendly staff and service. Only complaint was the wait for our food. Others who came after us got their orders before we did. Maybe because we had main entrees and they all got poutines only? I guess... Cash only here with an ATM machine inside but they also accept USD. So thankful for that.  Oh and they're open 24/7! Probably because this is good drunk food. Hah!"}
{"text":"Pas de crédit pour payer (doit retirer au ATM avec frais si tu n'est pas avec une banque), sauce plutôt ordinaire et terrasse/intérieur très bruyant. C'était la première fois que je mangeais sur place et je ne crois pas vouloir revivre l'expérience.   Le service fut très long mais somme toute courtois. Il manquait de fromage et saucisses dans ma poutine (Poutine hot dog). Il y a définitivement de meilleurs endroits pour déguster une \" vraie \" Poutine québécoise."}
{"text":"Pretty good poutine. Cheese curds were a bit too chewy, but otherwise nice. Lots of flavor choices, quite heavy. Definitely preferred Comptoir 21, though."}
{"text":"I've been here twice- once for take out and once dining on the back patio. If you like Poutine or want to try Poutine for the first time this is a good option as there are so many varieties plus its open 24hrs. Downside is that it is also super busy and you often have to wait for a table. I've had a couple of different varieties-one with 3 different kinds of meat and one with 2 meats and some green peppers and onions. Both were tasty and filling but like with most experiences with Poutine it can end up being a bit sickening by the end and Poutine is never eaten for its looks usually anyway. It is a fairly reasonably priced meal though at about $10 you get more for the same price if you eat in then if you takeout but I found the takeout serving size was a bit more achievable.  If there is a long wait and the takeout line is short I recommend taking it to eat in Parc Lafontaine and you can watch the duckies. Overall, a nice but somewhat sickening meal but if the line was around the corner I would probably go somewhere else unless its your first poutine experience."}
{"text":"This has to be on your radar when you visit Montreal!!! I come from NYC and we do have options of authentic pouting however, this place puts it out the park. The place is super cute and there is a line! However, service is fast! We loved the neighborhood which has quaint shops and a beautiful park and row of houses to stroll down. The prices are reasonable for the portion of fries you receive. I ordered my own and I felt like that was the best option if you're hungry and can eat a lot. If you're not that hungry but want something with one other person then go ahead and order one to share. Do not share your fries with more than one person. That's just asking for trouble."}
{"text":"There was one food I knew I had to try in Montreal and that was poutines. I am still kicking myself for not going to a Poutine-dedicated shop during our trip to Vancouver last fall. So before we left for Montreal, I made sure to google the list of best poutine in the city. La Banquise topped most of those aforementioned lists. So the first thing we did after checking into our hotel was to set out for La Banquise!  We got here at 4pm, so there was no wait. We weren't too hungry, as such we decided to share a hot dog and a poutine dish. First things first, we had the Spicy Sausage Hot Dog. Holy cow, or shall I say holy dog, it was honestly one of the best hot dogs I've ever had. To be fair, I am not a connoisseur of hot dogs, in fact I rarely order hot dogs. But out of the few that I've had, this was way up there. The sausage had the perfect amount of spiciness, and the coleslaw was pretty kickass. Lastly they toasted the bun, which is a huge plus in my book, I hate soft soggy buns that fall apart when you bite into it.   Now onto the main event, the poutine. We shared La Festival, which had ground beef, Swiss cheese, hot peppers and onion rings. It was ... Kind of a letdown. For a place so well known for poutines, the one we tried was just average. The ground beef was bland and there wasn't enough gravy. However the four onion rings on top were kind of amazing, and cheese curds are always fantastic.   Overall I think the poutine deserved three stars while the hot dog gets five, so I averaged it out to four.  The service was fast, efficient and friendly.  Definitely worth a visit when you come to Montreal."}
{"text":"Une place où l'on va manger régulièrement tard le soir avec une gang d'ami. Malgré l'heure et le nombre que l'on est a chaque fois on a une table rapidement, le service est toujours super, rapide et efficace. On rigole bien surtout que c'est toujours le même ami qui est servi en dernier.  Blague à part, les poutines sont bonnes et on mange à sa faim. c'est pas de la gastronomie fine mais c'est pas ce qu'on attend quand on vient là."}
{"text":"When in Canada, grab some poutine!! This is the place to be. So many poutine options and also other types of dishes to choose from. I got the smoked meat club sandwich and a side of poutine. Experience was perfecto.   Knocked off 2 stars b/c the server overcharged me by 13 dollars, and I had only realized this after I had left. My mistake that I didn't look more closely I guess!"}
{"text":"I had to come twice. Sadly, I only left once with poutine. I couldn't wait the first time I went as the line was out the door (my fault, bad timing). I made a point to return the next day at a godly hour. I had the traditional poutine and walked to the park down the road to enjoy it.  Every component was perfection. The portion a dream. I would have loved to try the different variations but my time in Montreal was up... for now."}
{"text":"When in Montreal, poutine is a requirement.  La Banquise is a well-known resto for said dish as it was featured on Bizarre Foods for their array of many poutine toppings. There was a bit of a wait on a Saturday night and the line extended out of the restaurant, but it thankfully moved quickly to get us out of the cold.  We ordered La Elvis which had steak haché (ground beef), mushrooms, and green peppers on top of poutine (fries, cheese curds, gravy). It was as tasty as it was gut-busting! Although a bit disappointing because:  1) The regular size is not as big as I had imagined from reading reviews. Order a large if sharing with another person.  2) The fries could have been crispier. While I understand there should be an allowable soggy-ness factor from sitting under all those toppings and gravy, I would have enjoyed it more if the untopped fries on the sides had more crunch!  Overall it fulfilled my obligatory duty to eat poutine, but perhaps next time I'm in Montreal, I'll check out another spot."}
{"text":"Came Friday in early evening. Honestly, this is tasty food, but the place is extremely crowded and loud. I am not a poutine expert but can't believe the poutine would be vastly better here than elsewhere. If you want a real boisterous experience then this is a great choice, otherwise I'd look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Mon restaurant 24h préféré! Pourquoi aller au McDonald quand tu peut aller a \"La Banquise\"? J'ai toujours de la place, le bruit est tolérable c'est super rapide et vraiment trop bon! C'est un menu classique qui vieillit bien! Peut-être juste un peu gênant de payer avant de manger dans la nuit mais sinon c'est super! Pour avoir 5 étoiles je ferais baisser légèrement les prix!"}
{"text":"Nice spot! very good poutine. I never like waiting in line - and there are numerous other places with good poutine in Montreal - so no need to wait.  If you can get a table without much wait  - go for it - you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable and very close to La Fontaine Park.  The service was great and so was the breakfast poutine.  Best poutine we had in Montreal."}
{"text":"We came here super late at night to have our poutine fix after dinner and a visit up mont royal. We were still full from dinner, but the poutine here was pretty good.  Decor/ ambiance - 4/5 A great thing about this place is that if is open 24/7 and is cheerily painted inside. A not so great thing about being open 24/7 is that after a certain time, you have to pay the check beforehand. Oh well that only makes sense. Also cool hip hop played in the background when we were there.  Service - 3/5 After our guy sat us down and took our order, he practically disappeared for the rest of the night. Maybe he went to take a nap.   Food 4/5 We ordered the matty and a cider. Though we had finished dinner at l'express only 2 hours before, the poutine was good enough to dig in. Afterward though I felt like I was going to get a heart attack.   Bottom line - for your late night munchies"}
{"text":"C'est un bon restaurant où la poutine est excellente. Le service est agréable et souriant, je le recommande à tout voyageur souhaitant découvrir la Poutine"}
{"text":"So I guess I'm a real Canadian because my first time eating poutine I really enjoyed it! I had the poutine with onions and beef. Like everything else, I googled/yelped best poutine in Montreal and this place came up. There isn't much more I can say that everyone else hasn't. You just have to come and be amazed."}
{"text":"THE place to try in Montreal for a touristy taste of poutine. 25+ different types on the menu. Very busy all year round with locals and tourists alike. Yes, there are better poutines out there but there's only one La banquise. So do try it and make your own opinion of it. You'll like it or you won't but at least it'll be a 'check' on your list of things-to-try-in-Montreal!"}
{"text":"The food is okay. But it doesn't seem the reason for its popularity. The environment is just soso like fast food places. The staffs are ok friendly but given the price they should have a service of this level. Unfortunately i cannot understand why it's a must for visitors..."}
{"text":"Resto La Banquise is serious about their poutine! They had a menu dedicated to poutines and special seasonal poutines.  I don't know which local first told me about Resto La Banquise, but somehow I heard that Resto La Banquise was the best poutinerie in Montreal. We walked quite a distance on a hot day to enjoy it and our efforts were rewarded.  It was an off-beat time but Resto La Banquise was bustling. Other groups arrived at the same time as us and many tables were occupied. At first we were confused and waited in the wrong queue. There are two lines: one on the left for ordering take-out and the one on the right for seeing the host(ess) to be seated. No matter - we were seated soon after arrival.  The server was amicable and warm. We enjoyed the regular, classic poutine as well as the seasonal Just For Laughs. In both, M noted a hint of sweetness to the fries themselves - a welcome addition to combat the savory richness of the toppings. The fries could easily be cut; however, they also maintained their integrity well enough to be stabbed with a fork and lifted. Sometimes fries become soggy, break, or fall apart after absorbing delicious gravy.  The gravy was beautiful. It wasn't as thick as I'm used to. It was thinner and more like a broth than a somewhat gelatinous sauce that I have come to call gravy. It was delicate but still rich. It melded with the fries rather than sat on top of them.  The curds were squeaky fresh. My teeth literally squeaked as I chewed them. They were creamy, firm, and salty.  In addition to those regular toppings, the Just For Laughs poutine also had roasted red peppers, guacamole and sour cream. We appreciated those additions. The vegetables lent a welcome freshness to the otherwise indulgent savoriness that is poutine.  We also enjoyed an apricot beer and a hard cider along with our poutine. We were given the bottles and plastic cups in which to drink them. The cool beverages were refreshing after our long walk and then they were a great way to follow up a bite of poutine. The inside of Resto La Banquise was comfortable but not cool. It was not quite an escape from the uncomfortable heat outside so our cooling drinks were crucial to enjoying our experience."}
{"text":"The poutine at a famous little 24 hour place in Montreal called la Banquise located at 994 Rachel East, corner of La Fontaine Park is pretty damn good.  Poutine may sound like a dirty word and if you are at all concerned with your arteries or blood pressure it very well might be. But if it is the \"good death\" that you seek then poutine will be a delectable treat on your ferry ride across the river Styx.  What is poutine, you ask? Well it is a French-Canadian dish, imagine glistening pommes frite or French fries, topped with fresh cheese curds and a dark, heavy brown gravy. For the adventurous eater la Banquise offers 25 variations with a slew of toppings, from Bolognese sauce to bacon, peppers and mushrooms.  The place has a wonderful neighborhood feel to it and due to its local fame attracts droves of Montréalers, a quick glance around and you see teenagers on dates, truck drivers on break from miles on the road, and families enjoying a warm plate on a cold Montreal night. The staff is friendly, the prices affordable, and the portions are intense.  The potato may have originated in the Andes, but it fits in just fine in Quebec. If you ever find yourself in Montreal la Banquise offers a wonderful taste of French Canada."}
{"text":"I know there is a ton of reviews on this but I have to add mine as a recent Montreal defector, who now lives in BC. This place is horrible. Haha no justa kidding, open 24hours the best service you can find at 4 in the morning and the food is pure laine 100% Quebecois! This what clings to your ribs when it's -40 below or just finished a Forty.. The girl that served us on the day I left was so nice that I didn't want to leave and just remember that January night. Poutinesss, think of it like an ice cream shoppe except for fries, cheese and gravy as the base. If you go to Montreal GO THERE!! Danse la Poutine!"}
{"text":"It's a hugely popular poutine place in Montreal. Lots of energy. Line ups were long. Even takeouts required 10 mins+ wait. So do your homework and figure out what you want before ordering is a smarter way.  I ordered a regular sized classic poutine (without meat) for takeout as the wait for dine-in was too long. It's a big portion, so don't order large size if you're not super hungry. I loved its piping hot gravy over fries, but wished the cheese curds were layered inside the pile of fries so they could be more gooey (cheese curds were a bit too cold) Don't get me wrong, they were still delicious regardless.   Next time I should try the meat choices (TONS OF CHOICES TOO). Heard they were even better. It's not expensive either. Open 24 hours.  I'm hungry now, LOL.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"It's fine. people go here for decent, albeit it varied, poutine 247365. There is better in the city, but you can do much much worse.  ps: for the love of god if it's your first time eating poutine get the regular one. nothing angers me more than people wanting to try something authentic and then proceed to get it topped with guac or seventeen kinds of processed meats. Fries. Gravy. Fromage en grain. rien d'autre.   pps: avoid late at night in winter unless you want to freeze to death for something that can be had at roughly the same quality elsewhere."}
{"text":"The poutine is awesome here.  The cheese usually still squeaks, and it is 24/7.  Coming here after the bars close is sometimes interesting."}
{"text":"The food is good and the price is fair. Maybe just I am not very into this... but still deserve to try!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is... it's not that great.  It's good, but there are many better options for Poutine or late night food in Montreal.  THere is a reason that this place is popular late night with drunk people."}
{"text":"What an institution!  We arrived in the midst of the crowds at 1 am on Saturday night.  There were about 20 people ahead of us outside, but the line moves fairly quickly and this joint's quite large so we were seated in about 30-45 minutes.  There are quite a few poutine options.  As newbies to La Banquise, we went with the classic.  Given that I love me some cheese curds, I tried to order a large classic with extra cheese curds, but after a lengthy banter with our friendly waitress, I ended up with two sets of extra cheese curds, one on top, one on the side.  After being seated and giving your order, you pay, surely to avoid having drunk customers scurry off after stuffing their faces, forgetting they haven't paid.    Even though we were pretty hungry, a large poutine was more than enough for two (even without my extras!).  If I returned, I think I'd get the classic with smoked meat on top.  Having nacho fixins' or some other truly bizarre combo is too much for me.  The classic was solid, with tasty fries, gravy, and really great curds, though a tad on the salty side.  There's a lovely patio in the back which I understand is new.  Inside, it's very bright and lively.  The night we visited, the crowds died down around 2:15 am or so.  If you have a place to eat relatively nearby, you could get takeout instead."}
{"text":"Wish my city had a 24 hour specialized poutine joint. Had to check out La Banquise having heard it is #1 in Montreal. Not bad, not bad at all.  Had their La Fred Caillou poutine, that came topped with four different meats, and the regular portion was more than enough for one (mind you, I had just eaten dinner elsewhere).  Was it special? No. Was it tasty? Heck yeah. Beware of the line ups, it was already a packed restaurant on a cold snowy day, although we were lucky we only had to wait a little while."}
{"text":"Line for take out and sit down are extremely long. Took about 25 mins to wait for a take out Poutine.  Poutine is okay, but if you choose to go here make sure you allow yourself some time to queue before you're truly starving"}
{"text":"L'attente est comme toujours longue et fastidieuse.. Mais comme toujours ça vaut le coup! Si tu veux un bon restaurant gastronomique de qualité, court loin d'ici, mais si tu veux une place réconfortante à toute heure, la banquise sera toujours là pour toi, avec, selon moi, les meilleurs recettes de poutines en ville."}
{"text":"Not understanding the hype of this place at all, I found La Banquise to be very mediocre. Montreal is known for hearty poutines, but I had much better experiences downtown back home in Toronto from food trucks... yes I'm not joking in the slightest.   Our order was the classic poutine, adding a plate of onions and a hamburger which we shared. The poutine was nothing special, lots of gravy and lots of cheese, however didn't wow us at all. Burger was nicely cooked. Onion rings were the worst, bland and extremely greasy.   With tip, our total was about $20 for two patrons which was pretty reasonable. No complaints about our server, received good customer service. Food was the shortfall unfortunately."}
{"text":"Great late night- after drinks- type of meal! Any type you want- you got it! Must try at least once in your life !! Reasonably prices too :) but do expect a line up, whether it's 4pm or 4am! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"A bite from our full experience review -  \"Montreal was very quiet at midnight on Monday and La Banquise was the centre of attention for the whole block, it filled the neighbourhood with life, became a gathering place. We enjoyed our experience more for the vibe and general atmosphere than for the actual food.\""}
{"text":"We came in around 10am for sunday brunch, freated by mice gentleman who led us to pick our own table in the corner. Floor is greasy and slippery moght have been from the fries and meat that fell on the floor and poor cleaning job. We ordered T rex poutine as recommended, a hot dog, BFT and the french toast with bacon and fruits (forgot the name). T REX is definitely wrecking havoc, so overrated. Salty and greast topped with over done ground beef and hot dogs with not so great cheese curd vompare to what we had in Quebec. My kids love omellete but not theirs. Wife was not proud of her dish also. We came back diasappointed because we were recommended by native montreal to go to this place for poutine aficionado like myself. :(( take your money  somewhere else and i will go to frite alor uno mas for poutine."}
{"text":"I think if you are in Montreal and want to try Poutine this is the place you should go. I asked a native and this was his recommendation. I was happy with my Fred Caliou (Fred Flintstone) with all sorts of meat on it. It was heavy but what I expected. Very tasty. Bring cash as they don't take credit cards (they do local debit cards) and expect to pre-pay at night."}
{"text":"La poutine est bonne, tout comme plusieurs autres établissements similaires. Fromages en crottes, sauce brune et patate. Je ne comprend pas le 'hype'."}
{"text":"Went for brunch in a day that wasn't busy, as normally when I pass infront on weekends, the line-up outside is humongous. It os a very basic place, food was ok, service amazing fast and dedicated, I guess the line up is more for the service as the food is pretty average"}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday early evening around 5p, no wait. Ordered 2 local beers, the la taquise poutine (guac, sour cream and tomatoes) and the smoked meat poutine. I liked the smoked meat poutine better as the meat really enhanced the flavor of the gravy. The regular size is more than enough for one person (I couldn't finish mine) so come hungry! They also have a selection of other food items from jalapeño poppers to burgers but we came only for the poutine. Would recommend a visit for their poutine if you're in Montreal. Also, keep in mind this is a cash or Canadian debit card only."}
{"text":"Bless you Montreal, for your French boys and your 24 hour food joints. I visited La Banquise two nights in a row around 2am and there was consistently a line up. Fortunately, the wait was only about 15 minutes both times. You can't go wrong with a plate of greasy poutine late at night. By far, my favourite is the La Taquise, which comes with guac, sour cream, and tomatoes so it's almost healthy. Come here with a couple of friends so you can share multiple poutine a because why should you limit yourself to just one?"}
{"text":"This was my first authentic poutine in well over 15 years and it was just as good as I rememberd. There are a ton of reiews already, I just wanted to add that they are the only place I found while in town that has 100 percent vegetarian poutine (gravy included). I had both the traditional and the ground beef with onion variety. So good that I went back twice in the week I stayed in Montreal. I adored my cider, Mystique and hope to find SOMEPLACE in the US to purchase."}
{"text":"If you are in  Plateau Mont-Roya area, be sure to check this diner out.  It has classique poutine and lots of variations. The staff is friendly. The decor is cool. It has a limited beer selection."}
{"text":"The first place I had poutine was La Banquise. It definitely set a high standard as a first time. Poutine everywhere tastes the same since it is cheese, fries and gravy but what makes this place so special is the different types of poutine it offers. The poutine here ranges from Mexican style to pizza style guving the Quebec dish an international dash. Furthermore you can add whatever you want to your poutine to customize it. Food here gets really heavy but it's fabulous. A must visit if you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"Pro's - A menu that offers a variety of 25+ poutines, catering to all tastes. My favourite is by far the Kamikaze (merguez sausage and hot peppers) - Don't overlook the other items on the menu. They are also pretty good if you're looking for more regular casse-croûte fare. - Laid-back and causal atmosphere - suitable for families, couples and groups of friends of all ages - There is a plastic tree in the middle of the dining area - Open 24h - tastes better when you're drunk - Small patio in the back is nice in the summer  Con's - Has become an overrated tourist trap over the years - but still somehow managed to maintain some of it's initial charm - The Line - not worth the wait especially in the freezing cold - there are tons of other greasy spoon options in a 2km radius  - The poutine itself is actually not that good. I've had better gravy elsewhere and the fries are too greasy, not crispy enough for my liking.  Overall, visiting La Banquise is a part of the Montreal experience I like to indulge in from time to skip, but the line is just not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I went to this place after hearing the many amazing recommendations from friends who said this was really the best place for poutine in montreal. I was expecting quite a bit as well seeing the long lineup. When we finally got seated, the server was a bit slow however we can understand given the busy area. We ordered 3 different poutines, including a regular, and a onion rings and burger as well. The price seemed not bad given the portions we were provided. However this is about all i can say in terms of positive for it.   overall i find that the poutine was not very spectacular it was pedestrian at best. The mixture of ingredients was simple thrown on top, and the gravy which is basically the life blood of what poutine is, was simply bland and not special. it seemed they simply were intent to throw as many things as possible, not carrying how the flavour would match. The smoked meat that was placed in one of the pountine was simply not good. They needed better smoked meat. and the burger was average at best. The onion rings were nothing to scream home about it was about the only thing where i would say they did not give a good sized portion. This place seemed good at one thing which was give you a good portion for the price in terms of poutine. Other than that, they take an awfully long time to cook poutine, which doesn't make sense, it is fries with gravy and cheese on top. There really isn't a complicated process to it.   i have to say i was very disappointed at a place that was labelled by so many as the best montreal has to offer in poutine."}
{"text":"This place is grungy, hip, simple, and just an overall great time. The menu is full of poutines of all varieties and I am fairly convinced that no matter which one you order, it is going to be awesome.   Personally, I went for the B.O.M. which had bacon, merguez sausage, and onions in addition to the normal poutine gravy and cheese. Upon first bite, I was immediately in love. this mix of the salty sausage and bacon added greatly to pile and made each bite extremely savory."}
{"text":"I was told that La Banquise is a must for any Montreal trip- so off we went, via the Montreal subway (which ran a lot faster than the NYC subway... and the doors opened before the train made a complete stop?!) After this thrilling ride and a short trek from the Mont Royal station, we found ourselves at this Poutine Haven. I liked the very casual atmosphere- the store quickly filled up with locals/regulars (there was a line when we left!) To me, locals lining up is a good sign. My boyfriend ordered the BOM (bacon, onion and merguez sausage) and i got the T- Rex (ground beef, bacon, hot dog sausage and pepperoni)- we ordered regular sizes, but out came these mountains of fries, cheese curds, and MEAT. I couldn't finish mine (but I'm very proud to say I was damn close to finishing it), so if you're going for two, maybe a good idea to just get the large portion. The poutine was FANTASTIC- fries were fresh (with a good mix of crispy ones and squishy ones that've been doused with gravy), cheese curds were starting to melt a little, and the meats were fresh off the grill! Wash it all down with one of their local beers. And its open 24 hours! Yet another reason to move to Canada... Healthcare, Hot PM, and heaps of poutine!"}
{"text":"This is THE place to go for poutine in Montreal. Now, I can't really say that its the best, because I haven't tried them all, but wow, this was amazing!  Far off of the beaten path of tourism we trekked to La Banquise after finding numerous recommendations online. We were not disappointed. The place has a decent-sized dining area as well as outdoor dining in the back. Service was quick and pleasant.  I ordered the Savoyarde Poutine which was your standard poutine, topped with bacon, grilled onions, swiss cheese and sour cream. The cheese curds and swiss got nice and melty under heaps of fries and gravy. It was so delicious that I never wanted to stop eating. Unfortunately, I hit the wall of my stomach's limitations and had to stop. This was the regular size, so I'm afraid of what the large size would have looked like!  Husband ordered the Boogalou Poutine with pulled pork, creamy coleslaw and sour cream. He graciously allowed me to try this and it was so so good! He also could not finish, but we both certainly tried!  Husband also had a local beer, Coup de grisou which was thoroughly enjoyable and I had a nice Limoneta San Pellegrino which was a refreshing compliment to my poutine.   Every time I have poutine, I grow more and more disappointed that most American's have never tried and do not understand the perfect combination of deliciousness that they are missing. Our \"disco fries\" never even come close to the pure magic of crisp fries, perfect cheese curd and piping hot gravy.   Please take the longer walk to La Banquise, you will NOT regret it!!!!!!  Side note: they only accept Canadian credit/debit cards so if you are a tourist, be sure to have cash on you or be prepared to use the ATM they have in the front of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Amazing! 24/7 access to the best variety of saucy spicy gooey cheezy scrumptious nasty heavenly created poutines.  Whoever doesn't like this place should seriously look in the mirror and ask themselves where did it all go wrong?  Debbie Downer health food junkies are not allowed entry here! Stay home and eat some raw carrots.  I have been coming here for the last 15 years and have never had anything to complain about! Now that's RARE!  All immigrants and tourists should have a poutine from here when arriving in our kingdom.  Welcome! Have a poutine and enjoy!  Yeah, I love this place."}
{"text":"Ok, I am sure that the fact that I am not a big fan of poutine reflect the rating I am giving here. I must admit that the place is quite something... I mean, I wouldn't tough that I would wait in line for 20 minutes at 1:30 am (that's right, in the night) to get into a place that serves a snack bar menu. Granted, the place have become somewhat of an institution like Schwartz's and plenty of the bar crowd comes here for a late snack. However, the difference is that I like smoked meat and not so much poutine (It was my first in like 30 years!).  The poutine itself (I took the one with pepper sauce) was fine but not spectacular compared to some I had in the \"bois-franc\" region (birth place of poutine) in the 70s.  A worthwhile experience but not one I will redo anytime soon."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a vegan poutine option this is you're spot. Super tasty, delish and reasonably priced. Best part they are open late night."}
{"text":"It's definitely the best. It's worth the wait even though you are just a visitor and stay for like 2 nights (like me). I love poutine here! The t-Rex is just amazing! The pepperoni is my favorite!!! We also had the one with chicken an pea, it's good but we still prefer the meatish t-Rex as the flavor is stronger.  I had a great time! I highly recommend this one. It's such a perfect midnight treat to me. The environment is not too quiet, but I like it still."}
{"text":"It was amazing to find this 24/7 place late Sunday night to stuff a empty stomach. A place to experience night life of young people at Montreal. The only complaint is they accept cash or Canadian debit card only."}
{"text":"Hopes were dashed somewhat as the reviews were so high. Quantity was there, but the poutine contest to date puts it in a distant 3rd place after a Swartz, and surprisingly good airport Pork and Pickle.  The atmosphere was funky, and the dishes were enormous.  Who could possibly eat the whole plate of large poutine?  Burger \"sides\" were just ok including the smoked meat burger. The vegan poutine with vegan cheese was a nice touch for our allergy kid. Anyhow, the service was friendly and efficient.  And they were extra careful with the allergies checking with kitchen. Beware of the ginger beer... it is very gingery."}
{"text":"I love the place, but it is always crowded.  The good thing is they have English menu. I love poutine. It does not look good, but it tastes great. The poutine I got was the one with all meet. I cannot remember the name, but it is awesome!!!!. If you go to Montreal, YOU MUST STOP HERE AND EAT !!!.  5 starts for a great and awesome place !!!"}
{"text":"If you want to become a big fat fattie, you have found the perfect place. There are a million permutations of toppings for the innocent little fries. I had to have the Mexican with avocados. It was decent with slightly salty gravy, and rubbery cheese. Goodness, I never thought rubbery cheese was good unless it was haloumi. It is alright here."}
{"text":"This place was very crowded on a Friday night but it was clear this is the spot to visit in town for poutine.  After all, it has received numerous reviews claiming it has the best poutine in town.    The wait to get seated was probably about twenty minutes or so.  The doorway area serves as both an entry and exit conduit and is very narrow.  People are squeezing to get in and out.   When finally seated, the atmosphere is exactly what you would expect a college type hangout to be, full of mostly young folks but they also had large tables for families.  The portions are generous and it was definitely a challenge to finish the entire regular sized plate - I ordered the \"La Frank\" which was poutine with the Merguez sausage.  The food was delivered pretty quickly and having never had poutine before, I dived in.  Overall impressions - the fries were of all shapes and sizes, but were very tasty.  Its just my preference, but I didn't really care for the cheese curds - it is just like chewy tasteless cheese.  I could have probably also done without the sausage (again, having never tried Merguez) but it reminded me of a slim jim.  It took a while to get the bill - the folks sitting to either side of us ate and were gone within 15-20 minutes of sitting down, and we sat for another 15 minutes before anyone came by to clear the table, and even then we had to ask for the bill despite the place being packed and a line running out of the front door.  Overall, I think this is a great place for a visitor in town to experience Montreal and its poutine, although I think I'm all poutine'd out after one go at it."}
{"text":"overrrated poutine. prices are steep compared to restaurants"}
{"text":"We came on a Tuesday night around 9pm and the line was pretty long so we decided to order the original poutine to go. The grande poutine was more than enough for two people and quite filling. However, the fries were soft. I would have liked them to be a bit crispier. But all in all, very satisfying!"}
{"text":"well, the servers are the most rude I have ever had, but there French- Canadian so I think it's normal for them. The Poutine was really good which is why I rated them 4 stars, however the servers didn't \"kiss up\" to their customers like other restaurants would so it was kinda a cold atmosphere. I suppose some people would prefer \"service\" like that. Anyways, I would recommend this place. The food got out fast and tasted really good :)"}
{"text":"La Banquise serves poutine in almost every way imaginable. My boyfriend and I shared the La Matty (bacon, mushrooms, green peppers and onions) and it was more than enough to put us into a coma except we also ordered a hot chicken sandwich. **PSA for Americans: the hot chicken sandwich is not like an American chicken sandwich. It's not breaded or fried and it is definitely not spicy (hot). It is literally white bread, plain chicken breast, gravy and peas on top.** The poutine was heavy but tasty. I highly recommend getting a version with onions or some other type of veggie in order to help with the heaviness. The chicken sandwich was a surprise but edible as well.   Would return again but just for poutine.  Ca$h or debit card only."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of poutine, but I enjoyed every bite of my poutine today. I got there on a Friday for lunch and the restaurant was half empty with no line up. The inside is clean, not spacious but big enough to handle approximately 20 tables inside and outside.   I ordered the Reggae poutine with extra mushrooms and it was gooood. The guacamole and tomato were cold so it makes the dish taste refreshing and not too heavy. The guacamole was a bit too creamy... The hot peppers add in a nice hit. The fries were just on point, not too soggy or overfried. We got the regular poutine and I couldn't finish it all. Surprisingly, the poutine did not make me feel too heavy with all the fries.   The only complaint I have is just the fact that I ordered extra mushrooms in my poutine and I could barely see any in it... They were a bit too stingy :("}
{"text":"Dizaine de sortes de poutines 24h/24  7jours /7 Terrasse ouverte Bières locale Du haut de mes 21ans d'existence j'ai jamais gouter de meilleures poutines."}
{"text":"We were wandering around Plateau Mont-Royal looking for a good place for lunch. We weren't necessarily craving poutine, but decided to give La Banquise a try because it came highly recommended by our travel guide (and we needed a walking break).   We came in on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty quiet. There were a few people out in the patio area, but we were the only people dining indoors. We both ordered sandwiches and an order of \"classic\" poutine. The sandwiches were huge and all the ingredients were very fresh. We were a bit intimidated by the giant plate of poutine,which we've only had once before Stateside. However, it was delicious in all its gravy goodness. The gravy wasn't very salty and the cheese curds were very fresh.   Service was attentive and friendly. Great spot for a tasty lunch near the park."}
{"text":"YES. absolutely worth the 1000+ reviews. We came here after a 3 hour food tour and honestly, I wasn't expecting to enjoy poutine very much because it looked too heavy for my weak stomach. I was also stuffed from the food tour, but we HAD to try this place out. We ordered the \"La Taquise\" which was basically a combination of nachos and poutine. It was absolutely amazing. The fresh tomatoes added so much flavor to the dish. We also ordered a greek salad, which was tasty, but a bit on the pricey side.  Highly recommend. End of story.  PS. There are 2 lines: 1 for takeout and 1 for sit-in. There are heaters to keep you warm while you wait outside. HUGE plus."}
{"text":"We ate after midnight our last night there, and to cap off the end of my birthday.  This was a gorgeous meal, and I got peppers and onions and bacon on my poutine. It was absolutely gloriously decadent and delicious.  The food was amazing and I loved sitting in the back and watching the other diners dig in to their giant plates as well."}
{"text":"As I was leaving the hotel, the front desk clerk asked where we were going, and we said La Banquise and he said \"get the small!\"  The portions are indeed big here, although the choices are named \"regular\" and \"large.\"   I ordered the Three Amigos, which comes with three different \"sausages,\" counting hot dog as a sausage.  Regular size, of course, and I did not finish.  I liked the brightly colored decor.  Near the bathroom, there was a map with a penguin that said \"Vous etes ici!\"  Cute.  Your Amex has no power here.  This place is cash and Interac only.  I found that a little surprising because this place appears in the tourist guides and is well known.  I did not notice whether there was an ATM there, because I paid cash."}
{"text":"Pricey - they charge you for even the slightest change to the regular - even for removing things! Would've rated better but the line-up and service can take forever."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and make La Banquise a \"must-stop\" destination during your trip to Montreal.  Located on the plateau, just outside of Parc la Fontaine, Resto La Banquise is *the* place in Montreal to go for poutine.  The wait can be somewhat long in the evening, especially on weekends, but it's worth the wait.  I got the Smoked Meat Poutine and a Belle Gueule Pilsner.  If you haven't experienced it yet, the smoked meat in Montreal rivals the pastrami in NYC.  Put it on top of some high quality poutine and you've got two of the best foods Montreal has to offer.  When you're done here, signup for a bike tour with Cycle Tours (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/cycle-tours-montreal-montreal#hrid:KVbPoz7i5mYeFl9qBHq9lA/src:self) to burn off the calories..."}
{"text":"If you want to have poutine with various topping, should check it out. It has many type of poutine even vegetarian poutine! I choose vegetarian poutine which comes with cheese, bell pepper, onion, mushroom & sauce. Poutine was super great and you definitely check here out when you visit Montreal.   I know this place is quite popular but we didn't wait a line because we arrived before dinner time (5ish?). After us, many people waited a line and the place was packed. So, rule of thumb, just avoid prime time, would be helpful if you don't want to be in a long line."}
{"text":"So here's the thing, the best part about La Banquise is not the actual resto, but grabbing poutine to go, a couple of beers at the dep next door, and then heading to Parc LaFontaine.   I am NO poutine expert, by any means. Everyone (clearly!) has their own (very strong!) feelings about poutine. Mine aren't that strong. But I will say, I found the gravy at La Banquise to be somewhat lacking. It was sort of grease, very similar to what you have at a Saint Hubert. But I've had poutine before in totally nondescript corner diners (like Le Fameux on Saint-Denis/Mont-Royal) where the gravy is actually part of the dish, not just a gel to hold the fries to curds to the fries, gravy with the faintest hint of nutmeg and plenty of pepper, gravy without too much salt, gravy you remember. I've also had crispier fries. Fries that don't sink under the weight of delicious gravy and squeaky melting cheese curds...  So, the fact that you can get better poutine in random diners, better than this place that specializes in poutine, is kind of a draw back.  HOWEVER, we went here because we had a good friend in town and it is ABSOLUTELY something you should do if you or someone you love is visiting Montreal. It's a thing. You stand in line, you marvel at the menu (what! you can get poutine with guac on top! what!) you wait for your order, you get sassed by the sort of unfriendly staff, you look at other people's plates (whaaa! that girl has a corndog on top of her poutine!) and you look at your own plate (how the heck am I going to eat all of this...?) you feel victoriously stuffed and spend the rest of the week biking around the city and eating salad, and it's just a thing that you have to do.  So do it. You may not fall in love with poutine, but it's a lot of fun."}
{"text":"I got a chevre burger which comes with fries that I upgraded to a classique poutine. The patty was cooked and seasoned well, the cheese was generous, and the onions added a nice sweet touch. The poutine had a delicious gravy sauce, savory but not too salty, and the cheese curds had a good texture. After eating the whole burger I was only able to finish half the poutine, which still tasted pretty good three days later."}
{"text":"The best poutine I had so far in Canada. Be prepare to wait a bit to get in and to get your food because they are very busy. Fun place with a wide variety of poutine options and combinations. They don't accept credit card, just debit and cash (they have an ATM at the entrance but FYI)"}
{"text":"Restaurant spécialisé dans la poutine. Bonne ambiance, quoiqu'un peu bruyante. Bonne musique. Les poutines sont copieuses comme elles sont censées l'être et ont été vraiment savoureuses, on a pas été déçus."}
{"text":"Je rêves souvent d'une soirée d'été où je marches sur la rue Rachel et que je passes devant le resto où il y aurait, par a dont, PERSONNE DANS LE LINE UP et que j'irais manger une poutine mexicaine avec mes amis  Mais ce scénario n'arrive malheureusement jamais. Malgré la file; on est servis tellement rapidement, c'est bon, c'est frai même si on est 10 à commander en même temps !!! J'adore j'adore j'adore ! Tous les touristes à qui j'ai la chance de parler : je référés a 100000000%"}
{"text":"overhyped. I hate the fries because they're too soggy and cant handle the toppings and the sauce is completely tasteless. I am also a person that like little options because when I come to la banquise I am overwhelmed with options and I feel like I always choose the wrong thing and im so disappointed with my food, every single time. I recommend they diminish the menu and concentrate on a few poutine plates and do them right. I do appreciate the 24 hours though."}
{"text":"The absolute best poutine in Montreal. Open 24/7, this is the place to get and get some greasy food after a messy night on nearby St Laurent street. Nothing beats a night of clubbing in Montreal followed by a huge smoked meat poutine (my personal favorite). Be aware: there is often a lineup outside this place on weekends. If you want to go during the day, you can walk off the calories in beautiful parc lafontaine next door once you are done pigging out. 10/10 I have come here several times and it is my alltime favorite poutine restaurant in the city. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous wait, poutine was okay.  Not quite sure why it's so popular, but maybe I'm just not a big enough poutine fan.  Give me greasy carne Adama Mexican food any day over this stuff.  Anyway, it was fine, but nothing to write home about.  Had the Savoyarde."}
{"text":"We're probably the only people who waited in line and then ordered hotdogs instead of poutine.  Fortunately, we had a shorter wait in the takeout line, although they did lose our order and take 25 minutes to fill ours.  The hot dogs were very good.  For some reason, when I come to Canada I think of their hot dogs, which are much better than what we can get on the street in New York City.    The lines were ridiculous, especially if you want to eat in.  In nice weather, you can get it to go along with a beer then take it to the nearby park and eat on the bench."}
{"text":"Best poutine in the world hand down. Locals go there, tourists go there.  No one should miss it. :)"}
{"text":"I got the classic poutin, with a local brew.. The prices were more than fair, and I was so surprised to be served so quickly as the place was packed. I'll come here every time I'm in Montreal. The best poutin I had!"}
{"text":"Overall : Worth it for the novelty and the food.  The restaurant is cramped, the service is nothing special (although also nothing terrible) and be warned they are CASH-ONLY (see below).  That said, if you want a bunch of different gravy + fries + whatever, this is probably the best game in town.  Food : My partner and I split a regular sized hotdog poutine, and a regular sized T-rex.  Both were delightful.  The T-rex had a lot of meat, but that was expected, and somehow the bacon flavor permeated the gravy which was delicious.  One warning - a single regular is enough to share if you're not that hungry.  If you are, you might be able to eat one on your own, or split two like we did.  The large size is huge, it's like a soup bowl filled as high as they can mound it with poutine.  Decor / Ambiance : Nifty decor, but holy crap is it cramped.  We were there off of a normal meal time (around 2 PM) and it was full to brimming and we had to step over and around people and their stuff.  Getting a refill on water was painful, mostly because the waitress could barely reach us.  The bathroom was the filthiest I saw in all Montreal, and is unisex.  If I was a woman I would have recoiled in horror.  You have been warned.  Cash-Only?!?! : Okay, I get why some places don't want to take credit cards, but this was a special kind of hell.   Canada now has credit / debit cards with microchips, and some ATMs will not process your transaction if your card doesn't have one.  Being from the United States, my cards did not have chipped, and the two walkable ATMs near the restaurant as well as the one inside were all the type of ATM that did not work without chips.  It was probably the most frustrating half hour of my trip, and we ended up just eating what we could afford on pocket change.  We checked their website before we went, it would have been lovely if this had been written clearly on the main page or any of the menu pages... alright, I'm done griping now."}
{"text":"Burger was good, poutine was great. I got the banguise burger with the upgraded poutine fries.  The burger was about 6\" diameter and not very thick. They dont ask how you want it cooked and it comes out well done.  On the other hand the poutine was awesome. Crispy fries covered in gravy and cheese curds. They have ketchup and mayo on the table if you're into that.  Service was great, french and english friendly. Good local beer selection but they only serve beer indoors."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our first authentic poutine in Montreal! The outside area is charming.  Note: they do not take American credit cards."}
{"text":"Good ol' La Banquise, I'll never get tired of you :). Of all the places I've tried in Montreal La Banquise remains my favourite place for poutine. Their portions are huge and their variety doesn't get old. I ordered the Southwest, it's actually the best thing I've ordered from here by far. There were loads of onion rings and guacamole. Chipotle sauce added a kick of flavour on top of all the fattiness.  My friends ordered La Chicks, La Savoyarde, and La Veganomane. I'd recommend La Chicks if you have a particular craving for breaded chicken, but it doesn't offer more than that. The Savoyarde was also really good. I think I tried a bit of the vegetarian poutine but I don't really remember much about it, it wasn't memorable, sorry vegetarian readers :(.  Honestly there's nothing I can complain about this place so overall 10/10!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, disgusting washrooms with urine on the floor and toilet seat. Fries tasted like burnt old oil. Olives had a rotten taste. Once seated we were ignored for 20 minutes before we got a chance to order our drinks and meals. We literally had to bed for attention to get additional drinks. Empty glasses and meal plates were not cleaned up once while we sat at our table which because of the service and slowness was over 2 hours. The veggie burger was pretty good and brought this rating from -3* to 2*"}
{"text":"Short-ish line. 15 min. Someone tried to scalp poutine, pathetic. Others tried to cut in line.  The burger is good, but not great, a little overdone. In the style and scale of McDonalds, but obviously way better. The poutine is delicious. I had it plain, which a local told me is like \"buying a corvette but not getting the keys.\" I enjoyed it. Their vegetarian poutine is decent, the cheese is good but the gravy is very salty and tastes of condensed bullion a little."}
{"text":"It was really good, but I'm not going to lie... I was expecting better. I loved that all their gravy was vegetarian and they even had a vegan option. Staff was kind of rude. I don't like how they make you pay first.. it made me tip way less because they gave us the food and then never came back."}
{"text":"Couldn't leave Canada without trying Poutine and this place had such great reviews and they had a vegan option! I wasn't feeling to adventurous so I went with the classique poutine with vegan sauce and a vege hot dog. Loved the bread on the hot dog since it's different from the kind that is used In America and poutine was really interesting. Luckily our wait time was only about 15 minutes on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"So goooood. I officially love poutine after trying Le Matty. Having arrived in Montreal after a long car ride, this was the best food to eat at 4 in the morning. There was a long line with partygoers on a Friday evening. I went straight for the take out line and ordered the regular to go. In retrospect, I regret not getting the large. The poutine was devoured within minutes amongst the 7 of us. It was so good!  You can smell the deliciousness from down the block. Yummmmmay!"}
{"text":"We ate here twice while in Montreal! The first time we went during the week for lunch and there was a line, however we were seated right away because they had a table just for two. The Vegan options drew us in. Vegan cheese, vegan sauce and a vegan burger. Our poutine had sautéed onions, peppers and mushrooms with vegan cheese and sauce. This dish was amazing and I was regretful that we ordered the regular size and not the grande. The La Banquise beer was very tasty as well. It is annoying that La Banquise only accepts Canadian debit cards but being an American traveler I didn't let that upset me because they accept U.S. dollars! Woohoo!"}
{"text":"we just came to montreal for vacation and we were pretty desperate for dinner, and since two restaurants we wanted to go to was closed and fully booked (on a weekday!), we decided to just go with poutine for dinner.   this place is so good, that even before we entered the restaurant we could smell the amazingness of their poutine. i have never smelt anything like it! their menu has everything i have never thought could be on a poutine.   we had to have them to-go because the place was packed and we were very hungry. our taste buds were forever changed by how tasty the poutine turned out to be. even the classic poutine was not disappointing! definitely will recommend to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"This place is Poutine Heaven, it's very difficult to consider anyone not absolutely loving the incredible selection of Poutine at this restaurant, simply incredible!"}
{"text":"Get your snobby nose out of the air-- this is some GREAT poutine. Yeah there's always a line and you might be squished in that little entrance for awhile, but it's worth it. SO worth it. Like, still-dreaming-about-the-poutine-three-days-later worth it.  We had the classique and the italienne (with meat sauce instead of gravy)... both were delicious and the best I had during our trip (unofficially dubbed The Great Beer and Poutine Tour of 2013)."}
{"text":"Ahhh La Banquise... Tout le monde mais absolument tout le monde m'a recommandé cet endroit. C'est donc lorsqu'un ami américain est venu me rendre visite que j'ai décidé d'y aller. Peut-être que je m'en étais fait tout un monde mais j'ai été plutôt déçue.   Nous nous y sommes rendus un dimanche soir, l'endroit était assez rempli. La déco est plutôt mignone, l'ambiance chaleureuse et détendue. C'est donc sur une bonne note que je commence mon aventure.   Premier petit HIC, mon ami s'adresse en anglais à la serveuse qui lui donne un menu en français, il en demande donc un dans la langue adéquate, elle oublie et il se lève donc pour aller en chercher un tout seul.  Les erreurs étant humaines nous n'en tiendront pas trop rigueur.   Nous avons donc enfin les menus en main et que de choix !! Pour 3 novices de la poutine nous sommes un peu perdus. Nous nous décidons donc pour une T- Rex, une Rachel et une Dan-Dan. Le service est efficace et nous sommes servis dans les 10 minutes qui suivent.  Alors, alors l'expérience poutine...? Et bien je dois l'avouer et honte à moi vivant au Québec, je ne suis pas grande fan. J'ai trouvé ça extrêmement salé, sans goût et ultra bourratif. J'ai franchement eu du mal à finir et j'ai trouvé ça moyen. Mes deux acolytes ne se sont pas éclatés la pence non plus même s'ils sont un peu moins sévères que moi.   Conclusion, si vous êtes dans le coin, affamés, pressés ou ayant un budget modeste c'est un bon choix. En revanche, ne vous déplacez pas pour y aller non plus.  Je laisse quand même le bénéfice du doute à cet endroit qui m'a quand été recommandé par tous mes amis québécois... Peut-être ai-je mal choisi ma poutine ou que mon palais est trop français?"}
{"text":"O.M.G. This place is literally a place i think about going to like almost everyday. Okay not literally. But I would say the poutine I had here was literally the best I've ever had. The French fries were cooked to perfection, and they weren't too big or too small. The gravy was very tasty. The cheese curds were amazing. I also got ground beef, hot peppers, some other cheese lol and onion rings, which were also cooked to perfection. It was so delicious. When I'm back in Montreal, which I will be, I will be stopping here no matter what! And I can't wait! The prices are reasonable. Staff was great. And the outside seating was great. If your in Montreal, this is a must stop."}
{"text":"Un très grand choix de poutine pour un prix raisonnable. Peut être pas le meilleur restaurant de Poutine à Montréal, mais une bonne adresse et une institution à essayer au moins une fois."}
{"text":"Next time the family and I are in Montreal, la Banquise is on our list!  Great Poutine!"}
{"text":"Avant de venir à Montréal, on me disait : \"tu as intérêt à manger une poutine. Et le mieux, c'est d'aller à La Banquise, un must !\". Challenge accepted.  17h00. J'ai très faim et il n'y a pas d'heures pour découvrir une poutine. Avec une amie, direction donc à La Banquise, ouvert 24h/24, 7j/7. Déjà à l'intérieur, beaucoup de monde, mais pas une file d'attente énorme. En à peine 5 minutes, on était à table.  Le resto propose notamment burgers ou hot-dogs. Mais concentrons nous sur les poutines ! Vous pouvez choisir la classique (frites, sauce et fromage) ou d'autres plus recherchées. Ensuite vient la taille : régulière (normal) ou grande Pour ma part, j'avais pris la Chicks, qui est à base de morceaux de poulet pané, en régulière.  En revanche, l'attente a été très longue. Victime de son succès, La Banquise ne manque pas de clientèle, donc c'est tout à fait normal.  Après des minutes, voilà que nos plats arrivent. Et c'est l'émerveillement. Face à nous, une poutine qui ne demande qu'à être dévorée. Les premières bouchées sont excellentes : on trouve des saveurs qui font du bien au palais. Que dire du fromage : délicieux (mais écoeurant au bout d'un moment pour ma part) ! Les frites sont à la hauteur de mes espérances : croustillantes bien comme il faut ! C'est gras, pas vraiment joli à voir, mais qu'importe, c'est tellement bon !  Je vous avouerai que j'ai eu du mal à la finir. Déjà qu'à la moitié mon estomac était plein, j'avais de la peine à gâcher tout ça !  Bon malheureusement, vos vêtements sentent un peu la friture en sortant du restaurant. Mais ça vaut le coup :p  Un ventre bien rempli, un prix abordable (pour moins de 10 dollars sans les tips) malgré des minutes à attendre, La Banquise n'attend plus que vous !"}
{"text":"Not much to say about this amazing place that you don't already know. If you love pountines, this place gives the best one I've ever had, and so so so much variety. I recommend the T-Rex!! Although avoid the 'large' size if eating alone. As a big guy, even the medium was borderline too much for me to finish on my own!"}
{"text":"À mon avis c'est le meilleur endroit où on peut manger de la bonne Poutine.  La banquise propose une bonne variété de Poutine avec toute sorte d'ingrédients."}
{"text":"Restaurant specialise dans la poutine.  Bon accueil. Serveuses très sympa. Le hic s'est qu'à partir de 21h et jusqu'à 6h du mat' on paie en avance son repas. Je n'ai donc pas donné les tips car commande prise direct on passe à la caisse. Parisienne que je suis je leur ai précisé que cela était bizzare. Hum... Toutefois, très bonne ambiance dans le restaurant. Je n'ai pas aimé la POUTINE mais ce n'est qu'une question de goût. J'avais encore faim... Toutefois le restaurant est très prisé.  Une longue file d'attente mais rapide tout de même. Il y a une file également pour commander à emporter. Et si vous ne terminez pas votre plat, ils peuvent vous faire un \"emporter\". Sympa"}
{"text":"À faire si vous êtes de passage à Montréal c'est quand même the place de la poutine. Vous arrivez vous prenez une poutine large et c'est parti pour le régal et le plaisir à l'excès. Une fois que vous aurez trop mangé vous vous sentirez mal et vous regretterez à coup sûr de l'avoir finie mais au final vous repenserez au moment où vous aviez la tête dedans et vous vous direz que ça valait le coup!"}
{"text":"Excellente poutine, large choix de plats typiques de la région et ambiance sympa pour un tarif raisonnable font de cette institution un sure win. Par contre, se préparer à une longue attente car l'endroit est particulièrement populaire, quelque soit la saison."}
{"text":"favourite poutine spot!!!! by far the best in mtl! Be careful! Their portions are super huge and may leave you unable to move lol! A \"regular size\" can be shared! If you're a poutine lover such as myself?! I encourage you to go!  in love from toronto!"}
{"text":"After waiting for an hour and a half on line to get into la banquise after the festival of lights, I can say it was only half worth it. It was freezing cold outside and the line was crazy long. The poutine wasn't even that good it  was decent at best. They do have a lot of options though and that was good. They are also open 24 hours a day so that is why we decided to go here."}
{"text":"First time here. Of course lines are 30 minutes wait but it's worth it! They have a huge menu of Poutine. It was filling and portions are big."}
{"text":"Food wasnt all that, but the atmosphere and service made up for it. I dug the loud music, punky waitstaff, and sort of rowdy crowd downing beers and shoving sloppy food into their faces. We each got a regular sized poutine and a beer, which was more than enough food for the both of us.   BTW - Cash or debit card only"}
{"text":"On my holiday pilgrimages back to Montreal, no trip is complete without a stop at banquise. It is the taste of home, with some optional twists. A favourite is La Hot Dog, which is hands down the best hot dog poutine you can find. This is not the stuff of depanneurs."}
{"text":"Open 24/7!! Amazing plus. You can always crave your hunger. There are separate lines for to-go and dine-in. During peak time for dine-in, the wait would be around 45 min. It cash-only/debit card place. So, please be aware with that. They do accept US dollars.  The poutine looks and tastes amazing. I tried La Chicks and La T-Rex. I'd personally ranked 'em one of the best poutine I'd have had. Not being a Canadian, maybe my bar might  be low but they were were as good if not better than other places I tried in Quebec City and Montreal."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to La Banquise because they offer vegetarian poutine, which are very hard to find in Montreal (believe it or not).  This rating is solely based on the burgers since I don't really like poutines.  I have tried both of their specialties, \"Banquise Burger\" and \"Costaud Burger\", but don't set your expectations too high, the patties are unseasoned (or underseasoned at best) and the overall flavor you get comes from all the toppings.  Take notice that, when ordered in a trio, the hamburgers come with a huge amount of french fries that can easily feed two people.  Regarding the vegetarian poutine, my girlfriend said it was ok, but nothing extraordinary either."}
{"text":"Came to Montreal for the Poutine...and La Banquise didn't disappoint! A 5 star meal and exactly what I was hoping for on my first day in Montreal. The portions are big as well (I was well peckish and the normal size was enough for me but there is a larger size if required). 20+ different varieties of poutines so there is something for everyone. The line wasn't too long considering we went on a Friday evening (we pretty much got a table straight away) but the service afterwards wasn't the best. Not bad enough for me to rate this place any lower then a 5 though. The poutine I had at Patati Patata the following day was SLIGHTLY more delicious but it was very close.  Alcohol is served if you sit inside."}
{"text":"To hear people go on and on about how wonderful La Banquise is baffles me. I went to the spot after hearing many reports telling stories of how their poutines are \"the best in Montreal\". Hyperbole much? I had to try it out for myself.  I saddled up and visited the spot. The interior was what you would want from a poutine resto: unassuming and casual. The service was friendly and helpful. On to the food. I ordered the \"T-Rex\" that the menu describes asw having ground beef, pepperoni, bacon, hot-dog and sausage. I do have the tendency to have eyes bigger than my stomach so to make matters worse, I got the large. They don't call it a T-Rex for nothing. It was enormous. Homer Simpson enormous. Massive amounts of meat that were glistening in grease. Look, I love me a good poutine but this was wayyy overboard. I felt like I was sweating meat grease by the end of the meal - and not in a good way haha! Too much meat, IMO.  That said, I will have to go back and give it another try, maybe get a more standard/classic poutine. Until I do so, I can only give this a 3 star. Stay tuned for an update..."}
{"text":"Ok this is one of the best poutine restaurants. Nice vibe to it and it is conveniently open all night making it the perfect stop for a late night bite and an even better once you leave the party! That being said, at certain times you will find some long line ups, however they move pretty quickly (they have outdoor heaters in winter) both for take out orders or sit-ins. Needless to say their specialty is poutine but their menu features other options. I personally recommend the taquisa poutine with sour creme and guacamole, but if that's bot for your i'm sure one of the many poutine recipes will target your cravings."}
{"text":"omg there food is soooo good!!! the staff is amazing. I'm not a gravy person so i made my own poutine ( they allow you to swap out certain items ) it was sooooooooooooooo good. I would def recommend anyone going to Montreal to stop here. The burgers aren't too great though, but everything else was perfect! so if your looking to try Poutine, this definitely is the place to go they have like 25 different options."}
{"text":"Ask anyone where to go for poutine in Montreal, it's La Banquise, no questions asked. The line can get quite long during the early hours of dawn on a Saturday where tables are packed with intoxicated young'ins and bachelorettes are wondering if they'll get poutine sauce all over their veil. You're welcomed with a selection of high-calorie, high-carb deliciousness. For the out of towners, the potatoes may taste a little sweet, but the cheese curds and the sauce are like none you've had before."}
{"text":"So good. Not always worth the long waits. May try take out counter in the future. Very delicious with lots of selections and vegetarian options and sauces."}
{"text":"Many choices of poutine but never got out of there fully satisfied. Fries are a bit bland."}
{"text":"Been here two times now, both times late at night with so much booze in my system where I'm ready to lay down on the table after eating and go to sleep. My god the poutine is amazing! There's always a line, with tourists everywhere but I can completely understand why people want to go there. Every Montrealer I've spoken to told me to come here. Every single one. We had 5 people in our group and ordered the classic with extra cheese curds because that's what you have to get. We also ordered the T-Rex which comes with ground beef, pepperoni, bacon & hot-dog sausage. It's a heavenly overload. Two of those for 5 people was the perfect amount. As we were leaving, the waitress comes with four plates for a group of 4 thin athletic Quebecois ladies. May the poutine lords have mercy on their arteries."}
{"text":"Were visiting Montreal for New Years and our Uber driver strongly recommended La Banquise. After seeing the long line outside we convinced ourselves that it must be worth the wait. We painfully waited an hour+ in the freezing cold. I think because of the wait we had pretty high expectations but the overall experience was average. The service was great but the poutine was okay. We tried four different types and nothing amazed us. I had too much gravy on mine and my plate was too small for the large amount of poutine. This normally wouldn't be a bad thing except I couldn't mix all of the elements together for fear they would topple over and just felt very messy. I would go again if there is no line but would not wait in those conditions again. Recommend they fix or install more heaters outside for the waiting crowd in the cold."}
{"text":"I only have a tourist's perspective...but this was a mighty delicious pile of comically unhealthy food. It's probably good to get the \"basic\" poutine elsewhere first, then one of the crazy arrays of toppings available here to compare. Both ways have their merits.  I know poutine is meant for the inebriated, but the beer list offers a range of quality local stuff."}
{"text":"Seriously the best poutine I had. My first time I had poutine was in New York City but here in Québec you get the real deal.  There was an influx amount of people but the service is quick.  You get the option to go or to manger ici.  I decided to take out and in a matter of some minutes my number was called. Seriously fast.  I had the Poutine classique. So I am content with the place. hopefully I can come on a freezing day at 3 in the morning"}
{"text":"As a Canadian transplant in NYC, I often find myself shaking in poutine-withdrawal. Luckily, on a recent trip to Montreal, I was able to satisfy that craving like never before.   There were three of us, and we each ordered a small poutine (classic, Hawaiian, and 3-meat). That was kind of a mistake, since between the three of us, we finished only one of the MASSIVE plates. I ate until I couldn't eat any more, and kept eating some more. The crispy fries, the beefy gravy, and the squeaky cheese curds made for a perfect combination of gooey, cheesy, salty, and yummy. Although they do have over 20 different variations of poutine, I think the classic is really all you need- at some point, the extra stuff just gets in the way.  Sure, it's small and packed with French-speaking college kids, the decor is weird in a pseudo-European way (a fake tree dominates much of the ceiling), you will leave smelling like a fry cook (and, if you are anything like me, with the top button of your jeans undone). Is it worth it though? ABSOLUTELY :)"}
{"text":"Serveuse désagréable, Poutine copieuse mais plutôt bonne, surtout quand on sort de soirée à 4h30. L'avantage du restaurant c'est qu'il est ouvert 24h/24. Poutine aux environs de 10,90$.   Conseil : Poutine spéciale festival du rire pour ceux qui y vont prochainement. J'ai adoré !"}
{"text":"On an uber ride going somewhere unrelated, our driver asked if we had poutine yet and although we did once, it was not at the 'poutine hot spot. ' On his suggestion, we tried out La Banquise.   We arrived at the restaurant and even in the middle of the snowstorm there was a line out the door. Naturally we knew we had to get in on this not so hidden gem. We waited approximately 40 minutes until we were seated.   We ordered 1 large poutine (for those that don't know, it's a bowl of fries covered in gravy and cheese curds) with bacon and hot dog. We also got 2 burgers and 2 beers. We were stuffed.   The burgers were average but the poutine was awesome. The fries were cooked well, the gravy was just the right amount and the cheese curds - well it's cheese so it was amazing.  We were so impressed that we returned the next Dr and ordered 3 different poutines to try. All 3 were great and had its own special kick to it - peppers, tomatoes, smokiness. There were only 2 of us so we took half of it back to the hotel and enjoyed it as drunk food the next evening.   Of you're in Montreal, try this place out. Don't get intimidated by the line and bring cash - they don't take most international cards but there is an ATM by the front door. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Question 1. How the hell do people in Montreal stay as thin and svelte as they do with places like Resto La Banquise perpetually having a line? Question 2: How the hell can you have a menu with only about 25 different types of poutine and a few hot dog and hamburger options and perpetually have a line? Question 3: Why hasn't the poutine crazed infested NYC (I know it has been tried in the LES but, really, that's it?).  Questions I pondered after waiting in line in the freezing Montreal winter cold for 25 minutes, being cramped at a table for 2 and eating 2 small orders of poutine: one, the classique, the other, the smoked meat with pepper sauce.  Surrounded by Quebecoise families (all skinny and French speaking may I add) and tourists alike, this poutinnerie has been deemed best poutine in Montreal. Hmmmm. I wouldn't say that. But, it was solidly good and there is definitely a poutine wow factor with the amazing long list of varieties from Mexican Poutine topped with guac and sour cream to the pizza topped with pepperoni, mushrooms and peppers.  I preferred the classique version over the smoked meat and pepper sauce version though having the combo was definitely a smart move. Too much of the same taste would have been old and definitely not worth the calories. The smoked meat however wasn't filled with flavor and was a bit of a let down.  In and out in like 30 minutes filled to the brim with delicious gravy covered fries with cheese curds = 4 stars. Worth the wait for the poutine? Hmm, I don't think so. Worth the wait for the tourist factor and feeling part of the local scene and being able to say you've dined here to locals? Yep."}
{"text":"Les poutines de La Banquise sont apparemment les meilleures de la ville, et je trouve cela plutôt juste! Je préfère prendre à l'emporter aux heures de pointe car c'est très bruyant et la musique est très forte -j'aurais de la peine à manger dans ces conditions.  Comme c'est ouvert 24/24, on peut y aller n'importe quand, donc si vous voulez manger sur place, je vous conseille d'y aller plutôt l'après-midi ou tard le soir."}
{"text":"Awesome poutine, open 24 hours, and a decent selection of bottled beer...what more could you ask for?  Be adventurous, try a funky poutine!"}
{"text":"C'est bien, sans plus. Leur réputation les devance; un peu trop. Toujours trop plein et pas toujours excellent. Ne parlons même pas des prix gonflés par leur réputation, uniquement. Vous devez y aller, parce que c'est \"La Banquise\", c'est tout."}
{"text":"Got the chicken and peas Poutine this time but got the BOM and others before.  Very good Poutine overall but it gets crowded and difficult to get to as it is in the outskirts of downtown.  The wait is typically long and close sitting with others where you can hear everyone's conversation.  I would return but wished they had another location that is more accessible.  Food: 4/5, very delicious and never disappoints. It could be a little less saltier.  Service: 2/5, because it's often busy, service is very lacklustre here. The wait sometimes could be very long.  Ambience: 2/5, crowded tables and a lot of young people after the bar; it can get a little rowdy.  Price: 3/5, about $15 per person, it's a bit up there and versus Ma'am Borduc or Poutineville, the portions are not as big."}
{"text":"Epic poutine!!!"}
{"text":"It was rated the top Poutine restaurant by many; but I had better Poutine at many other places. Perhaps it's because the restaurant is always packed. Both Poutine I tried here: first one was covered with too much onions they covered the taste of other ingredients in it. I then learnt to order one without onion on my next visit. It was filled with sausages, ham, a lot of meat. It was good for the first bite and then i would feel sick of the taste. I struggled to eat half of it and then ask for take-away for the rest of them. Surprisingly, when I heated them up in the oven the next afternoon, they taste awesome. Perhaps it's because it wasn't hot enough when it reached the table. Or maybe they used good ingredients but because there were too many people, they didn't put in as much effort in cooking their usual standard. Service wise, they were courteous and great."}
{"text":"After 6 hours of drive into Montreal, checked in and yes this is where I'm heading. It's a pretty nice walk from the hotel I'm staying at, about 30-40 min. we went through some pretty busy streets and music was playing till late at night.   When we arrived at the poutine shop at 930, the lineup was waaaaay out the door. I wasn't too impressed with the lineup.. since it was a cold and windy night and we just drove like a gazillion miles to get here. After about half and hour of wait, finally we got seated. We got two poutines - one with guacamole, the other with hot chili, chicken burger and shepard's pie for four people - waaay too much food. guess my eyes were hungrier (is that a word??) than what my stomach can hold. Skip the burger and pie, have the poutine y'all, all the gravey gooey cheesy heavenly mmmmm.   We also had several beers - good stuff.   The only bone i want to pick is that there's not a whole lot of variety here. I get it's a poutine shop, everyone's here for poutine only blah blah. But c'mon since the lineup was so long, can't I atleast have some fish and chips, pizza, or other stuff to choose from?  Anyway poutine was fabulous. adorable little joint, always PACKED! cash only, pay first eat after. yum!"}
{"text":"My go-to place for poutine in Montreal. All the items I have tried from their menu are delicious! There is a covered patio at the back.  Word of advice: if you are in Montreal for a short time and want to eat here then please schedule your time accordingly as there has always been a big lineup extending to the sidewalk."}
{"text":"For muslims I recommend these (ask for vegetarian gravy): 1- mexicane(spicy) 2- taquise 3- rachel"}
{"text":"Good for a late night poutine - especially if you're taking out of town-ers."}
{"text":"We arrived at banquise around 11:45. We haven't wait so much and got a place at terrasse.  I ordered 3 viandes Poutine with a traditional coleslaw salad.  Though I like the poutine I don't think it was the best one.For me, La Banquise is more likely to be a tourist attraction and a good place for night life food. The poutine is too salty for me.   My no.1 poutine still goes Lemaire near Drummondville and Ben de la bedaine of Granby."}
{"text":"I've only recently become a fan of poutine so when I came to Montreal to visit I knew that I had to get some. The line out the door when you arrive is a testament to what you can expect and lucky for me, La Banquise did not disappoint! The place was packed so I have to commend the staff on working in such a loud, crowded, high-pace atmosphere of attending to customers. The menu options range from classic to interesting combinations. My friend and I shared a large order of Le Festival which came with onion rings. We originally had wanted just a snack but even when splitting the large, we were set for the whole evening."}
{"text":"oh. my! GOD! THIS ISN'T A RESTAURANT IT'S A COVEN OF FRENCH FRY SORCERERS!  Be me, in Montreal. Touristing, don't know where to go.  Want \"REAL\" poutine.  See article online, Montrealers saying dis be la place d'etre.  Go. Inside looks like Friendly Toast.  Feel at home.  Don't have to speak Francais.  Order poutine with hot dogs. #Klassy  Wait 20 minutes. Receive oval bowl with all the nice, transcendent delight of heaven and all the naughty of playing Russian Roulette with your pulmonary stuff. Hot dogs sliced on a slant so you know they ain't playin. Dem cheese curds be squeaky like whaaat.  Aww yeah, gravy-soaked fried potatoes. Get in me.  Every bite.  Oh mah gad.  Descend past the top layer, find the ratios of everything hold even to the nuclear center of the gravy-lubed haystack. Try. Can't. Can't even.  Eat until you feel Uncle Porkflaps-full. Go and sit in the park not saying a word for 90 minutes while your body catches up. Don't eat poutine the rest of the visit."}
{"text":"The line here can be very intimidating as it can really wrap around the corner but fear not, it goes by pretty quickly! We stopped in after doing a mermaid workout class (Aquamermaid) and were starving so each decided to get our own poutine.  We had la classique, le sud-ouest, la festival, and la taquise.  You could probably share 2 because they are so big and for some reason we even ordered cheese sticks (you get 3).  I would say 2 people could split a large easily.   Another tip - you can wait in a separate shorter line for take out!"}
{"text":"Great Poutine Every. Single. Time.  Best part is that it's open 24/7. We love coming here and trying different kinds of Poutine!! Our experience has always been good. Service is excellent and the servers are super friendly. Lineup is usually long but moves fast!  Only thing that i dislike about the place is that it's not very clean. The floors and tables are usually wet or dirty, and we have to request for a different table or spot each time.  Apart from this, this place is great!"}
{"text":"Physical and verbal abuse from waitress named Patricia, never again!  After waiting 45 minutes, I had to approach the waitress and have her say to me that if I didn't want to wait any longer, she would take my food and throw it in the garbage and if I didn't sit down she wouldn't serve me.  She elbowed me twice and as I was leaving said that she never wanted to see my face again.  After getting the card and name of the owner from another waitress, she tried to grab it out of my hand and swore at me.    Spoke to the owner and she apologized for the encounter and she explained that the waitress Patricia doesn't speak English well.  She sure knew how to be rude and cuss just fine. Talk about excuses.  After an experience like that, I would never recommend this place to anyone.  Besides, as a Montreal native, I heard this place is a tourist trap and  there are many newer and better places to go for specialty poutine."}
{"text":"Fantastic poutine. I should've just gotten the classic though cause the best part was the cheese curds. I just ate all of the curds in my order of t-rex and left the meat - they weren't needed."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The poutine portions are huge! And it's open 24 hours which makes it great for any time"}
{"text":"A very popular and trendy place in Montreal to get your poutine fix. It's usually quite busy here no matter what time of day you go so expect to at least wait in line before getting a seat as lines are usually out the door and down the street at times. They also offer takeout if you can't wait that long to dine in. It's a decent size restaurant. Many tourists and locals come here quite frequently. Prices are very reasonable and they offer 2 sizes; regular and large. Prices range from about $9-$13 which is really good for the amount of food that you get. Food comes out fairly quickly which is great! I ordered the meat variety poutine that has all kinds of meat such as pepperoni, slices of ham, ground beef and bacon! Super greasy and fatty but the poutine is delicious and they give you this humongous portion. I also ordered one of their specialty cokes with sugar cane in it as oppose to sugar. There are also a ton of options with so many different choices of poutine from your classic poutine with cheese curds and gravy to toppings such as pepperoni. Overall, great place to come for good delicious poutine. I come here over and over again. Definitely coming back here the next time I'm in Montreal. Another bonus about this place is that it's also opened quite late which makes it a great place to get food after clubbing or a party!"}
{"text":"La banquise, on l'aime pour son exécution parfaite du classique québécois qu'est notre bonne vieille poutine grasse.  La banquise, on l'aime parce qu'elle est toujours là quand on a besoin d'elle; un lendemain de veille ayant besoin d'un déjeuner suant le gras; un déviergeage de touriste face à la gastronomie québécoise; un besoin criant d'une place où continuer une soirée qui n'a pas envie de se terminer à la fermeture des bars à 3AM.   La banquise, on l'aime parce qu'elle convient à tous les portes-feuilles et toutes les diètes, avec ses immenses portions à prix modiques et sa savoureuse sauce végétarienne.  En gros, la banquise remplit bien son rôle, étant définitivement l'institution de la poutine à Montréal. Est-ce qu'on y sert LA meilleure poutine? En version classique, je dirais oui. Mais lorsqu'on a dépassé le stade du ''Je veux goûter la VRAIE poutine sans flafla'' et qu'on veut pousser le concept un peu, les possibilités sont bien plus intéressantes ailleurs si on ouvre un peu plus les yeux."}
{"text":"A MUST STOP! We got the smoked meat poutine and ended up devouring the whole box within 5 minutes. It was THAT good! The poutine at La Banquise is legit - everything from the fries to the gravy to the curds to the MEAT were perfection. The curds squeaked in my teeth as I ate them - that, people, is how you know that you're having some good poutine. Goddamn, my own review is making me drool and that photo that I've posted is definitely not helping lol."}
{"text":"Hang on. Wait... wait... wait... I need another five minutes before I can get up from the table.  I almost died IN poutine heaven.  Oh so dirty and so damn good!"}
{"text":"THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO RUN THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO EAT ABSURD POUTINE ARRANGEMENTS  the quest for poutine was in progress and La Banquise was the perfect way to refuel and celebrate after setting a new 10K personal record earlier in the day!  the Fred Caillou - poutine topped with merguez, ground beef, spicy sausage, and smoked meat - was fantastic. piled high with plenty of flavorful meats, salty and slighty spicy gravy, and perfectly squeaky cheese curds.  totally worth the wait to get your grub on in this funky restaurant. great music playing - old school hip hop, 80s alternative, French Canadian rock, a bit of everything. there are some pretty crazy poutine dishes on deck here and I would certainly come back to explore more.  I'm sorry, was I supposed to get tired of winning? WOOOOO!!!!!"}
{"text":"FYI: there can be a really long wait to get in! If it's cold out plan to be in line outside for 20 mins.  Boyfriend and I stood outside in -20 weather for 20 minutes and the poutine was pretty meh. Fries were undercooked and there was too much gravy."}
{"text":"COMPLETELY OVERRATED  The only reason why this spot gets such a good following is because of the 24hour open sign.  Poutine should never cost that much, no matter what one puts on it. It's a good place if you feel adventurous, but when you have tasted amazing poutine before, it kinda falls flat. Service is marginal and food taste ok at best. If you're looking for somewhere to eat after a night of clubbing, this might be it...if you're looking for the best poutine ever made, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Never been here to eat in as the line is always long but I've gotten take-out and it has never disappointed. It's open 24 hours so this is the place to satisfy your late night cravings. One of my favorite poutine places because they pour gravy on the fries and then they flip the to-go container over and pour more gravy on top of the cheese curds and toppings so that you have 360 degrees covering of gravy. The take-out line has not usually been as long as the dine-in line but it CAN turn into a decent wait so depending on the time of day you may have to be a quite patient. Luckily every time I have been here has been around 2 AM so I've only had to wait around 15-20 min. max for my food."}
{"text":"On occasion a fellow may want to have or beverage or six. And there is simply no better way to finish an evening then to meander into La Banquise and order a massive Poutine topped with hot dogs. The next day may be an odyssey of pain and self loathing, but its worth it because HOT DOGS."}
{"text":"Overrated and overcrowded. Not worth the wait. Perfect for tourists and people with little knowledge of poutine."}
{"text":"Waited over half an our for one plate of poutine after already been seated and already paid for our meal. I was appalled at the service and if there was an issue of people in he kitchen then should have been passed on to the customers as to the wait time on food. Disappointing."}
{"text":"We only spent one day in Montreal during our vacation and came to La Banquise to use this once in a lifetime chance to try Poutine. After we learned that they only accept cash and prepared ourselves for that we were seated right away in the lovely outdoor area in the backyard of the building. The waitress pretty quickly realized that we never tried the food before and then was very helpful with recommending the size to order. We tried two different sauces and where very happy with how it tasted. I would say it was a good Pountine but I have to admit that I don't have any comparison. The crowd at the restaurant was very laid back and you could see all kinds of people - business men and women, families, tourists and just friends hanging out. It really is a recommendable place to try Poutine."}
{"text":"I don't remember which one I ordered but I do remember liking their squeaky cheese a lot. It's a first for this west coaster.   The place smells of french fries a block away, but it goes well with their friendly casual environment."}
{"text":"What a place! Vast menu options, fun vibe and good food.  A goal for any tourist visiting Montreal is to try it's most famous food. On our quest to find the best poutine, La Banquise came up again and again in conversations.  The restaurant is fairly large and colourful. It has a very casual vibe, almost feeling like a upscale fast food joint. There was fun music playing and all the staff would sing along while running back and forth between errands.  The menu had many, many options that were very customizable. I chose the La Maty, a mix of bacon, green peppers, onions and mushrooms. I added ground beef as suggested by the waitress.  My friends who is a vegan was delighted to see that there was a vegan poutine, which he thoroughly enjoyed.   The food was good and very filling, I believe that this place is popular because of the heavy options and the exciting environment. I don't know if I would argue that it was the best poutine I've ever had, as it felt more like a dinner than a traditional poutine.   I would recommend this place to anyone that wants a treat but if you're looking for Montreal's best classic poutine, I would look elsewhere. Somewhere much smaller perhaps."}
{"text":"A bit crowded but who cares when the food is bomb?  bf and i shared the large La Dan Dan poutine w/ pepperoni, bacon, and onions. O.m.g it was so friggen good. cheese curds were amazing and we were fighting for every piece of it. well worth the wait.  dont go to any other poutine place because it wont be as legit as this one"}
{"text":"Open 24/7! Cash only or their Canadian debit. Very affordable poutine joint! They have a backyard area too. Been here twice now and really enjoy having this option as a late night snack. It's very different from a pizza. They have lines for food to go as well as for dining in. It's a very organised operation. Once you are seated, they'll take your order and your pay up front before receiving the food. Must be a previous issues with dine and dash customers! All good, this concept did not bother us at all and I think this is actually a great idea! They have several beer selections for you to choose from. The poutine list is fairly huge. I really enjoyed just the steak and onions. Simple but so delicious with amazing flavour and taste. you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I have gone twice this trip and the poutine is great. Many kinds to choose from...the one with hot sauce and banana peppers was a great compliment to any of the meat ones. Portions are huge and poutine is great for breakfast when you've been out partying! I went on a weekday morning and was seated right away outside in the back porch. If you go on a weekend prepare to wait, unless you call ahead and do take out. They have a breakfast menu, but to be honest I didn't even give it a look. This place is a must try if you're in Montreal! It's a laid back, casual place, and the waitresses are generally knockouts. I will definetlly make my return!"}
{"text":"Amazing poutine spot! They have A LOT of varieties, and each is thought out carefully and the flavours and ingredients match very well.   The line can be crazily long, so be prepared to wait, but it is very worth it.  I tried one of the poutines with a lot of meat and it was totally an indulgence. They have gravy that is not the typical kind, and other interesting additions. Very busy and lively spot!  Will be back, next time I'll go just after opening/before closing and see how the line is."}
{"text":"First time in Montreal and the one place we had to try especially being in Canada was poutine and I was so glad we were able to try this place out twice in the span of four days because this has got to be the best poutine there. My boyfriend and I visited La Banquise in two separate occasions and I have to say my first visit was my favorite. Being a New Yorker we weren't very well versed in French as that was the main language there but no worries everyone was still able to communicate in English and we had no problems having our orders taken. But even now writing this review about two week after our visit I can still taste the poutine and wish I could go back and have some more. My favorite part of my visit was definitely the cheese curds and the fries were doused in just the right amount of gravy. A must visit place if you're planning on visiting montreal! The plus side is that they're open 24/7!"}
{"text":"I've been to La Banquise at least 5 times and I have yet to discover why it is acclaimed one of the best Poutine places in Montreal. The fries lack crisp to them and sometimes, they are just soggy. The sauce has no special flavour to it, tastes just like any other gravy. However, they do serve a multiple different variations of poutine with different toppings and each portion is quite generous (a small is sufficient to feed one person).   If you are looking for a good poutine, try ma poule mouillee across the street (they have a killer horizon, Portuguese chicken poutine!)  CONS: soggy fries, ordinary sauce PROS: variety, open 24 hours"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  Before my celiac diagnosis I would come a few times a month to assuage my hunger.  The food is hot, delicious, and despite the line up and crazy amount of traffic, service is reasonable. However, I stopped visiting for a while because I found out that I have celiac disease, which means no poutine sauce.  However, fear no more!  The vegomane sauce (vegan poutine sauce) is now gluten free!  You need to be very specific with your waiter to ensure you do not get a vegomane poutine (unless daiya dairy free cheese is your forte) but celiacs and gluten intolerant people can now rejoice again!  Fries are made in a dedicated deep fryer.  I would be leery of their add on ingredients however, as I think they fry everything on the same surface.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Locals say it's the best poutine in town! In town = Montreal, Montreal = poutine capital of the world... You see where I'm getting at. Best poutine I've ever had. Tons of options it's unbelievable!  Craft beer selection is on point! Open super late for your after club cravings and late night munchings. Must go to complete your Montreal experience"}
{"text":"This is the Anchor Bar of poutineries. It's touristy and overcrowded, and it seems to be resting on its laurels. The wait: Over an hour, much of which was spent outside in sub-20°F temperatures. Of course, there's only so much that can be helped. A lot of people gave up from the back of the line or never even started waiting. Any thought to a second location? The atmosphere: Noisy, crowded. I don't know how people spend more than half an hour here, so why the hour wait? It's not the loudest place ever, but that's because the music isn't turned up. Everyone else's voices echo over your table. The poutine: Bleh. BLEH, I say. The curds melted right in, no squeak at all. The fries were average to good poutine fries, I'll give them that, though not crispy the way I like it. The sauce was almost sugary, not at all what I want to taste on my poutine. I got the T-Rex. Let's see... it had bacon (half a strip at most, probably less), ground beef (plenty), pepperoni? (none), and hot dog (half a link at most, probably less). What it had a TON of was strips of what seemed like either Canadian bacon or SPAM (yes, I shit you not), that tasted like burnt plastic.  Sorely disappointed by just about every aspect of this visit. After all the hype, this turned out to be one of the worst poutines in Quebec. (It still is better than most Stateside, but that just tells you about US poutine.)"}
{"text":"On my trip to Montreal early this year in January, my lady and I stumble upon this delicious place. It's been said to serve the best poutine here in Montreal so I had to give it a try (which by the way, was my first time trying poutine). AMAZING! La Banquise did not disappoint at all; it was delicious and for the price, let's get another! I ordered the poutine with bacon and added guacamole because why not? And it was delicious to the point I wanted another one. The place is decent, it is CASH ONLY but they do have an ATM inside for those unlucky ones carrying around credit cards. The employees were nice and very formal and spoke both French and English (just in case some of you don't speak too well French). I will definitely stop by again when I return to Montreal."}
{"text":"Bon, je ne comprends pas l'engouement aussi immense pour la banquise. La poutine est correcte, sans plus. Je trouve la sauce trop sucrée... C'est peut-être le fait que le resto soit ouvert 24/24? C'est vrai qu'à la sortie des bars, tout goûte délicieux! :)  Belle grosse sélection de poutines, incluant une alternative végane et sans lactose."}
{"text":"It was just okay. If ever I'm in Montreal, I'll have to visit this place again for another go.  The line up was super long, we waited almost a 45 minutes to get seated, which is totally understandable as this place is pretty popular!   I ordered a basic poutine, it was pretty basic. Lacked some flavor, and was just warm.   Maybe next time it'll be a better experience. I'm sure it was just a one off."}
{"text":"One word: Amazing!  If you're in Montreal visiting then I'd strongly recommend this place. I went here on my birthday since I wanted to experience real poutine. My husband and I shared three dishes, but only really ate one and a half since we were so full. We got the Bacon, Chicken, and \"Nacho\" poutine. The bacon was our favourite, but the nacho one was GREAT! Tomatos and poutine is surprisingly amazing together.   If I lived Montreal this would be my go to place! Long lines and busy staff are a con, but they were extremely friendly. I'd recommend a first time goer to be patience and understanding towards the staff; also, SHARE SHARE SHARE with whoever is your date.  5 out of 5!"}
{"text":"Best poutine ever! The only serious waiting period is getting through the door at anytime you wish to go. Large variety of meat and vegetable combinations. They clearly use fresh cheese curds and the gravy is made fresh everyday, throughout the day and is never too salty. Be prepared for larger-than-your-average-poutine portions. Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"What is there left to say about La Banquise. Its a pretty iconic place in MTL. Easy argument for the best poutine in the city. This is where I had my first poutine, and have continued to eat here for many times. They're open late, so this is a nice place to go after the bar and fill your belly."}
{"text":"Tried poutine for the first time at 3 places in Montreal. Resto La Banquise was the best. Came around 3 in the afternoon so no line. Got one regular and one with all sorts of meat toppings and pepper gravy. If it's this good when it's 90 degrees out it must be really great in the winter."}
{"text":"One of my two favorite poutine locations in Montreal. The line is a bit too long and the prices are a bit too high for it to be number one, but it's still a worthwhile visit. The sheer number of varieties of poutine is commendable, though they tend to be a bit more affected and pretentious."}
{"text":"Poutine was good- colorful atmosphere. Long line but the waiting time was reasonable- within 10 minutes."}
{"text":"The poutine here is good and it was the first time I had it, but then we got some poutine from a truck the next day and it tasted just as good if not better, minus the long wait in line."}
{"text":"What can be said about La Banquise that hasn't already been said? There was a line out the door and we waited an hour to get in but it was worth it. They have vegan gravy for those that are vegetarian and it's not disappointing at all. They also have vegan cheese if anyone is interested. Anyway, the poutine is fresh and amazing. You have to go if you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"Favorite is T-Rex. Although everything else is super unique and good.  Be aware though, it gets quite packed at night especially around 2-4am!"}
{"text":"I wasn't surprised that there was a long line/wait for this poutine on a rainy day. It's basically comfort food for rainy and cold days like this. We got there around 5 something and the line wasn't as long, but when we left around like 6 there was a long line, lined up along the window of the shop. It seems really small outside but it's pretty big on the inside, crammed with tables. It took a while for us to get the waiters attention, probably due to the fact that is was busy like hell.  Besides the craziness, the poutine really hit the spot. We ordered the pulled pork poutine and the Matty. Maybe it was just me but the potatoes has a tint of sweetness to them, which was really good. The pulled pork poutine was a little sweet and the Matty was more to the savory. For 4 people, we order 2 regular size poutine. It's was just enough for a snack. Besides the poutine we tried the Bec soda, a maple soda. The soda was great with the poutine, it cuts the heaviness of the poutine. Overall, one of the best comfort food I've had and expect it to be bustling with people."}
{"text":"This is probably Montreal's most famous restaurant (along with Schwartz's) and there's a reason why. It's cheap, it's open 24/7 and can serve a ton of people fairly quickly. But before you enter this establishment to try their famous poutines, you might want to join a gym and make sure you stick to a strict diet for a few months afterwards. But more on that later.  We went clubbing all night. We were drunk. We were hungry and needed to sober up on a Saturday night; actually morning, it was 3:30AM. We carefully made our way over to this place and low and behold, a friend that we thought we had long lost a few hours before was in front of the line waiting for us. We cut everyone and proceed to be seated about five minutes later. Sweet.  For those who might be left out in the dark, poutine is a local specialty from Quebec and consists of fries covered in cheese curbs and gravy. It's not a healthy meal but tastes delicious.  The three of us ordered three different poutines - shut up, we know it's unhealthy but we had to try it! - we settled for the T-Rex Poutine (minced meat, pepperoni, bacon and smoked sausages), the Obélix Poutine (smoked meat) and the Frank Poutine (merguez sausage). We paid right after ordering and just minutes later our three plates arrived.   After feeling a great deal of shame, we devoured each plates, each bite slicing our dignity (we had little left at that point) and we were left starring at the empty plates, embarrassed. We had each consumed a ridiculous amount of calories at that point, enough to discourage us from cabbing it back to the hotel; we instead walked all the way back which took over 30 minutes.  Months later I'm still burning that stuff off but hey, it was well worth it. Just make sure to try it if you haven't been, it's a must visit place in Montreal. The service and prices are excellent but keep in mind that the lines are long there, especially after the clubs close at 3AM."}
{"text":"This is our first trip to Montreal and poutine was a must on our list of foods to try out here! When we arrived we were immediately greeted with the popularity of La Banquise by standing in line for a solid 30mins before we were seated (there were a ton of people in line and the staff did an amazing job of moving people through and keeping the food flowing)! The staff was very helpful, the veggie burger was amazing and the poutine was the best choice we've made so far! (Also, try the Apricot beer, it's delicious)!"}
{"text":"What started off as a hot dog and fries joint in the late 60s, La Banquise has become one of the city's preeminent poutineries. They've created an entire spectrum of poutine that goes beyond just gravy, cheese curds, and fries; a variety of which would appease all sorts of palates.   The poutine portion of their menu is incredible. There are all sorts of combinations, even specialized ones like an all vegan one (Veganomaniac). I really wish I was able to try them all but the standouts for me were the:  The T-Rex - chopped steak, pepperoni, bacon, sausage, hot dog. The Reggae - chopped steak, guacamole, diced tomatoes, hot peppers Bougalou - pulled pork, creamy cabbage salad, sour cream The Shoot Out - smoked meats, spicy sausage, pepperoni, bacon The Duleton - chopped steak and onions  I also highly recommend coming with a large group. Fortunately I was able to roll with a deep crew of dining companions and we were able to order all sorts of food for everyone. There may be a wait depending on the time of arrival, but thank goodness this spot is open 24 hours a day.  At one point they were a divey spot, but after a change in ownership a couple of decades back, followed by a huge renovation, this has become an eatery that plenty to offer. There is now burgers, sandwiches, soups, salads, and a separate brunch menu. A big plus for drinkers: they also have a ton of craft brews.  Service is also good for what it is. They deal with a lot of knuckleheads on the weekend and minus the ambiance of young folks, it's also not a bad idea to come in and order takeout. Drunk or sober, be sure to bring your appetite."}
{"text":"Had the Poutine Classique while on tour here last year, after being told by almost every Montreal resident to go here for the best poutine. It was very good and the Large portion is more than enough for one person, I'd say it's even enough for 2 people."}
{"text":"3/5 parce que c'est une institution à Montréal, mais si on parle de poutine 1,5/5... Disons nous la vérité...TRÈS ordinaire.  La sauce est fade.  Les frites un peu trop grasses.  Choix de poutines impressionnantes, mais le goût y est beaucoup moins. On aime la banquise pour son ambiance, pour son histoire, pour son emplacement, ses bières...mais on repassera pour la poutine.  Je préfère aller chez Lafleur pour une poutine traditionnelle."}
{"text":"Had the vegan poutine. Husband had the classic. Really quick service, generous wait staff. We sat down around 2:30 on a Wednesday. Most of the tables were bustling by the time we left.   Classic poutine: cheese curds, gravy, fries.   Vegan poutine: shredded vegan cheese, vegan gravy, fries.  Fries were a great slightly crispy on the outside texture and soft on the inside. Good for grabbing all that gravy and cheese. Good ratios for all the three ingredients to have together - wasn't too much or too little of any of the flavors.   Would happily recommend to vegetarians or meat eaters."}
{"text":"Great fast food to go and eat. Great service. If you see the line to big don't worry it advances quick! Don't expect fancy restaurante, expect good fast food"}
{"text":"So many poutine options, we had la miam and la reggae.  Both were delicious and large servings.  Being from San Diego, la reggae was basically carne asade poutine ;)  Debit and cash only, so make sure you plan accordingly.  Also, Line can be quite long and out the door, best to come as 2 for faster service."}
{"text":"Amazing late night or hangover cure place! The selection of poutine is also fantastic.  Great place to bring tourists to try their first poutine"}
{"text":"Hum, d'abord le positif: le service était rapide et chaleureux. Pour la bouffe, c'était ok. Le burger végé etait bon. la poutine était grosse et bonne mais ca reste une poutine. La place devrait être nettoyée de fond en comble, le plafond et tout le reste est poussiéreux et collant/gras. ouf!"}
{"text":"I have never had poutine this goood! Even the potato is more delicious and tasted a little bit sweet for some reason...i saw lots of people ordered large size and finished only like 1/10 of their plate. .. i admire your courage! For those not sure about what size to order, this is regular!"}
{"text":"Loved their poutine.  Ordered a regular and it was huge.  Very filling and tasted great. Their fries and topping were fresh and high quality. This place is also open 24hrs. If you want to try some of the best poutine you have to hit up La banquise."}
{"text":"I am an absolute passionate about breakfast food, and do they deliver! Their breakfast food is delicious, as well as their poutines. burgers and shepherds pie!"}
{"text":"Yeah the reviews aren't wrong, this is the best poutine in town.  Expect to wait, expect to be full, and expect to be amazed at the enormous plate of fries that gets thrown at you after ordering.  They pile down the toppings and have multitudes of selections and even specials to make your fries just spectacular.  Go original if you want or venture out and go Texan or Mexican in the toppings.  Either way, you'll get some great fries, gravy, and cheese curds piled high for a reasonable price.  And expect leftovers."}
{"text":"Sloppy poutine is best served late, really late, like 3am. Maybe it's because you're too drunk to really gauge the food, maybe it's because you suddenly don't give a hoot about your diet, or maybe it's the electric vibe you get by being surrounded by a room full of poutine craving lunatics. I say it's all 3!!! Long live La Banquise."}
{"text":"This is heaven. Had the poutine with merguez, ground meat, smoked meat. I destroyed the dish in 5 minutes,  it's addicting and delicious. Had to convince myself not to order another one."}
{"text":"I had the chance to sample the poutine at La Banquise twice while on a recent trip to Montreal.  Both times were late at night (2-3AM), and both times they were very busy for such a late hour.  The staff was prompt and friendly, and the poutine was fantastic (I had poutine with bacon and poutine with smoked meat).  If you are in Montreal and need a poutine fix after a late night on the town, La Banquise is the place to go!  Just be prepared for a short wait, but it is definitely worth it!  They are also busy enough that there were taxis waiting outside of the restaurant for a quick easy ride back to the hotel."}
{"text":"Put-zin or poo-teen or something in between? I don't know but the waitress understood me when I asked for Poutine Obelix (smoked meat), one of the 25 poutine variations on the menu. I prounounced it like we do in Manchester, NH (put-zin). Busy, funky restaurant in the Plateau neighborhood. The regular sized serving was more than enough for me. Dinner for two and a couple of beers came to around $30. A bit expensive for fries, gravy and meat, but it was tasty comfort food."}
{"text":"Confession: I wouldn't really know good poutine from bad. It is all rather unappetizing to me. I prefer the Southwest's regional equivalent of chile cheese fries - shout out to Chubby's in Denver! Nonetheless, I brought a first time visitor to Montreal here to try poutine and he liked it. He ordered one of the varieties with multiple meats on it. It did not look appealing, actually it looked terrible, but apparently it tasted fine. I had a burger which was...meh. At 3:30am, the place is an odd mix of night-owls and drunkards - of course - and they do make you pay in cash and when you order, even with table service, which was odd."}
{"text":"You're either a poutine lover or hater, right?  After about a dozen visits to Montreal, I finally had to satisfy my curiosity.  Everyone pointed me to La Banquise for the best poutine in the city.  And I'm sure they're right. I'm not the only one using a $1,000 camera to take photos of a pile of soggy french fries with cheese curds.  OK, poutine. Lost on me.  Soggy french fries? Yuck.  Then again, I'm not much into gravy.  Now the cheese curds on the other hand... loved it.  But cheese fries are hardly novel.  But usually it's melted cheddar.  I ate about 1/2 the small plate... the bottom half of the fries were just a soggy mush.  Service was great... environment was nice.  Be sure to take a stroll around the park across the street to burn off some of those (insane) calories!"}
{"text":"Easily the best poutine in Montreal and it's open all day!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place because of the long line wait outside. We waited about 40 min to an hour to try the famous poutine here. We got La Classique, La \"3 Amigos\", and La Boogalou. I really enjoyed the La Classique, but the other 2 was just whatever. NYC, step up your poutine game!"}
{"text":"Que dire de plus que la meilleure poutine à Montréal ! Atmosphère électrifiante surtout aux petites heures du matin..."}
{"text":"YES! Love this crazy little joint. The poutine had copious amounts of cheese and gravy. There was a bit of a queue when we got there, but don't be put off, it only took about 10 mins to get a table. This place has a really fun and casual vibe. Go, if you're looking for Poutine in Montréal."}
{"text":"Popular poutine place in Montreal, its great because they have a large menu filled with options so that everybody can find something they like. However because of its popularity, its permanently crowded which causes a long wait to order/be seated/get your food"}
{"text":"I think this just wasn't for me, tbh. But worth a try if you're in Montreal for the first time."}
{"text":"Being a newbie to Montreal (having moved here recently from the UK) I was craving some good old British Fish n Chips. My husband has been trying to get me into the famous equivalent here - Poutine - but has failed on a few occasions. Anyway, it was 11pm and I was all ready to go to sleep when he randomly tells me to get ready to go have the best poutine I will ever eat... I was sceptical but went along with it.  Being a Friday night, we queued up for about 40-45 minutes until we got a table. I instantly loved the place and its ambiance! From the unique timber decorated ceiling to the vibrant colors and images that filled the walls. It was crowded and noisy but that is what made it so special. Whilst deciding on what to order (I couldn't make up my mind!) I glanced around the place looking at some huge poutine creations... It really was a difficult choice! We decided to go for a vegetarian poutine and I absolutely loved it! It more than satisfied my cravings as the greasy fries somewhat resembled the vinegar soaked chips in the UK but these were better as the gravy and accompaniments just added that extra oomph! I highly recommend going for a spicy ensemble (add hot peppers to your poutine) as it enhances the gravy flavors! The service was excellent despite the crowd and price wise it is reasonable too.  As someone who so far had not liked any poutine since moving here 8 months ago, this place has truly converted me and I cannot wait until our next visit!"}
{"text":"Meilleure Poutine en ville! Un peu chère pour une poutine, mais ça vaut le coup.  Énormément de variété également ainsi que plusieurs bonnes bières!  Personnel sympatique, nourriture délicieuse.  Seul point négatif, attendez vous a attendre pour avoir une place, l'endroit est souvent bondé (Et avec raison!)"}
{"text":"È il più rinomato per la poutine a Montréal e si conferma essere in assoluto il più fornito della città, con un menù da leccarsi i baffi. Io ho assaggiato la tradizionale e la porzione mi ha impressionato! Buoni gli ingredienti, gentile il personale e carinissimo l'ambiente. Assolutamente consigliato, anche se vi aspetta una fila di 15 minuti per entrare.  PS. Buona scelta di birre artigianali"}
{"text":"This June I went to Montreal for the first time (a very long over due visit), and while I didn't have a game plan for what to do I did know I wanted to eat. I know it probably seems very touristy, but I did want to find some awesome poutine in Montreal. I've had poutine before, but I've been told you can't really get great poutine outside of Quebec, and I wanted to see if that was the case. So I put out a request on Twitter asking where to find good poutine. I got a response back saying La Banquise, so I thought I'd check it out.  Resto La Banquise is apparently open 24 hours, and when I got there around 2pm it was busy. It seems like it's probably busy almost all the time. I got a seat outside, in a nice courtyard area, and proceeded to order poutine.   First any good Canadian will be able to attest to the fact poutine needs hot fries (preferabbly fresh cut, which these fries seemed to be), gravy, and arguably most important of all cheese curds (the squeakier the better). If you're visiting Montreal, or Canada just know real poutine uses cheese curds, not grated cheese or cheese sauce.  The restaurant was really busy when I was there, but it seems to be the kind place that's always busy. The waitress was very friendly, and my poutine came out perfect and pretty fast. Definitely a good place if you're craving some poutine, or if you've never had this delicious delicacy."}
{"text":"This place takes its poutine seriously. I've gone here repeatedly now, because it's really close to Parc La Fontaine - it's so easy to grab a poutine and head to the park to eat it. I have never seen so many varieties of poutine, and they are very filling, very tasty and very messy. Also, pretty affordable! My favourites are La Elvis (mmmm mushrooms and beef) and La Taquise (MMMM a huge glob of sour cream and two heaping globs of guacamole). If you're looking for fat, this is the place to find it. Every once in a while, a good helping of grease is good for the soul. The helpings are ample and the hip servers and cooks make it a cool place to go.  I loved going on a Friday night, when the music was blasting and the cooks were all singing away at the tops of their lungs, obviously having a really good time doing their jobs. I like positive energy being put into my food. The wait is not long at all for take-out, and even less of a wait if you're eating in-restaurant.  They have a big indoor section and a small outdoor patio. Great for all ages, and always open."}
{"text":"Excellent assortment of poutine available that transcends the traditional dish of just cheers, gravy & fries. While the lines can get quite long after-hours on a weekend night, it's worth the wait if you're leaving a bar or club and need to satiate your hunger."}
{"text":"A great late night snack! I happen to work nights and have come to this restaurant at all different random hours of the nights! The pluses are they have funky tables and great food (I love the Banquise burger and the poutines) the only downside is there are many young drunks there at all hours and the music is often played so loud you cant talk to whomever you are eating with. However, everyone had to try this place once! Prices are cheap and food is great!"}
{"text":"We read everywhere that you can't visit Montreal without trying poutine...so we did. It's not for everyone. Poutine is fries covered with gravy and sprinkled with cheese curds. It's EXACTLY how you'd expect it to taste =P   The ambience of this place is really chill and it seems like a fun place to hangout with buddies (especially if you're drunk). I liked the bright colors and the mismatched décor; appeals to the younger crowd as it seemed like everyone was under 30.   On to the food...the fries are really good! Unfortunately, that was the best part. The gravy was very wet and the taste got old fast so we ended up picking only the dry fries after awhile. If you want poutine with meat, I recommend getting the steak NOT the hot dogs. The hot dog was very rubbery and seemed like the cheap of the cheap stuff. They do have some decent beers too.  We would not return, but it's only because poutine is not our type of food. This place is doing something right because the locals LOVE it."}
{"text":"Si vous avez déjà goûté leurs poutines, essayez les burgers! Étonnament délicieux, avec la salade de choux en garniture."}
{"text":"L'endroit parfait pour passer après une soirée bien arrosée et fatigante. Paiement en cash a l'entrée. Ouvert 24h/24 pour une poutine bien copieuse et bien grasse comme on les aiment. Toute personne venant a Montréal doit au moins allé manger une fois la bas. Il est evident qu'il y a meilleur en ville, mais la Banquise tire son renom de ses heures d'ouvertures et la taille de ses poutines"}
{"text":"A very unique atmosphere with delicious poutine. Read other reviews and knew I had to try it. A must go for anyone visiting Montréal."}
{"text":"Everyone has to try this place at least once in their life. Whether you love poutine or have never had it- this place will open all doors to a whole new world of cheese and gravy. You might have to wait in line for a bit but once you're in, your stomach will be very satisfied."}
{"text":"they do not take credit cards. canadian debit or cash only (i was a bit peeved, when a visa decal is on the window, that means all forms of visa). but the food was good."}
{"text":"If poutine is your thing, then I'm sure you'll enjoy it. A plate of only okay fries, made soggy with a basic gravy and lesser version of mozzarella cheese is nothing to brag about, yet that is all that this city does. If you're planning a trip to Montreal and poutine tasting is at the top of your to do list, just go to Brooklyn and save yourself the trouble."}
{"text":"If you need a place to go for a hangover cure, desperately hoping for something to soak up all your alcohol, this is your spot.  If you just want a nice, normal meal, this place is just okay.  While they do have practically every poutine option you can imagine, the overall vibe was less than charming.  It reeks of grease the minute you walk in (again, a plus for some). The tables are not exceptionally clean or comfortable."}
{"text":"The place for your poutine craving. Think of any fancy or weird poutine and they make it! Also they have bar license, ie. serve beers, what a great poutine needs :)"}
{"text":"The lineup for this place is very long. I like the variety of their Poutine. They actually put a lot of stuffs (cheese curds, meat, we order the ones with meat), heavy but tasty. We ordered regular size and their portions are good enough for us."}
{"text":"You want 3am post-clubbing poutine? La Banquise has got ya covered! I have no idea why it took me so long to finally visit this place but it was totally worth my (inexcusable) wait. I ordered the boogalou poutine (pulled pork, coleslaw, and sour cream) which was TO DIE FOR. They brought out our orders within 10 min. and every bite was heaven sent. I know they usually have a line-up during the day but even then, I still think it's worth it to visit if it isn't crazy long. Quirky and cute decor too!"}
{"text":"Great introduction to poutine - especially for a vegetarian from Colorado! Cozy atmosphere. Don't go if you are on a diet!"}
{"text":"Everything you ever need in one place. And it's open 24/7 what else can you ask for. A must when visiting Montreal. Poutines galore.  To be honest, I was quiet intoxicated when I came here at 0300h, but I'm certain the poutine saved me."}
{"text":"The lineup is worth the wait! Even in -10 celcius where the air is starting to hurt your face theres a lineup out the door! The restaurant is crowded with a cozy feeling, the atmosphere was very enjoyable.   I was with a group of 4 we all ordered seperate poutines, the regular size is more than enough for one person. I also ordered the pogo which brought back alot of childhood memories. I ordered the poutine with sour creame and guac. The poutine was lifht and refreshing. Usually when i order a poutine im sick of the flavour halfway through but i ate the entire thing!   Also ordered the house brewed beer, its a regular pale ale, nothing too special but its worth a try if youre coming from out of town.  Next time im in town ill be coming back for more poutine!"}
{"text":"What does a university student who finds herself wide awake and starving at 5AM decide to do as a spur-of-the-moment decision? Walk, to La Banquise, of course, since that seems like the most logical decision! But seriously, go there after the late-night après-clubbing rush so you can avoid the hordes of drunk students who make the long line seem even longer. There was literally no one else when I walked in, something that surprised me considering that when I went in the spring of last year, it was packed to the brim.  I decided to try one of their unique twists on poutine instead of the usual \"La Classique,\" so I ordered \"La Taquise\" since it seemed the most appealing and not doused in meat like the other ones. One might not think that gravy and guacamole go together, but they surprisingly tasted really good! I just wish the guacamole contained more chunks of avocado instead of being totally pureed, but it helped some of the cheese curds stay in their solid form instead of conglomerating in a gloppy mess. The sour cream and tomato made the poutine more refreshing and provided a nice contrast to the hot gravy, making the dish all the more interesting. I ended up finishing the whole plate, which says quite a bit since they fill it to the brim with fries and condiments. They definitely are not cheap when it comes to giving you lots of food.  La Banquise is definitely worth the hype in my opinion, and their poutine offerings are some of the highest quality available in Montréal. Now, if only they had a delivery service so I wouldn't have to order Chef on Call if I'm too lazy to walk and need a poutine fix... (Hint: it's not that great)"}
{"text":"La Banquise changed my world.   My cousin and I got off our 5 hour train ride up to Montreal and she insisted we go here that very night. The miserable walk through snowy freezing weather was immediately forgotten the moment we walked in...  I tried poutine for the first time here and I guess I spoiled myself because wow it was just so much goodness on my plate and I don't think anything will ever be the same. It's probably a good thing I live on the opposite coast of a completely different country otherwise I think I'd end up here at least once a week for the drunk cravings.   We had the La Mexicaine and it was truly divine, especially with the added bacon :)    Definitely a must-try when you're in Montreal"}
{"text":"This place has been reviewed to death, but here are my two pesos.  I don't know about the 'best poutine' label, but La Banquise does a mean poutine, mang.   I had the regular poutine with vegetarian sauce and it was all that I expect of a Montreal poutinerie and checked all of my boxes:  [] Squeaky Curds [] Hot, salty gravy [] Soft Fries with crunchy corners [] Will cause arteriosclerosis in 10 years  I will return, but still in search for the best poutinerie in the world. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Friday night around 3:30 a.m. and waited in line for 30 minutes. The line moves surprisingly quick IMO. The place has poutine with every kind of topping combination imaginable. The portions were extremely large...way too much for me to finish, that's for sure. I ordered the regular size Poutine T-rex (with ground beef, bacon, smoked sausage and pepperoni) and had plenty leftover. So good though after a long night out on the town! Though the place was a bit far out there, there was a small lineup of cabs ready to take us to wherever we needed to go afterward."}
{"text":"Packed to overflowing. Loud and hectic. Service at all stages took quite a while. Sandwich and salad were small, but poutine was huge. The side salad, by the way, was about 1/3 shredded carrots. Flavors were okay, I suppose. Nothing about the meal was especially satisfying to me. I'd say go there after plenty of drinks and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant was very nice looking. The decor was fun and interesting. It was pretty packed, but still not too crowded nor too loud.  My boyfriend and I shared 2 different poutines and while one was great, the other was just okay.  The first poutine, with merguez sausage, was very good and the ingredients really complemented each other. The second poutine with chicken and pepper sauce was not as good. I found the peppersauce to taste like a boxed mix."}
{"text":"if you pass by Montreal you must try this restaurant! BEST POUTINE IN TOWN! and it  is opened 24h! but around 2 - 4 am it is so crowded better get there earlier"}
{"text":"For great Poutine at any hour..... Late night tends to be a line up but it's worth it. Ohhh make sure you have cash. They don't take cards late night."}
{"text":"I drove through snowstorms, twice, from Boston to Montreal for authentic poutine. La Banquise has amazing stuff, it will definitely kill you, but I love it love it!!  My buddy and I would always laugh at the \"Three Amigos\" Poutine - three shady meats haha what a way to go    I heart & miss Montreal a lot."}
{"text":"The wait for this place was surprisingly fast... and this place was definitely hoppin'. Upon walking towards this restaurant, the area just ooooozed the smell of poutine-goodness.  I got the L'Obélix, which was poutine with smoked meat. I very much enjoyed it but thought that I would have enjoyed it more without the smoked meat. I thought there was a slight disconnect of flavours between the smoked meat and the poutine... but maybe i was just crazy. I liked eating the two entities in different bites, instead of together. I also tried bites of La Végétarienne (the vegetarian poutine) and I'd have to say the vegetarian version of their gravy tasted legit! Definitely not a place I would come to two days (or multiple times in a week... or multiple times in a month), but not because it isn't good food, but because my body probably wouldn't be able to handle all the poutine-goodness too often."}
{"text":"24 hour diner that offered a large array of poutine options and trust me if you can't find one of their monstrous combinations to your liking you can definitely create your own! The line is always out the door it seems, but we were able to sneak in right before the lunch crowd hit.  Service is great, everyone is very nice and spoke English (or they sit you with the servers that speak English.   We ordered a salad (need something to cut the grease) and a order of the most popular poutine and well it is absolutely yummy! It was honestly not the best, especially with all the hype around this place, but also not the worst - so just okay.  Would return for late night poutine if nothing else around is open and I am nearby but nothing that I would make a trip out for specifically."}
{"text":"*sigh* I just love this place. I love that it is open 24/7. I love how it has so many different poutines to choose from. I love their gravy (not beefy like New York Fries). I can split a small/regular poutine with someone and be nicely full. Last time I was there, I wanted to try their steamie hotdog, but unfortunately their machine was broken. We were there around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon and there was still a 10-minute wait, but the poutine was well worth it. Note that they do not take credit cards. Will definitely go again and recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for poutine in Montreal. There's a line all the time but it moves fast. Every time we come to Montreal we come to this place. This place has a great variety of poutine to choose from."}
{"text":"There's always a line here and it's there for a reason.  This is the best Poutine in Montreal.    I'm not a huge huge fan of Poutine but at least La Banquise makes it bearable for me.  There are tons of options, ranging from the Classic with cheese curds and gravy to toppings like hot dogs, corn dogs and sausages.  Each of the different options is just a classic Poutine with additional toppings on top.  If you get a burger and substitute the fries with a Poutine--- you get a regular portion of Poutine.  Quite a lot of food.  I think 3 orders for a group of 4 is the perfect portion.    The Guacamole is too creamy so I'd avoid that one, the B.O.M. was really good but just too much for one person to handle so i guess the Classic is the way to go."}
{"text":"Long lineup but amazing poutine! The taco poutine was excellent and the serving size monstrous. Worth the wait and taxi ride there, definitely a highlight of Montreal for me."}
{"text":"Amazing place. I have been here both for breakfast and dinner. First, let me start off with the dinner. I had, of course, a poutine. And I had, of course, the T-Rex. Why? Why not! It is a mountain of meat on a poutine! While they do not skimp on the meats, they did skimp a little on the cheese curds. Therefore, you might want to ask for some extra cheese curds. But overall, it is amazing. And yes, the pictures posted on Yelp are a true interpretation on how insanely over-the-top their poutines are!  But one of the real gems of this place is their breakfast. Just a warning, if you go on the weekend, they don't start serving breakfast until 7 AM (hard for us early birds, and no, I am not 87 years old). Just like their poutine, their breakfast is over-the-top as well as reasonably priced. I had three eggs, three strips of bacon, two sausage links, toast, French toast, homefries and some type of spread that is big here in Quebec (have no idea what it is called), with a coffee and orange juice for only $12 total. And, again, the portions are huge. While everything was great with the breakfast, I recommend the French toast.  I highly recommend La Banquise for either breakfast or dinner. You leave happy...and full!"}
{"text":"Ohhhh how I wanted to love it...  it was -35C or lower with windchill and a 30 minute bus ride to get here so it took dedication and perseverance to consider La Banquise.  We were stuck trying to figure out when to get off the bus and laughed that it must be where a crowd had formed.   Turns out... we were about to join a fairly long line of people to get poutine.   Yup,  a rather off hour in ridiculous temperatures and there were probably 20 people outside and even more crammed inside waiting for a place to sit.   They did have heaters to stand under but it was so cold it didn't really matter at that temperature.   A group of friends ahead of us got in fight about whether or not to wait in the line and when one friend bolted for a nearby restaurant where you could go in immediately,  shattered friends followed (and we got to move up faster!  woot!   heartiness for the win!)    So yes... I expected to be in love with poutine here when I finally put it in my mouth.   I should preface,  I'm a vegetarian so not all poutine caters to me and I therefore may not have ever really developed the taste for it.  The vegan sauce is why we selected La Banquise for our poutine quota.  I actually don't know if I truly get the appeal of poutine.   That being said,  I  had already has some I liked in Quebec city so I figured my peeps out west may just be screwing it up.     Anyways,   I got a grilled cheese and a Rachael poutine with vegan sauce.  I regret all the vegetables... wish I had tried the plain as grilled veggies added nothing for me.  Also,  I was over my poutine after a few bites and it was disappointing to feel the need to eat most of my plate. The few bites were good and all but I was still over the whole meal very quickly.    The grilled cheese was nothing special but well executed... I almost would have rather a second of those and some stolen fries from my husband.  I don't think the poutine was executed poorly... I just don't think poutine is in my blood.   I also felt wickedly ill for several hours following my poutine and that's not really worth it (some food is though...).    Hubs had the 3 amigos (or something like that) and does say it was the best he'd ever had.... he also liked my Rachel with the vegan sauce so it wasn't just my gravy.   Thus,  there is a hope for you and La Banquise and maybe it's worth the line and the potential dietary upset for a taste.   One thing to note.... debit or cash ONLY here.  If you bring only credit you'll be washing dishes ;)  I would try Montreal poutine again but I think I would pass on this place due to it's excessive popularity and my limited interest."}
{"text":"Came here because, despite being Canadian, I've never had poutine in my life. Methinks I'm way too old for this... I could just hear my arteries clogging up with each bite! For me, this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience."}
{"text":"POUTINE, part deux. (The first sample was at Frite Alors, a Montreal chain).  La Banquise gets a wink and gun for being one of the classic Montreal poutineries (yes, that's an amazing word that exists in real life). But if we're taking votes, I preferred my Frite Alors experience. Like fellow legendary food establishment Schwartz's, La Banquise can get a ridiculous wait. Unlike Schwartz's, I don't think it's worth the investment.  For the wait averse, there's a to-go option at La Banquise, which we took advantage of rather than waiting in line. After ordering, we waited a short 10 minutes and hailed it to the nearest stoop to dig in.  Again, my take on poutine is to get the base model, no fluff. Give me frites, give me curds, give me gravy, call it a day. Thus, it's hard to produce a truly electrifying poutine, since the differential tends to be the unnecessarily piled on toppings. It's like ordering a New York slice with seventeen ingredients, or Texas BBQ with five kinds of sauce. Don't do it.  Anyways, the easiest way to screw up poutine? Start with fries that are too soggy to withhold the gravy dairy onslaught. Unfortunately, that's where La Banquise didn't hold up. Gravy? Good. Curds? Good. Fries? Not so much."}
{"text":"Fell asleep immediately after getting back to our hotel from a drunken Sunday night out. I was begrudgingly dragged out of bed and into a cab by my friend to go to la banquise around 3am. Although I resisted at the time, our trip would have been incomplete without the late night visit.   24/7 poutine is an amazing concept. I seriously wish someone would bring it to the U.S.  Crispy fries with cheese, or really whatever toppings your heart desires? Who wouldn't love that? The drunken experience could be comparable to IHOP, but with a slightly cooler crowd and much better food.   We tried the classic poutine and a chicken sandwich. Both were crispy and flavorful and cooked to perfection. I also got a cup of coffee to keep me awake. I tend to be a coffee snob but it was surprisingly good.   As a tourist it was interesting to sit back and people watch the young crowd. There wasn't a line when we got there around 3am, but passed by quite a few people waiting as we left.   If you're in Montreal, put this on your list of must-dos!"}
{"text":"my first poutine experience! read the raves on yelp and my local friend agreed - this is THE spot for poutine.   we arrived late thursday night and ordered between the 3 of us 2 medium poutines - one with veggies and another with green peppers, onions, and sausage. fresh, hot, large portions and i really enjoyed it! it does sound a little strange to the typical american - fries topped with cheese curds and gravy - but the cheese curds were melted, chewy, and fresh and we were all stuffed afterward!  b/c poutine is a great after-drinking snack, they require you to pay before you get your order but it actually works out pretty well since things get busy and it's hard to catch one of those (cute, young, friendly) servers."}
{"text":"La fameuse poutine de la banquise!! Quoi dire: elle est excellente!! The best in town!!"}
{"text":"Waited in line for at least an hour but I've driven by during off-peak hours and there was no line - so I would recommend avoiding peak meal hours! The selection of toppings is great. Unfortunately I found the fries to be a bit soggy. Maybe it was just a one time thing but I would prefer the fries to be crunchier."}
{"text":"I heard so many recommendations about this place. Who ever you ask in the Plateau area would tell you \"La Banquise\" is the place to go in Montreal since they have apparently the best poutine.  As a Montrealer myself, I do recodgnize that the concept is cool. It's open 24 hours.. and hey! you have the La Fontaine Park just in front (During the summer it must be awesome to order and sit by).  As far as poutine, I do believe that they are overrated. The gravy is good and their fries are just okay (nothing that would amaze you). You well have a lot of choices to pick from the menu, that's a fact.  According to me.. This place deserves a solid 3 stars.. Will I try this place again? Meh maybe, who knows"}
{"text":"*3.5* stars  We actually drove into Montreal on the way back to Toronto from Quebec City to try this poutine.  I ordered the standard (regular size) and my DC ordered one with a lot of meat (sausage, ground beef, and possibly some other meat) ~ with gravy and cheese curds of course.  Both were good, not sure that it was worth fighting Montreal traffic for (so I'm hoping this is not the \"best\" poutine in Montreal).  Having tried several over the last few days, I'd say that it wasn't...but not bad for a diner and there were lots of options for toppings.    It was definitely good, but not amazing.  And we did have it to go, so it's possible that some of the ambience was lost.  PS - they only accept Cash or Debit.  So be prepared!"}
{"text":"I was told that I must try poutine while in Montreal.  French fries with cheese curds covered in gravy?  Yummmmm.  I have not tried poutine anywhere else so I can't make any comparisons.    When you enter, go left for take-out and go right to eat-in.  I had the Classique while my wife had the Rachel (peppers, mushrooms, and onions).  Both were pretty darn good.  If you love fries and have never tried poutine I can't imagine you being disappointed with the poutine here."}
{"text":"When in Montreal, you have to eat poutine. This place was recommended to me by so many friends that I had to go, even if it meant waiting in line for 30 minutes. It was well worth the wait. Their gravy was delicious!"}
{"text":"J'ai souvent entendu parler de la Banquise comme étant là meilleur poutine de Montréal et l'ayant tester je peux vous le confirmer.  J'ai pris une poutine à l'avocat et à la crème sour et j'ai adoré !  La Banquise propose différentes sorte de poutine pour tous les goûts.  Seul inconvénient c'est la line up que l'ont fait parfois même jusqu'à dehors et le sentiment d'être un peu mis à la porte une fois presque terminé pour laisser passer les autres qui attendent d'où le fait que je ne mette pas 5 étoiles"}
{"text":"Overrated is the first word that comes to mind concerning this very touristic attraction. It's good but let's be honest folks, it's simply not THAT good. Simply put, there's far better poutine to be had elsewhere in Montreal.  Thus here's a review of a Montrealer for other Montrealers as well as tourists coming to town on what's what.  La Banquise is a 24 hours, eat a variety of pre-established poutines to your heart's delight. The price tag has steadily gone up over the years with small sized STANDARD poutines close to $6 and the larger ones around $10. Obviously, it's far more expensive if you go all out with their toppings so it's not unusual to pay close to $13-15... FOR ONLY FOR THE POUTINE. They also offer other fast comfort food but let's be honest, you're coming here for the poutine... RIGHT???  On a positive side, the portion sizes are generous. The standard plate should feed most people. The big plate is quite a treat.  My major issue with La Banquise is not the price-tag, nor the service, nor it's ridiculous popularity as the GO TO place for poutine in Montreal but simply put... that it's simply a relatively weak poutine.   The gravy just isn't that great and the fries aren't right.   At least, that's my opinion.  In more detail, the gravy lacks substance as it's probably made by the barrel for the non-stop flow of clients coming in and the fries are too thin. Frankly, I'm unsure if they're the best quality of potatoes possible for consumption. Are they even hand cut? It just BLAH, fries that are fried too quickly and they are quite soggy when received. Fries often make or break a poutine plate and this won't do. At least for me.  I always recommend to folks to try to visit smaller mom & pop places that make a wicked poutine or perhaps even Poutineville if they want a popular place simply because one can make their very own poutine. Their gravy more consistently good and more importantly... the fries are the right kind with other options that exceed the standard poutine experience that I recommend to everyone willing to have THE BEST POUTINE! Heck, if your cheese curds aren't squeaky, you ain't getting the best poutine!!!  I've been to worse Tourist traps in my life so feel free to experience it yourself but be warned, it's simply not the best Montreal has to offer...far from it. So for those of you coming to Montreal, Yelp search poutine and check your other options, La Banquise isn't the best place to have poutine.  No, this isn't a ploy to shorten the line-up. :)"}
{"text":"The poutine options are plentiful and the line is worth the wait! The gravy wasn't my favorite(I had the vegetarian) but the meal itself was very filling. It's certainly high cholesterol on a plate but who cares! Treat yourself and eat up!"}
{"text":"So as everyone knows, we all love Saus, right?  This place is Saus on steroids. I went here with 3 other people who did not speak any french. It look me several minutes to read through the 30 plus different options of poutine that they offered here. I knew we were in the right spot when there was a line of 12 or so people in front of us. Somehow, the Gods were smiling on us because we got a great booth at the window.  As we mange'd on 3 amigos poutine (fries, cheese curds, gravy, 3 different types of sausage); Mexican poutine (fries, cheese curds, gravy, guac, and sour cream); and the tasty original, I wondered how life could get any better. Then out came our server with our beers. These portions were huge, In hindsight, we should have ordered the Canadian size order instead of the American size.   As we continued to eat, the line out the door got longer and longer. By 2p when we left, the line was easily 40 deep and the restaurant could probably seat 60 at a time. If you like Saus, you will love Resto La Banquise.   BTW, CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"I don't really like french fries or gravy all that much, but I was visiting Montreal, so eating poutine was a required activity whether I wanted it or not. My friend sent me here promising it would be a good spot for the (in)famous snack.  They have a large menu of poutines, and not much of anything else. I had the classic poutine because I figured that was really the only way to see what all the fuss was about. Not gonna lie, it was pretty good! The fries were crispy and the gravy was thin, almost broth-like, which I liked. The cheese curds were good, but I wish there were more of them. I can't help it, I love cheese! Maybe you can order extra cheese?  Overall, a good first real Canadian poutine experience. I can't say I'll be craving the stuff but if you're a poutine fan or just curious then La Banquise is a good starting point!"}
{"text":"On our way here I accidentally ran a red light on Avenue du Parc la Fontaine. I realized halfway through and freaked out, stopped, but then realized I should just pull through. An old French man watching all of this unfold pointed straight at me with his index finger I swear he was performing the cruciatus curse.  Walking into the restaurant I was still a little bit shaken and wasn't really sure if I could properly enjoy my meal with the thought of that man judging/hexing me for my honest mistake. But most of my apprehension melted away when the three plates of poutine we ordered hit the table.   Out of the three types that we picked (the original, one with pepperoni and ham, and one with beef and peppercorn sauce) I definitely preferred the original. The flavors and the textures quite simply worked better here than in the rest. In general, I think the entire experience could have been improved if the fries were hotter and crispier, the gravy had more flavor, and the water had ice in it.   The lasting impression was that La Banquise seems like one of those places that started out as an awesome local joint but eventually devolved into an average touristy trap. But I was happy to get some poutine while in Montreal and by the end of the meal I wasn't thinking about that scary old man at all."}
{"text":"First time trying poutine and decided to go with the highly recommended La Banquise. Went at around 3pm on a Saturday, but only had to wait about 20 mins to get a table for two. We heard the lines get crazy long at more popular times.   Tight, no frills atmosphere. Type of place to eat your food and get out, not sprawl and take your time.  We just went with a regular sized order of the Classique poutine and it was great. Nice size to split for an afternoon snack. We also had a Banquise pilsner which was pretty good too. Service was friendly and quick, which was impressive as it's definitely a busy spot at all times. Be advised it's cash or Canadian debit only."}
{"text":"Being in Montreal, I had to check this place out and see if their poutine is really that good as people claim. Long story short, it's good! We got the original one and the Mexican one (tomatoes, hot peppers and black olives). I was so glad the cheese curds were squeaky!! The gravy was not overly salty, which I really liked. The portions are generous. Atmosphere is loud and fun, and despite being a very busy evening, the servers made sure they checked on us."}
{"text":"Un classique à Montréal, autant pour les habitués que les touristes qui n'ont jamais goûté une exquise poutine! J'aime y amener des amis rencontrés outre-mer qui visitent la ville. L'ouverture 24h est un plus. À la sortie des bars, préparez-vous à faire la file à l'extérieur un bon moment. Menu varié qui plaira à tous et toutes. Points négatifs? On y manque d'espace (particulièrement à l'entrée, agoraphobes s'abstenir) et il faudrait revoir la climatisation: hiver comme été, il fait chaud chaud chaud. N'y amenez pas votre belle-mère en ménopause!"}
{"text":"Poutineville est de loin bien meilleur pour une vraie de vraie!! La sauce ici est tellement claire, on dirait presque du bouillon de poulet"}
{"text":"Expectation were high but the poutine left a lot to be desired. Gravy was kind of bland along with the unsalted fries."}
{"text":"The poutine was good!!!!! They say that a regular-size poutine is for one person, but it's enough to be shared by 2 people. Not as AMAZING as I heard, but still tasted great! Servers were VERY nice too!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended as having the absolute best poutine and it did not disappoint.  After a nice walk in the snow we found La Banquise.  It is a 24/7 restaurant specializing in all kinds of poutine variations.  The waitress sat us and brought us some beers.  Looking at the menu I was overwhelmed by the different kinds of poutine contained.  Being a fan of hot food though I decided on the Kamikaze.  It was poutine with hot sausage, hot peppers, and tobasco.  The plate was huge, and I ordered a small.  It was delicious though and very filling.  Great spot to hit up anytime."}
{"text":"The only restaurant we visited twice on our trip, the poutine was excellent - especially the vegetarian version with onions! It's a bit crowded and a bit loud, but we never waited more than a few minutes for a table. The taquise poutine was also very tasty, who knew that guacamole and gravy were a winning combination?"}
{"text":"first food stop when we came to montreal. when I heard about poutine, I was already in love. gravy and cheese curds on french fries! I was so glad we found out about La Banquise before we got to Montreal. Our flight came in a little after midnight and lucky for us this place is 24/7! already perfect :]  The place was packed! but people were constantly coming and going that we didnt have to wait for a table too long, we were seated right away. Our server was extremely nice and very patient.   There is every kind of poutine imaginable! If you can think it up, they probably already have it on the menu. We ordered a large T-Rex to share. it was HUGE! Ground beef, bacon, pepperoni, and hot dogs all on top of gravy, cheese curds, and french fries. it was sooo gooood! fatty meaty goodiness. droollllll. and yet we still had leftovers!   If you're going late at night, do expect it to a bit loud and there to be a younger drunk crowd probably leaving the bars. Regardless, this is definitely the POUTINE MECCA you should make pilgrimage to!"}
{"text":"We waited on line for this poutine for maybe 20 minutes which isnt too bad.  For 3 of us we ordered the small 3 amigos poutine and then a classic large. We were brought out 2 larges, which was fine in the long run.  The poutine tasted good and was enjoyable but I dont think anything to write home about.  It was a very quick meal and our server did bring us the wrong bill to pay.   If im back in Montreal I do not think I would come back here, I would maybe look for a different poutine spot."}
{"text":"?????poutine?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"'Oh, my god. This is amazing. I totally get it,' says my hubby at 8:30am, sharing the regular-sized classic poutine. My reaction is the same as his. We've never had poutine with real, fresh, squeaky cheese curds before, and now that we've experienced it, yes, we get why it's a big deal.   We shared the regular size thinking it would be enough for two. The photos make it look enormous! It was actually quite small. We regretted not trying some other options, too.   At 8:30am on a Monday, we were the only customers. The food is very reasonably priced. Like everywhere else in the city for some reason, credit cards are not accepted.   After talking about it all day, we decided it was important to make a second trip before we leave. It was our first meal in Montreal, and it will be our last."}
{"text":"As all the locals say, it's THE place to go anytime during the day, but the BEST after clubbing/bar hopping. There was a half hour wait at 2:30am, which wasn't too bad actually. I think the greasy goodness smell and watching the people eat was the torture. You just want a hand full of poutine in your mouth instantly. I know that sounds gross, but hey, you have to go try it!!  We ordered the T-rex Poutine which is loaded with hot dog, sausages, and ground beef along with the cheese and gravy. I suggest sharing if you don't feel too hungry. One plate is a lot of food."}
{"text":"We wanted to like this place so much! And had been looking forward to it for awhile.   We came around 6 pm on  Saturday and the line to dine in took about 45 minutes. We ordered a grande La hot dog to share (we had read on their menu that their hot dogs were their specialty?) and a cheeseburger with bacon. The poutine with hot dog was a HUGE disappointment (the hot dogs were no better than oscar meyer wieners and added a strange flavor to the gravy; they certainly were not all beef; I would recommend NOT to order this) and the cheeseburger was one of the worst that I've had (the meat was dry; not even the bacon could redeem this).   To add insult to injury: The seating arrangement was pretty terrible -- they made what was one table into two, to seat us and another family (we couldn't get up without having to ask them to stand up).   To date, the best Poutine experience that we've had was NOT in Montreal; it was at Saus in Boston.  We were glad that the service was at least friendly and our waitress happily helped convert our US dollars into Canadian.   This place definitely did not live up to the hype -- it doesn't even rank as \"OK.\"  **Cash only (accepts US dollars); ATM on site**"}
{"text":"J'aime vraiment le costaud berger si j'ai le gout d'un berger je vais la bas...bon la poutine est très bonne aussi mais trop calorique pour moi j'essaie d'éviter."}
{"text":"We have two official languages here in Canada - English and French. Poutine is iconic as hockey is. When you are in Montreal, Quebec how could you not scavenge the city to find the best poutine available? It was part of our bucket list of the trip to taste a true French-Canadian dish of French fries, fresh cheese curds that are smothered with brown gravy and sauce. None of that New York Fries quickie from a food court. It has to be something I would feel dirty just thinking about. Something that could match a 10 piece Church's Chicken late night!   La Banquise Resto 24h is open 24/7 - yes, even at those ungodly hours when your drunk or crave a heart attack! In the heart of Plateau District, a little off from the Latin Quarter. This poutine joint is easily accessible by the Metro. Take the train to either Station Sherbrooke or Station Berri-UQAM.  La Banquise offers 25 different dangerously delicious poutines. Play it safe with Classic pork larded fries, fresh curds and sauce to the adventurous Superman limits with piles of ground beef, smoked sausages and meats, extra cheese and the works.   Poutine Trois Viandes ground beef, pepperoni and bacon. Now this hits the spot. This was amazing. I really wanted to try the other variations such as Poutine Kamikaze - merguez sausages, hot peppers, and tabasco...  but really I don't think we could have fitted anymore inside our satisfied tummies.  BLT - bacon lettuce tomatoes Who was I kidding when I thought to order something \"healthier\". I wanted to balance the poutine with some veggies and a side salad. The Sammy was pretty delicious with the juicy fried pork smothered with mayo.  Banquise Burger Ground beef patty, mushrooms, fried onions, Swiss cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, spicy sauce on a sesame seed bun. Dave meant business when he asked the waitress to suggest the best tasting burger in house. Not bad. Not bad. Juicy. Sumptuous. Dirty.  Better wash it down with some good old Canadian beer that we don't normally get in Vancouver.  St Ambroise Apricot Beer - Ok I lied. I like this apricot wheat ale a lot in addition to the Belgium Fruli (Strawberry beer). Boreale beer - named after Aurora Borealis. The label features a polar bear above the word Boreale. I found it rather bitter. More so than Asahi Black.   The restaurant itself may not be the prettiest, but the staff are friendly. You can expect a fast turnover even though there may be a wait. I wish I tried a few more poutine places so I can compare. But we were pretty satisfied. There is no reason to discount this place just because it is busy. I rather see a busy place than an empty place."}
{"text":"\"Wait... you've never had poutine? But you live closer to Montreal than I do!\" \"It's that ice cream thing, right?\" \"Just... just stop.\"  And then we stumbled over to La Banquise, a little Montreal-style diner near a big, beautiful park.  At this establishment, poutine is god. Don't let yourself be tempted by other menu items-- definitely not worth it-- and go for the Quebequois staple of crisp, freshly-cut fries, brown gravy, and melted cheese curds. La Banquise does it right with about twenty varieties and a solid base to go on. The fries are crisp enough to stand up against the herbacious turkey (or chicken?) gravy and chewy, gooey mild curds. Add on a melange (is that correct French?) of excellent toppings ranging from sour cream to corn dogs. Our suggestion? Try the Poutine Matty with green peppers, onions cooked 'til soft and translucent, sauteed mushrooms, and crisp bits of bacon.  This gluttonous eastern Canadian specialty comes in two sizes-- large and larger. Canadian and American. Petit and grande. Take it as you will.  Service is friendly and responsive to special requests but doesn't follow up with things like refills on water. The host stand often ends up unattended and there always seems to be a wait... even at two in the afternoon. This said, for variety, quality, and a very, very solid introduction to this Montreal delicacy, La Banquise is where it's at.  And, for god sakes, do not order the omelets. Have your healthy breakfast moment at another time and place."}
{"text":"So many choices of topping on poutine. We visited there around 7 o'clock and there was a line up outside the restaurant. For a 24-hour restaurant, it seemed to be so popular. My friend and I only ordered one house special with cheese, bacon, mushroom and gravy on top. It tasted really good and a little salty.  The most thing of this restaurant impressed is not their food but the working passion of every staff. Open kitchen showed that almost everyone enjoyed their jobs. Amazing~  Overall It was a good restaurant worth visiting while visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Ordered The Classique poutine and the Petit Club Sandwich. The regular sized poutine was a good portion for two people. However, one person could probably finish it. The gravy was good and not too salty. The cheese curds were firm and some were melty. The club was surprisingly very tasty and got a side salad with it. I was pleased with the meal and would visit the place again. If you go, they accept debit cards but bring cash."}
{"text":"La Banquise is a 24-hour poutine shop that has been around since '68. The poutine variation is quite extensive, offering toppings such as guacamole, ground beef, bacon, sliced corn dogs, bacon, etc. (if you're not in the mood for poutine, they also have breakfasts, hot dogs, and burgers).  The hubs and I came here later in the evening, and there was a long line.  We found out that there are actually 2 lines - one for dine-in, and one for take-out - thank goodness!  We tried the following: La Classique (fries, gravy, and cheese curds; the gravy was better than the other poutines we've tried, but it was still a little underwhelming; it had a ramen-esque type of flavor, which was kind of odd); La Taquise (topped with guacamole, sour cream, and tomatoes, it tasted exactly how it sounded like; the guacamole could have been more chunkier, but it was more smoother in texture; the sour cream was a little stiff and forgettable); and, La T-Rex (this was topped with ground beef, pepperoni, bacon, and hot dog slices; this was actually pretty okay, as it was meat mecca; the ground beef was forgettable, but the other toppings were good; I personally didn't need the gravy, but the hubs preferred it with the pepper sauce (which was a cream-based sauce with peppercorns).  Service was super friendly, but we had a mistake in our order and had to go back and get it replaced (they do check all the containers and verify, though).  Just a note - they only take cash or Canadian debit, but they also accept US $.  +open 24 hours +'naked' option is better; opt out of the sauces +friendly staff +Canadian debit, cash, or US $ accepted"}
{"text":"Although I'm sure if you like poutine this would be a great place to go, but since I was trying poutine for the first time, I wasn't the biggest fan of the food itself. The restaurant was cute and the people were very nice. The original poutine was good and worth trying. The guacamole, taco poutine was super filling and had a lot of flavors that after a while it became too much to handle.   This place only gets three stars from me because I was not a big fan of poutine. But, if you like it, I'm sure this place would be an amazing place to go!"}
{"text":"The best poutine I've had so far in Montreal. The atmosphere is great too. I'm surprised they can handle the amount of people that come here.   As usual poutine portions are large, so you can probably split one between two people. They do have a vege poutine for those of you who are vegetarian/have someone in your party who is."}
{"text":"The food and the service are good. Location is cozy but the music is a bit too loud. I can recommend the Montreal Burger"}
{"text":"Fat à souhait ! Oui la musique est un peu forte et oui les serveurs ne sont pas particulièrement accueillants mais ce léger désagrément est compensé par le plat. Large choix de poutines, toutes aussi alléchantes les unes que les autres !"}
{"text":"My family came up to visit me over Canadian Thanksgiving, and I was asking around for restaurant recommendations (since I'd moved up recently and was a bit of a stranger myself).  Pretty much everyone told me that La Banquise was the best place for poutine, and I'm inclined to agree.  So many varieties, good prices, and they also have some other breakfast/diner type dishes if you don't want poutine (and what is wrong with you?  Poutine is delicious!).  Open 24 hours, although I haven't tested that yet."}
{"text":"When visiting Montreal, you have to have Poutine and this is the place to have it. They have the classic gravy and cheese curds but then they also have things like chicken, hot dogs, and other toppings.  You can even have them in a vegan version. The menu also includes things like burgers. I, however, came for the Poutine so I didn't order anything else. I did see other tables with burgers though.   It's a must stop when visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype. Go check it it yourself. Very busy, even at 1AM when we went. Waiting to sit in seemed like a long time so our party opted to get take out.  For the record, I know having takeout does not give the food justice. The fries were thoroughly fried dark brown. For a poutine, there was lots of gravy and cheese curds. The cheese curds do not melt but have a rubbery texture. I enjoyed it at the beginning but quickly the fries became soggy. Quite salty but not bad. Try it yourself."}
{"text":"For a variety of good poutine, this place is amazing. The portions are generous, the lines are long but move fast, the fries is amazing.  We sat on the patio given it was a cool summer day. They don't serve alcohol on the patio though.   I would recommend coming, especially if you are visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Great spot to try authentic poutine. We were a little hungover so it was a perfect breakfast. We tried the smoked meat poutine with onions. And a greek salad. The dishes took a while to come out and we were starving. We expected nice chunks of meat like what we get in Nyc at mile end deli. But this was more like shaved ham. Still very tasty. Really fun spot."}
{"text":"Now I've only been here whilst intoxicated so I'm not sure how accurate this is but everything I've ever had was DELICIOUS. Such unique combinations! The waits are long at night though but I believe it is worth it!"}
{"text":"There was a long line that got seated pretty quickly when we went around 9pm on a Saturday night. Got the Poutine Classique- crispy fries with gravy and chewy cheese curds.  It was pretty good, not too salty and I liked the chewiness of the curds!"}
{"text":"I got La Taquise, which has guacamole, sour cream, and tomatoes. It was very delicious and reasonably priced. We were there around 8pm but waited for roughly an hour before we could get a table! Service was friendly and moderately fast, even for how busy it was. Would eat here again, even with the wait. It's a must visit for a first time Montreal experience!"}
{"text":"Some of the best traditional and non-traditional poutine you can get.  Tips: 1. Go around 11:00 am midweek. 2. Get the La Savoyarde. 3. You cannot get beer if you sit outside. 4. The regular portion (small) of poutine can seriously feed 2-3 easily. 5. Take Uber or bike.  No parking and Metro stop is a good distance away."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that poutine isn't for everyone ... and even if you like poutine, some of the creations here might be a bit too intense for your liking ... but there has to be something said about a business that always has a line out the door and a full house of customers.   I found this place on yelp, and my uber driver in Montreal said it's a must, so I decided to give it a try. I have had poutine before, but never in Canada, so I said why not??  Luckily for me when I got there there wasn't as big a line as expected (likely because it was an off hour on a weekday), which I didn't mind at all. I sat pretty quickly and tried to digest the many poutine options on the menu.   My friend and I decided to try two kinds: The Festival, and the Fred Caillou  Now both of those (and probably anything you order) were heavy. The Fred Caillou is definitely a lot of meat, and can be a bit much. The Festival was a bit better (the guac tempered some of the heaviness) but still was a lot to take. I think in total we finished maybe a 1/3 of the food. There were definitely people who ordered and ate an entire plate by themselves ... hats off to them.   I think if I were to go back I might try either just the plain poutine or something with more guac and sour cream to temper the heaviness of the gravy/cheese. The Taquise might be a good option.  Note: they do have non-poutine options here (burgers, sandwiches, etc) so if you want poutine and you're with someone who doesn't, you can still come here. Also note they only take cash or Canadian Debit (bc apparently that's a thing). so prepare for that.   Overview: good flavor but very heavy - don't expect to finish your food!  Stay Cheerful ;)"}
{"text":"I've never had poutine prior to coming here, so I'm not sure if I can give the most thorough review. However, there's a reason for the many positive reviews. The place is open 24/7 and on the two separate occasions I went here on my short visit to Montreal, there was a line out the door and it was jam-packed inside. This is a reflection of how willing people are to wait for a large variety of pontine that's also tasty. My friend and I ordered the classic and Jamaican poutine. If you like spicy, definitely try the Jamaican. Those peppers are to die for! They also serve other things besides poutine. We tried the traditional cole slaw and the jalapeno poppers. They were good, but the star of the show was the poutine.  Considering how crowded the restaurant was, we were served pretty quickly and our servers were pleasant amongst the chaos. If visiting Montreal, definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"The best poutine I've tasted yet.  - Their fries are delicious, cheese melty, toppings were perfect - It's open 24hrs - They substitute ingredients, e.g. if you wanted avocado instead of onions - Good portions for sharing - There was a huge line up, try to avoid fights - Friendly service - Good atmosphere, I've sat in the dining and outdoor patio area  A Montreal must."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!  Whenever I drop by Montreal I need to top by so that I enjoy a steamed hotdog and a pontine as always I'm never deceived ;)"}
{"text":"There is very little need for a review of this restaurant. Come early and be ready to wait in line. The lines form quickly and if its cold or raining outside, dress warm and bring an umbrella. Believe me, it's worth the wait. Great staff and they do accept US currency, just not US debit or credit cards.   As for as the food, there's not much I can say except look at all the pictures everyone posted. They taste as fantastic as they look."}
{"text":"There's something I love, and it starts with a P. You know what I'm talking about. My friends and I were in Montreal last weekend, so of course we had to visit the best poutine joint in Montreal. The classic poutine met my expectations - heart attack on a plate. My friends ordered the hot dog, ground beef and two other types I can't recall at the moment. Wait time was around 20-30 minutes. Our server was very nice considering he was surrounded by ferocious poutine eaters. Tip: The small order of poutine is the perfect size for 1. Thanks for the clogged arteries - it was worth it."}
{"text":"Poutine \"Paul-Pogo\" - ordered without knowing what it is, soon found out that \"pogo\" means corn dog. Tasted really great accompanied by glass of milk. Waitress was really friendly and pretty. Also cool decor."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening at around 9 PM.  Fairly long line outside, but moved fairly fast.  You have the option of sitting inside or outside.    My friend and I chose the inside seating, and it was \"cozy\" or \"cramped\" depending on how you feel.  Very crowded, definitely very popular restaurant.  Waittresses seemed very busy obviously, and the service was average at best.  I got the pizza poutine, which was just average, nothing special to write home about.  It was poutine, and we heard by word-of-mouth that this was the most popular poutine place in Montreal (Kinda a tourist trap though).    But the poutine looked kind of disgusting to be honest.  It was just a bunch of french fries, doused in what looked like their \"homemade grease sauce\" with some meat and veges mixed in there for good measure.  It looked like a mess and I didn't even bother to finish my plate (because I am fairly health conscious and the plate looked like a huge grease ball).  The bad part was the end of the mean, and they don't take credit card, and can't break $100 bills neither.  We didn't have enough money to cover the plate, so my friend had to trek to a bank and call his US Chase to withdraw money from a Canada ATM.  While I just waited at the table for 30 minutes.    After trying our best for 30 minutes, we still couldn't provide them with the appropriate payment, and eventually they just took the money we had (which unfortunately wasn't enough to cover the bill or the tip) which was around $21 or so for 2 poutine plates.  All in all, it was an average experience.  There wasn't anything too great about this restaurant in general.  Maybe other poutine places are better for tourists to go to.  The waitresses tried their best, but given the amount of people it was just not possible to provide quick and customized service.  The restaurant was nicely decorated though for such a small mom-and-pop vibe place.  The poutine itself was just OK."}
{"text":"Nothing like a 24 poutine place to satisfy your poutine cravings at allll times. Came here at 7.30am in the morning for breakfast. Tried the breakfast poutine: \"la cassoulette\" loaded with sweet sweet bacon (plus sausages) and 2 eggs that screams a typical hearty breakfast, but poutine style. It met all my expectations. The potatoes were the bite size, smothered in a rich savoury gravy! Cheese curds were good but ordering an extra serving appears it be quite costly.   Decor and ambiance was funky and cozy, loved it!!! Service was fast and pleasant. Never thought I'd say this, but poutine at 7.30am in the morning at la banquise was a surprisingly great way to start my morning.   Heads up, portions are big (perhaps I'm not used to eating just fries as meals)!! Pack up the leftovers and hike up mount royal, you'll be able to stomach it then!"}
{"text":"Good service, nice environment, great poutines generous in sizing !  Maybe a little loud, but otherwise brought a foreign friend there and it was great and tasty!"}
{"text":"I looked online for a highly recommended poutine place and it led me to check out this place.  A 24hours poutine place?!  Why not!  There was a small line-up and I only took take-outs, so I can't say anything about the service itself.  The room inside looks pretty nice (looking from the waiting line) and I believe there's a little garden/outdoor space inside.    I got the one with beef and green peppers poutine.  It was alright.  It's not bad, but not extraordinaire.  I would recommend this place for the fact that it has so much variety and toppings to choose from, aside from that, the taste itself is ok.  If you didn't go here, I don't think you'd be missing out on anything."}
{"text":"I only come here after a night out and nothing else is open, the poutine is overwhelmingly SALTY (and i *love* my salt! This is just too much though), as well as over-hyped.    Not really worth the insane lineups unless desperate."}
{"text":"La poutine est comme on se l'attends, excellente, et les combinaisons sont variés, c'est un resto plus pour les jeunes par contre, je me sentais plus ou moins à ma place et je suis dans la trentaine, mais bon, le service est rapide, et ce même à 2h am, une bonne place pour dégriser et se donner une alternative à la gueule de bois (indigestion dû au gras).  Mais que voulez-vous, la poutine à trois viandes, c'est trop tentant et déclicieux."}
{"text":"aahhh!  The poutine critique. You will never again find so much said about a meal with three bland graceless ingredients.  My friend has lived in Montreal for ten years and recommended we go here. \"Its the most quebecois place to go to at 12:00 AM on a Sunday evening in the Plateau DISTRICT. \"   This is a real original poutine gourmet cuisine experience. The type of place you overhear modern people talk about, while lining up in some crummy Toronto poutinerie at 2:00 AM.    The \"Classic Poutine\" was excellent. I found the sauce sweeter to previous poutine experiences and the waiter said this was because it's real cooked-down turkey gravy and fresh cheese curds, and fries.   The tables were all beat up and the washroom was in a a bit of a state.   Overall a good experience but I won't be bringing it up in line as I wait for shitty poutine in Toronto. There are so many better things to talk about. That being said, there are so many better things to eat."}
{"text":"After reading several travel blogs and getting a couple of recommendations from friends on where the best poutine spot would be in downtown Montreal, I was pretty eager to stop by La Banquise. Although the place was packed we were seated immediately. However I'm a bit sad to say that the poutine wasn't something I'd write home about. Overall, the potion sizes were large, and there was a good amount of toppings on our order (the 3 amigos), I definitely wasn't blown away. Perhaps because I had this as a lunch instead of a late night snack, I don't think I'd necessarily crave La Banquise again. Glad I tried it though!"}
{"text":"There is absolutely no doubt their Poutine is really good and worth a try. Their fries are thin and crispy with amazing gravy and plenty of cheese curds.(you can ask for shredded as well and they give you extra gravy if you ask)  However, I do think this place is a little hyped for what it is. The Poutines are quite overpriced and it goes up so fast with each topping you add.   I love poutines but it's just not the food item you spend 13$ on."}
{"text":"I ordered an original poutine from this famous 24-hour poutinerie and wasn't blown away. The curds were terrific but the gravy wasn't very flavourful and the fries were middle-of-the-road. Just my opinion. The other famous place I heard about is Poutineville (didn't get a chance to try it) in case you're planning a poutine tour of Montreal."}
{"text":"First poutine ever and La Banquise provided so many options, even vegetarian for me or vegan if that is your thing too. The restaurant is filled with color and close dining seating which may be a problem for larger groups when they get crowded. I tried the classic poutine and it was yummy and filling. My boyfriend ordered La Savory. In the end we should've ordered one to share but we enjoyed the meals regardless. To top it off I had a vegetarian hot dog and I may be slacking but wow it was delicious and I don't know why I haven't had one yet. Tasted like the real thing to a point I questioned whether it was a real hot dog or not. Poutine or many other foods this is a great spot."}
{"text":"First time having poutine in Montréal. Both my date and I got the regular portions and they were huge! An easy 3000 calories! As an American this is the first time I've been surprised at such a large portion. I had the La Folie and my date had the T-Rex. We tried eating as much as possible and couldn't finish. Both were delicious and we were surprised to see everybody around us finish their poutine. Bec Cola was interesting as it was flavored with maple syrup. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"This was the first place where we tried Montreal's famous poutine. The staff here preferred speaking to me in French which made me rather uncomfortable. My blank stares didn't help :) After a while, I noticed that we weren't the only non-French speakers struggling with our orders.  Ok back to my review - this is a cash or debit only place that serves a lot of different variations of poutine. Poutine is basically a plate of fries mixed with cheese curds, gravy & your choice of toppings. We ordered the Poutine Classique (no meat) & Poutine Dan Dan (bacon) from the menu for about $7 each. In short, the portions were large, tasty, salty & greasy. I remember walking out the place satisfied that I'd tasted poutine & will never want to again. Until I found Smokie's Poutinerie that is... I was then a convert for life."}
{"text":"We stopped here midday and got seated as soon as we entered. The service was quick and our food didn't take too long to come out. You get a good amount of food for the price.  I ordered the smaller serving of the classique poutine, but it was still a lot of food. I'd recommend going for one of the specialty poutines as it will have more variety."}
{"text":"Very popular, can get pretty crowded with a lineup outside in the evening. Once inside, your will be served quickly. A poutine, in any way you can imagine. As soon you modify the original poutine, they charge extras... only downside.  You visit Montréal, try it!"}
{"text":"HUGE portions, I couldn't finish it (maybe share between 2 people). Very friendly waiter if you're eating in. I'm not a huge fan of poutine (gasp! the horror!) but it was pretty good."}
{"text":"C'est mon resto de Poutine préféré la rachel sauce aux poivres est top! Selon moi les meilleures frites à Poutine de Montréal"}
{"text":"If you want poutine at 4 a.m. after a nite of clubbing...you must make a stop here.  Open 24/7, this hearty serving of fries with cheese curds and brown gravy is the best in town.  I would recommend the \"Poutine Galvaude\" which consist of a poutine topped with chicken and peas.  The peas in the Galvaude balanced out the meal...so now you can tell your mommy that you had your veggies.    I also tried the T-Rex (Minced meat, pepperoni, bacon and smoked sausages) but that was just too much meat.   I love meat....but there is a limit.  Although a woman who loves meat is a woman after my own heart."}
{"text":"La Banquise never fails to impress, every time I go there the service is fast, the food is amazing, and I always want to go back for more. Highly recommended place for an amazing poutine! I suggest La Taquise!"}
{"text":"Open 24h, that my favorite place to finish the night with a great Poutine. That's a great place to share with friends. Not expensive and poutines are really good."}
{"text":"Ahhhh Poutine!!!!!!!!! This is what Montreal cuisine is all about.  Fries, Cheese Curds, and Gravy.  Simple, yet amazing.    Was able to try to the classic one and the one with onions and bacon.  The onions and bacon are a slamming combo and is highly recommended.  They have a million different varieties.  I have a big appetite and the small was almost impossible to complete, but I did it.  The large is served in a massive bowl and if you are three people you can either get 2 large bowls or 3 smalls.  I think that would be the equivalence.    If you are going to try something, you got to try the best.  I highly suggest making this your first stop for any foodie.  The line was also out the door, so be prepared to wait.  It is well worth it though!!!!"}
{"text":"Have I really never reviewed this place? It's the prototypical poutine joint. Open 24/7, long line even late at night. Probably the second best poutine in the city (behind the now-renovated AA in St. Henri), and one of the widest selections of toppings for any such place. The one with the merguez is probably the best, although if it's your first poutine, just go classic. Service is good, prices are on the high end but not insane, and they have a good selection of local beer to boot. It's the ideal place for visitors and rookies, and it's still pretty good for locals."}
{"text":"Was in Montreal, thus had to have Poutine.  Looked on yelp for some help.   This place was recommended.  Got here for lunch...place was hopping.  So many choices for poutine.  Was torn with the classic or trying something new.  Decided to try La Jaco.  Prices were decent for the portion size.  Extremely happy with my choice.  Gotta come back and try something else."}
{"text":"This was surprisingly good!! Not too heavy (until we ordered a second poutine).. I enjoyed La B.O.M (bacon, onion, merguez sausage) - love the little bits of flavorful sausage and how it all tied together with the melting cheese curds and gravy sauce. We also had La Miam (ground beef, onion, tomato, merguez sausage, swiss cheese) which was heavier than the first and the tomatoes didn't do much as the pieces were too large. Also had a bit of Hamburger Steak - not bad.   There was a long wait when I arrived at lunchtime but they were all just waiting for take-out, so make sure to ask & check.   The only downside is they charge mandatory 15% tips."}
{"text":"This place is a kick. It primarily serves poutine with a large variety of meat and vegetable choices but has other stuff too. It's open 24/7 and is always busy. I dunno...is there a statement there?  It's popular with late night and hangover crowds.  Four of us ordered three regular size portions and were neither over fed or underfed. We went with a standard order, a chorizo and an onion & pepper mix.  They key here is the potatoes; they obviously serve a lot of them and they chop and cook them right such that the gravy doesn't drown them.  The line out the door moved quickly. It is a deceptively large resto and has outdoor seating (beer not served on patio).  Decor is dicey and fun.  Device is prompt to keep tables flowing.  Cash only for non-Canadians."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the veggie burger. The service was great too but man what a long wait. Prolly not something that can be helped as everyone seemed to know this place.  We got two different types of poutine and both were vegetarian which was awesome to have some variety. Also the veggie burger was different and had slaw on it. Really enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"really liked the poutine here t-rex and la mart...... i think you can also add extra condiments at additional charge.  it's just a place which is always packed. the seats are too crowded. there's only this one time when i don't need to wait for long and we get a relatively good table by the window."}
{"text":"Really good. Very filling. Did not know there existed this many varitions of Poutine!"}
{"text":"Poutine, a haiku:   the wait is quite long even healthy eaters seem to love  a lot of cheese and meat   Poutine is like midwestern food on steroids.  Potatoes, cheese curds, meat, sauce, in a big ol' not very pretty mix that looks actually quite unappealing?  We'll take it.   On a lovely little street in Montreal of shops, restaurants, and close to a lush park full of bikers, go ahead.  This spot gets crowded and a line forms outside the door but it's a pretty quick bite.  Fun decor and a very large variety of poutine from avocado, bacon to peppers to hot dog to spicy sausage to mozzarella sticks (yes, you can add a fried mozzarella on top of your cheese curds).    It's small, crowded, loud but you forget all that when you are faced with a giant bowl of meat, cheese, potatoes and some sort of gravy."}
{"text":"I've been here many many many times, and this time, I actually tried something new. It's been a while since my last visit, and my friends from outta town wanted to have this for dinner. I was super surprised to see a Poutine called La Taquise, that had guacamole, sour cream, fresh tomatoes. Part of me was thinking there's no way that goes with gravy, or there must not be gravy... and sure enough there was gravy and cheese curds to go with all that.  I went with the thought that if it sucked, they wouldn't put it on the menu.  I am super happy to try it because the guacamole for some reason actually made a poutine taste even awesome-r."}
{"text":"Poutine de luxe, poutine copieuse, poutine personnalisée, poutine spéciales... ya du choix! Je n'ai jamais été déçu, peu importe l'heure à laquelle je suis allé ! Il ne sont pas réputés pour rien ! Ils sont très constants dans leur plats"}
{"text":"I'm a little obsessed with poutine, ever since having it in, of all places, Chicago.  So when I heard that La Banquise had the best poutine in Montreal, it made my list for \"must eat\" destinations.  Um, this is not the best poutine in Montreal.  In fact, I was only able to get poutine twice while in Montreal (I mean, there's only so much gravy soaked fries and cheese curds one girl can eat) and this was the second best.  I ordered the poutine with peppers and onions because I like to try to kid myself that I'm eating semi-healthy.  Veggies help with this illusion.  The poutine is a little pricey at $8-$9 or so, but not too bad.  If you're dining alone, definitely get the regular.  The large is enormous.  Though this poutine was fine, I actually preferred the cheaper yet similarly sized pepper and onion poutine at Patati Patata.  I was able to sit on the patio in the back, which was very nice and the staff was friendly but overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to grab poutine at La Banquise while in Montreal."}
{"text":"Delicious poutine at all hours of the day. There's usually a wait though, especially during tourist season or in the middle of the night. They do takeout as well. Overall a solid choice for indulging poutine needs!"}
{"text":"It was 4 of us, all of our first time in Canada so of course we had to try some of this authentic Canadian famous food! The wait to sit down was pretty long but it was packed so we figured it was worth it. So out of 4 of us only one person was satisfied with their poutine. That person was cut off a lot on fries for some reason so she was able to eat her poutine in 5 minutes. I ordered the Mexican poutine with onions, hot peppers sour cream and tomatoes. It looked very satisfying when I received it but after finding pieces of sausage in my food that wasn't supposed to be there I immediately began throwing up in their bathroom. I don't eat non halal meat so if it gets in my system it automatically comes out. I was very disappointed with this! They should keep their foods separated from each other, has me really questioning their sanitary habits there if they can't separate foods."}
{"text":"So many different varieties of poutine! I'm in heaven.   My family took my here while I am in Canada since I can't find good poutine in the states. They have all sorts of varieties from Mexican inspired ones to ones with pizza sauce on it! I took the T-Rex which had ground beef, sausage, and hot dog and it was really good. The regular size portion is huuuuge and it's so dense, so it filled me up for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for clubbing endings or just a poutine craving. This place is crowded like starbucks on rush hour but at 3.am! It makes the whole place come alive. Oh and aside from the ambiance the poutine is phenomenal, there is so much variety depending on which flavours you'd like to incorporate. Love it!"}
{"text":"While in Montreal, we wanted to find the \"best\" classic poutine. A lot of reviews highlighted places w a menu boasting loads of different kinds of poutine... And anyway this place was suggested a few times (including by locals). So we went there at about 1030pm on a Saturday night. (Tip: if you order a burger and upgrade your fries to a poutine for $3, the poutine is the same size as a reg poutine.) So we got the 2 hotdogs platter w poutine. Fully loaded hotdogs were terrific! Poutine was UNTERRIFIC to say the least. Unsalted, cheese was tasteless, gravy cold and bland, and fries were just okay. I have to note that they had a number of poutine options (like in the pic) that looked decent.   That being said, place was hopping and service was really efficient and friendly enough. I wouldn't go back, but it wasn't a horrible overall experience. I've literally had better poutine at Burger King."}
{"text":"I've never had poutine before so this is from a tourist perspective. Order the small! because it fills you up!  This place is to poutine like what california pizza kitchen is to pizza. Poutine is Fries with Gravy and Cheese Curds (think chunks of mozzerella or something similar). La Banquise mixes it up and it is suprisingly really good!  I had the Poutine Mexicane: Fries, Gravy, Cheese Curds, Olives and Peppers. It's was delicious!   My friend had the Pizza version: Fries, Gravy, Cheese Curds, Pepperoni, Green Peppers and Mushrooms. That's was really good too!  I was here Tuesday Night and I've been thinking and craving poutine for the past 3 days. It's THAT good!  I made a video of my experience on youtube incase anyone is curious: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUm-2oaLGvc"}
{"text":"We got the tip from a local that the best poutine in town was here. She was so right! A bit of a wait in some bitter, bitter cold was well worth it. The food is amazing and the combinations all sound so appetizing. We also loved Poutineville, but this place is far better."}
{"text":"Super cool place!  La Banquise came highly recommended from friends and it certainally did not disappoint! We showed up midday on a rainy Saturday and the lines was still out the door! We elected to carry out but it looked like the line moves fast.  The poutine was excellent! They had a lot of really interesting options but we went with the t-Rex. The quality was great, poutine doesn't seem like something that can be a really high quality in nature but the flavors of the smoked meats was very good!  We would definately come back to dine in!"}
{"text":"A whole restaurant devoted to poutine fries.  I liked the classic with gravy, cheese curds and poutine fries.  The regular size was too big for me to finish, could've easily split this with another person.  Also tried the bacon poutine fries substituted with mozzarella cheese and gravy and that was pretty good too.  Not sure I would go out of my way to come here.  It was good but for $9, it's pricey.  They also service burgers, sandwiches."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go after hours, you know that they are always open...The Poutine there are excellent and tge portions are generous. My favorite is the \"Elvis\" comes with ground beef, green pepers and the famous cheese and poutine sauce...if you are really hungry you can try one of their toasted hot dogs !!!"}
{"text":"I got the vegetarian fries and it was okie I am not a fan of oily food and I don't like the curds. But my husband loved his it had guacamole and gravy! If in the area it's a place you should try"}
{"text":"Poutine is to Montreal as carne asada fries is to San Diego. You can't go wrong with the combination of fries, cheese curds, and gravy. I've been to Montreal three times without trying this local staple. I made it a priority on the fourth and most recent trip, but it was not without difficulty. The adventure began at Rôtisserie Chalet Bar-B-Q, which we were told had both amazing chicken and poutine. After we sat down, the waitress informed us that they didn't serve poutine and never did. But, she did recommend a diner two doors down that did serve it. Befuddled and a bit embarrassed, we walked over next door. The diner was mostly empty and I didn't have a good feeling about the food there. Fortunately, they carried free wi-fi, which I used to find the most popular place for poutine in Montreal, Resto La Banquise. We promptly made a quick escape when the owner just so happened to take a bathroom break. Two consecutive walk outs were uncomfortable, but that was not going to stand in our way of trying authentic Montreal poutine.  Four miles later, we found ourselves in Resto La Banquise, a 24 hour diner that is dedicated to serving a variety of poutine toppings in addition to breakfast and sandwiches. When we stepped in, I knew we were in the right place. Left and right, there were plates of poutine on every table. Out of the 28 varieties of poutine, we picked 3 to try: the Rachel, T-Rex, and the Classique. It was prepared very quickly and our plates arrived in a few minutes. My favorite was the Classique because you can really taste each individual component: the sweetness of the fries (Canadian fries are sweet for some reason), the savory gravy, and the mild flavor of the cheese curds. The Rachel had green peppers, mushrooms, and onions, which was flavorful, but overwhelmed the cheese and gravy. The T-Rex is just a mess of meat, which included ground beef, pepperoni, bacon and hot dog sausage. It was salty and my least favorite of the three.   I can see why this local fast food dish is so popular. After a day (or night) out in the city, a big plate of poutine is sure to cure any craving. Our love of fatty comfort foods is sure to add a few notches onto our belts, but in this case, I will gladly go up a size to indulge my stomach."}
{"text":"J'en ai entendu parler tellement longtemps meme des artistes on chanté une ode a leur éffigie malheureusement la qualitee de la poutine en tant que tel laisse a desirer. Tout etait fade, vraiment loin d'etre a la hauteure de mes attentes, je suis peu etre juste mal tombé sur une journee ou les ingredients etaient peu frais, j'y retournerai peu etre un jour si tout est fermer mais leur poutine ne rentre meme pas dans mon top 10"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pouting you'll ever eat! They've got over 30 varieties of poutines, as well as other types of food. They've got poutine for all tastes, Mexican, Italian, meat lovers, and many more... A must try at least once!"}
{"text":"La Banquise has good poutine. 'The bacon'  is an upgrade from the classic poutine. The portions are huge, order the small. Be prepared for a line up but don't worry because staff are working fast and will sit you soon. They have local brews as well to enjoy. This is a very popular spot with cabs often parked out front waiting to take you to your next destination. One less star because the server didn't see us seated amongst the sea of people and we had to wait and seek her attention."}
{"text":"So if you wanna try the poutine, you should first go to Montreal and then definitely go there :) I think the best one was the classic one. Just wish we did not have to wait in the line for 40 min. But it is just a Montreal :) the best hangover food ;) the food is huge but we literally finished it up . It is one of those food that you are like damn I am full but I just can't leave my plate and want to finish it :)"}
{"text":"When in Montreal, why not have poutine!! Only if your group likes poutine of course.   Every time I'm in Montreal, I've always stopped by this place. It offers a variety of poutine with vegetarian options, and it's 24/7. What more can you ask for! Personally for me, the portions were really big, even when you just order the regular size. Then again, it could've just been filling.   There's also the 'healthy' options (aka not poutine) for those of you who aren't a fan of gravy on fries. This surprised me when I had a friend who just wasn't into it."}
{"text":"I'm just not a fan of Poutine.  I don't really get it, its soggy fries, gravy and cheese curds.  But thats probably because I'm not from around here and I prefer my fries crispy and not overcooked.  And I think I'd rather have chili-cheese fries than gravy n cheese.    That all being said, this is probably a requisite touristy spot, 2nd to Schwartz if you're from out of town.  I had poutine last year somewhere else, wasnt impressed, but came here in hopes to give it a real shot.   I think what really sets this restaurant apart to try poutine is the HUGE VARIETY of different toppings that you can add on top of the gravy and cheese.  That in itself makes their poutine much better, and almost a basic medium to have any number of other ingredients.    We ordered 3 plates: -Traditional -T-Rex -Pizza  Since I'm not a fan of poutine, traditional sucked for me.  The extra meat they throw on top of the T-Rex made it much more palatable.  And I have to admit the Pizza Poutine tasted a lot like a pizza... go figure!  Then we saw the couple next to us order a TURKEY N PEAS plate, and a Taco plate.  BOTH looked MUCH better than all 3 of ours.  We decided to get the Turkey and Peas.  Its easy to miss on the menu, but BY FAR my most favorite one.  It really wasnt the soggy fries and gravy I was tasting anymore, it was the turkey with gravy.  So no wonder why its such a great combination.  Service was really slow here.  I can blame it on the language barrier too, but they just didnt seem that friendly to us.  And the line was long for dinner time.  So be warned to try to come early.  However, they are open 24 hours, and I suppose for locals, this must be a great spot to go for Late Night cravings."}
{"text":"This was by far the best poutine I had in Montreal, and if you want to eat a plate of the local junk food specialty, you should make this your first stop. The service is fast, the portions are more than you'll ever need (definitely big enough to split), and they have a bunch of fun variations on poutine involving everything from smoked meat to peas. The vegetarian poutine was the only disappointing thing. My wife doesn't eat meat, and I know that veggie poutine can be done better than this since we've had it at Potato Champion in Portland. My other complaint is the silly, tiny waiting area, which is a confusing mess if you come for take-out and only slightly less of a mess if you're waiting for a table. The place seems busy at all hours, so they should figure this out. But this is clearly the place to go for the local heart attack delicacy, and I recommend it to anyone visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Hella good son, they trying to make me add more to this review but it just hella good"}
{"text":"My review is based on an 10am poutine run. I knew this place would be silly at night so I fortified my system to down a classic poutine for breakfast. Having never been to Quebec, I've only ever had Mid-Atlantic US takes on poutine. I've never met a poutine-esque dish I didn't like but I cannot wait to get back to Montreal for the real thing. I couldn't finish a regular because it was so much. The vegan gravy and pepper sauce are awesome offerings. There's something for everyone here, as long as you like... you know, fries & cheese. Go (during a not-so-busy time) and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Despite the hype, and the occasional crazy lines we saw outside, this is definitely not the best poutine in Montreal.  I'd venture to say that even chain poutine places in Toronto, like Smoke's do a better job.  As others have said, the only reason to come here is that it's 24 hours.  So if you'd like to drunk eat some poutine after a night at Dieu du Ciel, this is your spot.  There will be a line outside, just be prepared.  If it's under 10 people, it moves quite quickly.  I had the smoked meat poutine.  The regular side would be enough for 2 people.  Fries were a bit greasy, and the gravy was quite dark and salty.  The smoked meat was nice though.    The super weird thing is that they make you pay after you order at the table, but before they'll bring you your food.  It's just awkward.  How do you even tip before you've been given service?  Anyway, not a bad spot for a post-bar poutine, but definitely not worth a long wait in line."}
{"text":"I had just arrived in Montreal after a grueling, rain-filled drive from Toronto.  My friend and I put our bags down at the hotel and headed for a drink, but the bar wasn't serving food.  Where to go?  A patron told us to hop in a cab and go to La Banquise for poutine.  We were not disappointed.  I regretfully got the La Classique (fries, cheese curds & bbq sauce) while my buddy wisely embellished and had an additional topping.  Mine was good, but with so many toppings available, I think I missed the boat.  It's 24 hours, so I may be back another night."}
{"text":"A bit of a walk from Station Mont Royal. Upon arrival, there was two signs outside of the restaurant, one for takeout, one for sit in. We opted for takeout as the line for sit in was nearly out the door. The restaurant itself was hot but we quickly came to a decision to get the \"Le Classique\" in regular size then was handed a beeper and told to wait outside until it vibrated. The wait unfortunately was about 10-15 minutes and we finally got our food.   OH. MAH. GAWD. IT WAS SO GOOD. I never thought I would ever hear cheese curds squeak but it did!!!!! I love the squeakness so much, the gravy was beyond amazing, I don't know what they put into it but mhmmmmmmm it had the gravy taste but hints of spicy and sour. The potatoes were cooked perfectly and weren't starchy at all with some subtle sweetness. Definitely try it out but some of the locals told us the place is overrated, meh lol"}
{"text":"This place is retro-cool. The poutine is good, good portion, good hippie-like staff, good times. I enjoyed everything! I will definitely go again with friends to try more!"}
{"text":"I was told that this place is a Montreal must, and I can see why.  My fiancé and I showed up around midnight on a Saturday night, and it was HOPPING!  We waited in line for maybe five minutes and ended up on their enclosed patio, which was fine, although I'm pretty sure they mentioned that they don't serve alcohol out there.    We ordered two poutines, and they were giant and tasty.  The service was efficient and good, and I actually liked that you had to pay before your food came, because we didn't have to track down our waitress when we were ready to leave.  Definitely add this place to your list if you're visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"I went here a few times. Three times for dinner, and the rest during after hours. Oh, and once for breakfast because my company decided to use their caterers. Probably one of the best places to get poutine in Montreal if you don't mind the sometimes long waits.  If you're not picky with where you eat, you can use the often-much-faster take out line, take your delicious poutine to the bar next door (BYOF) or go eat at Parc La Fontaine in the summer."}
{"text":"When we were in the city for Osheaga in August we came here about four times. It is seriously fantastic and such a great atmosphere. There will most likely be a wait that extends outside of the building at night (or at least there always was when we were there) but it moves quickly and is worth the wait. I had the vegan poutine each time and it is definitely the best I've ever had. I think that this spot is one of the best places to get poutine in Montreal. We will absolutely return when we are in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Fun place, easy to get a seat, tons of poutine options and they are served like the picture. Good music and they have their own banquise beer. Famous poutine however I wasn't amazed. We has the Mexican poutine - maybe should try another type."}
{"text":"Frankly, I am dumbfounded by the good reviews for this restaurant?!   In short: worst poutine I've ever had.  1. fries - too soggy 2. gravy - simply didn't taste much 3. cheese curds - I'm sorry, but have you guys ever tried real cheese curds?? I mean, the fresh, squeaky curds that taste of fresh cheese and that you have to fight real hard to stop eating? obviously not. this restaurant DOES NOT serve real cheese curds with its poutine. worst cheese. I think this is the main ingredient in any poutine and I give La Banquise a resounding FAIL. 4. meats - having tried the smoked meat poutine and the mixed meats one - bad quality cheap supermarket meat.   Please avoid if you respect yourself. Not worth paying for."}
{"text":"24 hr poutinery.  I'm not qualified to say if this is 'the best' poutine in Montreal - but I liked my T-Rex poutine - burger, pepperoni, bacon and hot dog.  Seriously, hot dogs are underrated as a condiment.  I like this place."}
{"text":"Cute place and a MUST for anyone visiting Montreal. The Mexican style poutine was my favorite! Definitely good with some St. Ambroise beer. Only thing is you have to pay before your meal comes so make sure to know what your getting!"}
{"text":"This is THE place for poutine in Montreal. It was around the corner from our hotel so very convenient. The line was long, but we were only 2 so got to skip ahead of many people - woo hoo! This is my first time having poutine so I have nothing to compare it to. However, this place has TONS of options. I'm glad I tried poutine, but not really sure that I need to have it again. It is a TON of food - I couldn't finish mine and neither could my friend. I got poutine with ground beef, guacamole and tomatoes though there are tons of options as previously mentioned.   Tip: Be sure to have cash as they only accept Canadian bank credit cards, but will accept CAD or USD cash. Highly recommend CAD though as the exchange rate was not good."}
{"text":"Overrated. You come here if you are a tourist and had never tasted a poutine before."}
{"text":"Visited Montreal and couldn't leave without trying the infamous poutine. We ordered the just classic poutine and it was exactly what I expected it to be. Soggy fries covered in gravy and cheese curds....I really don't get why people go crazy over poutine haha but again that is just me. Ordered some side dishes like jalapeno poppers and onion rings which made the experience a little bit better.....I suppose if you are visiting Montreal and you really want to give poutine a try, do give this place a try since everyone seems to be crazy about their poutine!"}
{"text":"Ordered the classic poutine. It was yummy but I thought the gravy could have more flavor."}
{"text":"My first ever poutine was a success.  I can't say that this place is the best at making poutine because it's the only place I've ever tried it at.  Nonetheless, all the other places have a lot to live up to.    I ordered the poutine with smoked meat.  If I go again, I will definitely get something other than the smoked meat.  It was like cubed up pieces of deli meat.  It was good but not really what I expected.  The fries were crispy but were also able to soak up the gravy.  I don't love gravy but this was seasoned well and the curds were squeaking away in my mouth.  I finished the entire thing and felt perfectly satisfied.  The portion was just the right size.  It was priced about right and the service was pretty good.    I definitely want to go back for more poutine and I know I'm gonna miss it as soon as I go back to Ohio because it is not something that will be easy to find."}
{"text":"This was recommended to me by three locals, who all said this had excellent poutine, and one of the best in the city. I ordered the Le Classique, which is just the fries, gravy, and cheese curds. It seems a bit expensive to me: $6.95 for a plate of fries, gravy and cheese? It seems like it would cost them $0.50 to make something like this, but I'm not a poutine expert, nor have I eaten it a lot.  To me, the poutine was just okay. The potatoes tasted sweet to me, the gravy was a bit runny and the cheese curds were kind of hard (I expected them to be softer and more melted). This was only my second time ever eating poutine, so you can take my review with a grain of salt. The fries were crispy, which was good, because soggy fries are never a good thing.  My friend got the poutine with the smoked meat ($9.15) -- also pricey in my opinion, but she said it was the best poutine she had ever had.  While I liked my poutine, I think there's probably still better elsewhere and I'll be on the hunt for it next time I return to Montreal.  I would still come back here and try the other flavors; best to come with 3+ people so that you can share different flavors. This place opens 24/7 which is pretty amazing, as this would be perfect drunk food. Cash only."}
{"text":"I was very excited for this restaurant. We had researched on the best poutine places in Montreal and this restaurant came up multiple times. Maybe because of that I had very high expectations for the food. I am a vegetarian and I really liked how they had multiple veggie options. However, when the food came, it was not hot and the fries were soggy.   The restaurant was very busy, so I am guessing that was the reason for the soggy fries. Overall, it was not as good of an experience as I thought it was going to be."}
{"text":"An extra star for them because they do vegan poutine!  We stopped by the location mid-day and the staffs were very friendly.  The regular size is definitely enough for one person!  Lots of flavour and gravy to the poutine, but it did get a little sickly towards the end.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit overrated. Bit the overall the food was good. Major complaint was it sat outside and it humid and flies flying around.  I would recommend you order one regular for two ppl as the regular is a big enough portion"}
{"text":"This (their Poutine) is one of the best things I have ever eaten in my entire life. I've been to about a dozen countries..."}
{"text":"It was absolutely delicious. I would recommend it to anyone. If you find yourself in Montreal, do yourself a favor and try this. It's so worth it and delicious. The T-Rex is definitely our favorite. The price is good and it makes you full. Will definitely come back here when I find myself in Montreal again."}
{"text":"If you are in Canada, you have got to try the poutine, if nothing else to say that you have. Everybody raves about it, but don't go thinking it's as worldly as they make it out to be. It's fries, with gravy and cheese. Some spots, like La Banquise, have all kinds of variations. The poutine doesn't get much better and the price is right. Don't bother getting anything else here. The poutine is a meal in itself, and nothing else in this place is worth writing home about."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here around 2:30PM on a Saturday. We knew we were at the right location because the line was out the door! However, the line didn't last more than 45 minutes, which was definitely worth it. We both got regular-sized orders of La Classique poutine. If you want to feel less greasy, I recommend ordering one to share (if there's just two people). I expected the cheese curds to have more flavor, but overall it was as yummy as everyone says it is!  The restaurant is very cramped and everyone sits close together, but it makes for a fun experience."}
{"text":"A bit noisy and probably best for a younger clientele - out door patio no alcohol allowed.   Arrived around 6:05PM and no line ups.  If it was less noisy we can come back ... teenage son wants to come back though LOL."}
{"text":"Very good poutine. Wide selection and many options. Even the basics are very good. Fast service and food"}
{"text":"Tried the famous poutine, which I can't recall the name but it was wonderful! Served warmer and with lots of gravy and cheese on top. Highly recommend it. Luckily, I found a seat right before it got crowded and was quickly seated."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great hearty food, La Banquise is the right place. The food isn't fancy, mostly several variations of burgers, hot dogs, salads and poutine, but everything we had was  very good. We were in Montreal for four days, tried poutine at three places, and the traditional one at La Banquise was the best. When we arrived there was a line out the door. We needed a table for nine and I was sure they'll say no, but they accommodated us without any issues. We were there on a pretty hot day, and the place was very warm. I don't think they have air conditioning. Something to keep in mind if you're heading there on a very warm day. Overall, great experience for reasonably priced food."}
{"text":"It's just poutine, right. Nothing out of this world, but I have to admit, as a late nigh snack it's just the perfect thing. It's a damn good Poutine. Greasy, gooey, cheesy, hot and filling.  It's a popular place so be ready for some wait."}
{"text":"It's pretty hard to tell everyone that you serve the best Poutine in the city of Montreal, you have to let your patrons do that for you. I believe that their best weapon is their use of social media. After putting off this rendez vous for a while I finally got to see for myself what all the line up was about. So fries are real good. Crispy hot and soft. Their Poutine sauce Nice and dark and tasty. Cheese curds and what ever topping you choose play second fiddle. So is it the best I ever had NO!  It's one of the better ones but there are some real good one out there you just have to look. I personally feel to wait in line, struggle with parking to be really tightly seated for a Poutine is just not worth it for me."}
{"text":"Nice spot to got after a night out. The place is open 24 hours. Be prepared to be welcomed by a little line outside but usually goes fast, even faster if you're a party of two. Not the best poutine in town but the facts that is 24hours and well located makes all the different for me !   If you are a meat lover like me, you go with ' LA T-REX' : steak, pepperoni, bacon, hotdog, you ask for an some extra onion and add a little tabasco sauce. ohh my gad."}
{"text":"They were at the top of a list of where to have poutine in Montreal.  Most every review I'd read said to be prepared to stand on queue and wait for your turn.  I was flabbergasted and thrilled, after walking for 50 minutes to get there, to see no line and to be seated immediately at approximately 6 pm on a Thursday in June.  How many ways are there to make poutine?  An infinite number!  My plan was to have a virgin version so that I could experience it in its true simplicity. But with a menu offering up more than two dozen variations I found myself weakening and giving in to several of the deliciously sounding descriptions.  The only thing I was certain of was that I would only order a regular portion and not the large portion.  I had seen a regular being served at the table next to us and questioned if I could even finish that amount.  I settled on La Rachel ($8.45/13.20) with green peppers, onions, and mushrooms.  In some ways, it was almost like having breakfast without the eggs.  The fries were crispy on the outside with some brown edges, yet yielding, and soft on the inside.  I first enjoyed a few that had not touched the gravy and they reminded me of the ones that my Mom made years ago.  The gravy was very good and also reminded me of what Mom made for our mashed potatoes.  The cheese curds are on the chewy side to add an additional texture and maintain that texture even with the hot gravy.  The peppers and onions were likely sliced on a mandolin and properly cooked.  The mushrooms added one more wonderful flavor.  My wife ordered La Taquise ($10.25/15.70) with guacamole, sour cream, and tomatoes.  After tasting my dish, she said that mine had more flavor.  Hers was good, but lacked the oomph that my had.  The tomatoes did not further emphasize the flavors of the fries and gravy, nor add any character to them.  The guacamole was very average and might have benefited from some chunky texture, but that might have conflicted with the curd texture.  It would appear that Canadian restaurants and bars favor selling Canadian brewed beers.  We had bottles of St Ambroise Pale Ale ($5.70) and Alchimiste Ecossaise Scottish Brown ($5.30).  Both were quite good.  Service was polite, efficient and friendly.  Minimal translation was needed and the place is open 24 hours.  They do not take American Express, and only take credit cards from Canadian banks."}
{"text":"Docking one star for the fact that after a certain hour they only accept cash, and half the time the on site ATM refuses to dispense cash. I usually would deduct more than that but resto makes up for that by being open and willing to provide poutine all day and all night.      The poutine was amazing, the curds were just sqeeaky enough. The fires were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. This really is the perfect post bar drunk food. It was so good we had poutine from here three times during our week long visit.       I had the poutine savoyarde au poivre, the traditional poutine and a poutine with chicken and bacon. Each variety was better than the last and made my stomach very happy. The beer selection features beers made in Canada, many of which I had never seen or heard of before. It was exactly what I wanted. I love immersing myself fully into the culture of those around me when traveling. I loved the beers so much, I just wish I could find some of these small breweries beers here in LA.      The service was awesome, even when I mispronounced au poivre and the waitress thought I had said avec pee. Which made us all laugh quite a bit. Hey I never get to speak french at home, so I'm a bit rusty when trying to keep up with the locals. I wish there was a poutine place close to home, hint hint restauranteurs of Los Angeles.      The next time I'm in Montreal I will be stopping in here for a beer and a large plate of poutine, but don't even think about asking me to share, that is not going to happen."}
{"text":"It was our first time in Montreal and many told us we had to visit this place - so we did! We visited on a Saturday afternoon during our touristy weekend in Montreal, and found the place super busy. Luckily, we came around 1:00 PM and there was no lineup for a table. We were seated right away. If you don't want to wait hours for a table, visit during off-peak meal times (it's open 24 hours anyway).  First, if you're driving. We found free street parking right by the park located beside the restaurant. But note, parking is only free during certain times of the day (I think our particular spot was only available before 3:00 PM). Make sure you read the signs!  Second, the food. Carbs galore but it was worth it. Our server suggested getting the onion rings as a side to our poutine, with honey as a dipping sauce. GET THIS! The best onion rings I've ever had - fried to perfection, thin and crispy, and the honey was a cherry on top. For poutine, we got the T-Rex poutine which was full of ground beef, pepperoni, bacon and sausage. This was delicious but not the best - the meat and fries could have been crispier but overall, a decent choice.  A great poutine experience in Montreal. Atmosphere is lively, and you'll enjoy your time here. With tax, and tip, we paid a total of $22.00."}
{"text":"Banquise is ok! It's not the best poutine in town, I wouldn't wait in line for it personally only because there is a lot of good poutine around. But this really is some of the best drunk food in the world and the late night lines aren't wrong. Get a giant poutine with crazy flavours! Vegan gravy! Guacamole! Share it with 7 friends or eat that mountain all by yourself, either way you're a champion."}
{"text":"It is always fun to go to La Banquise. Afterall, it is 24 hours! I have been there late night after a good party and for lunch or dinner. Yesterday, we had dinner there and my boyfriend loves it. I don't really like gravy (a sin of poutine) so I order it without. I love that they have vegan and vegetarian options for gravy and cheese curds. They are not super accommodating to anglophones but they do have an English menu."}
{"text":"Hate to say it, but Anthony Bourdain steered us wrong on this one. Maybe if you're realllly drunk it's a good experience, but otherwise, skip it. Service was slow and the food (poutine included) was gross. Strike three was when I asked for a salad without bacon. It arrived with a pile of bacon on the top (forgivable) but after I sent it back (politely), they returned it having simply scraped the bacon off the top (huge pieces of bacon left in the salad below). I rarely bother to write bad reviews, but I'd discourage others from wasting their time and money here."}
{"text":"We were visiting from NYC, and had to come to this place because everyone raved about it. We came in around 5 on Sunday for dinner and it was packed. When we were leaving the line was SO long!   The poutine was really good. We got the one with sausage, bacon, and mushrooms and added guacamole to it. (Large size) was good for 2 people, except there was a bit too much guac. The gravy was great and our cheese curds melted too and were really stringy!   We also got a burger to share \"all-dressed\". We didn't realize that meant it came with mustard (instead of ketchup) so we didn't really enjoy it.  The service was ok, no one really came to refill our waters but the food made up for it. Also, they don't accept American debit cards or cash so you basically are forced to use the ATM machine and pay a fee."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!!! One of the best poutine, I ever had, the reason why I gave it 3 stars because the staff was rude. Instead of saying politely they don't take US debit cards they were rude about it, but other than that the poutine was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The fact that this place is 24hr is what they really have going for them. I feel bad for the staff that have to deal with all the drunk people late at night because it gets crazy inside but it doesn't give them a right to treat their customers so poorly.   Poutine here is good, but not deserving of the hype and if you're lining up for 30min. you should rethink your decision because it's not worth your time.   But after a night of drinking, this place is definitely a Godsend. It's just nice to have a spot available for your drunk needs."}
{"text":"Je comprends pas prq c si populaire! Les frites sont froid, peu croustillant et huileux. J'apprécie qu'on peut changer la sauce régulière pour la sauce végétarienne, mais ça charge 1,25 dollar..."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that this is supposed to be one of, if not \"the\" best poutine in Montreal, I always seem to find myself dissappointed. Yeah, they have a wide selection of poutines, but that doesn't mean anything if they can't even get the gravy right. Had a trio with hotdogs and a small poutine, poutine sauce was bland, cheese didn't even begin to soften,  and the steamed hot dogs were absolutely tasteless. could of gone to Bell P's for half the price and better food..."}
{"text":"After a hearty late evening of drinking at Le Lab, my friends and I wandered over to La Banquise, which we had walked by earlier and had known was where there was some good poutine being served. Even at 3 AM, there was a pretty solid line out the door to get in - which gives you an idea of how much the inhabitants of Montreal either like their poutine or like La Banquise. We were probably in line for around 20-25 minutes before we got seated, but after that, it's very much a speedy journey until you get your poutine, as the servers are running around frenetically trying to serve and move people out as quickly as they can. You pay for your bill before the food arrives (in case you should be too inebriated to remember to pay), and the food comes out quickly - which, for this kind of joint, you can't ask really any more of.  As for the poutine itself, I've only had it once before in Toronto, but this was definitely better stuff. You really can choose from a whole bunch of different kinds; in the end, we got one of the vegetarian ones (I believe it was the with guacamole and sour cream), as two with meat (La Jaco and one of the others with spicy sausage in it). The meat ones were really all about the savory greasiness of meat mixed in with french fries and cheese curd, which adds an interesting texture (if a taste that I'm not terribly good at recalling) to the dish. La Jaco really does a good job with the mushroom goodness, which adds a nice distinct flavor and depth to the greasy sauce that you'll be dipping your bites in. I really liked the vegetarian one, though - it's extremely fatty, but I don't think there's another occasion I'd take to eat sour cream. It pretty much tastes like a taco without the meat, but it's really hearty nonetheless.  You can pretty much show up here anytime, as I think it's a 24-hour restaurant, but if you walk by in the evening, you'll definitely see how popular it is. Don't expect incredible service or even necessarily great quarters (we sat at a table that fit 4 but ended up having all 6 of us), but you're here to get your grub on. Probably a must-see if you're insistent on trying some truly local cuisine...and you can take out if you really don't feel like waiting."}
{"text":"We arrived at 12:30am and it was lined up out the door but I am glad we toughed it out for the 15 minutes it took to get a table.  We ordered a classique and a duleton.  They were everything a poutine should be - handcut dark fries, rich gravy and tonnes of curds!  The onions on the duleton were amazing.  Well worth the hype."}
{"text":"Thoroughly unimpressed. Overcrowded. Over hyped. Terrible gravy on the poutine. One of the worst poutine I've had in Montreal."}
{"text":"First time having poutine here and it was only ok.  Even for a first-timer, I noticed how the fries were soggy and cooked in old oil.  The gravy barely had flavor and it's listed as BBQ sauce when it's just chicken gravy.  Maybe it's a Quebecois thing.  $8 so not really a bargain and the plate's not even that big.  The older woman with short hair was bitchy.  Asked her about the Banquise burger to make sure it's with meat and she gave a smart reply of  \"It's a burger, of course there's meat.\"  Really?  Don't they have veggie burgers?  Besides, on the menu, it only lists vegetables under it, whereas other burgers clearly stated it's a double meat patty, blah blah blah.  I don't think I'd return here.  Frite Alors was SOOOOOOOOOO much better in all areas."}
{"text":"For poutine, this place is the real deal.  They have every combination of poutine you can imagine.  It's open late night so it's perfect for any time or evening.  The portions are huge so prepare to share, or just pig out!"}
{"text":"We arrived at La Banquise to a line out the door. I was excited because if folks are willing to wait on line that means its worth the wait. Once inside we reviewed the menu which had a variety of poutine to choose from. I chose the classic which is french fries with gravy and cheese curds. It was great, real late night or snack food."}
{"text":"Après une soirée bien arrosée, rien de mieux que de manger une bonne Poutine pour éponger"}
{"text":"A great way to introduce your out of town friends to poutine!  The variety, the fact that you can order and go have a beer at the nearby bar while they make your order and they'll notify you via a portable buzzer is awesome."}
{"text":"I can see how La Banquise would be touristy.  It never closes, serves what you want after you stumble out of a bar, and it has been televised on certain travel shows in the US.  But after going several times at 3am, I'm not so sure if it is.  Every time I was in line, I had gotten into conversations with native Montrealers, even sat and ate with, most of whom were surprised to learn that three dudes from Philly made it to this poutine eatery.  I did not meet anyone that wasn't from Montreal while in queue.  It's also kinda out of the way and even a nice local stripper recommended that I should go here.  I forgot her name, but she danced with reading glasses on so I'd assume she was probably wise.  Fries, cheese curds, gravy, and a myriad of meat combinations to put you on your ass for the night.  I recommend the T-Rex, topped with hot dogs, bacon, pepperoni and ground beef.  I'd also recommend visiting St. Luc's hospital as well."}
{"text":"TL;DR: La Banquise is the place to go for poutine in Montreal. The options range from the classic to ones with a fusion of flavours from different cultures. VERDICT: I recommend but expect to wait in line.  My friends and I ordered the Rachel, the Reggae, and the La Savoyarde. All are delicious. The Reggae was my favourite as it had a lot of freshness from the avocado and tomatoes. As a result, it did not feel as heavy as the others. The Rachel was more savoury to me than the La Savoyarde. The onions are grilled very well with a delicious caramelised flavour.  The service is quick and efficient. We arrived right around dinner time and only waited 10 minutes to be seated. Our server was very friendly and attentive. Casual vibe filled with locals and tourists at any given time of the day."}
{"text":"Very interesting concept, alot of poutine options any-time of the day i would love to see more drinks options that will make it place the best in town"}
{"text":"Now I have finally had the pleasure of trying the Montréal poutine. This place is supposed to be the bomb. I can see why: open 24 hrs a day, suitable tacky music (for example Vengaboys) and seriously fatty food. I had the classic (regular size) and I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"J'adore leurs poutines, les meilleures que j'ai mangé !! J'aime aussi leur choix assez originaux pour les poutines, ma préférée est l'abreuvoir avec les rondelles de pogo. Le prix est assez raisonnable pour la qualité. Par contre, le local est trop petit et bruyant, donc s'ils agrandiraient un peu le lieu ça serait mieux et la file serait moins longue."}
{"text":"For our first meal in Montreal, of course it had to be the real poutine. After reading tons of great reviews, we biked our way to la Banquise. There were a million choices but we narrowed it down to bacon and green peppers and the ham and mushrooms (can't remember the names of the dishes). They were both just ok, and I'm glad I got the salad to start because this is definitely not diet food! I guess we were expecting something amazing but it seems to be a touristy restaurant with many creative options of ok-tasting poutine. I can imagine it must get busy on late nights since this place is opened 24-7!"}
{"text":"The classic! You can't miss this symbol and the apogee of Montreal's gastronomic decadence while you are in town. They lose a point so, mainly on inconsistent quality. A good this standardized, is easy to quality control, while in Banquise you will notice quite important taste differences from one time to the other (let's say for instance the Merguez changes)."}
{"text":"Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm poutine. Ouvert 24h, je quitte la banlieue à minuit pour déguster une bonne poutine graisseuse avec un vaste choix de garnitures. 5 étoiles pour être ouvert 24h et pour avoir de très bonnes poutines."}
{"text":"If you have never eaten \"Poutine\" this certainly the best place to begin your  journey !  Great amount of choices for every taste !"}
{"text":"This place is really popular, we waited in a line that wrapped around the block to be seated. They have a huge selection of toppings and you can pick any suggested combinations or create your own.   I ordered a regular sized poutine with smoked meat, mushrooms and sour cream while my boyfriend got a large sized dish with smoked meat, bacon, pulled pork and Italian sausage. We both enjoyed them.  I don't necessarily think it's worth the long wait. In my opinion it was more of a late night drunk snack than a dinner meal. Would still recommend."}
{"text":"Must try! Really delicious poutine! And the servers are really friendly. I will definitely come again if I go to Montreal in the future"}
{"text":"Holy Poutine Batman! This place was amazing!  They have several kinds of Poutine (old fries with gravy and toppings) and as Montreal's 'dirty little secret' when it comes to food, this Poutine was very unique. I definitely recommend sharing a late because it's A LOT of food.  We saw a lot of locals and a lot of tourist.  I don't understand how the locals eat this and stay so thin and trim.  They must walk/bike 20 miles afterwards. Get the poutine with the bacon and sausage, it was yummy! They also have a unquie selection of beers for $3-$5. If you drive make sure you can park on the street because a lot of the parking in this area is only for local residents."}
{"text":"As a visitor to Montreal and a poutine virgin, I decided to hit up one of the most popular spots for this regional delicacy. We waited in line for a while before realizing there is a separate line for takeout. They take only cash and Canadian debit cards.  pro tip: want to find Americans? Just start talking about football.  I'm pretty disappointed by this poutine. It was essentially gravy fries with chunks of cheese that were too hard. I'd rather just eat cheese fries or gravy fries, or gravy fries with MELTED cheese on top. Maybe I'm just too American to appreciate it. The Squirrels in the park next door sure did enjoy our leftovers."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with all things french fry related -- if I could write my master's thesis on carne asada fries, I would. Therefore, in Montreal - I just couldn't not eat poutine. And they're everywhere, it should be easy, right?  Well, since I have Celiac disease, not so much... which is why I'm so happy that my fry related research led me to La Banquise. The vegan sauce is gluten free... and delicious.   The fries are fried in the same oil as gluten containing ingredients; I would have preferred that not to be the case, but I ate it anyways and had no adverse reaction. I had read somewhere that the breakfast potatoes were safe, but the waitstaff told me no (which I'm not sure if they meant no, they weren't safe, or no, they weren't serving them at like 3 o'clock.)  Yay for poutine!"}
{"text":"My first time enjoying poutine, this place was recommended by the barista, a bar tender, 4 students and some random strangers.  They are open 24 hours.  They did not mislead us.  I tried the La Dan Dan, frites, curds, grilled onions, pepperoni and bacon.  My friends got the original, no meat, and the T-Rex, which had bacon, sausage and pepperoni.  We all got the small size, which was really more than enough for one person.  You could share it, but we decided to approach it like a cross country run, by pacing our selves.  Only one of us managed to clean the plate.  We all decided that all of it was very good, however to fully appreciate poutine in all its glory, we should have waited till maybe 3 a.m. after coming from a night of bar hopping.    We left, happy, blissed out and very full."}
{"text":"ALL POUTINE, ALL THE TIME!  This all-night, artery-clogging joint was a gawdsend at 4am when my friends and I left the bar to soak up the alcohol we had ingested. That extra hour of drinking provided a good excuse for me to partake in a large plate full of cheese, starch and not-too salty gravy, no matter how unhealthy it might have been.   The menu was full with many, many choices, but I settled on the Poutine Bacon that cost $7.  The place was packed and loud, and I'm impressed that the servers did not lose their cool. To be working when the nearby bars are letting out drunk, obnoxious people must be a pain in the ass. I hope they get tipped very well."}
{"text":"Only place that is 24/7 to eat so best spot after long night of drinking  !! However I don't like it much since the fries aren't crunchy !!! Super soft fries !! Staff are all chill and nice"}
{"text":"the regular order is good for 3 ppl..  lots of varieties and they taste good.  Good staff too."}
{"text":"Awesome that it's 24 hours, perfect for late night poutine.  I got the poutine mexicaine, and I'm really glad I chose that one. The tomatoes, olives, and pepperoncini helped balance out the crazy grease bomb of fries, gravy, and cheese curds. But once the toppings were gone, it got pretty hard to stomach. Even the small size between two people. I definitely needed the beer to wash it all down.  Glad I came, and glad I didn't go back for seconds.  After 9pm, you have to pay the bill ahead of time."}
{"text":"Everyone said I had to try poutine when in Canada, and I was so happy to stumble upon La Banquise with their option of vegetarian sauce (thanks to Yelp!). After planning a day of walking around the neighborhood, we made our way over to La Banquise. I had no idea where we were going except for the little map I had in my bag, but I could tell we were in the right spot when I saw a line going three buildings down from the entrance.  Is this going to be worth it? Will the line move fast? Neither one of us were particularly hungry so we figured we could afford to wait. Not knowing the tourist:local ratio, it still seemed like it must be a good place to go if the crowd was so big just for dinner. The line moved quickly, and I think we were sitting at our table within 20 minutes of getting there.  They tease you by bringing out other peoples' orders first (you know, in the order in which they were taken), so you get to see/smell all the deliciousness before you have your own dish in front of you. Beau ordered the classic, I ordered the vegetarian with peppers and onions. Holy crap. It was heaven on a plate. So yes, the line moved fast, and yes, it was worth the wait. We both could only eat about half of our dishes (both ordered regular size), but were able to grab the leftovers for our hotel fridge.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I did some research before selectively picking a poutine shop, and this place hit the spot. Very popular with tourists and locals, so it's all good. I love the endless variety and the touch of humor that they have to the restaurant. It's really laid back and casual, which is what I wanted after walking around the whole day. It's also situated in a very relaxing neighborhood.  Just go in hungry and expect what poutine should taste like. Don't expect too much and keep an open mind! I really liked the L'Obelix. Would definitely order it again!"}
{"text":"Very good but a bit too often referred as the best poutine in Montreal. It's not necessary true, personally I prefer small and greasy potatoes shop. Don't get me wrong, it's very good, but just not the best place for poutine."}
{"text":"if you love to eat poutine this is your place, they have every single type of poutine to satisfy everybody, the staff is great, prices are not high."}
{"text":"If you want a fun Montreal experience, come here for dinner.   They do breakfasts too. And they are kid friendly for sure. My kids and I go there often enough for a morning outing, and they always provide us with crayons and paper to keep busy.   The staff are friendly and efficient and it's always bubbling with customers. Be forewarned though, it can get mad busy and you might expect to wait a while before being seated."}
{"text":"cute yellow-and-red painted space away from downtown montreal.  though known for their poutine, their menu boasts a diverse array of items (hot dogs, burgers, salads, platters, breakfast), appropriate for the 24h restaurant that they are.  but do they really have the best poutine ever?  nah.  the fries are merely okay (not mushy but definitely not crispy), the gravy lacked flavour, and there was some kind of subtle sweetness in it i didn't like.  red wine maybe?  the cheese curds are plentiful and tasty, but the squeakiness of them against your teeth is quite unpleasant.  the poutine here isn't awful, but let's be real - costco poutine is better"}
{"text":"Wish I had ordered a large plate instead of a regular, it was that good! My husband and I came here for authentic poutine after a tip from our Airbnb host. We came on a Sunday morning which was a smart move as there was no lineup like there usually is. We split a regular sized La Elvis which was poutine topped with ground beef, green peppers and mushrooms. It was amazing!!! The fries were nice and crispy and a really good ratio of gravy to poutine to fries. We finished the plate in probably 5 minutes. Fast service too. This place rocks!!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  I came here in the summer of 2013 (three times) and honestly, I don't find it that amazing!  The most memorable poutine was probably the one with a lot of peppers but in general, I feel that it's a bit over-hyped.  The reason why I'm not giving them 4 stars is because of the long-lines and waits that aren't really justifiable other than fact that they're famous for their poutine.    The portions are really big and if you're not here for a meal (I don't really consider poutine + a pop a meal anywyas) then you can easily split it between 2 or 3 people as a filling snack.  The location isn't exactly easy to get to if you don't have a car (we were here on vacation techncially) so the walk from the center of Montreal is perhaps 20-30 minutes depending on where you're located.   Definitely give La Banquise a try if you're in the neighborhood but if you're not a fan of waiting in lines, then you may want to consider one of the many other poutine shops in town! :)"}
{"text":"Very popular place and I can see why, the poutine was delicious! Large variety of choices and great for vegetarians too, with options like vegan gravy and cheese and vegetarian burger and even hot dog! I ordered the veggie hotdog and it was so good I couldn't believe it was vegetarian! My family loved the poutine and the portions were reasonable with the price. The only inconvenience we had is that they only take Canadian cash!! No American cards, but there is an ATM located near by if needed. Definitely recommend this place for any tourists looking for local, tasty poutine!"}
{"text":"When you think of Montreal, you think of...  POUTINE!  I am not a major fan of poutine, it's just fries drizzled with gravy and cheese curdled on top. However, La Banquise as I have been told by many Montreal locals is the OG poutine, they do poutine like no other. With a never ending list of ingredients chucked in such as avocado, smoked meats, bacon, sour cream, you name it, you'll be spoiled for choice. The regular or small size definitely filled me up and could potentially be shared between two people, seriously filling stuff and especially great for a late night out after drinking. Nothing like carbs to cure to delay the hangover"}
{"text":"Great selection of poutine (we ordered Original and T-Rex). Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful, able to speak in both French and English. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Have a beer and enjoy some famous poutine! I tried it with lobster somewhere else and I have to say meat is SO much better! Get some bacon and caramelized onions and welcome to heaven!"}
{"text":"Fries (and pizza) are my favorite food so I obviously had to come to La Banquise... but unfortunately left wondering what the hell happened.   Maybe if I were a hungry college kid at 3am it would have been good, but the quality of the toppings (when not meat- can't speak to the meat) is horrendous. Pretty sure it's crappy canned tomatoes, sliced black olives, the limp and sour grease-trap onions strings, flavorless guacamole, and the tiniest bits of cheese curds ever. It tasted like a clueless college student's ration pile.   Such a disappointment.   We picked through to try and find some more cheese curds or bites that would taste decent but I almost fished it were just naked fries and ketchup, it was that bad. We left 90% of the plate on the table and left feeling heavy and drowned from the stomach out.   On top of that, they only take cash or Canadian debit (don't even get me started on this) so be prepared for that or be prepared to fight through the line of 18 year olds to get to the busted  and sketchy looking ATM and pay those fees.    Oh, and if you come after 9 (I think we got there at 9:03) they make you pay at the beginning... so as to avoid dine and ditchers. So strange... as if you'd be able to get out the completely blocked doorway anyway. But not strange was how the service totally dropped off after we paid. Took my money, served me some sub par fries, and ran."}
{"text":"Poutine's are alright but way too over priced and you can get way better in south west MTL where this originated."}
{"text":"I hate poutine.    So this may not be a fair review.  This was our first stop in Montreal, as a \"must-do.\"  I don't dislike must-do lists in general, unless they include things like poutine.  Artless.  Soggy.  Flavorless (unless you count grease and salt).  All quantity and zero quality.    I tried to keep an open mind, but I thought I might throw up anyway when the \"small\" orders of poutine were put in front of us.  I did like the creme fraiche delicated speckled throughout my poutine, which otherwise had heavy bouts of some kind of processed meat in it.    I like my fries crispy!  I like texture in my food.  I do not want my food to taste or look like the way all food ends up in my stomach -- half digested.  And cheese curds - what the hell are cheese curds?  The droppings of other dairy products as they go through their processing factory?  Are they collected, packaged, and sold as cheese curds?  Yes, dairy-product-poop masquerading as an edible treat, the perfect crap to top your pile of crap with.  Is it possible to have taste-blindness -- or does everyone assume they are the unfortunate few who have it for cheese curds?  Do we now enjoy densely-packed calories tasting of nothing?  Models eat tissue paper to stay full, you know.  There's another option.  This is turning into a rant against poutine so I will stop discussing that here.  I did walk away with a nice stomachache despite eating 1/4th of my small plate.     There's a nice mosaic mirror thing when you first walk in.  It's pretty.  PS. If any Montreal residents are offended by this, please feel free to come to NYC and crap on our lox bagels, pizzas, hot dogs, reuben sandwiches, Halal carts, or anything else we are \"known\" for.  I really would not mind."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes in line in the frigid Montreal cold, but it was worth it!  Got a regular classique (BBQ sauce, not gravy) and a grande T-rex (hot dogs, sausage, and ground beef).   The classique was amazing, the curds were squeaky, and the BBQ sauce instead of the gravy didn't make it too rich and heavy.  Never thought I'd say this about a dish, but the T-rex had too much meat. It was hard to get meat + cheese + fries. But once the meat dwindled down, it was delicious.  The fries were crisp and tasted good even when they became soggy in the end.  Definitely a must-eat in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Il parait que la banquise c'est The place to be pour manger la meilleure poutine de Montreal. En suivant se conseil je me suis rendu 2 fois lors de mon séjour et je n'ai jamais été décu. Dans un premier temps par l'accueil avec de charmante serveuses et dans un second temps par la poutine.  Il faut dire que pour un lieu ouvert depuis des années et que c'est 24h/24 donc ils ont eu le temps de progresser et de développer leurs recettes. Pour mon premier passage on m'a proposé deux tailles différentes et je dois dire que j'ai bien fait de prendre la plus petite. Certes ce repas n'est pas des plus équilibré car il s'agit purent de frite de viande de fromage et de sauce mais ca n'est pas un étouffe chrétien (désolé pour l'expression).   Concernant les recettes il y a un large choix mais comme c'est la sauce qui donne le principal du gout. En tout cas il y a en a beaucoup à tester. Pour ce qui est du service rien à redire il est souriant et rapide et tout cela est fait pour un prix raisonnable il faut compter 10 Dollars pour une poutine sans les taxes."}
{"text":"La poutine est bonne et variée et toujours appréciée lorsqu'il est 3h du matin après une soirée bien arrosée! Toutefois, il manque de sauce à mon goût et les prix sont un peu chers! Faites attention aussi, la place est souvent bondée alors il faut etre patient !   Personnellement je vous suggère celle avec toutes les viandes du monde dedans ahah :)"}
{"text":"Huge portions. Great menu. Quite versatile for people with varying meal preferences. Perfect for groups and family, friends.. Open 24 hours so quite casual and can always find regular visitors, students, tourists..."}
{"text":"Great vibe, good poutine Lots of different meats- this  Is a drunk must-try"}
{"text":"I have eaten Poutine in many different places in Canada and the US.  This place casts a shadow over all other venues.  I order the La Fred Caillou, which is a poutine consisting of ground beef, smoked meat, spicy sausage & merguez sausage.  Need I say more?? I will advise this place only takes cash or debit.  No Credit Cards accepted!!! So for my fellow tourists, make sure you have cash on hand as this restaurant is a must if you are in Montréal."}
{"text":"Come with a big appetite. The poutines are quite large! There's a lot to choose from. One regular sized poutine would have been enough for my wife and I. The gravy was sweet. Cheese curds were firm and squeaky.    The place was packed. Popular choice. We sat outside. It was a very cool little secluded patio with many plants (fake but still nice to look at). Note that you can't have beer on the patio. Just indoors.   I would say the only thing we found was the bathrooms were gross. Walls covered in graffiti. Reminded me of an outhouse.  Also they only accept cash or Canadian debt cards.   Very cool area of Montreal."}
{"text":"Guilty and pleasure at the same time. Frequent consumption not advised.   La Banquise is the de facto place for poutine in Montreal. In fact, you could almost consider it a tourist attraction! It is known for its 24hr service of delicious but gluttonous fries topped with gravy, cheese curds, and other toppings of your choosing.  The best time to visit this jolly spot is after a crazy night out, at around 3 or 4 in the morning (when everyone is hammered beyond repair). But beware, you'll probably have to wait in line for about 30 minutes before you get a seat."}
{"text":"Je pense que la poutine et moi ça fait 2, d'où ma note peut être. L'original est déjà très lourd à manger, mais quand ça devient des recettes revisitées, c'est encore plus bourratif et écurant. Mise à part son large choix de Poutine, ça reste des frites avec beaucoup de sauce. Rien d'exceptionnel."}
{"text":"Had to try the Classique Poutine for our first time ever in Montreal! It was delicious. The gravy wasn't as thick as we thought, which was great because we shared a large plate and we didn't feel gross & stuffed.  The cheese curds were nice & chunky.  We also ordered the La banquise burger and it was good too. It was very juicy.   They have a whole page of different kinds of poutine. Some with meat and others with vegetables. You are sure to find something you like!"}
{"text":"La Banquise is open 24 hours so if you are hungry you have a place to go.  The poutine is so great. If you have never had it, you must try it. You can have it topped with all sorts of things.  There is often a line, but it moves pretty fast and you will be glad you stuck around. Try the Classic or the Jamaican poutine. The Jamaican is spicy with great peppers on it, so if you want mild, have the classic."}
{"text":"Preparing for my first summer trip to Montreal I had to do my research--I spent days on Yelp and similar sites looking for interesting, well-known, and well-liked restaurants. Food is a big deal in the city and I want the best experience for my money. La Banquise certainly delivered. After a long day of (literally) walking up and down Mont Royal, we decided to stop in for a quick bite. In my head I knew what I wanted, but of course I had to take an eternity browsing the menu. The poutine section alone covers an entire page! But I settled, and patiently awaited my poutine--the BOM. Being from the states, more importantly the south, I'm no stranger to dishes piled high with meat and cheese. But this was like nothing I'd ever tasted before. Well, it was my 2nd poutine of the week, however the first was not even able to compare to this masterpiece. I washed it all down with a local beer, which was so good I wish I could get it back home. Overall, this place did not disappoint a newcomer like me and I can hopefully make coming back routine in the future."}
{"text":"I stopped by before 6, for an early breakfast!  Great food, great service. I enjoyed myself immensely and will be back! A fun place even in the early morning."}
{"text":"Oh wow .... so this is Poutine! I don't even like greasy food, but this is great! Had the original... cheese curd and also the beef/tomato/onions.... the size is gigantic! An oval plate piles with at least 2-3 high of fries and its toppings... I prefer the beef/tomato/onions better but that's probably b/c I am not a fan of cheese...Good thing this place is across the street from the fire department ... (though I think their restaurant bio states that this place was opened by a firefighter...lol)"}
{"text":"I'm unfamiliar with the poutine game in Montreal, but coming here, I thoroughly enjoyed my \"Elvis\" dish (standard poutine with the addition of beef, mushrooms and green peppers). Fries/chips could have been cooked a little more thoroughly and the gravy seemed a bit watery, but it was overall satisfying. Don't dig the hipster vibe of the place, but the service was friendly enough and a nice hot plate of poutine makes those miserably cold days in Quebec all the more bearable."}
{"text":"this is a MTL must. During the summer get the poutine to go and eat it at Parc La Fontaine! There's always a line though so expect a wait."}
{"text":"Welcome to Montreal, home of the poutine. Of course we had to try only the best poutine place in town, La Banquise.  This was my second time in this place, the first being back in March. I tried the traditional the first time (pure awesomeness), but this time I wanted to add some toppings, so I tried to B-O-M. Yummy.  The portions are big even for a small (regular) size, I barely finished it (but took me a good 40-45 minutes to do so), and my friends who ordered a large barely finished half of it.  When I'm here in Ontario I'll get my Smoke's Poutinerie fix, but it's honestly not even close compared to La Banquise. Cream of the crop right here."}
{"text":"Went here to try Montreal's famous poutine. I stood in line for almost an hour on a rainy day. When I finally got seated, I was overwhelmed by the choices and so excited and hungry. I ordered Le Matty with bacon, onions, peppers, and mushrooms. It didn't take long to come out considering how busy they we're, but to my disappointed, it was bland and boring. I added hot sauce to make it a bit better.  Maybe I ordered the wrong one? But even the original should be delicious and this was the original plus some. I probably won't be back here again and definitely won't wait in line."}
{"text":"Was that Bill Cosby yelling reggae?  I'll never know, and I love Bill Cosby, but the music here is...not as good as the poutine.  Despite all of the funky menu choices (poutine with hot dogs, poutine with pepperoni, poutine with guacamole), my gut said to stick to something basic or regret it later.  I had the Poutine with chicken, which like all other poutines, was a massive mountain of fries, gravy, cheese curds, plus chicken.  Being from the U.S.A., the land of over-portioning, even I was surprised at the poutine portion sizes.  Any time we ordered a \"small,\" what we received seemed like a mistake, because one poutine is enough for two people.    If you want to poo-poo the poutine, there are other menu items available.  My husband had a burger, which comes standard with fries, but you can sub the fries for...you guessed it...poutine for $3 more.  Want to add a beer to that combo?  Only $3 more!  This is a mega meal and I don't think anyone can finish.  I enjoyed my meal, washed down with a St Ambroise Apricot, and would recommend Resto La Banquise to anyone, especially anyone visiting Montreal.  Although there was not a long wait to be seated, every table was occupied at all times, and the service was a little slow.  Resto La Banquise is casual, so you'll kind of be sitting on top of other diners, but there's nothing romantic or cozy about poutine, so this wasn't a problem.  It was stuffy and hot in here though, but that could've been the steamy gravy and melty cheese I was eating."}
{"text":"The poutine was really great. My first time having it. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Un hommage à ce restaurant à l'image de Montréal. Un ptit (gros) creux à 3h du matin après une soirée arrosée? Oublie le Mcdo et rend toi à la Banquise. Tu me remerciera plus tard, l'estomac bien rempli de bonnes patates frites, sauce et fromage scwick scwick. Je ne met pas un 5 étoiles puisque ce n'est pas la meilleure poutine en ville mais elle vaut le détour très certainement"}
{"text":"GREAT! everything we ordered was delicious, lots of poutine choices. Great service. played good music as well."}
{"text":"The poutine choice is massive. The poutine is good but not worth a detour if you are not in the area. On the weekends there are doormen who are very aggressive and hot headed. As far as me going I would have to pass by the place to stop and have a poutine or else I'll go elsewhere and the poutine's are much better"}
{"text":"Literally the best poutine I've ever had.   The price point, portion size, food itself was all amazing. The only thing is that there are certain times where you will be waiting at least 30 mins to get in (I've seen the line stretch down the street before).   So many different poutine options here, and if you're not a poutine fan, there are other menu options!"}
{"text":"When in Montreal - je mange poutine!  It's a tourist attraction, so visit for that if nothing else. I'll review it on more than just it's reputation.  First, it's a ways from anywhere. The closest metro stop is a hike away.  There will probably be a line. We only waited about 15 minutes lunchtime on a Sunday. When we left the line went around the building.  It's not a great deal. The large classic poutine is close to $10. That's a lot for fries, cheese and gravy. I didn't think it was that large either, but maybe it's because I'm used to American sized portions. Prices go up from there. It was good though and there are many varieties. (But I've had better)  It's cash only, which we didn't find out until we had consumed a lot of poutine and a bunch of beers"}
{"text":"Heard all about the poutine before coming to Montreal so had to try it.  After reading rave reviews about Banquise being the best for poutine, we gave it a try.  The service was sub par.  It took forever for us to order, and their menu was slightly 'deceiving.'  If the sandwich said \"poulet,\" then it should just be a chicken sandwich, no? My friend doesn't eat pork, so when she found out that her 'poulet' sandwich had bacon in it, she spoke to the waitress, who responded in a very curt way, meh.  Bad things aside, the food was fantastic.  The poutine was great!  We shared the poutine vége (peppers, mushrooms, onions), and it hit the spot for a cold cold night.  Then got the Costaud burger.  It was a big and juicy burger, and it is cheap ($3.70 CSD = $2.85 USD).  Total bargain!"}
{"text":"Well, I am probably not the biggest fan of Poutine for starting.  You know the saying: \"Canadians could have had French food, English culture and American government. Instead, they ended up with French politics, English food and American culture.\" :)  But when in Quebec, you definitely need to try some Poutine and La Banquise was a really nice place to do so. You have a lot of options to choose for, and portions are huge.  We ordered one large and one medium for the 2 of us, but 2 mediums would probably have been enough.   Fun atmosphere, feels like a student spot."}
{"text":"I finally came to La Banquise after being in Montreal for 4 years. My mom and I shared the regular size vegan poutine with added onions. The sauce and vegan cheese are great; the vegan cheese is actually quite creamy; however, its more like shredded cheese instead of the traditional cheese curds. The fries are good because they were fresh and hot. I usually prefer my fries to be more crispy, but these fries are softer."}
{"text":"Bon...  C'est probablement l'un des restaurants qu'affectionne Lucifer.  On oublie les régimes et toutes les bonnes résolutions en entrant. La poutine ! La damnée poutine qui vous fait saliver, qui vous réconforte, qui comble votre fringale à toute heure du jour. Ce plat maudit, qui fait monter votre taux de cholestérol et que vous allez digérer pendant des heures. Mais, on s'en fout ! Il faut bien pécher dans la vie. Je salive rien qu'à y penser. Mon estomac proteste et mon foie me supplie de ne pas céder à la tentation.  J'ai toujours été bien reçu et servi rapidement. Un incontournable pour ceux qui aiment la poutine."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with this place, came once and left it was so packed, then came back like at 8am, got a breakfast style poutine and it was awful, only thing good was the beer."}
{"text":"I miss la Banquise. I can't wait to go back to Montreal so I can eat here again.  I got the classic with vegan gravy. The third time I was here (yes, I came three times on one trip) they told me the regular gravy was vegetarian. I think what they meant was there aren't meat chucks in it. They still use meat and by products to make it. So if you're a strict vegetarian just stick with the vegan gravy. I honestly liked the vegan gravy better anyway.  Their veggie burgers are good too!"}
{"text":"Excellente poutine, mais incapable d'écrire une simple affiche en français \"no débit or credit, sorry\".  Inacceptable pour l'est de Montréal."}
{"text":"Long line ups! Which means it must be good!  Pretty good poutine and very large servings! Tons of cheese and gravy.   I just wish the place was a cleaner, the washrooms were disgusting"}
{"text":"I was a girl on a mission to try the best poutine in the city. Our friend who was born and raised in the city, took us to La Banquise and I'm so greatful that she did.   This place is THE poutine place, with 25 different varieties of poutine to try from, there's something for everyone. We ordered the classic poutine with gravy and cheese curds. It was unbelievable!!!! I FINALLY totally understand why everyone raves about poutine, it's the perfect comfort food!  We tried Poutine about a month ago in Toronto, and it was nothing like this!   They offer 2 sizes, regular and large. We split it 4 ways at 1am, but next time I'm there (and I hope I'll be there soon), I'll be ordering a whole plate for myself.   xoxo, Poutine lover for life!"}
{"text":"I tried different poutines in this restaurant. Had always a mania to go there almost every night to eat some different staff. I always liked it. =)"}
{"text":"my first visit to montreal - i had to try the classic poutine - i have had fries with gravy - but this was the first time with cheese curds. i was thinking that this was going to be a salty and oily affair but it was pure goodness. the cheese curds actually made it sweet. the fries were cooked just right to soak up the gravy but not so soggy that it was gross.  the mystique cider was pretty good as well. service here is fast and efficient.   they have other stuff here like hot dogs but a large poutine is way more than enough for two people with lots left over.  take care this place is cash only - like many 24 hour type joints. there is a cash machine by the register."}
{"text":"I see the 1070+ reviews and the overall 4 stars, but I don't know if it is all justified.   Location: A college hangout,  this is divey.   Bathrooms are trashed out.   The floors are greasy.  The tables are wiped down with a soggy wet towel.   Food: The poutine thar I've tried \"la festival\" was OK.  The fires were soft and soggy, coated with some sauce, cheese curds and some meat.  After eating the meat and some curds and fries,  I can't imagine eating a not her bite.   It reminds me off poorly made or reheated French fries from the high school cafeteria.    Personally,  I think they take frozen French fries and heat them on a griddle before dressing them up.   This is my first experience with poutine, and I'm not sure if all places make it the same way.  Drinks: Good beer selection."}
{"text":"If you're visiting Montreal do yourself a flavor and come here. Just know it's cash only and it has no WiFi. I ended up here twice during my trip and my favorite poutine was the reggae ( I didn't get a pic) and the sesame bagel sandwich was good but don't order the burger ( a waste of money- nothing special )"}
{"text":"La Banquise is amazing ! My go to poutine place. Everyone should eat poutine here I bought a poutine here at least 15 times"}
{"text":"Seeing the many great reviews here I should probably give this place a second chance. Came here at around 10pm and there was no doubt that this place was hustling and bustling with busy kitchen staff and long line ups out the door. I was quite excited to try this. There is a menu on the wall so you can think about what you want to order while you are in line. There are more than 28 types of poutine to choose from - From la hot dog to la boogaiou to la t rex and much more. With so many options and limited time to choose I decided to settle with the classic poutine.  The service was good in terms of taking the order and the actual poutine itself takes around 15-20 minutes to make. Considering there are so many customers 15-20 minutes was okay. As the place was packed with many customers already with no seats left we decided to get takeout.  The staff were very hard working, friendly,, constantly making poutine and ensuring the floors were clean. 15-20 minutes later we got our poutine. Portion was huge and looked pretty good at first with lots of cheese curds and gravey.  Eating it was a different story though unfortunately :/. I was looking forward to eating the melted stringy cheese curds but when I opened the box the cheese curds were still cold and squeaky. Gravey was somewhat too salty as well and fries did not taste fresh.  Not sure if I would come back but maybe it was a one off kind of thing Maybe we just got the wrong batch of fries and cheese curds? :)"}
{"text":"Un endroit incontournable pour engloutir une bonne poutine ! L'endroit est chaleureux mais les places sont chères donc parfois on fait la file. Budget très correct compter entre 7$ et 15$ la poutine sans les boissons. Il y a une terrasse qui est agréable.   Si vous êtes de passage à Montreal et que vous voulez découvrir la poutine, vous devez absolument passer par la Banquise !"}
{"text":"Got 2 large poutines here to go, maybe it would have tasted better to eat them there. Taking them to go did not taste good at all"}
{"text":"T. rex was all different types of sausages. Not too much of a fan of this item, maybe because what we ordered. They need to give more gravy here."}
{"text":"Junk is Junk, but this stuff has a soft spot in all of our hearts. Bless poutine and it's sobering virtues."}
{"text":"Un classique à Montréal pour la poutine, que je recommande fortement à tout le monde. Venue ici un vendredi soir vers 1h30 du matin et il y avait une file d'attente! Ayoye! Il faut dire que ce resto est l'endroit de prédilection des fêtards de tout azimut et des touristes en quête de cette saveur typiquement québécoise.   J'ai choisi la classique en petit format (frites chaudes maison, sauce BBQ et fromage en grain). Très satisfaisante et assez grosse pour un bon mangeur! Bien sûr, il y en a des très originales, avec des saucisses merguez, des petits pois, à la mexicaine avec crème sure et guacamole, etc. À vous de choisir!  Si vous n'avez pas la patience d'attendre pour une place assise, il y a un comptoir à emporter! Aussi, un des rares resto ouvert 24h à Montréal."}
{"text":"Heard many things about this place being one of the top poutine spots in the city. After waiting in line for around a little over 10 mins, the menu offers a load of many different types of poutine along with sides and hotdogs. The food came out pretty quick. It is def filling. They pack a good amount of fries and toppings.  The place is a bit far out of the way from downtown, but it's still a good place to get your poutine  fix."}
{"text":"La Banquise was great! not these days. I ordered potuine as always. they brought burned fries with a few chesse. Really It was burned! when I made a complaint, they brought a chocolate cake! I remember the quality of this restaurant was great. but these days not."}
{"text":"If you're going for the plain poutine (La Classique), you can do better (head to Patati Patata). If you're there for the crazy toppings, I can't help you. But really, if that's what you're going there for, skip the dense, heavy fries and bland gravy - just get the toppings.  The portions are large, even for the small. And the cheese curds squeak (if that means something to you), but that hardly makes up for the aforementioned shortcomings. If you can't get the base ingredients of poutine down, why bother at all? No wait is worth that.  The best thing about this place is that the staff seem to love it. They were singing and dancing and just having a good time."}
{"text":"Convenient at is it 24/7. If you visit Montreal you have to stop there because it is iconic. But the Poutine is far from the best in town (I'd recommend PoutineVille or the one choice of Poutine accross the street à Ma poule mouillée!) . It does the job though and you have a lot of choice which is still nice."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and walk there, so as to begin to burn off the many delicious calories you're about to consume. I ordered the poutine with bacon- and that made a good thing even better. Prepare for a wait though- even on a Sunday night at 9 and with just 2 people, we waited about 30 minutes before we could sit down."}
{"text":"I feel like a trip to Montreal is not complete without coming to La Banquise.   We decided to stop in around 2pm, had to wait about 30 minutes. Luckily I wasn't starving.   I ordered a regular sized L'obelix poutine. Which was smoked meat, cheese curds, gravy & fries. It was delicious. The smoked meat was perfect, not dry. The fries were still crispy & the cheese curds still chewy. The perfect poutine consistency.   The serving was way too big in my opinion, not sure how anyone could finish the large.   La Banquise also serves burgers & other food items. Can't imagine ever having room for other food besides poutine. They lose a star for the beer menu. I was hoping to wash down all of that gluttonous poutine with local Quebec beer."}
{"text":"I ordered poutine (mushroom, onion, chicken) and really good!   Just warn you all to prepare for long lines!   I came to this place with my friends at like 5pm, it was few people.   But after 7pm, long line!   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"After an exhausting bixi bike ride up TWO mountains and a plateau (it's really just a hill), we finally made it to lunch at La Banquise.  We decided on doing take out and eat at La Fontaine Park. We got La Mart (large for $13.25) which contains hot dog sausage, bacon and mushroom. It was a generous portion of food and we had difficulty finishing it between two people. There's something different about the fries (it's sweeter than other poutines I've had) which makes it so good!  I would definitely come back here for a cheap eat if I'm back in Montreal."}
{"text":"If you want to have a heart attack come here. This place was very good with tons of variety in poutine. Open 24 hours, beer, nothing else is needed! Friendly servers and prompt service with reasonable prices make it a Must try for the classic Quebec dish."}
{"text":"C'était horrible  J'ai payé 35$ et je n'ai presque rien mangé, ce n'était pas bon du tout."}
{"text":"Because Andrew went here...we tramped along.  Left most of our food, fries were overcooked, gravy tasteless and all the \"additions\"  piled on top unnecessary.  Go for poutine classique anywhere but here.  This is sub par and just coasting along on its rep."}
{"text":"Hello poutine!  Even better that you come in a vegetarian version!  Resto La Banquise came highly recommended for having La Végétarienne (100% vegetarian gravy), which was tasty tasty tasty.  You can request veggie sauce for their other poutine's that don't have meat components in them (i.e. La Rachel, La Mexicaine). I did try the La Taquise (guacamole, sour cream and tomatoes) with veggie gravy - it was okay, I'll stick with the La Végétarienne next time around.  Word of advice - if you're dining with someone, get yourselves one large poutine each. Sharing one large poutine between two people may lead to disappointment and resentment as the plate becomes empty and you blame each other for \"having more than your share\"..."}
{"text":"Can't say I'm a fan.  Overpriced for mediocre fries.  The cheese wasn't the awesome.  We ordered the Original, three amigos, and kamikaze.  The Kamikaze was probably the best b/c of the banana peppers.  I'm thinking this is all a personal preference b/c the cheese curds were rubbery and kind of gross."}
{"text":"From some of the reviews, I get the impression that getting poutine here as a visitor is the sort of tourist experience that I would tell my friends who visit New York to never, ever indulge in. You know, waiting on a line to try a particular unhealthy locally beloved food item from a particular restaurant just because it's the \"Thing\" to do. We New Yorkers, as everyone knows, never fall for that kind of hype. Unless, of course, cro-nuts are involved...  ANYWAY, I did it. I walked way out of my way and then waited in a line in the cold to eat the most unhealthy meal of the year (so what if it was only halfway through January) in a horrifyingly short time. I smelled like frites and smoked meat all day and had a vague stomach ache. These are all GOOD THINGS, in case you were wondering.  I did it all because first of all, french fries -- sorry, *frites* -- are one of my favorite foods. Second, how can you not get poutine while you're in Canada? Is this the best poutine ever? I have no idea and don't really feel inclined to do the research. But the whole point of poutine is that it's immensely satisfying while you're eating it, consequences be damned, and I left Resto Banquise happy.  Oh yeah, get a small order."}
{"text":"Poutine is pretty subjective, but this place has my absolute favorite. Very fond of not just the original but the Hawaiian poutine! Love that they're open so late and the atmosphere is cool. Love this place. So Montreal!"}
{"text":"Delicious! La banquise is probably the most popular poutine place in Montreal.. Had to visit this place when I came here earlier in the summer.   They are open 24 hours and the portions are huge. There is a huge selection of poutines with different toppings.. It was incredibly hard to choose just one. I ended up picking one with ground beef, tomatoes, hot peppers and guacamole..It was amazing! There is something about the fries that is different from other places that makes it so good!   We arrived on a rainy Friday night around 10 and stood in line for about 20minutes.  As this was my first time in the city, I was not familiar with the area and parking is quite  difficult to find in the streets of Montreal as a permit is required for most residential streets."}
{"text":"First thing I ate when I got to Montreal had to be POUTINE!!!  Very difficult to find street parking. Super crowded at 8 pm. Ordered to go and it took about 10 minutes to get my order.  Took my Visa but they charge a fee.  La Classique, large - $10.95 - HUGE and heavy! Loved the cheese curds. Gravy was tasty and not to salty. Fries had a good mix of soggy and crispy. Flavor got a bit boring after a few bites. Should have got some meat or something to help change up the flavor."}
{"text":"The reviews seem a bit harsh here.  They specialize in poutine, they have sandwiches and such. You know exactly what you are getting here, delicious unhealthy food. Cash only for americans, which is fine.   We had wanted to get some real poutine, and we left feeling pretty happy about what we ate. We got the regular and the reggae dish. Two dishes for 3 of us was perfect for not feeling awful after.  The fries are good, gravy and cheese are good, everything is good.  It is not fancy, so you shouldn't expect that. It is delicious unhealthy food.  I would recommend this if you are looking for poutine.    The place does get crowded at all hours."}
{"text":"Totally lived up to the hype. Best poutine I ever had in my life. Worth the line up and wait!"}
{"text":"It's lunch time at the office right now and all I can think about is the Elvis poutine (I subbed the green peppers for onions though) I had during my long layover in Montreal. This was only my second time having poutine (the first was at a bar back home in NY and suffice to say it was just ok) and I don't think I want to tarnish my memory by trying any other poutine moving forward. The portion was HUGE (I was alone so I had one half for lunch at the restaurant and the other half cold at the airport waiting for my flight...it was still good cold fyi) and the service was friendly although a bit slow since the place was busy. I came here on a Wednesday afternoon and there was no wait since I was dining solo but they get a lot of foot traffic so I can imagine the lines that form on a Friday/weekend.   Back to the food itself. My dish tasted like a Philly cheesesteak which I'm into and I highly recommend it if you are into that sort of thing as well. The fries aren't seasoned, but the beef/cheese curd/gravy to fries ratio is enough where you won't have a dry unflavored fry. They were also not soggy despite all the gravy, which is key. Though poutine isn't for anyone on a diet, it's definitely worth it as a cheat day meal. Honestly the best 10 bucks I've spent so far."}
{"text":"Had my first poutine experience here, I really loved it! Inexpensive and super filling I was so full I barely could finish as the portions are pretty big! Will definitely return next time I'm in Montreal :)"}
{"text":"It is obvious why this restaurant became so popular, and it isn't because they have the best poutine in the city - they have a huge dining area which is open 24/7 and they have really good gravy to boot. The location is ideal on the corner of Lafontaine Park - have a few drinks in the picnic area of the Park with snacks and then work up an appetite. This is a great poutine location too as they have adventurous poutines that are all pretty terrific. The veggie is pretty good, as is the chicken with peas."}
{"text":"One of my favourite poutine restaurants in Montreal. One that I would definitely recommend to friends. While most poutine parlours I have been to are usually a take-and-go, or in a more run down environment, La Banquise has a tasteful collection of various poutines that you can go, and the dine-in experience is fun!  Portions are fair, but it can be a bit pricey if you go with the large, but well worth it if you are hungry. For meat lovers, I will recommend the T-Rex, which comes with ground beef, pepperoni, bacon, hot-dog and sausage. If you are hungry, and want a good poutine and lots of meat - this is the perfect choice!  I am still looking for a \"to-die-for\" poutine restaurant in Montreal. Since I am not the biggest fans of poutines, I am still looking for the perfect poutine in the perfect restaurant. La Banquise is at the top of that list now, but maybe there is something better out there."}
{"text":"T-Rex poutine is bombbbbbbb. Great for drunk food if you're willing to go the distance"}
{"text":"They robbed me of my first poutine experience...  Since hearing of the existance of poutine I've been waiting to try it in Canada... that was 2 years ago.  My aunt took me to La Banquise on my first night.  I read many good things about the poutine at La Banquise, so I was very excited to try it.  We ordered a large of the classic poutine to share.  As I took my first bite, the first thing I realized was the fries were not fully cooked.  I understand that they are open 24 hours a day and are incredibly busy however, I will never get this expereincce back again.  After waiting two years to try real poutine, I was was SO VERY dissapointed.    Oh yeah, and apparently they are CASH ONLY.  :("}
{"text":"Well deserved to get a 5 star!!! Lots of variety of poutines, but I love their burgers!I got the trio burger bacon, fries and a drink for 10$! Hey I even took home my extra fries, No shame I couldn't finished it :)"}
{"text":"Came here for poutine. Settled on the merguez, bacon, onion version. There wasn't a lot of squeak to the cheese but the fries were crispy enough and there was good balance with all the ingredients. Cash only unless you have a canadian debit card. Place was packed around lunch time on a Thursday."}
{"text":"Overhyped. Poutine is OK but nothing special, really. Not worth the queue."}
{"text":"La Banquise is Poutine heaven. There must have been literally near 100 different kinds. This was my first time trying poutine so I opted for the classic, nothing but straight up fries, gravy and cheese curd. Sounds like a heartattack waiting to happen, but it's worth the risk. Next time I'm trying the classic with bacon, can't wait.  La Banquise was packed when we arrived around midnight, and this was on a rainy day too. Line was out the door but locals and visitors waited patiently for tables to probably what is the best poutine place in Montreal."}
{"text":"Best poutine in Montreal! But the best part of this place was the service we got. We went on a Saturday that wasn't particularly busy day so we were welcomed right away. Everyone of the employees we came in contact with us was friendly and helpful. Our server, Noémie, was awesome! I got the Savoyarde which was delicious. I got a regular and the portion was huge! Really good value for your money   Definitely going to come back and try other poutine options"}
{"text":"Oh dear lord this place was popping even at 1-2pm on a Sunday afternoon. Apparently it's THE poutine spot to hit up.  Canadian debit cards or cash for payment only.   If you drove and don't want to wait in line for a table then just order to go.. We did that and I'm glad we did.   Ordered the regular sized Trex which is apparently the most popular one and man that thing is huge! (Check out my photo).. Also it was way salty like man really salty.  I can def see this being an amazing drunk dish, I could really only get a few bites on before I felt like I was on a sodium overload. Otherwise though besides the overbearing salt confect I'd say it was an interesting combination of textures and flavors.. From the fries to the gravy to the chewy cheese curds to the ham etc etc   All in all, I'd probably only return if I was drunk and craving greasy salty food!"}
{"text":"The poutine was burnt,I left  when I saw a drunk kid vomit all over his poutine."}
{"text":"Thursday afternoon around 1:40pm. Came here to get take out and try their poutine. People lining up to get in... Once you step inside the doors, there are 2 lines. The right side to eat in, the left for takeout. For takeout, you have to grab the menu and pick from that. There is no menu posted. I just wanted to get the classic poutine - kept it simple so I don't have to wait too long, and ordered the grande size. The gave me a buzzer, and said it may take around 10mins.  I felt it took a bit long to wait for fries, gravy and cheese curds. As I can see the were making fries by the batch, I'm sure the gravy was ready, as well as the cheese curds.  10- 15 mins later, I get my food.  The fries were good!! Gravy was not bad. Cheese curds were chewy, different texture from what I'm use too.  4 stars for food. 2 stars for wait time- I could understand if the made each order as it was ordered, then it would make sense. But everyone in the takeout was getting poutine."}
{"text":"Poutines at their best!"}
{"text":"Come on.... Big deal there's a line up regardless what time you go! It's some of the best freaking poutine ever. ESPECIALLY at 4am!! AND they gave me hotdogs AND bacon in my poutine.. I almost proposed to my poutine."}
{"text":"Okay, I am going to give this place 4 stars... but mind you, I don't have much of a basis for comparison because this was my FIRST poutine experience.  If you don't know, poutine is a gluttonous concoction.  It goes like this:  1)  A pile of greasy french fries; 2)  Smothered in a thick brown gravy;  3)  Topped with cheese curds.  La Banquise offers an array of poutine, ranging from La Originale (see above) to the meat-lovers version, the T-Rex (hamburger meat, sausage, pepperoni, etc...).    Since it was my first time trying poutine, I figured that I would just go with the basic la Originale.    My first impression:  WOW this is SALTY.    My second impression:  Hm.  Who would've thought cheese curds could taste so nice.  All in all, it was tasty.  Total drunk people food though.  It appears they are open 24 hours a day - making this the perfect stop after a late night drinking with friends.    I sat in the patio area and it was really nice.  I would definitely check them out!  They are NOT cash only, contrary to the other posts."}
{"text":"I've been coming to la Banquise for the past 7 years now and  I've never been disappointed. It's one of my favourite places to eat in Montreal. All the types of poutine I've tried are really good; my favourite is \"la pizza\".  Their burgers are good too but I think it's only worth the trip if you order at least one poutine. I always order the large portion and take the rest home if I don't finish it.   Occasionally the lines are long but it moves pretty fast, and you have the option of take-out. Parking in the area isn't too difficult either if you're willing to walk a few blocks.   If you like poutine I highly recommend you try out this place. I don't live in Montreal anymore but every few months when I come home I make sure to eat here at least once."}
{"text":"I had never had a real poutine but I'm willing to try anything once. The concept for fries with cheese and gravy didn't sound too bad. My boyfriend took me to La Banquise and told me that it was the best in Montreal. They have a large selection of poutines. After trying mine, I was hooked. It was really good and since it was the first and only one I have ever had, it was the best. The atmosphere of the restaurant is low keyed and cozy. There is a small outside porch area full of plants and small birds looking for a treat. I would suggest visiting La Banquise just for a poutine. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Poutine BOH. Crack. Absolutely the best drunk food I've ever had; fries, spicy Arab Sausage, caramelized onions, cheese curds, gravy and BACON. YES BACON.  Montreals an amazing city to get wasted in. There is no drinking age and the cops are more of a friendly professional party patrol than a gang of armed thugs like in the states. Just try to speak French and people will help you. You will not understand Jouale. Do not try. Just go with the flow, hein?"}
{"text":"I'd say 3.5-4*.  Good poutine, but like the others said, dunno about BEST poutine.  Divey, hole-in-the-wall eclectic, mishmash décor.  Cons -  line-up -  loud as hell -  service is a tad slow probably due to how busy they are.  Takes a while to get your order taken/food to arrive -  poutine is not \"layered\".  Gravy+cheese curds only on top -  fries aren't crunchy throughout, just around edges.  Very well-done, dark fries  Pros +  line moved relatively quickly +  portions are HUGE.  A regular size is probably too much for the average appetite!  So totally shareable.  We had a reg + 1 large for 4ppl!!! +  gravy, even veg gravy was quite flavourful  Tip:  Since it's a busy place, waitresses can be impatient, so have your order ready by the time she comes by!  Menu is detailed with explanation, EN/FR.  In the main room, description of beers is written on the large mirror (complete with poutine pairing!), so you don't really need to ask waitress."}
{"text":"you've been drinking for a while.  not too much, or you'd be on the floor in a back alley.  \"i need to eat something that i can carry with me while i walk back to the hostel,\" you think to yourself out loud.  you wonder why people are looking at you, but by then the hunger has set in.  \"poutine!!!\" you yell.  now people are scared.  but that's their fault.  this place is popular.  there was pretty much a bouncer at the door to separate people that were ordering take-out and those who wanted a table.  it felt like i could have been at some place called club curd or disco gravy.  after a 15 (maybe 20) minute wait i ordered the standard poutine, small.  i've only had poutine one other time, somewhere in vancouver.  at first i thought it wasn't that good because there were not enough cheese curds.  then i realized that it's sort of portioned off so that you can mix the sauce and the curds into a glorious heap of unhealthy goodness.  i took a break from walking along a street named after a saint so that i could eat it.  i agree with another reviewer that poutine is not for everyone.  if you are only into crispy fries, you may not like it.  but give it a try.  i'm only rating the place based on the poutine.  it has the feel of a late night diner that needs a bouncer because of the popularity of the food.  maybe they have crispy fries inside?  i know they have burgers on the menu.  adieu."}
{"text":"La Banquise has the best French fries I've ever tasted, and I don't even like potatoes!  Unfortunately they are often stingy with the sauce and cheese curds, but overall the poutines taste great.  The staff are usually very friendly, and the overall experience is good, so I'm rounding 3.5 stars up to 4."}
{"text":"With so many rave reviews, you would think this place would be great outside of the 11pm-4am hammered crowd timeframe, but not so much.  Although getting a seat is much easier, this place is not really recommended for just a regular dinner.  Maybe it's because I'm not the biggest \"squeaky curds\" fan, but no one at the table seemed to be blown away by the various assemblies of fries, gravy and cheese.  I have had other poutines that would knock your socks off drunk, sober, or anytime of the day, but this would not be worth it unless you're drunk enough to wait forever in a line to inhale something that will make your hangover a little less painful."}
{"text":"For the longest time - 7 years - I resisted eating poutine. An international student sealed in his McGill \"bubble\" for the longest time, the mere mention of poutine conjured images of a person experiencing a stroke!  Fast forward couple of years later and I finally convinced myself to try poutine for the first time. It was banquise were i experienced awesomeness!! Over the years this was always a great spot for your aprés troise heure meal.  However I give 3 stars because recently i have noticed line ups outside on the street.....at 12:30am!!! Post 3am drunken food fest i understand, but 12:30am when the inside looked not that busy at all?  Then again maybe its the old fogey in me remembering the good ol' days!"}
{"text":"This place was a total, ridiculous disappointment. What a tourist trap.  We had been hearing about this place since we got here last summer. Twice we thought about going, but a huge queue outside made us change our minds. Poutine just didn't seem like the kind of food I'd queue for, not that I like queuing for anything really.  Anyway, last night, late night, we're satisfactorily drunk, in the area, we decide to just do it for the sake of it.   To start, it was about a ~20min wait in the freezing cold/snow (it felt like an hour, and note: there's about 150 places within a kilometer radius that sells this same dish, poutine - places we went before, and enjoyed.). And remember, poutine is drunk hangover food, it's not fine dining. Any old greaser can put a good one together. We've had dozens of great ones since we moved here (without visiting Banquise let alone queueing in the snow).  So yeah, a loooong wait. Then eventually, once it's your turn the staff don't even look at you, they just sort of gesture their hand for you to run inside (kinda similar to crappy nightclubs), then put you into a corner with two menus and run off without a word. Right off the bat it feels as though you're really making their life unpleasant. I understand it's busy but a simple \"Welcome to Banquise. I'll be back in 5 :)\" would be great!  Inside, the place is super loud and bright, full of other drunk obnoxious people (usually fun but the vibe is off, its not a bar nor an entertainment venue, so it feels a bit weird), and decorated in a pretty bad way. Kinda like a pastoral McDonalds.  Anyway, the menu had a ton of awesome poutine options, so we got excited. Ready to order within 2min, it took us forever to actually make the order. You'd think with such a queue outside they'd be on this. Eventually, after about 15min, a server came and took our orders, in a very fast food manner (raised eyebrow, no response). My gf had a regular large poutine, and I got the Dan Dan (pepperoni, bacon, onion). We also ask for two Dr Peppers. Then he snatched the menus with a grin and ran off.  We then waited excitedly, very hungry by this point. But then 5min later, the guy comes to us with the cheque, saying we have to pay first, because it's their \"nighttime policy\" ie ppl sneaking out. I mean I get where he's coming from, but this isn't a take away corn dog, we're sitting down in the damn place!? To me, this speaks volumes about the tourist trap system of this place (designed for maximum speed, absolutely no attention to clients, who is sitting, or standing, or outside, or anything). Remember, ppl are queuing in the snow for this. Anyhow, I pay ($35 for two poutine/soda!!!!) without a complaint. And we waited again (now -$35).  Then, 10min later, two poutines arrive. They look amazing, but turn out to be extremely ordinary. Ordinary as in it looks just like the ones up at A&W on St Laurent/Mont Royal that you can get without a queue (not even Poutineville which is open till 5am just down the road. For a quarter price, mind you.  So, anyway, being slightly inebriated/hungry, we dig in. And yes, it is satisfactory drunk filler, but nothing great at all, considering queue, price, noise etc. You have to eat it amid shouting and people throwing things, and it's not cheap. It felt like a frat house. I much prefer a quiet greaser at this hour.  Being pretty disappointed, after about 15 bites each (about 1/3 of a large plate), we then ask the guy if we can have our food to go. Thankfully this part was done really quickly.  I felt kinda conned and scammed into a poutine tourist trap. The queue, the people, the glorification of a drunk food. I mean, AA or all the late night city diners glorify poutine by making the experience and food taste authentic to Montreal, not with colors and queues and self-important staff. I found it a little absurd and kind of disingenuous to visitors, the way this place is advertised. Like Schwartz's and other queue places, offer something specific. Poutine? And not great ones? Are ubiquitous.  This is the \"go to\" Montreal place? The whole approach with this place is wrong. This is not Montreal to me, this is a cartoon tourist trap to rip off people.  If you are starving next door with $15 to throw on a poutine and can't be bothered to walk two blocks in any direction, then eat here. But this is not \"good poutine\". It's over-saturated and phony and.... just a bit of a tourist trap cashing in on tourists MTL poutine stereotypes.  My image of Montreal was kinda tainted by this place. But anyway, glad we went and got that out of the way."}
{"text":"I mean, what is the point of even writing a review for La Banquise? The 1444 reviewers before me have probably said it all... and the fact that this place has 1444 reviews and over 1000 4/5 star ones, says a lot.  Absolutely a must go. I have been to Montreal around 10 times in the past few years, and there has been not a single time I have skipped on going to the Banquise. I have only ever had poutine there, but they also have other options, such as burgers and hot dogs. Truth be told, there is no need to do anything but the poutine, because that stuff is AMAZING. I have tried at least half a dozen of different types and was never disappointed in the least. Delicious, juicy, and flavourful. Everything you'd want in a poutine.   Only thing to be aware of  - there is absolutely always a lineup there. This is the *it place* for poutine in Montreal, so do come mentally prepared for waiting, and have a snack before, just in case.  Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"I love this place, in the cold Montreal days/night, poutine is the way to go. Here's the skinny...   Food: 4.5 (burger?)  Decor: 5 to me, but I could see how others would say its too... loud, visually and verbally  Dress: No code here people  Price: Cheap! just the way I love it.   Food Ordered: Traditional Poutine, regular size, killed it... and a cheeseburger \"dressed\", it too well done for me.. I don't know if they have medium available.. but this review was for Poutine. Cheval Blanc which tastes like a Hoegaarden   Tip: After a certain time, waiters want to be paid first, which makes sense (drunken customers w/o cash)."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours a day, la Banquise is one of those restaurants that define Montreal. Having been to dozens of other poutine joints all around Montreal, La Banquise has always been the number one choice for late night poutine. Their menu is extensive and features all types of toppings. The price is reasonable and the portions are not small at all. This is one of those places that make me glad that I came to Montreal for school :)"}
{"text":"Delectable 'Rachel' poutine, about 4 or 5 down the list of various styles that La Banquise prepares as their main dish. It was my first time having real, quality, authentic poutine. Or else I think so anyway. Compared to the Hilton room-service poutine in Vancouver last year, this tasted way fresher and quite a bit more pronounced in some specific flavors. It was like eating rich earth. Saucy mushrooms, sauteed peppers in onion. Light curds, aromatic gravy. All on a bed of warm fries. I love the memory of my 'Rachel' poutine."}
{"text":"Belle selection de poutines différentes, tout le monde y peut trouver sa poutine. Des fois l'attente est un peu trop longue et manque un peu de place. Mais sinon c'est une bonne place à poutines."}
{"text":"The poutine was good, but the service was atrocious. Although the pick-up line seems shorter than the dine-in line, it looks like the kitchen prioritized those dining in. It is easily a 30-45 minute wait for pick up, which is unacceptable for a simple dish like poutine where the main ingredient - fries - is made in bulk. In my opinion, the food isn't good enough to offset the gross mismanagement."}
{"text":"I did my Poutine challenge all over Montreal and there were several increbile poutines that I was most pleased with. La Banquise was the best.   The plain, old-fashioned fries-curds&gravy poutine was fantastic there. I totally ate that and realised that this was probably the best straight-up poutine I had on my visit, but then I tried the BOM and that just sealed it. It was incredible and my visit was a success because I'd found the perfect poutine. I'd tries at least 8 different poutines that week, and this was the best.   Oddly enough, it was recommended to me by a taxi driver who also pointed me to a bowlign alley that did a pretty good one too!"}
{"text":"I'm actually here to make a plug for their veggie burger, which is probably not the first thing most people think of when they want to come to La Banquise. Our group of six really wanted to try the poutine dishes. I don't eat meat, but the vegan-style poutines didn't really tempt me, though I'm sure they are delicious as well! I was in the mood for something a bit lighter. I ordered the veggie burger, which came with a toasted bun, delicious coleslaw, and a thick layer of melted mozzarella cheese atop a veggie/soy patty. It was a small yet filling portion, with a variety of textures, and tasted indulgent enough that I didn't feel like I missed out on the crazy poutine concoctions, though they did look good! You can also sub the veggie burger in for any of the other burger combinations for an additional $1.50. On a Saturday night, the line was out the door and to the middle of the block, though it moves rather quickly. The food took a while to come out, but the fun music and retro diner atmosphere kept us entertained while we waited!"}
{"text":"What else is there to say? You've read it all! You know the drill, it's a bit of a tourist trap, but as a Montrealer you probably keep coming back just because.  While I am still mourning the loss of the Hawaiian poutine, I must admit their menu is huge. Don't see anything you like? Go wild with the extras! I decided to console myself with a \"Taquise\", a generous portion of poutine, plus guac, sour cream and tomatoes and let me tell you...it's cold. Yep! The guac + cream + tomatoes are cold, so the cheese curds underneath don't melt, and then what's the point of it all, man! The fries are delicious, but the gravy can get very salty. There was virtually no wait at 9pm, but they do ask you to pay beforehand in the evening because...I'm not too sure either. Of course, cash or debit only!  Eh, it's just poutine after all."}
{"text":"Les idées de poutine sont bonnes. Rien comme des pogos dans une poutine. MAIS, la poutine en tant que telle est très moyenne. Le fromage est plus ou moins frais (pas en termes de passé date, mais en termes de couic-couic et de goût) et la sauce n'a rien de bien spécial. Bref, un incontournable de la poutine à Montréal, mais rendu là, je préfère honnêtement celle du Valentine."}
{"text":"So, this is where all the hipsters flock when the bars close to get a fix of greasy, hot, salty poutine before they get to bed.   For those who don't know about poutine, it's Quebec's version of ramen except no one actually thinks it might be good for you.  La Banquise's most interesting feature is that it's open late. People rave about it's poutine, and it's fine, but it's far from amazing. Well, that's not true, it IS amazing at 4:00 in the morning when you have a belly full of beer.  I don't want to be the one to say \"poutine is just poutine\", but it kinda is.  A mandatory stop if you're doing a poutine-a-thon, but if you're only interested in trying out poutine in Montreal, I'd go to Chez Claudette. If you're doing a Quebec-wide trip, go to Cantine de la Gare in Rimouski."}
{"text":"Yum! First time having poutine and it was delicious! We ordered two larges that was enough to share for 3 people. I would recommend getting two dishes that are completely different from each other because they tend to start tasting the same after awhile! You may want to get a coke or some kind of soda to wash down all that fat that you're eating... delicious fat though! We just had water and while it helped, I don't think it did the job.  I can't remember which two poutines we had, but I'd say any one of them are good. We got the regular/traditional one and one that had all this meat. The meat one was a bit overbearing because the sausages were huge and very filling. I'd recommend something lighter if you're small like I am and you're sharing just to try it for the first time.  Definitely get here early because a line sure does build up quickly! We parked on the streets in the neighborhood ... not sure where else to park!"}
{"text":"So, Ive tried poutine several times now in Canada and I thought the fries and cheese curds were mediocre. I like my cheese curds in smaller balls, but this was like eating thin cheese sticks-hard and rubbery. The gravy was thin and taste like a watered down BBQ sauce. I ordered the Taquise Poutine which has tomato, guacamole, sour cream. It was ok. Its great that this place offers various styles and toppings of poutine but the ingredients are also mediocre.  A plus is that its open 24 hours, great for groups, and the outdoor courtyard seating is nice."}
{"text":"Très bonne bouffe, mais quelle foule, et le resto est trop bruyant!"}
{"text":"Aside from the lineups and tight-space, this place is THE tourist attraction to bring your visiting family and friends. You can skip the Big O."}
{"text":"As a tourist, I had never heard of this place before entering-I was just hungry and looking for some delicious poutine after spending some time in the parc. (It was 10 years ago, so it may not have had the same reputation)  Either way, this place cemented my love for poutine and has become a must-visit for me everytime I'm in the city. While it may seem like it takes forever when sitting down, I suspect this is simply illusion because waiting for poutine can feel torturous.   The variety of poutine dishes is amazing, and I've still yet to try them all. Either way, things you would not think should work do. Make a point to visit this mecca of gravy/curd/fries. If you're conscious about your health-well, you only live once, right?"}
{"text":"We are good tourists, so we needed to eat a poutine at La Banquise. We took a large one to share with bacon (CAN$13) - everyone is sharing large portions, it's way less expensive than ordering 2 small portions. We knew what to expect (aka not a culinary orgasm) but we were a bit disappointed - that poutine tasted... cheap.   We then (not the same day!) tried the chicken and chorizo poutine from Ma Poule Mouillée, and I would totally recommend going there rather than at La Banquise - fries are better, meat is better, sauce is better and cheese is better (do you see some kind of pattern here?)  So all in all, I understand the convenience of a 24/24 poutine spot, with plenty of poutine variations to choose from, but if you want a good poutine, there are better spots in Montreal..."}
{"text":"A couple of beers into a late night, a long day of travel and no dinner in my stomach, what seemed like an endless walk, and finally we were here. We got lucky and scored a table immediately, just seconds before the late night rush in this packed place. You could order hot dogs, if you want, but why would you want when you could order from endless varieties of poutine - even a vegetarian version. The servings are HUGE - order small and try to get it all in. French fries, gravy, squeeky cheese curds, the whole thing is a fatty wonderful mess meant, demanded, to be eaten with a fork and another cold beer. You know you want to."}
{"text":"My rating hovers between 3 and 4 stars. I would go back to La Banquise if I were in Montreal and really craving poutine (and not on a nightshade-free diet). A local friend recommended it as a go-to place, a \"thing to do,\" and it ended up being a fun, if extremely caloric experience.  As many have said, the line can get way long. We went on a Saturday around mid-morning and waited maybe 15-20 mins. for a 4-person table. The interior of the restaurant is cramped in a busy diner fashion, with bright colors, mosaics, and mirrors everywhere. There were groups of 20-somethings alongside families with kids, which made for a festive atmosphere.  The menu is crazy expansive, with many kinds of poutine alongside other breakfast and lunch fare, even salads, if you're not up for completely clogging your arteries. We wisely ordered just two small poutines for the table, alongside lighter lunches. One was le B.O.M. (bacon, onion, merguez sausage) -- intense! But we actually preferred the other, which was the vegan version of le Classique (just straight up gravy and cheese curds). It was flavorful and had a better balance. The sandwiches and salads we got outside of poutine were fine but unremarkable.  Would I come here on a regular basis for a snack on my own? Maybe not. But would I come here with a group of friends on the off occasion? As they might say in Montreal: Sure, bien sûr.  P.S. A hike up Mont Royal is the perfect post-poutine activity. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If you want to try poutine, you must come here. Endless options....gravy covered, cheese smothered, goodness. Ranging from spicy, to mild, to endless combinations (such as Mexican, or with bacon and Creme fresh and the list goes on). You come here and wait to be seated, once you do, they take your ordered and bring your meal. This is a must try to truly experience the goodness of poutine."}
{"text":"I give La Banquise a 4.5 out of 5 stars.   Despite how busy this place is even at 11 at night, we were seated quickly and got our food just as quickly.   Food is reasonably priced and delicious. They're known for their poutine so definitely order that when here. I don't think it's reasonable to order anything else besides that.   Overall, this poutine place trumps over all of the poutine places in Montreal. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the sour cream, onion, bacon and cheese one(and highly recommend), really good taste but just as every other poutine, cost people drinking a huge amount of water to help neutralize the gravy a bit hhh. Pretty good taste, finished the regular size all by myself. And really the large size is enough for two people to share."}
{"text":"It's good, but yes a little overpriced. I got La Rachel which has peppers and onions, so the poutine yasted like the best breakfast hash ever. Their cheese curds are fresh and salty tasting, and the gravy is not too salty and is a good light consistency. The atmosphere is funky and nice, but it is a bit of a wait (I went at around 2)."}
{"text":"Ok so I heard a lot of good things about La Banquise, like it is THE place to go and have a Poutine. I heard how crazy and crowded it can get when people start leaving the surrounding bars, craving for fat food.  AND SWEET GREASY LORD JESUS, fat it is.  I made the terrible mistake of ordering a large one and not the regular (cause you know, it's better when it's large) (I'm still talking about food here)   I had the T-Rex (Yes I saw the menu, T-Rex caught my eyes, and my choice was made, why would I check the other poutine when you have one called like that ?) It was a mix between a Poutine and a Meat Salad. You heard me  : A MEAT SALAD Like a Salad of meat. Without the healthy salad.  I would say it's the kind of dish absolutely amazing when you're drunk, because, ok, it's good, it's fat and you hate yourself so much when you finish it. I actually couldn't sleep all night because I was so full.  BUT this is clearly not the best Poutine I had so far, the fattest one, for sure.  Might try some other ones, and the regular one this time, thank you very much"}
{"text":"Amazing poutine! I even got to satisfy my craving with a vegan version. Long line ups, but definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"As a French person I came to Canada thinking it was an abomination of food, but I went because my friend wanted to try it and decided \"what the heck\" completely expecting disappointment, for it to be way too fatty, and flavorless, and heavy. I was wrong. I am reluctant to say that I have been converted and now approve. Well done Canada."}
{"text":"Always a good time. I highly. I repeat HIGHLY recommend the boogalou. Who knew pork + coleslaw + sour cream would be the formula to happiness? My friends didn't believe me. They got other options but quickly realized the error of their ways.   This spot is a staple \"you want poutine?\" Spot. It's also open 24 hrs a day.   With all great things however I get more critical when I expect it to be great. The friends aren't crispy. The wait times can be long sometimes. ... really... it's just that soggy fries trigger me.   Other than that! Great spot.   Boooooogalouuuuuuu"}
{"text":"I'm only giving La Banquise 2 stars instead of 1 because (A) I can tell it's an institution and I respect that and (B) it's entirely possible that I ordered poorly, which resulted in my lack-luster meal.  I came to Montreal specifically to have a solid meal of real Canadian poutine (I know Quebec City is supposed to have better poutine, but it's February and I'm not about that penguin life, ok?) La Banquise is cited by pretty much everyone as THE place to try poutine in Montreal. So off I went, stomach rumbling.  What a let-down. There's a line out the door that, while somewhat fast-moving, is jumbled and stressful. The menu is overwhelming, but I settled on the T-rex (poutine topped with ground beef, hot dogs, bacon, and some kind of sausage). It came out looking incredible, but tasting like nothing. How can a pile of so many meats be bland? Honestly! I had to drown it in Tabasco just to feel like I was experiencing something. (That's a sad sentence.)  I paid and left, feeling extremely disappointed. Did I really fly all the way from New York City to have shitty poutine? They serve up better poutine at Harlem Public or Jacob's Pickles in Manhattan! Luckily, Montreal's poutine reputation was redeemed by the AMAZING bowl of goodness being served up at Le Saloon Bistro Bar in the Gay Village. Got my fat girl noms ON at that place.  But La Banquise... man... I'm sorry, but I don't get it."}
{"text":"Okay.  I know I'll get some grief for this rating, but my heart may stop beating before you all read this anyway since they're clogged with poutine beyond repair.  I love greasy, cheesey, potatoey goodness more than mostly anyone you know.  But this was the place where they brought out my order (poutine with peppers, bacon, etc.) and it was so large and obscene, I almost lost my appetite, but tried to power through before giving up halfway in.  Maybe I should have come here drunk at 2:00am.  Almost certainly would be a 5-star place.  Food: 2/5 Value: 5/5 Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: 4/5"}
{"text":"Pretty much every person who recommended poutine to us told us to hit up La Banquise. It's definitely a popular place. We were there for Osheaga and saw a lot of festival people stopping in their for a dose of Montreal poutine!  The wait time is super long because this place is so popular. We didn't wait for a table but took our food to the park to eat instead. The staff are busy busy busy too. They all looked like they were working hard, which was nice to see. It did take us a while to order at the till though because they were all so busy. We waiting a while to get someones attention, but finally got it. My girlfriend ordered a regular poutine and I tried the mexican one with banana peppers for something a little different. I believe it was called the \"just for laughs\" or something.   These are huge poutines and they are heavy. You're definitely getting your money's worth here. They were really good too! I'm not really a poutine expert though so I don't have much to compare them to! They were yummy though! I would totally go here again and can see why people love it so much!  I also wanted to say that this restaurant is located next to the most beautiful La Fontaine Park. I would totally recommend going and sitting outside at the park to enjoy your poutine. It's just lovely."}
{"text":"It's an always open creative greasy spoon, popular with after hours crowds who are jonesing for late night eats. There aren't many 24/7 places, and this one is a Montreal staple. Personally, I'd rather eat a bag of Doritos."}
{"text":"La poutine de fin de soirée, peu importe la longueur de la file d'attente, elle fait du bien et permet de se ravitailler en plein milieu de la nuit...  Visite août 2011."}
{"text":"Very good Poutine! Lost of choices, and with very affordable prices! A must if you're visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"It took far too long, but I can now proudly say that I have been to La Banquise!  Located at 994 Rue Rachel East in the Plateau, La Banquise is perfect if you're a tourist coming to Montreal, or a Montreal resident who has not been to this restaurant yet.  Don't make the mistake I did- GO.  Right now.  It was absolutely delicious and perfect for a night out with friends.  It was almost a year ago when I posted about going to Lola Rosa with our friend Ruedi, who was visiting from Switzerland.  You've guessed it- we were able to spend more quality time with him and this time, my best friend Ali was able to come too!  None of us had ever been to La Banquise before so this was a great opportunity to go.  Haven't heard of La Banquise?  Well, it first opened its doors in 1968 and first served poutine in the 1980's.  When poutine was first added to the menu, they only offered two different kinds- the classic poutine and the italian poutine.  Fast forward to 2015, they offer no less than 30 types of poutine!  The restaurant which was originally a small ice cream shop, went through major renovations in 2006 to accommodate the growing amount of customers.  It is open 24 hours a day, which is great for those late night food cravings.  They also serve great breakfasts.  For now though, I'll talk about our experience.  When we first arrived, we saw quite a long line of people waiting to get in.   Of course, it was a good sign, especially since it was raining and people still wanted to wait.  It took about 20 minutes for us to get in but because of the good company I was in, it didn't feel long at all.  When you walk in, you get to glance at some of the poutines offered which they display all over the walls.   The venue is very bright and colorful.  You're in quite close vicinity to the other diners and the noise level does get pretty high because of everyone discussing the numerous meal possibilities.  It gets even harder to wait for your meal when you see your fellow diners receiving their delicious looking meals.  Even though I had looked at the menu earlier on in the day, it was still VERY difficult to choose.  We all ended up choosing different dishes so we could sample one another's poutines- which made making a decision just a tad bit easier.  Once we ordered, we were asked to pay right away, even before getting our meal.  It took less than twenty minutes to get our food and once we did- we barely said three words to each other because we were enjoying our meals so much.  Here is what we had:    Ruedi got the \"La Savoyarde\" poutine which is bacon, onions, swiss cheese & sour cream.  La Banquise also offers trios which consists of a burger, drink and fries.  However, you can replace the fries with a poutine and the soda with a beer of your choice. I don't know how anyone could resist the urge to replace the fries with a poutine... if you can do that, that is major willpower.  Ruedi chose the \"Costaud Burger\" - 2 patties, cheese, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, pickle, house sauce, all on a sesame seed burger bun.    Ali got a large \"La Matty\" poutine which has bacon, green peppers, mushrooms & onions.  As you can see, the portions are quite big and although we are chicks who love to eat and CAN eat quite a bit- it got to the point where even though we had been eating for almost fifteen minutes, it barely looked like we made a dent in the food.  The prices are definitely good for what you get.    John got the same burger as Ruedi, the Costaud Burger but for his poutine, he chose the \"L'Astérix\".  This poutine has smoked meat, mushrooms, sour cream & pepper sauce.   As for myself, I got \"La Banquise\" Burger, which has 1 patty, mushrooms, fried onions, swiss cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, spicy sauce, all on a sesame seed burger bun.  The poutine I chose (after much consideration) was \"La Reggae\" - ground beef, guacamole, diced tomatoes & hot peppers.  Absolutely delicious.  I will now either have to recreate this every time I make a poutine at home or come back to La Banquise because no poutine will ever compare to it.  I had a few bites of my burger, a ton of poutine and I got so full, I gladly took the rest home.  I definitely recommend this restaurant to any poutine lover.  They also have vegan options, healthy menus, kids menu and other assorted meals.  The food was so good, that I came home and ate most of my leftovers right away."}
{"text":"Went there last night for take out on a Wednesday around 2330! Lineup outside but it wasn't too long. Got the T-Rex poutine as I was told it was the most popular. In my opinion it was quite salty. But if you love a lot of meat on top of cheese, gravy, & fries then you might love it! The cheese curds were good."}
{"text":"This place is king for poutine in montreal. I love the various options and flavours. I still haven't had a chance to eat in because the lines are so atrocious...I might have to come in here for breakfast to avoid a long wait. I had the Taquise and Le Duleton each on separate occasions. Both are amazing poutines. I got them in large sizes to share with a friend. The large size is huge, so bring an appetite. These poutines are priced well for the amount served. My duleton in a large take out box was about $16. Only thing they could improve is adding more cheese curds."}
{"text":"Non, non et non ! Peut-on m'expliquer pourquoi cet endroit a autant de succès ? Je ne vois que l'ouverture 24h qui peut attirer les foules ici. Oui il y a un choix de poutines incroyable, oui le concept de \"poutine du moment\" est intéressant. Oui les poutines sont généreuses et bonnes dans l'ensemble. Mais le service ? Citons en vrac : - l'obligation de payer en avance pour le service du soir - les serveurs antipathiques - les hauts-parleurs qui crient de la musique au niveau des oreilles - les serveurs qui vous demandent de partir à peine la dernière bouchée ingurgitée - le temps d'attente incroyable Toutes mes expériences là-bas ont été catastrophiques.  La Banquise, je le recommande uniquement pour la vente à emporter la nuit. Eviter absolument le service sur place."}
{"text":"Best place for poutine experience. Lineup outside at 3am on Saturday nights :-)."}
{"text":"Brought the GF here for her first poutine dish and it was very good.  Next time, we will go to Au Pied de Cochon for their foie gras poutine.  Before I digress, we split the classic poutine and their gravy was dark, rich, and flavorful.  The fries were crisp while the cheese curds were gooey and delicious. I would recommend. Expect a wait. We had a drink across the street at the corner bar, and then went around 9PM without a long wait."}
{"text":"Perfection. The bond that brings all Montrealers together, English, French, White, Black, Chinese, Indian all ethnic origin. Poutine from the best place in the city. Pumping out perfection 24hr days (except on Christmas). Enjoy. I love the Taquise and Mexicain and the Traditional - you would be surprised how good fresh cut tomatoes are on a poutine."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I'm definitely not an expert when it comes to the \"best Poutine in town,\" I'm just visiting so what do I know.  With that said, it doesn't mean I haven't had my taste of frites, gravy and cheese curds - separately and together as one dish.  All in all, my rating for La Banquise is solely based on to the two dishes my companion and I ordered (Poutine Matty & Kamikaze).  Sure the frites were hot and crispy, the gravy warmed through and the ingredients by itself ok but the cheese curds were less than satisfying and the merguez (unlike any lamb sausage I've ever had and not in a good way).  I was not impressed.  What happened to the squeaky cheese curds I've read about in my reviews?  The ones I had were chunky, dry, hard and not warmed through by the hot gravy or fries.  Sad.  Thank goodness for the down-to-earth envi, local crowd, music and bearable prices."}
{"text":"Unless you're going there to eat a massive poutine with basically every ingredient that ever existed, I find their regular poutine to be quite average. The place is also really small and hot during the summer."}
{"text":"Busy place on a late Sunday afternoon.  Open 24h.  Heard it had some of the best poutine in Montreal.  We were not disappointed.  So many different choices of ingredients on top of the basic fries, cheese curds and gravy.  Sandwiches and burgers also available for those who go in a group and happen to not like poutine.  My wife ordered a cheese burger and enjoyed it.  Would have given this place a 5 star if not for service issues that day.  They messed up my friends order and did not correct it till reminded at least twice, by which time the rest of the table had finished eating.  Probably would not have repeated on another day.  They were very apologetic.  I would recommend this place for satisfying a poutine craving or to taste for the first time or after a night out on the bar scene."}
{"text":"To be fair, I'm not a fan of poutine as I love my fries crunchy and not soggy. Don't like gravy nor cheese curds.  I did like the variations that were available at La Banquise however.   The line up was ridiculous. We were there around 8:30pm or so. Thankfully it wasn't too cold out and the wait was approximately 30 mins. It was a bit odd as right after we ordered, the server told us we had to pay right away as it was after 9pm. I have never had to do that before! I honestly thought he was singling us out but another table beside us had to do the same thing. I guess they've had bad experiences in the past for those who leave without paying after a certain hour? We ended up tipping afterwards.  Got to try the smoke meat poutine. It was delish! I wouldn't mind coming back just for this one. The one I'd ordered (Elvis) was disappointing and it was a little on the salty side.  Price and value was amazing."}
{"text":"This was our second stop for poutine on a week long food vakay in Montreal. It was good, and I wish I had more room to stuff my face. It would have been perfect If I had been walking around all day and was slightly drunk and ready to fill up my tank, but I wasn't empty enough for that.   Classic savory poutine. Can't go wrong. AND it's a cross the street from a police station and a park, so there's plenty of safe lounging to do afterwards."}
{"text":"Ok kids. Lets be honest here - this is NOT the best poutine place in montreal.  What is it then? Well it's 24 hours and its a damn good place to come after the bar.  The poutine gravy could be better, and hotter. But what is amazing is the sheer choices - meet over meet over meat over veggie (oh yeah, those)  The portions are huge. The options are limitless.   My favourite is t-rex when i'm hammed.  So please do come here, but let's not call it the best poutine in montreal."}
{"text":"Meh, I've had many many many better poutines than this. This place is in the list of top restaurants on Yelp, but I guarantee that it's because a bunch of tourists have written about it. Locals don't come away from La Banquise going \"that was a great poutine\" - it just doesn't happen.  This place has a wide selection of ingredients to make your poutine with, but really there's only three you NEED in a fantastic poutine: fries, cheese curds, and gravy. Everything else is a gimmick. If you really really feel the need to 'choose your own adventure' go to one of the Poutineville restaurants - I've had much better food and service at their restaurants than here.  On top of it all, there's often a big queue to get in to this place, and in case you didn't read the rest of my review; It's just not worth it."}
{"text":"Great greasy spoon type place! HUGE portions at a reasonable price. Really enjoyed it. Everyone recommended it to us and we were not disappointed."}
{"text":"This is thee cutest place to have Poutine with a fun, hipster atmosphere. Apparently, word has caught on since there can be a long lineup that spills outside, but the Staff is efficient and keeps the line moving.   Two things to remember when you line up: there is an ATM right inside at the corner of the hall (immediately to your right through the front door). Convenient! The other, is that it's a very narrow space where you line up with no sitting room.   When my aunt and I got to the front of the line, we were given the option of inside or outside. You can consume alcohol inside but not out, so since were weren't, we opted for outside patio since it was sunset on the longest day of the year with a nice breeze!   Our waitress spoke broken English but my aunt spoke broken French so we got along just fine! I wish I knew the waitress' name, but she was also quite helpful in directing us to the nearest Metro station as we were purely on foot.   To the food: amazing!!! The menu is in both languages (yay) & I opted for the \"Trio\" of a delicious chicken burger (the veggie option was out of stock) and paid about $4 extra for authentic Poutine instead of regular French fries which I had been meaning to try all week. The combo included a soda as well and wow! My aunt and I were BLOWN AWAY and went to foodie heaven! The Poutine was perfectly gooey and the chicken burger had this amazing special sauce that had a sweet, mustardy taste to it that I've never had before. My only regret is that I live too far away to go back on a regular basis!   One last thought is how aesthetically pleasing the outdoor patio is. Strung lights across the top perimeter and cozy tables in a garden setting is perfect, particularly in warmer weather.   The interior definitely had a rock n roll bar/pub type atmosphere and everyone has having a great time.   A must-go if you're ever in Montreal. I know when I'm in town, I'm going straight to La Banquise!"}
{"text":"It was our first time trying poutine. It was also our last time. So much hype about poutine and everytone said go to la banquise. but it was soggy french fries covered in a sweetish gravy with salty cheese curds. HUH? Should we have been plastered to appreciate this novelty? Such a bummer, we paid our bill and left. Sadly, the most disappointing part of Montreal trip."}
{"text":"Poutine with steak, bacon, pork, hot dog, lots of mozza and plenty of gravy. Shared a regular with the finance and we didn t even finish, it was so heavy."}
{"text":"Tried this place again on another trip to Montreal. They have even fallen farther past my low rating before. STAY AWAY. Service people are rude and arrogant. Food sucks. And, now because the dollar is strong, they wouldn't accept my credit card and made up pay cash. Then wouldn't give an exchange rate with the cash. I guarantee you if it was the other way around and the CAD was worth more than the USD, they would apply the exchange rate! A bunch of crooks for sure! I would give a lower rating if I could.   Go to Poutineville instead and don't waste your time with these rude arrogant crooks!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to get Poutine!  I always get La taquise with hot peppers. So good! Guacamole, sour cream and tomatoes!    My one problem with this place is the plates they use for the small is too small, because they put huge portions on them. Total plus, unless you like mixing everything like I do.   I asked both waiters for the Poutine in a bigger bowl/plate  First guy said he'd just give me an under plate, when I asked specifically for a certain bowl (the one the large comes in) and then when it didn't come with an under plate I asked the girl who dropped it off for the bowl I wanted and she brought me a smaller plate.  I finally just said forget it, because all I wanted was not to make a mess on the table and to be able to mix my Poutine how I wanted.   It wasn't busy, why couldn't they just bring me the bowl I wanted instead of offering other plates. I could see it in sight, however it would of been rude to get it myself. Haha  Our waiter jean-Ralph Switched to English when I spoke English to him and he was very friendly and attentive.   I love this place and recommend it to every out of towner I meet!   This may sound like a diva move but I just wanted a bigger bowl!! lol"}
{"text":"very touristy place but worth it. we came around 3pm, and there was still a wait. there are heaters outside, so it wasn't as cold. we ordered a poutine under the special menu (with jalapeño popper, sour cream, corn, sausage, bacon, onions) and the traditional poutine (just cheese curds and gravy). the regular size is still huge portions, and the grande is HUGE (in a bowl). because it was so packed, service wasn't as good. but everyone is really friendly  THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH OR CANADIAN DEBIT so bring cash!!"}
{"text":"Meh, I've had better poutine in Van. Way too salty overall."}
{"text":"The location is funky, across the Police station.  The place packs locals as a revolving door, so get there early... They don't take credit cards, so bring cash - US or Canadian... As for Poutin... MORE CHOICES THAN YOU CAN SHAKE A STICK AT... Hearty, greasy, clog-your-arteries richness... a Montreal staple, where the young kids (ok, 20-30 college and young metabolic enhanced professionals) stuff their faces with GUSTO.  My son and hub shared a bacon ladden service as they also wiped out the 3/4 remaineder of mine..."}
{"text":"Love this place! This place offers one the best poutine made in town. Came here quite often, the food never comes bad and they are cheap too. Tried most of the menu and the are all good. Service is a bit inconsistent depending on who's working. Nevertheless its a good spot to hang out and chill with friends or family and enjoy good food."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the hype is. I've had better poutine from a food truck. Don't waste your time waiting in line."}
{"text":"Can definitely see this place is a destination--it was packed even at midnight on a Monday night! We ordered two different varieties to go (Classic and three meat) and both were absolutely delicious! Only thing to note is this place is CASH ONLY (CAD only)...so make sure you come prepared."}
{"text":"I got the classic in a regular, which was like a half size which is the size of a snack. If you are hungry I recommend the bigger size. This was my first poutine experience so I wanted it to be authentic and got the classic but wish I had gone with the specials.  It's cash only I believe.  Tip ** skip the long time and order to go walk about 50 ft over to the nice park and eat your poutine there."}
{"text":"This place is legendary and MTL would not be the same without it. The best poutines in the city, the long wait is always worth it."}
{"text":"My first poutine experience and it did not disappoint. We were seated quickly and the food came out fast and hot. The menu is extensive and allows you to create your own poutine. We had the Elvis and the pulled pork hot dogs both are bonkers. There was a large line when we went to leave so I'm guessing this place could get really busy. Definitely suggest it if you are looking for some class Canadian poutine"}
{"text":"I had pretty high expectations for La Banquise since it's so well known for its poutine, but was ultimately a little bit disappointed.   No wait on a Saturday near lunch for two- we had a nice patio seating until our waitress brought me an opened beer and said that she had forgotten their rule of no alcohol on the patio. She said we could either move inside or she could take the beer back, but the beer was already opened! We moved inside.   I joked about having gone without avocado for too long as a Californian, but it's true. I really, really missed guacamole, which led me to choose La Taquise- guacamole, sour cream and tomatoes. My sister got La Mart- hot dog, bacon and mushrooms. We thought they were both ok, and I was actually grossed out by the guacamole, which was more reminiscent of store-bought guacamole.   One thing that I give to them: their cheese curds were the squeakiest I've encountered so far during the trip, so definitely props for that.   Overall, 3/5."}
{"text":"If you like poutine and are in the neighborhood try this place. It's hip, fun and always busy. Beware of long line ups. Food features a variety of takes on poutine from classic to creative. Recommend the Mexican poutine. Reasonable prices for portion size. Also I personally really love their poutines."}
{"text":"I just love coming in at 4 in the morning for some poutine. Yep, flew in around midnight, hung out in the hotel for a bit and the very first thing I did was to get some poutine here.  Couple of things though...because this is Montreal...no alcohol after 3am which is bs, and I guess we pay ahead of time. Seemed appropriate, because when I was there, there was a scuffle and the police had to show up. Oh well, whatever.  Again, cash only or debit. These guys know how to make some good poutine. It's a tie between these guys and Poutineville. That's why I always go to both at least once every time I go to Montreal."}
{"text":"Went there to have a classic poutine but I couldn't resist the T-Rex :D I think it is the best dish I can have in Montreal (meat lover here). Good service, reasonbly priced and very very tasty dishes.  I will definitely repeat!"}
{"text":"Allez à la banquise le soir à votre sortie des night clubs, la poutine sera encore meilleure !!!"}
{"text":"Best poutine in Montreal!   If the weather is nice, get takeout and head over to Parc La Fontaine across the street.  The place is famous, so it's often crowded."}
{"text":"Seems like everyone in Montreal comes here! It's a great poutine place. I love the cheese in it! This is my first time eating poutine so it's a cool experience, judging by how busy it is, it must be good. Even though it's crowded and small, they are very accomodating to babies with strollers!"}
{"text":"La Banquise is known for their poutine. Dan and I walked there and walked right past it.  We sat outside in the back patio area.   The waiter took a while to take our order and once he did we ordered a small poutine to share. They had many variations and we chose the one with guac, tomatoes. It felt like it took FOREVER (said like the Sandlot) to receive one small order of poutine, which I thought was ridiculous.  I ventured off to the bathroom and that stunk like sewage. Yuck!! Tried to hold my breathe  Once we received the food we started nibbling away. It was ok not great. Sort of disappointing for the long wait and adventure to find the place. The cheese curds didn't taste as fresh, gravy ok, fries alright.  Next time in Montreal, we're going to venture out to other poutine places"}
{"text":"A local recommended this place to me for authentic poutine. It did not disappoint. We were lucky enough to come when there was no line (Wednesday at 11:30am), which apparently is unusual. Place was busy, but we were seated immediately. Waitstaff is attentive and bilingual (French and English). I ordered regular-sized La Classique. It was a very generous helping. It was delicious. I'd recommend if you like lots of potatoes and gravy and cheese curds. There were other variations on the menu, but I wanted to try the original first.   Heads up that this place only takes Canadian cash or Canadian debit cards. There is an ATM at the entrance where you can get cash. Also this place is open 24/7."}
{"text":"only 2 negative points: - it's a little far from my place :D no easy access by metro or bus.  -the Ventilation system does not work well. The food is awesome. One of the best choices you have after midnight."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have never been to Montreal, so we took the opportunity to have some poutine! When we first got there we had to wait in line for about 10-15 mins (definitely worth the wait). The place was packed, but the turnover was quick. We went a little overboard in terms of ordering. Even the waitress gave us the \"oh my gosh are you want all that?\" look. We just wanted to try so many things! My boyfriend had the t-Rex, which was meat galore-- ground beef, pepperoni, bacon & hot-dog sausage. He loved it. We of course shared a classic poutine, and I got the Reggae-- ground beef, guacamole, diced tomatoes & hot peppers. It was enjoyable, but I liked the classic poutine the best. The gravy was not salty at all, and the cheese curds were quite yummy. I also had the exquisite berries smoothie, which I didn't particularly love. It wasn't as sweet as I anticipated. I may have enjoyed the tropical one better. The service was fine despite the slight language barrier. I need to brush up on my French. If you visit Montreal, you must go! It's open 24 hrs!"}
{"text":"Yes it is worth the long line-up Saturday nights! But be ready for a very high-fat, mouthwatering, monster of a poutine... so being extremely hungry is key here!"}
{"text":"Just had the traditional breakfast, eggs were darkened with some mystery grey colour. I am assuming some tinxture from the grill or metal tools rubbed off. Not what i expect form this glorified resto even if it is a greasy spoon. Toast was hardly toasted. Plate was well garnished with I don't care."}
{"text":"We were recommended this place by a friend and it didn't disappoint. Our first poutine was great and delicious. The portion sizes were excellent. I also liked that the service was good but not overbearing and the server was happy to switch between French and English for our non-Francophone friend."}
{"text":"poutiiiiiiine.   Listen, you're never gonna get poutine that blows your socks off. You're gonna get poutine that makes you make weird orgasmic noises when you're 5 pints down, and you're going to eat it like a damn animal, and La Banquise is the place for that.   I went here at 4am once. Bless the serving staff who do the 4am shift."}
{"text":"Been living in Montreal my whole life and cannot for the life of me understand why people make such a big deal about this place. Tourists always ask me where to get a good poutine and my answer never involves la banquise, go here if you believe hype or for drunken post bar snacking but for a realistic Yelp review of food this place is below the \"good\" line and falls under Fad. - sorry"}
{"text":"Oh my. Mon dieu.   Ca c'est du bon. Du bon Poutine et certainement le meilleur de Montréal!   Je recommande pour tous les touristes, tous les montréalais et tous les citoyens de la terre!   Plus de 30 variétés de Poutine (moi non plus j'en croyais pas mes yeux au début mais j'ai vu de mes propres yeux)!!  J'avais la dalle mais c'est sur que j'avais les yeux plus grands que l'estomac quand j'étais pleine après le régulier alors que je pensais prendre la grande! Haha   Enjoy! ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent poutine!  Fun decor with tree branches hanging form the ceiling covered in lights and all the tables and walls are covered in interesting fun artwork.  This of course is just the start. What you're really here for is the delicious poutine.  The best thing I like about this place is the variety.  I was only in Montreal for a long weekend (4 days) and I came back here twice to consume the gravy soaked deliciousness as \"snacks\" and a break while I was out and about exploring the city.  A good starter is a traditional poutine with bacon, and a good \"not so traditional\" recommendation is La Folie, which comes with mushrooms, corn, sautéed red onions spicy sausage,bacon,sour cream, jalapeño popper & pepper sauce.  Its a bit spicy and busy, but a good blend of flavors.  The staff was super friendly and nice as well.  A must visit on your trip."}
{"text":"J'adore la banquise, c'est un classique pour la poutine. Ouvert 24h sur 24 tous les jours avec une terrasse à l'arrière pour l'été. Il y a au moins une dizaine de choix de poutine, je suis d'un ennui avec ma classique :D choix de burger, de hot dog et autres. Ce que j'aime bien faire c'est prendre le plat pour emporter et le déguster dans le parc LaFontaine avec mes amis, pique nique bien gras au menu!!!"}
{"text":"very good!  the Poutine (pepperoni, bacon and onion) was delish! the cheese was melted wonderfully. the gravy wasnt overly heavy. the fries were really really good too! music was a bit loud but no big deal! the onion was well sauted too! loved it :)  This is supposedly one of those \"must do\" places in Montreal, and I can see why. If I were sending a friend out for food in Montreal, especially on that side of town, I'd send them here!"}
{"text":"Well, the line was long but we were in the door and seated in their deafeningly loud dining room in 15 minutes flat. We watched all the tables around us turn over (people were seated, ordered, served, ate, paid and left) before complaining that our order had not yet been served after 30 minutes waiting. We didn't get the impression that our waitress even noticed, and she responded with an excuse about our order being complex (a salad, a regular poutine and a poutine with guacamole and sour cream on top). When we tasted the food our jaws dropped. Wow this was an impressive poutine. Definitely worth the wait. Their gravy is excellent, the guacamole was even above average and the salad was fresh. The only complaint about the food was that the curds weren't melted so there was something wrong with the temp. Perhaps our order sat unnoticed in the kitchen? Who knows. So if it weren't for the tepid curds and service, this would have 5 stars."}
{"text":"Know this: I am an American tourist who has never had poutine before this. That said, this place was so delicious. We had to wait in a line that went out the door, which I assumed was a good sign. It was extremely busy so it felt like the wait staff took a little while to notice we were there, but once noticed, service was friendly and fast as it could be for such a busy time of day.   There is a fun vibe to this place--I wanted to take one of the flower painted tables home with me.   They had beer, which is never a bad thing, and we immediately received warm tap water (why is all the tap water in Montreal warm?)   We ordered the T-rex and the Mexican (I forget what it is in French). Both were delightful. While the toppings were meaty and perfect, I actually found myself saying that a classic poutine would've been enough--it was that good. Portion size was enormous, but I'm not complaining.   Aside from the fact that *supposedly* better poutine exists in Montreal, I would absolutely come back here again."}
{"text":"Try the dish of Canada (surprisingly no sirop d'érable involved) 97 ways... Not quite that many, but there are variations that would please the ultimate carnivore.  Relatively quick and very, very filling."}
{"text":"Great poutine place; where I send all first-time visitors to Montreal that are looking for a tasty and unique poutine place!"}
{"text":"-Wait was short for 3am visit on a Saturday night. Sat in dining room which was busy but fun.  -Server was friendly and attentive  -Poutine was delicious  -Dairy free cheese available / vegan friendly -Open 24hrs (we went at 3am)"}
{"text":"If you love Montreal, and you love poutine why the hell haven't you been here yet?   One of the great things about this is it is opened 24h (who doesn't love that?) and it really is a great greasy spot for late late late night outs.   They have a huge section of poutines, and what's great is you can easily add on or remove certain ingredients. The more meat you get on your poutine, don't be too surprised if it tastes a bit salty. Overall, a really great home to poutine in Montreal."}
{"text":"This place was awesome although the lineup was pretty excessive, but I can't complain because it was New Years Day and everything else was closed."}
{"text":"Delicious outing with a lot of variety. Unfortunately they are SUPER rude to Americans. They allegedly don't accept American cards and only take Canadian debit and cash. There's no signage nor do they mention it prior you sitting and ordering. It's embarrassing that they brought our food and took it away without us paying first. We had a really rude waitress who was condescending and made us almost walk out. The only reason we stayed was because it was late and we paid for an uber to get here.   It's a risk if you want good food but extremely crappy service."}
{"text":"Est-ce une poutine? non, c'est une motte de frites graisseuse avec des condiments! Où est la sauce brune? C'est pas un frite sauce, encore moins de la poutine. Si au moins les frites étaient de qualités on pourrait apprécier. Le fromage, c'est pas du squick squick, on s'entend que c'est ordinaire."}
{"text":"Was recommended to visit this well known pouting place from a friend that is from Montreal. Definitely a restaurant that speaks for it's popularity. Upon arrival, there was a wait to be seated. We did go at lunch hour which made sense to the long line up. Not to long from our wait we were seated in one of the cozy corners of the dining areas. Ordered a tasty beer that I wish I remember the name of and one of the poutines. The pouting I ordered I should have considered the topping option as I was anticipating a hot poutine plate but with what I chose the poutine was served somewhat cold due to the excess amount of sour cream. I still enjoyed it and enjoyed it even more the next morning from the leftovers. The atmosphere was cool as the place a neat decor style of everything. Overall I would go again but order something different."}
{"text":"Among the most satisfying poutines we've had. Will fix your poutine craving for sure! Creative menu, including vegetarian friendly options."}
{"text":"La Banquise was my first exposure to \"real\" (aka not Trader Joe's frozen) poutine.  Let me preface this by saying that maybe my expectations were set too high as it was described to me by one of my travel companions as \"the best poutine ever\".  We decided to check it out after strolling around Parc Mont Royal the better part of the Sunday before Labour day.  The spot is certainly popular, there was a line about 30 people deep out the door.  The line moved quickly and we were seated inside 20 minutes.  That was the end of anything which might be described as \"quick\" as it was another good 10-15 minutes before our existence was even acknowledged by our server, who handed us menus, and it was another ten minutes before we saw her again.  The menu and beer list are extensive, with upwards of thirty different poutines from which to choose.  I opted for the \"la kamikaze\" with merguez sausage, hot peppers and tabasco.  I went with the regular size, because, you know, trying not to be your typical American glutton my second day in Montreal, and it was a more than adequate portion.  The merguez was unspectatular and tasted like a slightly spicy vienna sausage, the \"hot\" peppers were mild at best, and the tabasco, well let's be honest you can't eff up tabasco.  The fries were crispy and hot, the gravy was the perfect consistency and the cheese curds were, umm, curdy?  It was a filling meal for a reasonable, by Montreal standards, price.  In the end, an average experience when weighed against restaurants in most other cities, but in Montreal, a veritable foodies wet dream, it seems like La Banquise is thriving solely on past reputation, in other words, it felt a bit of a tourist trap."}
{"text":"This place has the best poutine in Montreal. A local friend of mine brought me here and it was the most mindmelting experience of my life. We got the ground beef and sausage poutines and I have to say that I have never had poutine as good as what I've had here. The environment is nice and I'd definitely suggest bringing any visitors to the city here."}
{"text":"Fitting that this was our first stop in Montréal.  Atmosphere: Huge! We came on a Friday night around 9pm, and the line was well out the door, however the line for eat in moves rather fast. We waited about 20 minutes before we were seated. It has a college-vibe - loud and young.  Food: Ordered the regular classic and la fred caillou. Regular classic is fries, cheese curds, and gravy. The Fred Caillou was gravy, fries, cheese curds, ground beef, two types of sausages, and smoked meat. The fries here are OUTSTANDING. Crispy and flavorful, I would get them alone next time. The classic was good, although the cheese curds were a bit more rubbery than what I'm accustomed to. The gravy is smooth an adds a good touch to the fries. The Fred Caillou is a meat lover's dream, however it is incredibly heavy. I enjoyed the spicy sausage though. They also have a nice variety of sodas and beers (I love you, lemoncocco)  Services: Canadian dollars or debit only. ATM in the front before you get seated. Service is friendly and quick and they make you pay first if you're eating after 9."}
{"text":"La Banquise aurait apparemment la réputation d'être le meilleur resto de poutine de Montréal. J'ai bien dit \"aurait apparemment\". Nous avons donc eu envie d'aller voir par nous même!  Malheureusement, ce fut encore un cas de \"réputation plus grande que nature\".  Sur place, nous constatons que l'endroit est minuscule. Les tables et les chaises sont petites, et notre table était sale, il y avait encore de la sauce dessus. J'ai moi-même pris un napkin pour essayer la table!   Cet endroit est très bien pour connaître les gens; mon voisin de table qui est un parfait étranger était à 10 cm de moi et je pouvais tout suivre de sa conversation avec son ami.  Après quelques minutes, la serveuse vient prendre la commande; j'opte pour une petite poutine à la sauce poivrée.  Le service est un peu long, mais les poutines arrivent finalement.  Les frites ne semblent pas très fraîches et sont un peu mordantes sous la dent, pas très bien cuites.  Le goût est bien, rien d'extraordinaire; j'ai connu des poutines meilleures ailleurs!  Ne voulant pas nous arrêter sur une note négative, nous décidons d'essayer les desserts. Ce ne fût pas vraiment un succès. Le pudding chômeur était sec et un peu granuleux sous la dent, et le gâteau triple chocolat goûtait un peu le congelé, on sentait parfaitement le goût de l'humidité de congélateur à chaque bouchée.  Alors que nous attendions l'addition, nous remarquons que le sol est bien sale.  Mais au moins la facture n'était pas très élevée, ca il faut bien leur donner!   Bref, au risque de péter la balloune à certaines personnes, le resto La Banquise n'est pas LE resto de poutine à Montréal pour les connaisseurs de poutine :)"}
{"text":"The place to go for poutine. They serve about a thousand different varieties, ranging from the classic curds n' gravy to more elaborate creations with things like smoked meat (corned beef) and guacamole.  I had the \"La Poivrée\", which is like the classic but with pepper sauce. It was darn tasty, but to me poutine is still just something to have in Canada; I'll never crave it elsewhere.  The clientele is a hearty mix of locals and tourists, and there's no shortage of photos or Instagram'ing going on at the tables. All in all it's a good experience, and a great place to go for those visiting Montréal for the first time."}
{"text":"Overall good vibe, nice outdoor seating area.  Poutine are really good poutine but fantastic hotdogs!  I never ever eat dogs, but this is one not to be passed up and comes in a nicely charred buttery bun."}
{"text":"This was my second time at La Banquise. I was dissappointed with my meal there a few years ago but I decided to give it another shot. This place, after all, is frequently acclaimed as the best poutine in Montreal.   I strongly disagree. While La Banquise certainly is a Montreal mainstay and a cultural hub, it is by no means the best poutine. In fact, I'd call it mediocre. The gravy tastes as if it were made from a powder. The fries are OK but they are a far cry from the Thrashers fries I devour by the handful along the east coast's boardwalks. My friend and I shared the chicken patty poutine. While a generous portion, the dish lacked star power. Topping the average poutine were two pieces of microwaved patty chicken. Like the kind you get in the supermarket frozen aisle. I was almost offended that anyone would call this place the best.   Banquise does share an impressive variety of poutines. But who cares? The cheese and gravy mask almost any flavor regardless. Skip La Banquise."}
{"text":"Every city has its drunk food specialty.  This is one of the best.  Be prepared for a line, and be prepared for it to be worth it.  Pricing is reasonable, portions are huge, and everything is delicious."}
{"text":"Poutine with delicious gravy and squeaky cheese curds *insert heart eye emoji*. Their servings are large (hubby and I were full after sharing a large).   They have many varieties of poutine. We had smoked meat on ours (we really wanted to be Canadian) and it was delicious and they were NOT stingy with the meat. The gravy was surprisingly less salty than expected and not too thick and not too thin. Cheese curds were satisfyingly squeaky.   There are two lines - right side is for dine-in and left side is for take-out.   Docked one star for absolutely disgusting bathrooms. It is worse than a portapotty and it seriously almost made me lose my recently eaten poutine. Usually not an issue, but it seriously needs to be addressed here."}
{"text":"Great reputation makes this a student favorite in the plateau.  Many different kinds of poutine,  apx.  Thirty or so with different toppings.  Food quality so-so at best,  unfortunately."}
{"text":"I used to find La Banquise flat out gross with greasy floppy fries, hard cheese and everything was just in a goop.  Went back last weekend, it wasn't as bad as it used to be. The cheese still doesn't melt but the fries are quite good now.  I'd come back after drinking but sober I'd go somewhere else"}
{"text":"A large easily feeds three people. We went with La Reggae and freaking loved it. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"On our final night up in Montreal, my friends and I decided to come here for dinner. There was a bit of a wait to get seated, as most of the locations we had researched had had, but the queue moved quicker than I had expected.  Once seated, service erred a bit on the sluggish side, which was frustrating, but we did see that the wait staff seemed to be short that particular evening. For the second night in a row, I decided to get another poutine dish. This time, I had opted to get the vegetarian sandwich (which, funnily enough, was located under the healthy options. I'm not sure how a sandwich with mayonnaise and fried eggs would belong under any healthy option menu, but it was there) and a side of their La Rachel poutine. My friends and I also shared a large salad, and I got a bottle of their namesake brew.  My thoughts on the meal? The sandwich was good, the poutine was tasty, (though, I thought the poutine was better at Poutineville), and the beer was fine. I can see why the place was so popular and I did like that they offered plenty of things aside from just poutine. Not a bad spot, and it seemed to be quite popular with the locals as well."}
{"text":"Friend recommended this as one of best spots to hit poutine. Loved it so much I came back twice in four days! Unless you are ready for feast mode, go for a regular size"}
{"text":"Went  there  last  week... Always  the best  poutine  in town.  On a down  side,  they  may  want  to add few more people  kn the staff  because  when  it's  busy,  the  staff  looks very  nervous..."}
{"text":"We had a 'La Taquise,' it was pretty delicious. It almost felt healthy. If you forget about the amount of fries and cheese you just ate. Lol. A small portion size was enough to share between two, just to satisfy the craving. We got lucky when we went, around 2pm, there was no line and were seated quickly. Would definitely recommend. Specially during/after a night of drinks, I think it would really hit the spot."}
{"text":"The Classic poutine is definitely a must-have!  Very tasty and a cool outdoor patio in the back. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a poutine from La Banquise. The portions are huge and one poutine is more than enough between two people.  Lines for this place are always long so be prepared to wait a bit. You can also take it to go which might be better option on the warmer days."}
{"text":"The poutine is delicious! There are many kinds to choose from. I got the T Rex. The food (because it's poutine) is super heavy, but it's worth it! There seems to always be a long line, so expect to have to wait a bit."}
{"text":"I can't believe I stood in line for 1 hour waiting for french fries. That's what I kept thinking when I stood in line. But I felt a bit better when I realized everyone around me spoke French, meaning they were most likely locals. At least I didn't stand in line at a tourist trap. When I finally got in, it was 9pm and I was starving. Ordered a La Matty and washed it down with a St. Ambroise. Not bad for my first encounter with poutine, but I couldn't finish it because the portion was too big (and I thought I have a healthy appetite for a girl). Better go with a bunch of friends who can keep you entertained in the line and share your food."}
{"text":"Finally got to go! I don't do long lines so I didn't get to go last time I was out here but this time we waited. I love poutine. Especially with bacon. And that's what we got. I think we got the bacon, hot dog and onion one. We also got a salad because you really should have something green when eating this stuff, and the one with avocado doesn't count.  The cheese was a bit squeaky but other than that I will definitely be back to try all the other variations. After all, isn't that why this place is so popular?"}
{"text":"Poutine is great and priced reasonably. Went there lunch time and the place is almost empty but still had a good time. I recommend getting the classic poutine or the ones with guacamole -for a fresh change.   Burgers are good too. plus, service is fast."}
{"text":"I never had poutine before so I didn't know what to expect coming here. We were seated right away. The menu is extensive and with all the poutine options it took awhile before deciding what to get. I choose green bell peppers, ground beef and onions for my pointine. Delicious! All the type of stuff I knew I would enjoy in my poutine. I barely finished it since it was so filling. My experience was great especially with the attentive staff. Even though it was so busy, the waitresses came to our table to ask if we needed anything. It's also a plus being open 24 hours. I think we even ate next to the table of Anthony Bourdain for his show. It made my dinner all the more memorable!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Montreal for the weekend, and they had never tried poutine. We found Resto La Banquise on yelp, and decided to give it a try. We went Sunday around lunchtime. The patio was full and mostly had tables for 2, so we sat indoors, which was really cute. I loved the decor and feel of the place.   We ordered 3 different poutines- original, hot dog, and beef/mushrooms/green peppers. We also ordered a hamburger and 2 side salads. The food took a really, really long time, and the service was also pretty slow in general. However, the wait was totally worth it! We ordered the regular poutine size, but they were BIG. None of us finished our plates. The burger was small but delicious and cheap, about $3.50. The side salads were pretty basic, but one of my friends didn't like the seasoning they used. The poutine was delicious. They mostly just throw the additional things (hot dogs, mushrooms, etc.) on top of the original poutine. I loved the hot dog poutine.  Definitely worth a trip if you're in search of some delicious poutine and a cute restaurant! When we left, there was quite a long line- so go early!"}
{"text":"Wow, death by poutine! No kidding. There's only starch and fat to be had here and it's so darn good you won't care.   We came for a late lunch and there was a short line but we got a seat within 20 mins. I had a small order of the T-Rex which had sausage, hot dog, ground beef, and bacon. Oh yea! And my friend had bacon, green peppers and mushrooms on hers. Both were really good and I can't believe I actually finished my plate! Of course, the local brews helped wash them down. :)"}
{"text":"Obsessed with this poutine. Best in Montreal. I always create my own: Classic gravy and cheese curds, sautéed onions and mushrooms, and green peas. I promise it's amazing."}
{"text":"Overrated. Not the best poutine in town, not by any stretch of the imagination. Service used to be all over the place, but I haven't been there lately. It's a place for hungry inebriated people, it's no better than that (and believe me, I know, I've been hungry and inebriated). Don't go sober, and don't go out of your way for La Banquise."}
{"text":"This is the most popular poutine place in Montreal. If you go on the weekend or late at night be prepared to wait in line."}
{"text":"I went here to meet some friends who were visiting at their suggestion (maybe they saw it had over 400 reviews on Yelp?) and was a bit disappointed.   Sure, you can get poutine almost any way you want, but the fries are not out of this world or anything and it's not like putting ingredients on top of a bed of fried potatoes is very difficult to prepare. Considering this place has so many positive reviews, I expected it to be pretty good, though was not even as tasty as poutine you get at a chain like Frite Alors!  Not to mention, once you load poutine up with all manner of things, is it really poutine anymore? I guess like pizza purists, who say only the Margherita is a true pizza, I think I have to agree that poutine is only poutine when it's classic - with gravy and cheese alone. Anything else is just poutine with crap on top.  I probably would never have gone here if it were not for the people who wanted to go there, and I definitely won't be back. I would give this place a lower rating if it weren't for the fact that you can get vegetarian classic style poutine.  Aside from the food which was only meh, it's super crowded in here! Many places in the city are cramped, but it was a little unbearable here."}
{"text":"Oh my God I'm a believer. As a skeptic of all things Canadian from \"eh?\" to \"aboot\", I came to Montreal prepared to hate poutine (though secretly feeling intrigued). I was staying at the Hilton Bonaventure and was feeling pretty lazy. No taxi, no one to go eat poutine with, no car, feeling comfy in my hotel bed, etc. However at the recommendation of a friend who had lived in montreal, I dragged myself out of bed, stomach growling, ready to take on the metro and the cold to get myself some food. I was surprised by Montreal on all accounts. The metro was clean and easy to get to, the weather was amazing for a November afternoon, and the poutine...was...one of the best fast food items I have ever had in my life. I got the one with black pepper sauce (a must get!), ground beef, onions, and mushrooms all smothered by a thick coat of gravy. Unhealthy? definitely. Finger-lickin' good? For sure. I finished 3/4 of the plate by myself...pretty impressive if I say so myself...and finished the remaining 1/4 after I got back to the hotel hours later. The black pepper sauce gave the gravy a spicy aftertaste which I loved. I tried regular poutine later and it was such a letdown. If you're in Montreal make a stop here. The poutine will make you fall in love with the city."}
{"text":"Great place for poutine! They have so many varieties that meet everyone's \"poutine\" needs. It may be one of the best poutine places in Montreal. If you haven't gone already it definitely should be in your list.   French: Ci vous a jamais aller au la banquise  tu devrais aller. La poutine es excellent et ils ont beaucoup de choix pour tout les different person."}
{"text":"For me, this is the most overated poutine in Montreal. Why is it so god damn popular?  It's open 24/7. There's a line-up almost all the time.  I was a bit disappointed. I wanted a Poutine with a cheeseburger. The poutine was good but my buddy had very little gravy and he wanted more. Our Burger were not good. Like burned buns. How complicated is it to make a burger? Not very much! Missing the easiest component   or not re-starting the bun was a downfall."}
{"text":"Le Banquise 24h is a staple of Montreal. Just like Schwartz's or Biftec, it's one of those places that you don't necessarily go to often, but that you never forget and always crave."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5 This place is located on Rue Rachel E and Avenue du Parc-La Fontaine. There was an insane linefor the dine-in side of the restaurant, so we opted for takeout instead.  [SERVICE] - 5/5 Staff on the takeout side were very quick and efficient. They gave us a buzzer to indicate when ourfood is ready. We wandered out of the restaurant for a few minutes, and our buzzer alreadyindicated our food was ready!  [DÉCOR] - 5/5 Small, intimate, and old Montreal vibes. The mismatching tables and chairs gave the place quite aunique personality.  [QUALITY] - 4/5 Generous portions with high-quality ingredients in every poutine!  [ORDER] - 4/5 Le Classique - $11.75: fries had a hint of sweetness to them, which gave them a unique flavourto balance the savoury gravy. Cheese curds had the perfect consistency and melted perfectlyon top of the fries and gravy.  [OVERALL] - 4/5 Personally, I like my fries just a little crunchier because the fries here were a little soggy. Butoverall, I think the gravy was not overly salty, and cheese curds mixed together to create aclose-to-perfect concoction. I would definitely recommend La Banquise for the classic Canadianpoutine!"}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars! I really do enjoy a good poutine, I'm talking about a regular cheese curd and gravy on fries poutine. This place is next level for any poutine lover.  When you first walk up and see the line-up, your first though is likely to be, nope... I'm not waiting in this line-up for a poutine. It was definitely my first thought but the group I was with was not in the mood to relocate and I'm grateful. Apparently there is always a line so don't walk away!   So this one hour looking line actually moved quick, we actually got a table in close to 20 minutes. Not bad, and they give you menus as you wait to you can decide on a meal.... so many choices.  I ended up getting a poutine called La Trois Viande, which as the name suggests is a poutine covered in 3 different meat (how could I not?). Ground beef, bacon, and pepperoni!!! I washed it down with a new beer for me called La Block. Both delicious. My group shared a Cesar salad and that was also insanely good.   I strongly encourage any poutine lover or anyone visiting montreal to hit this place up. I will be back when I'm in Montreal next."}
{"text":"Quick service but most importantly the best poutine you will find! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I went here in November 2015. The poutine lived up to the hype and was god tier. Highly recommend going when in Montreal."}
{"text":"2nd time i visited la banquise. I'm not a poutine fan so i will go with the facts. the 2 times I've been here they have been really consistent in terms of quality and service. the first time we stayed in because there was hardly a line up and 2nd time we got take out. my friend and i shared a large poutine and 18$ defintirly fed 2 people well. the gravy was hot, cheese curds were delicious! and heaps of toppings"}
{"text":"C'est bon, c'est même plus que bon.  La Banquise c'est l'oasis perdue dans les nuits folles de Montréal. C'est là que tu entend des gens de tout les styles parler fort de leur virée achevée.  Mais c'est surtout là qu'on trouve les poutines légendaires. Le genre de poutine que tu ne peux pas dire ''ma essayer ça à la maison !'' parce que c'est juste NON! Respect !  J'aime ma poutine avec des légumes dedans (comme si ça me pouvait vraiment changer quelque chose).  La Banquise fait honneur également à tout les québécois en proposant une poutine de ''qualité'' à nos chers touristes ! Quand tu reçoit des invités d'Europe, tu ne veux pas les amenés chez Valentine ! Faut leur montrer que même dans le gras, y a quelque chose de chez nous là dedans !"}
{"text":"Poutine and good beer. What a great combination!  On this rainy day, we stopped by La Banquise for Montreal's best poutine. Well, I mostly convinced my friends to go there, so I can taste all of their beer. Lol  Okay, so if you plan to drink, you can only sit inside. The law--what kinda law that needs another permit to allow ppl to drink outside of a building--won't allow you to enjoy nice food and beer on the patio with an awesome weather. Well, I guess we're stuck inside.   We ordered 2 regular orders of La Festival and La Matty. La Festival is a must try since it comes with pickled peppers. La Matty was good as well.   This place only takes cash. Why????"}
{"text":"Delicious poutine with enough variations to please any craving. I ordered the classic and my bf ordered the poutine with chopped sausages, bacon, and beef. Both were tasty, esp with the fresh green veggie salad we had on the side (hey, at least we tried to compensate for the plated heart attacks in front of us).    At the time we went (8ish pm on a Monday), there were lots of yuppies/college students around. Vibrant, energetic crowd."}
{"text":"First time to Montreal , first poutine experience.  That's what it is- an experience. we went on a Sunday for lunch this past weekend. Friends recommended this place as they had been there before.   It was packed, there was a line. they dont take reservations. it a great lunch/late night place.  not your fancy dinner type of place.  DO NOT MISS IT.  I got the Greek Poutine... it was amazing. it was like a greek salad with fries and gravy. I was hesitant as i just couldnt imagine how it could even taste good- but somehow- IT DOES!!!     i love the fact that they serve soda, right in the can, but with a straw! This just tickled me pink!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite Poutine place in Montreal. Home made fries, fresh cheese and gravy, this is by far THE place to go to when you want to try Poutine for the first time. The portions are pretty big, I always stick to the traditional one which is definitely enough for me. Add some meat if you're hungry !  Expect to wait if you go at night, but it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Poutine is a must-have while traveling in Montreal, and if you are vegetarian or vegan, the choices are often limited. I highly recommend a visit to this place as they have an option for everyone. They have a VERY impressive menu of unique and often unusual poutines (check their menu!).  I did not have time to dine in, so this obviously means I have to return. ;) I just got something to go, but I'm happy to say service was very friendly (and happily she spoke English as my French is poor), and my food came pretty quickly too. Now, here's the thing. This is not health food. French fries, smothered in gravy, covered in cheese (in my case, vegan cheese). Don't go here for fine dining or a healthy meal. This is bar food, but of excellent quality. Very well made, and delicious!  It's a must-try if you're a tourist in Quebec (as I was). And this place is open 24 hours so it's a great spot to hit after a night out."}
{"text":"4.5   Did you even visit Montreal if you didn't go to La Banquise?   It was a hot summer day, the hottest of the year so far in fact, and I ventured all the way to this plateau landmark for some delicious poutine. The storefront is old, but it's seems well maintained.   The place was packed despite it being 10 PM - apparently this place is always busy. I placed my order for takeout because the restaurant was full and also there was no AC inside...   On the day I went their fridge had broken down so they didn't have all the ingredients to make every type of poutine, but they had their basics and I just wanted the classic...they have vegan and vegetarian options which are made with mushroom gravy - and if you want vegan cheese curds they have that for an added price.   There is quite a bit of a wait to get the food - I would say at least 10-15 minutes, but it's well worth the wait. The poutine is prepared fresh and tastes amazing. The fries were crispy, the gravy was hefty and satisfying, and the cheese curds were salty and perfectly mixed together.   Definitely check out this place if you have time!"}
{"text":"This place is a 24 hour diner but the service was surprisingly slow around 1 p.m. (tail end of lunch hour).  There was plenty of hustle and bustle and action, but you had to literally make direct eye contact with a waitress and \"glamor\" them like a vampire before you got them to come over and take your order.  Just a heads up to those who expect service right away.  Then again, the lack of attention may be their style like some places that pride themselves on rudeness.  The poutine is basic (even though they boast 24 different varieties).  And I'd recommend sticking to the basic building blocks (fries, gravy, cheese curds) and maybe adding onions and ground beef because... Well, seriously, what isn't better with onions and ground beef?  Keep in mind that this is Montreal's version of the LA street taco, NY pizza, Chicago hot dog, or whatever other iconic local fast food you can think of and this is the best known place for it.  So even if you don't like it, don't say you don't like it to locals.  That's like telling an Italian that the Vatican is just another chapel or church.  That's a huge no-no.  Just smile, eat the dish for what it is.  French fries with gravy and cheese...nothing more, nothing less.  Maybe try a beer to go with it.  The local blondes are great...er...beer that is.  Remember, Poutine is a heavy dish so prepare yourself for it.  As in....don't have a heavy breakfast (which is hard to do when there are so many delicious pastry shops and croissants to be had).  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Decent food and really amazing atmosphere. Though, the hype created about this place makes you expect something beyond words and anything short of it comes as an underachiement.  The poutine? It's all about the poutine and the nice people you'll meet there! Ideal to go there on a week day to wait less in line"}
{"text":"The poutine here is some of the best in Montreal.  Open 24 hours the place is usually packed so there can sometimes be a wait for a table but it is worth it.  They have a vast selection of poutines to try so you can go for the traditional one (gravy and cheese curds only) or mix it up.  I'd suggest getting the small serving if you've never been before because usually it is more than enough to fill you up."}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal, I could not resist the urge to at least taste some of the world-renown poutine that the city has to offer.  After extensive Yelping, I decided on La Banquise for lunch. The poutine itself was very rich as it was drenched in gravy and loaded with sausage, bacon, mushrooms, and of course... CHEESE CURDS.   Although it was a little salty for my preferences, I enjoyed the meal. The fries were perfect and the bacon added a beautiful crunch. A must try!"}
{"text":"La Banquise has a big reputation to live up to.  I finally tried it last week.  I ordered the Obelix, my wife had the classic poutine.    I say - it's fun to have extra things on a poutine, but when it comes to their fries, cheese and gravy, la banquise is not the best.  They make a great poutine, but this place is not poutine mecca.    Go and enjoy their fancy poutines, and make sure you order one of the special ones.  Bring your extra wallet for la banquise's outrageous prices.  It's nice to experience this place once, maybe even twice...but Montreal has more to offer (like decarie hot-dog)!"}
{"text":"Beer and a butt-load of poutine. I'm not going to act like a poutine connoisseur, I live in Canada, I eat poutine- not regularly but whenever I want, La Banquise is the shit. You go, if you're lucky the line isn't too long, have a beer or two with your small or large poutine. I really like the B.O.M. because I really like Bacon, Onion and Mushrooms. Simple."}
{"text":"I went here after all the reviews and also recommendations by other people in Montreal but...I found it overrated. I got the small classic to go since it was pretty busy inside and there was a nice park across the street. The cheese curds are definitely super squeaky but almost a bit too rubbery and the gravy wasn't anything fantastic. Same with the average fries. Did I just order the wrong thing? I think I've had better poutine in Vancouver and Toronto..."}
{"text":"DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE LINE.   I almost left three times because of the bloody line but sticking it out was worth it. It actually moved pretty quickly and we were seated within 25minutes.   The tables are hand painted and the decor is something that would attract youthful souls who's greatest desire in life is to be considered \"cool\" by their peers (ps: as a teenaged girl i loved it)   The poutine options are bountiful and i highly suggest getting the option with sour cream to balance out the greasy gluttony that is their poutine.   Was great, and i'll probably end up bringing some of my friends here next time in an effort to seem like that member of the friend group who has a life outside of the friend group that includes doing things like eating poutine at cool restaurants and listening to obscure bands in even more obscure bars."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were staying at a hotel about 5 minutes away from La Banquise. Everytime we walked past - day or night - a long line of people would be snaking it's way from the door and spilling out onto the street. An investigation was in order. We got in line and took the time to look around and find out what we could about the place. The answer? Poutine, poutine, poutine. When we were finally seated, a menu with an impossibly long list of poutine variations was set before us. We ordered the classic and pizza poutines along with some local beer. The food arrived quickly and our poutine fest began. Fries drenched in gravy and topped with melting cheese curds... yum. The pizza poutine (classic poutine + green pepper + mushrooms + pepperoni) was good although I think I liked the classic better. There is already a lot going on with poutine, adding to it is unnecessary if you ask me. All in all I really enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"On y va entre amis à n'importe quelle heure de la journée... ou de la nuit! Grande variété de poutines bien sur mais aussi de burger, hot-dog et autres :) Ma préférence va à la Savoyarde! Terrasse a l'arrière l'été.  N'oubliez pas, on peut emporter sa commande et éviter la file dehors parfois bien longue! Petit hic, on ressort avec une odeur de friture parfois forte sur les vêtements!"}
{"text":"Came at like 3am(lol) no wait. This was our first time having poutine and went because everyone recommended. Three of us shared one large one! :) it was super yummy :)"}
{"text":"I knew what to expect from a quick dinner here. Nothing is fancy. You will not enjoy a quiet gastronomic experience. You will however have a taste of a Montreal favourite poutine. The service is quick and efficient and the towering poutine is served piping hot and topped with delicious gravy. I wouldn't recommend ordering dishes other than poutine. Although they are cheap, they're nothing special. Overall, this is a great restaurant to satisfy the weekly pouting craving."}
{"text":"The first time you go to La Banquise, you go nuts over their crazy variety of poutines. You soon realize you are simply ordering a classic poutine with great toppings. They are delicious and worth every penny, but there exists better poutines."}
{"text":"Amazing poutines. WAY TOO MUCH INGREDIENTS. lol. Not a bad thing. If your not from Montreal this place is a MUST VISIT."}
{"text":"Oh man, this isn't the first poutine I've ever had but it sure was best. The portions are huge and they have a large selection of different toppings. I went with my husband and we got two large servings (definitely only needed the regular) the classic and the matty (bacon, mushrooms, peppers and onions). Amazing. Cash only, and if you go at night be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Tout est extrêmement bon et frais. Passant de la poutine avec du guacamole à la poutine classique, le tout est bien mariée afin de faire de se plat un doux réconfort bien Quebecois. Lorsque je veux une poutine, c'est le seul endroit ou je vais."}
{"text":"Such a long list of things you can choose, and they're all delicious. Price is not too bad, and the perfect food to eat after a night out. The ONLY thing is that there is always a line, which makes sense, since it's always open and you can rely on the fact you will leave happy and full!"}
{"text":"Over hyped, rude, rushed service (which, given their popularity is okay and all, but I don't appreciate my order being taken, made to pay & tip before actually being served in any capacity & my plate being slammed down in front of me afterward)  Go to Pitarifique. Their cheese is fresh, their gravy is better, their fries are the same... and they have a dope philly cheesesteak poutine!"}
{"text":"This place is perfection. Needs to start a franchise and have them all over the place. Everything is delicious! Only complaint is that there's only one and its in the east end..   Have the Elvis poutine and thank me"}
{"text":"MMMMMM flavorful, smokey, cheesy, and generous. Worth the wait in line for me! Line spread across the sidewalk went by super fast, so don't be discouraged. Keep note that there is a line for take out and dine in, so line up accordingly to prevent wasting time!  Me girlfriends and I went on a Saturday night, we don'y speak very much french but contrary to other reviews, we had a very pleasant dining experience. We were seated in the outside patio and provided heat lamps so we were freezing out bums off.  We ordered the pulled pork poutine with coleslaw and sourcream. The fries were real potatoe tasting, soft enough to absorb all the gravy and juicy goodness. Cheese curds were large and plentiful. I got this one piece of fatty pulled pork and i couldn't contain the symphony of flavors in my mouth.  A must try! For sure, plus Vegan options available"}
{"text":"L'endroit n'est pas mal et la Poutine non plus, bien que je l'ai trouvé trop lourde et écoeurante à mon goût. La meilleure Poutine que j'ai mangé reste celle de Poutineville mais est totalement différente.  Toutefois la Banquise peut convenir aux affamés et propose une carte à des prix pas trop élevés."}
{"text":"Les poutines sont excellentes!!!!"}
{"text":"First time ever trying Poutine as this is a must try in Montreal.  Tried Resto La Banquise because of the ratings on Poutine.  Two of us give it a 4 star, and two gives it a 3 star.  We did not need to wait in line for a table.  The waitress was very friendly.  We did not receive the correct Poutine ordered, but the waitress fixed it immediately.  The gravy was just luke warm, but we really have no comparison as this was our first ever dish of Poutine.  We split a burger which was good, but it is a very small portion, although it is not very pricey.  So between the 4 of us for the first time Poutine eating, it probably rates a 3-1/2 star."}
{"text":"line was pretty short despite being like saturday at 2am. never get the vegan poutine! she is unfriendly and probably was bullied in middle school. it's just not worth it. the tables kind of offset that however. music can be unpredictable, going from audial treats to aggressive top pop hit attempts to mariachi within the same bite. most disturbingly was the couple, or trio of people next to us. a middle to lukewarm aged man and 2 asian women. i still do not know how they came to be. another mystery of the world i guess. the tables were great."}
{"text":"For our last stop in Montreal, both in this long-winding post and literally, I couldn't leave the city without trying the poutine and although we'd just eaten a filling breakfast at L'Avenue we made our way to La Banquise - what better than cheese curds, fresh frites, and gravy at 9am...or any time, 24/364?  While many in The States may not even be aware of what poutine is, the staple Montreal comfort food has apparently been around since the 1950's and featured prominently on most menus in the city in one way or another ($2 at Burger King, or $23 at APdC) I was told by no less than 5 people that La Banquise was where to get it - in one of no less than 30 varieties.  A seemingly small place from the outside but much larger within I found the restaurant without difficulty and entering the doors was greeted by a small line as the open prep kitchen stood to the right with seating on the left.  Given a few moments to make my selection from a menu on the wall or laminate version for dining in I was greeted in English and after placing the order plus a few minutes preparation time I emerged to the street with a Styrofoam clamshell of Poutine Classique.  Clocking in at $6.25 for what seemed to be about 6 pounds of food my first bite of the poutine more or less confirmed my thoughts about what good, classic gravy, fries, and cheese would taste like and while not as upscaled or refined other versions I'd tried in the past the words \"comfort food\" rang through with aplomb.  Rich, starchy, salty, and at times crisp while at others silky the gravy was simple yet perfectly seasoned with plenty savory and a touch of sweet while the cheese curds were presented squeaky fresh yet slightly melted from the heat of the crisp, yet somewhat oily fries.  A food no less comforting than mac n' cheese or spaghetti and meatballs this was one Montreal icon I could definitely embrace and with 30 options I'd gladly return on future visits...perhaps for a \"real\" breakfast, as they serve that (with a side dish of poutine) as well."}
{"text":"Out of this world-exceptional poutine. This is the most popular poutine joint in Montreal for good reason: the variety of toppings is astounding; the original is authentic and delicious. You can't go wrong here. Lines are nuts though for eat in and take out alike."}
{"text":"Over-hyped for absolutely nothing. The poutines are so-so and the service is definitely lacking. Came around 2am, only half of the restaurant was open and even that made us wait 40 minutes for two small poutines.  I would try Poutine Ville next time!"}
{"text":"Quoi de mieux qu'une bonne poutine qui vient de la banquise comme snack lorsque l'on sort d'un bar à 3 heures du matin ! Le service est rapide et bon, malgrès le fait que le restaurant soit bondé de gens. Cependant la file d'attente à l'extérieur du restaurant, quoi qu'elle ne soit pas trop longue, m'énerve un peu. Attention aux oreilles sensibles qui n'aimeront pas le bruit ;-)"}
{"text":"Un des resto les plus populaires À mtl, la Poutine est bonne si tu est jamais été dans un resto de Poutine. (c'est un must). C'est une ambiance de fast food mais acceptable. 7/10"}
{"text":"Poutine heaven! I advise you to get the small version unless you are sharing. It's very big. I couldn't finish a small poutine by myself and my husband almost died trying to eat the large one. We were left with a lot of wasted poutine. The gravy is amazing and the potatoes fries, cheese curds and vegetable/meat ratio is perfection. I don't think you can go wrong with whatever poutine you select here. Just amazing."}
{"text":"Came all the way from Toronto just to have this famous poutine and boy I was not disappointed!!  I ordered the Montreal Smoked meat poutine. Let's start with the meat - tasted just like its supposed to and with very little fat. The gravy was silky, savoury and complimented everything on the plate. There were so many cheese curds! Just the way I like it! And the fries were crispy and handcut.   The service was quick and I liked how we had to pay when we ordered so we didn't have to wait for the bill once we were finished our poutine. I wanted to go back for late night eats the next night but I got out ruled by my group. They don't understand what it's like to be a poutine-holic and find your favourite place that's 5h away from home.   I will come back the next time I am in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I go to Canada atleast once a year, and I've never tried poutine. I figured I would finally try it in the heart of Montreal. I thought if I tried the real stuff, that way I would know what's it supposed to taste like?? Omg it is disgusting!!!! Have you ever eaten cheese that made squeaky sound?? Well, I can now say, yes I have. It does not taste good. The fries were filled with oil and drenched in gravy topped with squeaky cheese. My review is solely base on Poutine since this place is known to be the best. If this is the best, I don't think I'll ever have poutine again in my life."}
{"text":"Best Poutine restaurant in my opinion. Everything is great about the place, the food, the service, the atmosphere... the only thing is sometimes there's a major line-up out the door... but, I guess it's that good of a place."}
{"text":"This was some fine poutine. We arrived at just before 6pm on a Monday and were seated almost immediately. For dinner, we got the Reggae and the Classique, both were delicious, but particularly the Reggae stood out as *lifechangingpoutine*, with the combo of guac, tomatoes, and the sauce. Highly recommended anytime one is in Montreal. As a proud product of the Midwestern United States, I like to think I know a good cheese curd, and these were they; you can feel them squeaking against your teeth as you bite down.   Prices were reasonable, waitresses were friendly, and the beer was good. Definitely worth a stop- or 10."}
{"text":"Poutine is ok. Fries can be dry & soggy. Overall this restaurant is overrated! All the hype is basically the varieties being offered and the fact they are open 24/7. You can def find much better tasting poutine elsewhere"}
{"text":"La seule pouting que j'ai mangé au Canada ! Ce n'est pas mon plat préféré mais celle que j'ai mangé était très copieuse pour la petite taille et excellente. Possible de manger dehors mais pas d'y boire de l'alcool. Serveuses sympathiques, prix bas."}
{"text":"First time. We choose to share a large poutine. We choose one that included guacamole, sour cream and tomato. Best poutine i've eating recently"}
{"text":"24 hour poutine?!?! This is brilliant!! Everyone needs to be able to get poutine any time of the day. It's 4 am, it's poutine time. It's 9 am, it's poutine time. 5pm you say, oh yeah that's poutine time.   Obviously the poutine here is amazing. You can't go wrong with anything you pick.   And try some the local and in house beer while you wait for that poutine."}
{"text":"My favourite spot for vegetarian poutine I would say. I love poutine and I will always be ready for poutine. I can take only vegetarian poutine so this is the best poutine I had had with vegetarian poutine so far."}
{"text":"If you're in Montreal, this is the place to try for poutine. There will be a line no matter the time, but it goes quick. Prices are good, portions are large. Get the classic poutine, though it's tempting to get others."}
{"text":"Poutine any day, any time, any way. Sometimes you just need a poutine at 4am.  And when I need a poutine (topped with hot peppers and pogos) at 4am La Banquise is my place! A Montreal institution. I love it! They have over 50 poutines and are always gracious enough to customize your order. The possibilities are endless! A fun thing to do is to take the food to go and eat in the Park Lafontaine next door."}
{"text":"Profil : Végétarienne dont la seule évocation des mots \"fastfood\" ou \"gras\" donne de l'urticaire. Etude de cas : La banquise. Avis : Wow, c'est bon !  Description : Les frites n'en ont certes que la forme (aucun croustillant), mais elles sont délicieuses, tendres, sucrées et surtout pas grasses ! Le fromage est onctueux en bouche et chose rare pour une poutine (selon moi), il ne goûte pas le plastique.  Prix : des portions énormes pour des prix tous doux ! Recommandations : lieu idéal après une grosse soirée ou pour se remettre du grand froid !"}
{"text":"24/24h  Beaucoup de monde suivant l'heure . Mais la poutine vaut le coup d'attendre . Top 3 des meilleures poutines   de l'île!"}
{"text":"There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said. A must stop in Montreal -- amazing poutine!! So many varieties to choose from, you can't go wrong. I have dreams of this stuff.... I wish we had it more than once. Plan to wait, to either sit or for takeout (ours took over 20 min), and bring cash."}
{"text":"They've got great food and an unbeatable atmosphere. However, the queue can be quite significant on busy nights."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenominal poutine!  Such a choice of creative toppings.  I had steak, mushrooms and green peppers on mine.  Massive portions.  The regular is do-able but not easy for all ;) ... I recommend having a salad to be sure to get some greens in ya with this one.  The only one I didn't like of those I tried is what they call sausage is more like hot dog, so avoid that one and you're golden like the bed of fries under your deliciousness. There is always a line ... this place is packed.  Not Scwartz crazy line ... but it is a fav of many at about 3-5am and tends to get pretty social too :-)."}
{"text":"I love this fun, young, quirky place! Wish I could see this place during the nighttime as I'm sure this is THE SPOT.  I tried coming here twice. The first time, the line was out the door and almost filled half the block. The second time was during the afternoon and there was no line (yay!). Service was prompt and portion sizes were good. But two criticisms: the menu is not placed in a very central spot and also there was not English verison of the menu. I would venture and say that this is tourist central...so why not offer an English menu? One last criticism: their gravy is not flavorful. The vegetarian gravy, surprisingly, was much more flavorful. Whoa."}
{"text":"Un incontournable à Montréal avec une énorme sélection de poutine. La poutine est une recette facile à rater et plusieurs propriétaires de restaurants du Québec et d'ailleurs dans le monde devraient être en prison pour avoir raté une fierté nationale. La Banquise à réussis à respecter la recette originale avec juste suffisamment de sauce pour pas noyer les frittes, beaucoup de fromages et des excellentes frittes. Bien entendu il a une sélection de poutine pour plusieurs goûts. Essayé la T-rex si vous avez une faim d'ours."}
{"text":"Returned to La Banquise on Friday night, wait, technically Saturday morning.  My friends and I had the small Classic, T-Rex, and Poivre.   The classic is the best that I've had so far.  The T-Rex was way too salty with all its smoke meat.  The poivre (pepper as in salt & pepper pepper) sauce didn't go as well with the frites as good old gravy does.  It's best not to diverge.  The Italian sauce isn't as good as gravy either.   Though La Banquise's poutine isn't other worldly, it's still the best that I've tried in Montreal.  One cab driver was trying to convince me that the poutine at Costco there was good too.  Somehow, I'm skeptical."}
{"text":"Vegetarian poutine.  I asked for the veggie gravy on the side, since I'm not much of a gravy fan.  It was all very good.  I split a gigantic portion with my girlfriend and we were super stuffed.  Good stuff here, probably even better if you're a meat eater."}
{"text":"Had to have poutine if in Canada.  My plans got a little messy, so I ended making the trip down to this area after a hockey game at Bell Centre - a day before leaving town.  Great type of food to grab after catching a game in the city and country where hockey is equivalent to oxygen.  From Bell Centre, it's about a 10 minute metro to the Mont Royal station, and then a 15 minute or so walk down St. Denis and through Rue Rachel.  There are a few pubs and bars lining St. Denis, and so it's not so vacant or unsafe.  Rue Rachel itself is a bit sparse and has a few alleyways weaved in, but I saw many girls riding their bikes or taking a jog - so I figure, the natives know it's safe enough to do so.  Just try to avoid walking down the side streets.  Stick to St. Denis - because google maps preferred I take a side street.  Google maps does not know that a side-street at 11pm is not ideal for a girl who is a wimp.    Ok, back to the poutine!  I got in, and they seated me right away, although it was quite busy throughout the restaurant.  I believe they advertise it as cash only, but the table next to mine paid by credit or debit card.  Either way, have cash.  The menu is extensive with toppings you can get, and I went with the one where it's like the original but with ground beef and grilled onions added (hey, I wanted some added protein).  When they take your order, you also pay at the table.  Then they will place your order.  I think mine was around $8?  For the small, and although I'm a big eater and was hungry at the time, I was barely able to put a dent into that monstrosity.    They're pretty quick to bring the food.  The fries are dark and crispy, and medium-thickness, and probably not my favorite type of french fry.  The gravy was not anything special.. and was sort of goopy in a jelly-like way.  The cheese curds were very good, but I'm a newbie with cheese curds.  They had a generous portion of large and small chunks.  The ground beef was very tasty and not salty at all.  I picked the cheese curds and the ground beef/onions, and ate some of the fries with ketchup because the gravy was not too flavorful or appealing.    Nice service.. nothing wow and nothing horrible.  I would probably choose a different place to try poutine next time, if only to compare.  It's a must try though, wherever you decide to get it!"}
{"text":"Been there twice. Poutine is good. First time had to wait 20 minutes for the line on Saturday at 3am, the second time was no lineup and instant on Sunday evening."}
{"text":"About as good as Poutine gets however... Service is reasonable. Prices - fair. Selection - great. Burgers (yes, burgers) - very good."}
{"text":"The restaurant was busy but we were seated quickly. The waitstaff was friendly. It was very noisy but that's to be expected at such a busy place. Don't expect to have a private conversation here, especially with the communal seating. The food itself was very good, the cheese curds were excellent as well as the fries. Be warned, however, it's extremely unhealthy stuff. It felt like I was putting poison in my body with every bite, I probably gained 3 pounds from this meal. If you are a local, eat here, but only do it once a year."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try since we were in the area. It had a lot of great reviews. As soon as we walked in we were warmly greeting by the staff and was quickly seated (we came at a good time). The service was great and the food came out fast. I ordered the banquet burger as well as the Rachel poutine.  The burger was on the smaller size but for that price ($4.90) it was understandable. The poutine was not as good as I thought it would of been. The poutines I've had in Toronto are much better. The gravy was just a bit under warm which made the cheese curds still hard and cold. I much rather have my cheese curds warm and melted in.  Good place if your in the area and want something quick to eat.  Pro: open 24 hrs.  Con: main dish (poutine) didn't measure up"}
{"text":"Got there around 5pm, very good speciality Poutine! Just heads up the \"regular\" size is already pretty big. Unless really hungry I think one regular poutine is enough for two girls. When we head out around 6:30pm the line up was already quite long"}
{"text":"To come to Montreal without eating Poutine is pointless and a waste!  A wee bit of a tourist spot mingled with locals dining on sizable heapings of poutine.  With a variety like theirs, it's very difficult to choose only one plate. No reservations here, so just make sure to come and line up.  Luckily, the seating area is fairly large, so even on a busy evening, anticipate a worthy wait.    We got the L'Asterix which was topped with delectable smoked meats and a peppercorn gravy.  Delicious without any doubts this is THE POUTINE spot.  If you could only eat poutine once, this is the place."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the hype is about this place. Is it because it's open 24 hours?  They have a large menu?  I tried it twice. Both times the flavor was meh and super greasy.    The weird thing is that there happens to be a place across the street with, what I think, is one of the best poutines in the city.    Take a picture in front of Banquise and head over to Ma Poule Mouille"}
{"text":"This place had the best poutine we had in Montreal.  Crisp, potatoey fries, rich brown gravy, and gooey melted cheese curds.  And, if the traditional poutine isn't for you, they had an entire menu of various inventive takes on this delicious dish.  Around lunchtime, there was a huge line around the corner, so we waited until late afternoon and got in with only a short wait.  Recommended, but go hungry!"}
{"text":"Le grand classique Québécois par excellence, la poutine !  Venant du pays de la gastronomie, un plat comprenant des frites, de la sauce à la viande et du \"fromage\" (un semblant de mozza sans goût et un peu salé qui fait \"schcrouik schcrouik\" dans la bouche) peut faire vraiment PEUR !  Et bien non. Bien que ce ne soit pas le met le plus délicat et goûteux au monde, c'est à essayer, c'est surprenant, et la banquise est l'endroit où en manger !!  La banquise c'est \"THE PLACE TO BE\" de la poutine à Montréal. Un large choix de poutine, de la plus basique à la plus \"carnivore\" (viande hachée, oignons, merguez...) il y en a pour tous les goûts ! Et le petit bonus, c'est que la banquise est ouverte très très tard ! Avis aux noctambules de fin de soirée qui ont l'estomac qui crie famine. Vous vous coucherez repus et satisfaits !"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of french fries, but not of the gravy sauce. The mix of those two, even with cheese? Eh...- That was my first impression of poutines. I didn't have much expectation for the food and I actually love, loved one! Poutine is worth to try, and if it is, here is the place. La Banquise is not simply the tourist spot- you must try, it's worth a visit.   Good for night out with beer. I'd recommend ordering some beer and salads too. It's good but could be greasy so needs some refresh. Also, the portion is large (or even though you think it's not, it's hard to finish all). So you may not need to order many like one plate per person."}
{"text":"I'm picky when it comes to french fries.  I wouldn't call myself a snob, but I do like them cooked a certain way - golden brown and salty, with crispy edges and soft (almost soggy) centers.  So when I read that Canada's national dish was basically a plate for french fries smothered in gravy and cheese curds, I got admittedly excited.  And on the last day of my 4-day visit, I headed over to La Banquise for what's considered to be the best Poutine in town.    I walked in around 3:00pm and the place was as packed as if it were peak lunch or dinner time. Lucky for me though, there was no line and I was seated immediately.  The interior of the restaurant is cheerful and warm, with walls and seats painted in bright yellows, oranges and blues, exposed brick and artificial grass in some parts, and a ceiling covered in branches.  There's also a nice little terrace in the back.  The restaurant is lively with a wait staff that actually appear to like their job.  The wonderful smell of fried-something was everywhere.    The menu is a laminated book with an entire page dedicated to poutine. And there are a LOT of choices: the hot dog poutine topped with pieces of hot dog; the mexican with hot peppers, tomatoes, and black olives; the T-Rex with the ground beef, pepperoni, bacon and hot dog combo.  Apparently you can get pretty creative with this dish.  Somewhere in Montreal there is apparently even a restaurant that serves poutine with lobster meat.    But since it was my first try, I decided to go simple and order the classic - fries, cheese curds, and the Canadian version of \"BBQ sauce\" (AKA, gravy).  The fries were perfect - the cut, the color, the texture with the crispy edges and the semi-sogginess from the gravy.  And the squeaky cheese in the center, nice and solid.  The gravy was thin and just enough.  It was all delicious and for 6.25, a great value for your money."}
{"text":"I've been to this place few times and tasted different poutines.  It's almost always filled with tourists and locals and on some occasions you may have to wait in line to be seated. I'm not the poutine expert, but I enjoyed most of the dishes I tried there. The only dish I disliked was onion rings, definitely overcooked.  My verdict? It may not be the best poutine resto in Montreal, but definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This was my second time there and the Poutine is truly quite good, is it the best I've had, not really that was up in Quebec City at Chez Ashton, who would have believed it. La Banguise is a more than a respectable vendor of this classic French Canadian dish of  french fries, cheese curds smothered in gravy. The beer offering is commendable and this is a place worthy of a stop, there is nothing more satisfying than Poutine, especially when it is cold outside."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing poutine. Young hipster atmosphere. And very busy. So get there early. We had the Matty and ate triple what we should have because we couldn't let it go to waste."}
{"text":"Might be a bit overrated. Their menu is extensive but I'd stick to their poutines.  Since it's a very renowned establishment among locals and tourists alike, there's almost always a lineup outside, and depending on the time of day, it will take a long time to be seated. Then, you'll have to wait until your order is taken, and food is served, which is also a lengthy process.   The positives: very cheap food, good atmosphere, and you can tell people you went to La Banquise.  The down side: it takes a long time to get your food, the food is just meh."}
{"text":"The poutine is delicious. The service is fast even though it is always busy. There are a lot of options that you can sample if you go wit a large group. The regular portion is huge for me so I had to share with my friend. A regular poutine and a salad are enough for two people if you want to keep exploring the local cuisine nearby."}
{"text":"We spent literally months of fantasizing about poutine.  Dreaming of what would adorn our french fries once we finally had the opportunity to gorge.  We walked to Banquise from Vieux Montreal.  We were starving.  We told our super-sweet server we wanted what was most popular.  She suggested the T-Rex for my husband (poutine topped with hot dogs, bacon, ground beef, and seemingly every other meat under the sun) and the Taquise for me (basically Mexican nacho toppings sans ground beef).  We stuffed ourselves, all the while pondering whether the flavor legitimated the calorie intake.  Did it?  I'm not so sure.  But I'm glad we tried it.  And I'm glad we tried it here--the mecca of poutine.  The next time we indulge again, we'll prep ourselves with a serious night of drinking beforehand.  We're convinced gravy and cheese curd laden french fries could cure even the worst hangover..."}
{"text":"Went to Montreal for a spring break and heard poutine was a must try. There's no better place to have your first poutine than one of the most popular places in the city, La Banquise. When we arrived the line to get seated was out the door. We waited about 40 minutes or so to get seated. There were tons of poutines to choose from. The service was pretty quick as well. I tried the La Carnival poutine over the classic. It was very tasty but could definitely tell my stomach was going to hurt after. The prices were decent but kind of pricy if you think about it as paying that much just for French fries. But overall, this was probably the best place to try my first poutine!"}
{"text":"Great poutine. Vast selection of different toppings. Service was great. Lines were huge outside though."}
{"text":"My very first experience with poutine, and I am hooked!  I will say that I liked the original better than the one with bacon (which is unheard of, for me), but there you have it.  I'm pretty lucky that I don't live anywhere near here.  Cash Only."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had poutine and without doubt fell in love with it. They had the best poutine and I also liked their veggie burger. Restaurant was welcoming, the hostess was good and the audience were too good."}
{"text":"This was my first and so far only \"poutinerie\" experience. On a recent trip, we were looking up best poutines in Montreal and came by this spot, which was the perfect stopping point for a final meal before calling it a night after perhaps a few too many pubs.   The line was long so we split up our large group and we were quickly sat at a table for four. I admire the service here. This place is taking on the worst possible customer base in the wee hours of the morning, drunk folks looking for greasy food is no easy task. But our orders were quickly taken and the food miraculous arrived minutes later, so no complaints there.  We got a classic poutine and one with mushrooms and peppers, which was too much food between the four of us as they come in generous portions. But the cheese was squeaky, the gravy was delicious, and we had no complaints. I later tried a ground beef and sausage poutine my other friends had, but it was too many flavors and by no means did I expect take away poutine to be nearly as good as fresh out of the fryer poutine.   All in all, a solid spot, and one I might return to on a future visit!"}
{"text":"Great service, love their Montreal steak burger. There was no line during the time I went (around 2:30). However, the gravy is a little to salty. We ordered a t-rex routine, lots of meat (hot dog, bacon, ham, ground beef), the taste doesn't really go together, but the fries were nice and sweet and delicious cheese!"}
{"text":"24/7 poutine, all kinds of poutine. What more can you ask? La Banquise is easily one of the best poutine spot in Montreal, if not the best. The only con would be that they only accept cash. I have only tried the Pogo Poutine so far, which was asolute bliss."}
{"text":"Great choices of poutine. We have had the original and the vegeterian, the vegetarian is so savory and good that you want to have more."}
{"text":"I'd like to begin by saying that La Banquise is the epitome of a lunch bag letdown. Firstly, it seems to be packed all the time, so be prepared to wait in line for what seems like forever. The restaurant itself is a lot smaller than I thought, and not the cleanest. The way the tables are arranged is also a bit awkward and I felt like my party was dining with the party next to us. Additionally, be prepared to speak loudly because it's impossible to hear anything over the loud music and other people's conversations.   The menu has a huge poutine variety, and there are even options for people with food restrictions and/ or allergies. I opted for fries with the vegan gravy. I was extremely disappointed. The fries were soggy and had an off taste. The gravy was okay. I will mention that I felt ill about an hour after I finished. The prices are also reasonable. Something I'd like to mention is that our server's behaviour was bizarre. He kept howling and/ or singing at the top of his lungs, which was interesting. Finally, you can't pay with credit, so make sure you have debit or cash on you.  Overall, I think La Banquise is extremely overrated. I would suggest Poutineville for those looking for good poutine."}
{"text":"I came to La Banquise under pretty much universal recommendation for my first poutine. Indeed, the poutine was good (if a plate of French fries with condiments can ever be called good) and the environment was very much made of locals.   The line upon arrival was long, but it moved fast enough. I was slightly put off by the fact that it's cash only and they only accept Canadian debit cards (weird). If you want to come here for lunch, don't forget to get cash first!   As far as the portions, the small is actually pretty large since it's fries. I couldn't even finish it, and I'm used to large American portions of everything.   Overall, it was worth it just to say I tried a plate of poutine. I'm probably never going to have it again but I would recommend this place if you want to try the dish."}
{"text":"A decent poutine place with so many options!  Flaws however is that we sometimes were handed cold fries and the prices are higher than other poutine places because it's a 'touristic' spot. The poutine itself is nothing special and it's not my favourite place but if you're hungry at 4 am and around the area, La Banquise will deliver"}
{"text":"Waited about an hour in line to dine in and it was so worth it. Got the Boogalou - pulled pork, coleslaw and sour cream poutine. I was starving while waiting in line so I got the large. I barely made a dent in it before taking the rest back to the hotel to munch on throughout the night. This was the best poutine I've ever had. Going to grab some takeout to accompany me on the ride home."}
{"text":"Had the classic poutine.  My boyfriend had the trex.  They were both sooo good.  We got the regular size but neither of us could finish.  They are pretty good sizes.  The wait wasn't too long, but it was definitely busy.  I ordered mushrooms with my classic poutine which they forgot but it was okay.  They brought me a little dish of mushrooms when we reminded them.  Overall a really good experience.  Also tried the Mystique cider, which I had never had before.  It was very good."}
{"text":"This place makes me want to go back and detract stars from other places where I've had poutine (but I'm a nice person, so I won't do that.) BUT the poutine here really put others to shame. They have LOTS of options, you are certain to find one that suits your fancy. I had one with guacamole and tomatoes and honestly could have had a large size instead of the regular. The hot dogs also looked awesome although I didn't try one. I can't wait until our next trip to Montreal so I can try out a different poutine concoction!   This place is known for a reason, and you shouldn't be skeptical...go go go!"}
{"text":"Un must à Montréal! La taquise est définitivement la meilleure poutine que j'ai mangé et j'adore le fait qu'ils aillent des options végés! De plus, c'est ouvert 24/24h, le service est toujours rapide et courtois et ils ont une petite terasse très charmante! Super bon rapport qualité/prix!"}
{"text":"Amazing Savoyarde and Elvis poutine. We were told by our hotel that this was the best place in town for poutine, and it was very popular amongst the locals. Definitely recommend trying it if you're looking for a staple Canadian dish!"}
{"text":"Really really great Poutine. I highly recommend the La Taquise. It's excellent. Good service as well, but go early because it does get crowded."}
{"text":"What you expect of a Poutine restaurant. The food is nice maybe a bit too crowded and noisy but definitely something to try once."}
{"text":"So I don't normally write reviews but this was a particularly memorable experience at Montreal's best poutine place. The line to get in was ridiculously long but that was to be expected, however what was ridiculous is that after we got in it took at least an hour after we ordered to get our food. The tables that came significantly after as for their food and were finished before we got our food. When I used the card machine even it seemed to be refusing to work with me and jammed my receipt. The poutine was delicious though we got the la reggae but the cheese sticks we got were missing cheese filling... I wanted to love it here but I just couldn't. Not trying to be unreasonable but we weren't offered an apology or explanation of any kind."}
{"text":"Nice try! And i am so happy that from now on, I start loving Poutine! That's really something amazing as I came here for almost one year but unfortunately I don't get used to this kind of soggy French fries, so...  anyway, this time I ordered la taquine topping with guacamole sour cream and tomatoes. To my surprise, it doesn't taste greasy, it's super great! I am so happy I love it!"}
{"text":"I could just eat all the squeaky cheese curds while I was sharing an order of poutine with my friends at late night.  I never got to pick which type but all I care about if there would be cheese curds?  We did it again! Seems it became an ritual whenever I am in Montreal.  But I never been inside the actual store and always have take out and haven't yet pick what to order.   Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"So, I've never had poutine before. I've also never been to Canada until my husband and I finally decided to spend a few days in Montreal together (his second visit, and yes he's at least had poutine). I knew that I had to try all of the regional specialties, and with poutine up at the top of the list wanted to make sure that where I tried it was goooooood.   Yelp to the rescue (as usual)! The list of places that popped up had Resto La Banquise as number 1, so with that decision made we bookmarked its location and after a loooong day of walking around and exploring, found ourselves standing behind a local family who had come there for dinner as well. It's usually a good sign if a restaurant is already 1/3 full when its on the early side of dinner time, and there are so many locals and local families dining there. We were seated immediately (and by the time we left, a line had formed) and quickly looked through the long list of poutine creations.  I had to try the classic as my first taste, but we wanted to try something else and opted for the Kamikaze since SPICY is my middle name. We got regular sized plates, which were still huge! Piled with french fries, topped with cheese curds slathered in gravy (and in the case of the Kamikaze, slices of hot peppers, onions, and merguez sausage), they seemed monstrous in size - and then a guy next to us received his LARGE order o_O  Both were tasty, but we couldn't finish either of them. By the time we were stuffed full, it honestly looked like we had barely touched either of them. I've certainly had better gravy, and the fries themselves were pretty good but not amazing (I wish they had been crispier on the outside given the gooeyness of the gravy). Its a very cute place, VERY family friendly, and clearly popular. Prices aren't terrible - IF you know what you're getting yourself into. Glad I came and tried poutine...and now I don't have to again. My stomach should thank me."}
{"text":"La réputation de la banquise n'est plus à faire... Une bonne poutine avec le guacamole soignera toujours mes hangovers ;)"}
{"text":"If you're in Montreal, you have to come here or you're doing yourself a disservice.  I'm not a huge poutine fan, never was....so when my cousins decided to drag me here at 12 am one night, I tagged along because I didn't want to piss on their parade, so to speak. And lemme tell you, this was probably the best decision I ever made or will make in my life! I ordered the vegan poutine and it was so amazing! The place was packed even at 12 am on a weekday. You know a restaurant is going to be great when there's still a huge lineup at 12:30 am  Our waitress was super nice and the service was very good! Would definitely recommend this place to all my friends"}
{"text":"This place is popular. We got there around midnight, and there're still lines for both dine in and take out. The lines are still there after we got our food. We got la classique (classic), la rachel (vegetable), and la T-Rex(meat). These are one of the most popular ones ordered there. I have to say all taste very good. They totally changed my thinking of poutine. A regular size dish is big enough for one person as it's kind of heavy. They take cash or debit card only."}
{"text":"Very famous and popular routine shop. We ordered 3 Amigo poutine which contains three kinds of  sausages. Large quantities and tasty"}
{"text":"Ugh. La Banquise. Cool concept, I'll give them that. Open 24/7 and serves a variety of our popular quebecois meal; poutine. Like I said, great concept... but it doesn't deliver. I've had poutine there 3 times, was disappointed each and every time. There are sooooo many other places in Montreal where you can get tasty poutine. Unless you want to wait an hour for a mediocre meal- don't do it."}
{"text":"If youre in Montreal, you must try poutine and you must go to this place. I've had poutine before and heard that this was the spot for the best poutine so we stopped in. We came during the weekday and got lucky there was no line, but we drove by on a weekend and man the line was insane. If you do have to wait in line, it's worth the wait. The portions are large so just get the regular, unless you're sharing. They have the classic which is fantastic. The curds were perfect and I like the gravy they use. My husband made a point to note that the fries on their own were good and the layers of flavors made it all perfect. They have great combinations for their poutine, flavors I never would've thought would work together but they did. Service was quick and there is also the option for take out."}
{"text":"When in Rome is what poutine is here in Quebec and Montreal especially. I found this place while watching Uncle Anthony on The Layover. This place is legit if you want poutine and different variations of it.  The wait and line sometimes varies, but if you go after the clubs get out, you an expect a line down the block. We actually went in the morning right before our trek back to Buffalo..  We didn't try the original but we opted for ones that I thought I might like and were more my taste buds. We got three plates total and we didn't even finish the ones we got ourselves, it was ALOT of food! Honestly most of it tasted the same because of the fries and gravy are all the same and the topping is what makes it different. The gravy and grease from the fries sometimes over power the toppings you had but you know your in for a good taste when you feel your arteries start to clog. Also the service was amazing and very friendly!  I will for sure be coming back to this place when im in Montreal again."}
{"text":"La place mythique pour déguster sa Premiere Poutine, peu importe l'heure la place est pleine de grand gourmands comme moi !   Gros coup de cur pour la petite (pas petite du tout) Poutine avec du guacamole, si vous êtes un petit porc comme moi, foncez"}
{"text":"By far the best poutine I've ever had and probably the most delicious food I had during my trip to Montreal. There was a long line, but it moved pretty quick. Since it was just two of us we got to cut a few big groups in line.   I got the \"La Mart\". Hot dogs on poutine sounds gross, but it was fantastic. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The service is a bit slow, but very decent for a busy place. However, while this place has a variety of poutine, the basic poutine itself is mediocre. While the gravy is smooth but not overpowering, the cheese curds are not fresh (definitely not squeaky or even melt in your mouth), while the fries were okay. Overall, I don't mind the hype, but I feel like their poutine could be far better. Poutine score: 2.9/5"}
{"text":"At 5am after a long night La Banquise is definetaly the spot!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  This is the best place for Poutine! I had Le Kamikazi It really was awesome, the Elvis is great too. Also, this place is 24 hours!  NOTE: They ONLY take Canadian Debit and Cash"}
{"text":"We ordered the vegetarian poutine, Bec cola made of organic soda and sweetened with maple syrup and beer. This place deserves more than 5 stars. I just loved the food, the vibe, everything this place had to offer. I will definitely try to come back again. The best part, they have plenty of vegan options too"}
{"text":"Omg so delicious! I got poutine with guacamole and sour cream. It was fantastic! If I am going back to montreal, I will defiently stop by this place again."}
{"text":"If you're in MTL, you should def pop by this spot at least once... although they have burgers and other menu items, they are known for their outrageous poutines (just take a look at their menu!!!) I had a ridiculous one that had 4 different kinds of meat on it. There are two sizes - regular and large. I ordered the regular, and THANK GOD I did!! It was monstrous! I'm scared to even find out how big the large actually is.   Contrary to my initial impression, this is actually a sit down restaurant with plenty of tables and booths. The atmosphere looks like a diner, with many comic book references plastered throughout.  Service was not bad, but nothing mind blowing.  For hearty, guilty pleasure food - this is your spot! But be patient, there's often a line :)"}
{"text":"The best place for poutine. Huge portions of meat, fries and cheese. Couldn't finish it, I took the rest home. Bring cash as they dont take card."}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time since I saw they had great reviews for their poutine. They have a list of all the kinds of poutine you could imagine. There was 4 of us, so we ordered 2 large poutine dishes. It was sooo enormous, we couldn't even finish. Dont get me wrong. I really wanted to finish it, but it was a lot! You get your moneys worth.  They had both indoor and outdoor seating. I couldn't tell if the indoor had ac so we decided to sit outside. Their outdoor seating was cute but small. I felt pretty hot sitting outside. Luckily, I was distracted by my poutine! The service was good, but not excellent. They also sold some craft beers. Overall, I think it was well worth the visit.  Would recommend this place to friends next time!"}
{"text":"3.5 to be exact.  I'll round up for these HUGE portions.  Oh... my... poutine.. this place is crazy with their portions.  One of the staple busy places that you can go for Poutine, La Banquise is definitely a great \"bang for your buck\" place.  Keep in mind that this place is generally busy and will definitely have a wait during peak hours even with the decent amount of tables inside.  If you are not willing to wait, there is a park nearby so I would suggest taking it to go and eating outside at the park benches or have a poutine picnic if it is a nice day!  Just to keep in mind, the sizes here are very generous.  I could not finish a regular size, and I saw the large size which is would fill a large to-go container to the brim.  I got the La-T-Rex, which had steak, pepperoni, bacon, and hot dog sausage, with gravy and fries of course.  The fries here are not crispy to begin with so as you are eating, the fries just get soggier and soggier.  My personal preference would be to have crispier fries as they are drenched in gravy.  I think a smaller option would have been better for me.    Next time I come here, I would likely try to get a regular meal with fries on the side and turn them to poutine (for $3).  FYI: This place takes only Canadian debit cards, for foreigners bring that cash!  They do have an ATM inside if you forget."}
{"text":"I love the fact that not only they make extreme tasty poutine you can even get it with vegetarian and even vegan sauce (although tofu instead of cheese is not the real thing). Defiantly a place you need to add to your bucket list."}
{"text":"When visiting Montreal, we had to stop by here to get some authentic poutine! We got the La Bacon and a hot dog fully loaded with cheese and bacon. (Clearly not on a diet lol) this was DELICIOUS! I am still thinking about the poutine days later. No other poutine compares to this. Amazing!"}
{"text":"If you want to experience Montreal poutine in all it's fat and glory, this is definitely the go to place of the city. It's open 24/7 and when we went around midnight it was still super busy and we had to wait in line for quite a bit. But it wasn't a boring wait, so I didn't mind. The atmosphere was loud and upbeat and everyone seemed to be enjoying their night and anxiously waiting for their poutine. We got the regular size which is decent sized and I have no idea how so many couples got the large and managed to finish it. (Such as the couple next to us). It perplexes and amazes me. Anyway the poutine was great (as expected) and I especially loved the fresh chunks of cheese curds. My only complaint is that the fries were weak and puny (can you describe fries like that..), or we just got the bottom of the stash. Overall great great place to get your Montreal poutine fix, ha."}
{"text":"I've always heard that Quebecois poutine was where it's at. La Banquise, however, is not where it's at. It's pretty standard, alright poutine. We ordered the smoked meat poutine; the meat was good, the gravy was okay but overly salty (even for poutine), the curds had no squeak whatsoever :( Their La Banquise brewed blonde beer was pretty good though!  I wouldn't come back here for poutine. The wait was short (~15 minutes), but this place does not live up to any hype at all."}
{"text":"C'était malaaaaaaaaaaade  Excusez moi mon enthousiasme, mais c'était une première pour moi et je n'ai pas été deçu bien au contraire. Le 24/24h est une idée ingénieuse  J'y suis allée un mardi soir vers 0h, il n'y avait pas grand monde donc on a été vite servi :)   L'accueil est vraiment chaleureux et les prix abordables pour la ration qu'il y aura dans ton assiette. J'ai choisi la Reggae sans piments forts et c'était vraiment délicieux, la guacamole (super bien préparé) apaise l'effet so fat de la poutine. J'ai apprécié aussi le fait qu'on puisse remplacer des ingrédients qu'on n'aime pas, etc.   Le seul petit bémol c'est que toutes les saucisses, merguez contiennent du porc, c'est vraiment dommage pour ceux qui ont des restrictions mais malgré tout je suis vraiment heureuse que ce restaurant honore aussi bien une spécialité québécoise."}
{"text":"This was a must stop on my trip to Montreal. I had heard of this restaurant from the travel shows on Food Network and from some friends that had traveled to Montreal.    When we went the restaurant was packed, but eventually after fifteen minutes or so we got a table and ordered. My friend ordered the T-REX and I had the poutine bacon.  This was a great stop for us as we filled up on great poutine and then headed off to do more sightseeing.    A must stop for anyone in Montreal."}
{"text":"Poutine: Great when it is fresh, absolutely disgusting looking and heavy after a 20 minute bike ride back to your house.  I came here to top off my 24 hour tour of Montreal before heading back home to NYC on the Amtrak Adirondack (an experience best left untried, in my opinion.) I decided I could not leave Montreal without tasting Poutine. So after getting a bit lost on my Bixi bike I finally ended up at la Banquise at about 10pm on a Sunday night. As expected, it was fairly packed, and I did have to wait about 30 minutes between getting there and actually being able to tuck in to my poutine.  I have to say that most poutine places in NYC do not get the cheese curds right. They are usually an afterthought and sometimes they just kind of chuck them in from a prep bowl that sits out all day (I'm looking at you, Pommes Frites in St. Mark's Place). This place does. But you cannot avoid what happens to them if you let them get cold.  So, it was AWESOME... until I got full. I decided to burn some calories off by biking back to the hostel but by then the whole thing was a congealed mess. I ended up having to chuck it, having no one else to pawn it off on.  Moral of the story. Eat excellent poutine here and make sure you eat it on site. Do not take it to go!!!"}
{"text":"Apparently they have the best poutine in town. If you are new to this, I would go for the original poutine - fries with cheese curds, smothered with yummy gravy. If you want add a kick, try their different variations with merguez sausage, beef etc. Yes, it's a recipe to heart attack but it's oh soo good! The atmosphere inside is cosy and if the weather is nice, definitely check out the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Typically, while I hate to admit it, I eat like a bird. PIcking here and there and going back for more later if I feel like it, getting full easily. But when my boyfriend saw me eating the poutine from La Banquise, he said he had never seen such a beautiful sight.... maybe those weren't his exact words..... but whatever the poutine is killer and I ate more then him and that says a lot right there."}
{"text":"I give poutine as a whole just one star. It's revolting and amazing at the same time.  However, this place is known for the quality and variety of their poutine. It was busy, but they were fast. Portions were generous for the price. Don't order the large; you won't finish it.  This place is also in a good and fashionable neighborhood. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The best poutine place! Me and my bf were looking around for some 24hr poutine place and we didn't even know that this very popular place was just right around the corner near the neighbourhood where my bf was staying (he was on vacation) we weren't expecting anything good because we just wanted to find a place where we can eat poutine and because he's never tried them before, I personally don't like poutine however this restaurant, I will definitely go for!"}
{"text":"TWENTY. FOUR. HOUR. POUTINE.  Need I say more?  La Banquise is known to be rowdy, which is why it made sense that there were two bouncers stationed out front when we went.  We were a group of 6 and it just took a few minutes to be seated inside (there's also a backyard).  Among us, we ordered the Classique, the Bacon and the Smoked Meat. Smoked Meat was probably my favorite, but they were all equal parts artery-clogging and delicious. Perfect drunk food, as evidenced by the full tables everywhere.  Beware - the portions are pretty large, even if you get the smaller dish. So bring a friend... or 5.  They also offer fries and gravy as a side, because why the hell not?  Also tried one of the beers - a Microbrasserie Alchimiste IPA, which was one of the worst attempts of beer I've ever tried. Seriously, avoid at all costs.  Other than that, La Banquise is a great time."}
{"text":"Je n'ai pas l'habitude de manger de poutine comme repas, mais après quelques verres, il m'arrive d'avoir une rage de fast-food! Je suis donc allée à La Banquise après quelques cocktails. Mes attentes étaient pas mal hautes mais je savais que j'allais simplement manger une poutine et non un repas de haute gastronomie. Toutefois, je n'ai pas été impressionnée. Le service a été très bien même si on était une gang assez bruyante - merci à la serveuse pour sa patience! Les poutines étaient bonnes aussi, mais simplement pas aussi spéciales que ce à quoi je m'attendais. J'ai voulu essayer quelque chose de différent donc j'ai pris une poutine avec la sauce poivrée mais je l'ai trouvé très fade et pas du tout épicée. Je dirais que c'est le manque de \"kick\" de ma poutine qui me porte à dire seulement \"pas mal\" après mon expérience de ce fameux restaurant iconique de Montréal."}
{"text":"Being from Toronto, and used to Toronto poutines with melty (usually shredded) cheese, this review may be biased.  After a 20 minute wait in the cold, this place is small, nice atmosphere (very upbeat staff), good and fast service. There was something in our water, however they replaced it immediately with a fresh pitcher. The menu was quite vast with variations of dressing a poutine. We all got different flavours, such as a the kamikaze, matty, hotdog, pizza etc. The toppings were all fresh and tasty however, the poutine itself as a whole was fairly disappointing. This could be because of the cheese curds, as they were firm and cold and not soft and gooey-(what we're used to and enjoy) The cheese squeaked in our teeth which is apparently what good cheese on poutine is supposed to be like, however it wasn't our cup of tea. The gravy was good, nice rich, dark gravy, however the fries were mediocre."}
{"text":"Decided to get some take out poutine. A friend recommended this place and I promise you it does not disappoint. I ordered the famous T-Rex and I can't emphasize enough how much meat is on this Poutine. Also the size is extremely large for a large portion, this can definitely be shared between two people. This poutine tastes amazing and it's a generous helping of one of Montreal's delicacies."}
{"text":"Poutine!  Is this a UNESCO World Heritage site?  It's a miracle they limit themselves to acting as a poutine Mecca with only this one location.  In preparing to visit Montreal I had researched poutine and encountered La Banquise in the Fodor's guide, on numerous blogs, and on Yelp. However it was the reco from my Montrealer tour guide that sealed the deal for me setting on La Banquise as a destination.  I ordered and recommend Le Miam which has ground beef and merguez sausage along with the classic gravy. However I kind of wish I tried the classic or T-Rex.   If you are visiting its worth the wait for a manger (eat in) to drum up your anticipation, however it is much (much, much) quicker to order it a emporter (to go). There are two (2) separate lines. The day we went the a manger line was 15 minutes wait outside to enter the 15-20 minute wait inside to get a table. The emporter line allowed you to walk immediately up to the register.  I've only known about poutine for 5 or 6 years. Must have been living under a culinary rock. Tried it for the first time in Canada on trip to Toronto in 2010. I think a few restaurants have put it on the menu I'm the U.S. However nothing previous compares to my experience at La Banquise."}
{"text":"I've done the Chicago dogs, the Charelston fried chicken, the Texas tacos, and many a New York slice of za, but this poutine may be one of the greatest food trademarks I have ever tasted. Fries, gravy, and cheese curds (plus exotic topping improv including meat and peppers) made the most delicious dinner after a day of traversing the city - knocking me off my very sore feet.  At first thought, you would think it's too easy: lard on top of lard under lard = tasty.   But, it really is so much more. Any nacho jockey can throw batches of saturated fats together in a grease sauce and call it a specialty. But, at risk of sounding like a pretentious foodie, the taste is actually rather complex: smokey and salty, crispy and saucy, and oh so cheesy.   If you go to Montreal and miss this place, you should be forced to donate the $10 that you would've spent to a charity and provide someone else with the kind of happiness you willfully neglected."}
{"text":"Stop #2 on my poutine crawl in Montreal.  Bacon, pepperoni and onions poutine. Regular size.  It was quite good.  The flavors worked together very well.  Service was very friendly but it took soooo looooonnnnggg to get my poutine.  It seriously took about 25 minutes for it to get there and I was starving.  Once it came, I attacked it like a dingo at a day care center.   It was maybe just a tad heavy on the onions, and I love onions.  Other than that, it was a nice meal.  The place was super busy (it was between 1 and 2 in the afternoon) and the people just kept coming in.   This place knows its poutine so I can heartily recommend it."}
{"text":"I made a quick trip to Montreal over the weekend, so to get my fill I tried two different within the span of 30 hours.  My trip to La Banquise was my second poutine trip, and last meal in Montreal. First of all, it's cash only so if you're not into carrying a lot of money around when you're visiting another country, there's an ATM at the front.  I ordered the \"La Taquise\" with ground beef added and the vegan boyfriend had the vegetarian poutine with peppers and olives. For a regular, you get a heaping mound of golden brown french fries covered in gravy, cheese curds, massive amounts of guac and sour cream (and the bits of beef I added) so there's no need to order anything else. What I should have realized that the cold guac and sour cream would not help your curds melt so for the curds were solid. From what I understand, the best part of poutine is the gooey ooey cheese curds and my previous (classic) poutine was a melty masterpiece. So, I have to admit- the cheese was underwhelming in La Taquise because it's a mild cheese, and they stayed solid so if I had to do it again, I would have gone for the poutine with the hot dog bits. From what I understand, poutine is Canada's equivalent of chili cheese fries so don't worry if you think having poutine with hot dogs is \"trashy\".  The vegan equivalent sans cheese curds has a brown gravy that tastes like marmite- it was pretty delicious, but of course on the salty side. The fries were not a win with the boyfriend though because he thought they were greasy. So if you're not a fan of thick cut, soft greasy fries you might not like poutine. I personally love soft fries! I don't really eat fries at home because I don't like the cardboardy crispy yellow sticks prevalent here (With the atrocious cornstarch batter to keep them crisp. )"}
{"text":"People keep telling me that this place is THE place for THE BEST POUTINE.   After I have eaten the Boogaloo, I must say, it is a very good place for a good poutine. It's also open 24h so you can have a poutine anytime. La Banquise has put its own taste into its interpretation of the poutine. The sour cream really is something that I've never thought about putting into my poutine and they did it! I thought I was really hungry so I took a large poutine, but oh my gosh it is so big, I overestimated myself for a poutine.  For me, it wasn't THE BEST POUTINE, but I must admit that it is a very tasteful restaurant that has a large variety of poutines and other stuff. Who doesn't love poutine?!?!?!?!"}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by a friend as one of the \"Best poutine places\" in Montreal. Impossibly huge servings, La Banquise serves up some interesting poutine choices. While I've always been partial to the \"don't mess with a good thing\" original cheese curds and gravy, I opted to try some of the more adventurous pairings, the pulled pork poutine.  The pulled pork poutine was deliciously savoury and satisfying. And very saucy.  The atmosphere is very hipster and casual and overall a great place to grab some good poutine."}
{"text":"Add our names to the list of \"We came here strictly for the poutine & were not disappointed.\"  We order a large \"La Taquies\" (sour cream, tomatoes, guacamole) & a small straight-up vegetarian poutine.  Both with veggie gravy.  La Taquies was delicious but I'm also glad we got the classic version as well.  The guacamole was more of an avocado spread but I know cilantro isn't for everyone so its probably better for the masses.  They achieved what I thought to be the perfect ratio of cheese curds to gravy to fries.  There's a split right after the door to separate people ordering take-out from those waiting for a table.  FYI: they don't have a liquor license for their patio but you'll be fine - get drunk off how amazing your meal is."}
{"text":"YAY!!! i loveee this place! Everytime we're in Montreal, we HAVE to go for some LOADED poutine, the REAL Quebeque Poutine.  Just so you know a couple of tips:  - HUGE LINE UPS during lunch and dinner that go outside and sometimes around the block! ITS WORTH IT!! don't go to another store instead - their LARGE portions are great for 2 people especially if you get a meat lover or what not. - this isn't a place to eat and CHILLLL .. due to huge line ups, you're rushed in/out - Forget about burgers and other stuff! if you're a tourist here, you must have a poutine! for locals, that might be different as over time you'd naturally like to experiment with other menu items  their mexican is just fabulous .. meat lover is great too and super filling."}
{"text":"I was visiting from New Jersey and was recommended this place as the best place to get poutine fries in Montreal. We went around 4-5pm on a Saturday. We didn't wait too long and the fries are really good! But come early because when we left there was a line out the door. The restaurant itself isn't that big so I can see how the lines can easily become long. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place after trying it once. A visitor to Montreal should stop in for some great and diverse poutine. They also have non-poutine items for those who are interested.  We tried the the T-Rex and the Mexican and both were good. THe staff also speaks both English and French, so no worries from either side."}
{"text":"there are a number of recommended places for poutine, a quintessential canadian comfort food, in montreal. not only was la banquise mentioned by anthony bourdain, but a preview of the menu online indicated there was, in addition to a vegetarian version for the pescetarian bf and the classic poutine, a variety of options of toppings for your poutine including a variation on the gravy.   we opted for the classic (cheese curds, gravy & fries), the veggie (green peppers, mushrooms & onions plus classic ingredients), the mart (sausage, bacon plus classic) and the jaco (minced beef, onions, pepper sauce instead of generic gravy). although the fries were on the greasy could have been more crunchy side (my main complaint), they were all tasty, and definitely worth the experience. i liked the pepper sauce on the jaco the best. the gravy on the others were a little bland and not memorable. i think if you're going to cover your crunchy pommes frites and render them somewhat mushy, you better have some tasty sauce.  the resto has a casual, youthful cafe feel and being open late, seems like a great place for snacking after (or during) drinks. the regular sized poutines are pretty sizable. even if i could eat more, i don't think i could eat a large quantity of such heavy food. they also serve hamburgers and other pub-type foods."}
{"text":"If you're a French Fry lover and are visiting the area, I'd recommend trying this spot for poutine for the sake of trying poutine. Since it was my first time trying it, I went small and only added bacon. It was a good, filling comfort snack. I can see why the hype is real, but it's not something I'd ever be craving for. La Banquise gets 3 stars for its large selection and wide variety and trendy atmosphere."}
{"text":"I visited Montreal 2 weekends ago with a friend. When in Montreal, one must get poutine, so we headed over to La Banquise.  We walked in and didn't have to wait long for a table. It was a beautiful day so we opted to sit outside and it was quite nice. Our table was a bit close to the next table but it didn't bother me too much.   As for the poutine - I got 'La Reggae' which had ground beef, guacamole, diced tomatoes & hot peppers and it was delicious! The portions are quite big and you can choose a regular or a large size. I got the regular for $10.50 and I couldn't finish it. (My friend was able to power through the whole plate, but she was very full afterward). If 2 people want to eat the same kind of poutine, I would recommend sharing a large.  Taste: 5/5 Service: 3/5 Atmosphere: 3/5 Value for Money: 4/5 Would I come again: Yes"}
{"text":"Don't embarrass yourself by getting anything else. Poutine. That's it.  We made the mistake by order a burger and a side of poutine to share. *gasp   Locals avert their eyes and you have tourist written all over you without even saying a word.  Every single table, each person ordered poutine. The menu has over 20 to choose from!  It's quite a huge order for 1 person to tackle. Man up and don't share. It's worth the weight gain and the trouble breathing afterwards."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.   Good poutine, but a bit lacking in service.  I see that the 24/7 thing definitely is working for them here as I saw majority of the tables packed even at 2 am."}
{"text":"poutine was very disappointing.  fries were soggy and SWEET. why were the fries so god damn sweet? cheese was old and stringy.  i dont recommended this restaurant for poutine."}
{"text":"24 hours of poutine-y goodness, YUM! The cheese curds are squeaky and the fries are crispy; perfect as a base layer before hitting up St Denis or before crashing into bed after a night on St Denis. Every time I go to Montreal I head on over to La Banquise. The only reason why I almost gave this place 4 stars is because of the 'no liquor on the patio' policy, but in the summer, I guess it makes sense."}
{"text":"Came by here Saturday night around 12am (opened 24 hr which is awesome) and it wasn't that busy! After we got seated and ordered I noticed there was a fast wave of people coming here. There's a lottttaaa stuff on the menu and you might get overwhelmed so check up yelp for pics for reference. The waitress we had was very attentive and checked up on us every so often and filling our water. After 11pm I think is when they tell you to pay after you order - makes sense. They have no problems splitting the bill as well.   I ordered the regular bougaloo which is the pulled pork poutine with coleslaw and a huge slab of sour cream on top of it. This place has huge portions. I couldn't finish my poutine! I wasn't a fan of the sour cream, only had a bit. It was too heavy for my liking. The coleslaw I didn't like at first, but after mixing it with the sauce, I think it tasted better so that combo was good. The pulled pork was good and had a lot of flavour. Fries.. not bad. I've had better fries at other places but it was still good.  As for drinks, I got a ginger beer (non alcoholic) and it very refreshing with the poutine. Fair warning: it is more on the spicier ginger side.    Overall, good food and service. I'm glad I finally got to try the famous poutine place in Montreal! Will come back to try other poutines and I love how it's opened 24 hr!"}
{"text":"So once I knew I was going to Montreal, the next natural step was to go on Yelp and pick all of the different places where we were going to eat poutine. From the first search, La Banquise was on my list.  Although a bit of a tourist trap, or so it seemed, this business was really great. Because it was February it was pretty cold, however, there are heaters outside for those queued up in line.   Once inside we were greeted by very friendly waitstaff and delicious poutine. I had the traditional with beef and my fiancée had the traditional with bacon. Both were crazy good. The fries were perfectly crispy and the gravy savory with a little hint of sweetness which was both unexpected and really good. Also, there was plenty of cheese in each serving.  5/5 and worth the wait!"}
{"text":"La Banquise sure deserves its 4 stars for serving underwhelming poutines.  I can vividly remember the first time I tried poutine at la Banquise in 2008: damn what a disappointment.   Silly me, I went back a couple times over the years (including a couple months ago), trying a different poutine every time, in order to understand why French Quebecers swear by their culinary Gods that poutine at la Banquise is the best (in the world).   On average, the fries seems overcooked and fried at low oil temperatures: the fries are greasy, hard, and not crispy. The gravy is generally too salty and tasteless. The toppings come in below average portions, but they got their cheese curds right.  I guess it can become a good choice for curing hangovers since it's open 24/7, when you're too drunk to taste the difference.   In terms of pricing... it generally comes down to 15$-20$ (taxes, tips included), which is not worth at all, considering its quality and quantity. I'd rather get McDonald's."}
{"text":"Massive lineup for mediocre poutine. It's good that they have a very interesting selection but I was disappointed in the end.   Don't believe the hype. It's enjoyable poutine, at best."}
{"text":"Always a classic, you can not go wrong here if poutine is your goals. This is not  a fancy shmancy she trip. Service was actually really good."}
{"text":"Ah Poutine, the Canadian equivalent to SD's Carna Asada Fries. I'm really having a hard time deciding what I think about Resto La Banquise. On the one hand, I definitively enjoyed my poutine here. On the other hand, I almost always enjoy poutine and its hard to me to think that the poutine here was exceptional. The poutine was above average and I thought the selection was great, but I think they know that they're popular and thus the prices reflect it. in the end, the combination of taste and price has lead me to give this a sound 3 star restaurant. Worth a trip if you really want poutine, but nothing go out of your way for.  For the record, i got the classic and the B.O.M. The classic is the standard fries, gravy and cheese curds. The curds were chewy and great. The fries held up to the gravy and didn't get soggy too quickly. And the gravy was tasty but nothing special. The B.O.M has bacon, onions and a spicy lamb sausage. The sauce is sweeter and spicer, or maybe it just picked that up from the sausage...not totally sure. This was definitely my favorite as it was unique and more memorable."}
{"text":"Excellent poutine. Came here with our two kids and shared 2 regular orders. Was a good light dinner for us and despite being busy was great service. Recommend coming early since it gets super busy."}
{"text":"Love it! One of the best places in town to get poutine! I highly recommend the italian poutine, the t-rex, or the three amigos poutine! Great service too!"}
{"text":"THE Poutine of Montreal... The menu has a wide selection, including vegatarian poutine. Come with a very empty stomach and be prepared to walk out uncomfortably full... But well worth it!! A must for the poutine explorer..."}
{"text":"Perhaps I'm biased because I was not a fan of poutine, but La Banquise was just ok. The food I ordered (a breaded chicken sandwich) was subpar, and tasted a bit like a frozen chicken patty. I also ordered just normal poutine, and it was nothing exciting. When our waitress brought us our bill, she told us they only accept Canadian credit cards and cash. We had neither and needed to use the ATM. It would have been much nicer for her to tell us this BEFORE serving us. My sister had to pay for me since my card did it work in the ATM; if I had been alone, I'm not sure what I would have done. The interior was nice and the tables and \"theme\" were cool. Wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Great music, great people, and great food! My friends visited this restaurant the first night arriving at Montreal and we loved it. I ordered a smoked meat poutine for the table and a burger with goat cheese, and the both were incredibly good (albeit I didn't expect much from the burger at all). Each bite of the poutine (smoked meat, cheese curds, fries) was super flavorful, but I think what really brought it over the top was the gravy. I also really enjoyed the choice of music at the restaurant. Overall really great experience and would recommend for anyone in Montreal!"}
{"text":"They burn the fries way too much La Banquise lost it's touch In Montreal a Poutine is a must But this place is a bust Trust me daddy My rhymes won me a Grammy"}
{"text":"THE spot for poutine in Montreal!  This place was recommended by a local and it makes sense why.  The place was packed by locals and students so you know it's gotta be good and the price right.  This was my first time having poutine so I won't claim to be an expert but if this was set the scale, then it's high.  We were a party of 3 so we ordered 3 different varieties in the small sizes.... We ate a ton and still had a lot left over.  The original is a must and I loved the Mexican flared one too.  A must if you want to try a local original! I'm still thinking about those delicious cheese curds.  Thank god it's not available in California or else I'd be in trouble!"}
{"text":"This is hands down a great place to have poutine, if you are in high school / college age. It is not the most sophisticated place and it is filled with kids eating a snack for dinner. However, it is still a great place! The selection is limitless on how many combinations of Poutine you can have! It is the chipotle of poutines!   We really enjoyed the calliou and the reggae! Both were great choices! The reggae gave a healthy option of vegetables and meat while the calliou will be able to satisfy any meat lover out there!   Drinks are on the pricey side, $2-3 for a soda and the poutine is around $13~ average. If you bring a date, the total meal could be up to $35 with tip and tax!   Would definitely visit again when I have a poutine craving!"}
{"text":"This place was certainly packed when we arrived. Decided to order to go and eat at a nearby coffee shop instead of waiting outside in the cold to eat in. I was not a huge fan of the poutine as it tasted more rubbery - might just be more of a personal preference, however. Looked like a lot of people enjoyed the place!"}
{"text":"I expected more.  It was line, we wanted sit outside but finally we decided stay inside because they don't bring beer outside... How silly thing. So I chose smoked meet poutine, my hubby chose something with chicken. Nice thing they have cider! :) The service was ok, but I just felt everybody is in rush, so I didn't ask just random chose. Actually it was nice but nothing special.  Also lines at the washrooms. People just to close to each other. I don't think I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Choix parfait pour une première poutine ! Beaucoup de déclinaisons de la poutine classique, délicieux. Le restaurant est ouvert 24h/24 et assez occupé à toute heure, mais la file d'attente va plutôt vite."}
{"text":"Mon amie et moi sommes aller au banquise et pour la première fois je n'ai pas manger un de leur fameux Poutine. J'avais essayer une salade verte et c'était fabuleux.  ( même possiblement meilleure que la géante Poutine que mon amie a dévorée ) la salade avait des carottes rases,  champions, tomates et olives. La présentation était très belle.  C'était une bonne expérience, tu peux toujours aller au banquise et respecte votre régime."}
{"text":"Pretty good Poutine. As a total noob to authentic Canadian poutine, it was quite tasty. Worth the wait in line, that said for a non-French speaking person the line can be confusing a bit. So the left side is for take out and the right is for sitting down. Once you sit down and order, you pay before getting food. - Which was actually nice. Once you get your meal, you can relax and enjoy your meal with friends.   Also I'd definitely suggest checking out the Bec soft drink, it's soda made with maple syrup."}
{"text":"Premier jour à Montréal, nous logeons sur Le Plateau et avons décidé d'explorer le quartier de manière à finir à La Banquise, qui borde le parc Lafontaine. L'endroit est une institution nous l'avons bien compris, et l'Homme n'ayant jamais goûté de poutine de sa vie, ça tombe très bien. Grâce au décalage horaire et à notre corps qui nous réclame d'une part de dormir mais avant de nous remplir l'estomac d'abord, nous nous retrouvons à La Banquise vers 19h (c'est ouvert 24/7), et avons directement une table. La longue file menant jusque sur le trottoir quand nous sortirons nous indiquera que nous avons été chanceux d'être installés si vite !  Nous avons opté pour un trio burger banquise + poutine + bière pour lui, et un poutine Rachel + side salade pour moi. C'était très bon bien évidemment (y compris le burger) et suuuuper copieux (très peu d'assiettes repartent vide des tables)!  J'ai bcp apprécié l'originalité des différentes combinaisons possibles au niveau des poutines et la variété de la carte (vous y trouverez aussi des burgers, des sandwich et des salades). Seul leger bémol je dirais c'est un petit manque de sauce sur ma Poutine.  Pour le reste, service très sympa et efficace et prix ok."}
{"text":"Yum! Poutine! In any variation that you could dream of, La Banquise serves hot and delicious poutine. I was tempted to get the classic, but went with a large portion with mushrooms, onions and bacon...and it was delicious! The large was more than enough for Russell and I to share. They've also got a great beer selection. Debit cards only, so be sure to remember your cash."}
{"text":"Awesome place. The poutines are really good and they have lots of variety.  It's my go-to poutine spot!"}
{"text":"variety and a slippery floor. what more could you want?  Oh, to be the 100th review of La Banquis, of course!"}
{"text":"I finally managed to try one of the typical go-to places for 1st time visitor yet I'm still contemplating whether to give this place its deserved 4 star or not. I feel that this place is a good intro on poutine for 1st time Montreal visitor, but I believe there is better quality ones somewhere. Yet I do still give them one..till I find a better poutine place.  While their poutine is tasty with all the gravy and fixings, I found them very very greasy. In fact, I exacerbated my sore throat the next day after digging into all the fried stuffs. Not sure they changed the oil after each batch of fries....  Anyhow, the fries are definitely full of flavors! I love the generous amount of smoked meat and gravy. The smoked meat and gravy has a pretty strong black peppery flavors. Also, if you are a not a big fan of sodium, beware - the sodium intake can easily jump up 10,000 mg after this dish. Definitely on the salty side, but I do not mind it as I am a complete sucker for salt or any umami awesomeness. Portion is humongous! I only ate 1/2 of the portion and packed it to go. I managed to eat it as a 2nd meal later on.  Bottom line - Come here ONLY if you: First time visitor of Montreal and are looking to check off poutine from your list Don't give a damn of a Paleo diet, Atkins diet, or any diet Not in a rush. Wait time for getting a table and getting the food altogether is at least 40 mins - place is generally crowded."}
{"text":"I was expecting THE BEST POUTINE EVER(!) when I waited in line at 4am (yes, there was a huge line but it went by pretty quickly) and what I got was slightly-better-than-average-but-still-nothing-to-write-home-about poutine. I definitely was not licking the bottom of my plate as I did with my La Belle Province poutine container. I'd go back to this place if I was close-by but definitely wouldn't make the trek just for it. I think people mostly go for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good! Delicious! Wide range of choice. The takeout is connivence! NOTICE: They don't take credit card! Canadian debit and Canadian or US cash only!    Watch your weight lol"}
{"text":"Best Poutine I've had in Montreal.  Hands down.  I've tried everything from the vegi to the t-rex.  It's all amazing.  Don't forget to grab some vinegar for your to-go orders."}
{"text":"It will be months before we burn off all the calories we ate here.  Don't be put off by the large line, it moves fast.  We started waiting outside & it took us about 10 min to get a table.  This is one of a few places that I wish I listened to my French CD's before coming ( The Menu was in French) but our server was great and we enjoyed our meal.  2 beers with Ham, Bacon, Pepperoni Poutine grand size $25 Canadian. Cash only!"}
{"text":"La meilleure poutine de Montréal, il faut l'admettre. Bien que les standards soient déjà très haut dans cette ville, seulement la banquise offre ce choix de garnitures aussi originales et qui accompagnent aussi bien ce plat légendaire. En plus de ça, ils sont ouvert 24h/24, donc pas de stress si il y a la queue, vous finirez pas vous faire exploser la pence comme tout le monde, car les portions sont énormes, même leur petite Poutine est difficile à terminer."}
{"text":"On My 1st trip to Montreal, I was determined to have poutine.  Everywhere I read said this place had the best poutine.  I finally made it here on my last day in Montreal and at 1st was a bit worried by the appearance.  But, when I let the salty, saucy goodness touch my mouth, I was in poutine Heaven.  I still dream about this place.  Definitely grab a seat, get a order and enjoy a beer."}
{"text":"Delicious poutine in many, many varieties and open almost 24 hours! What more can you ask for? Admittedly I'm not a poutine expert as I've only had it a few times in my life -- and most of those times I was ten. But you know I HAD to have poutine as my first meal in Montreal and La Banquise handily satiated my craving. I ordered classic poutine and my husband ordered a version with cabbage, both huge servings, came out piping hot with REAL cheese curds! Delicious! Loud, lots of drunk people waiting for a big table to open up (we anticipated a long wait as we saw a bunch of people hanging out by the entrance, but all of them turned out to be people who are waiting for big tables.) I'd happily return anytime."}
{"text":"Énormément de choix sur la carte. Les Poutines sont excellentes. Attention tout de même à faire le bon choix pour ne pas être déçu ! Service rapide. Par contre, énormément de lineup les soirs de fin de semaine mais victime de son succès ! Je pense ne pas pouvoir aller ailleurs du coup pour déguster la Poutine à Montréal !"}
{"text":"An authentic local restaurant which offers you the best poutine the province has to offer, the endless waiting line is a proof of how good the food is and the service is just too friendly. Perfect place for visitors, late night out or just a change of taste."}
{"text":"Yum!  The line outside was worth it.  I ate my first poutine ever- a regular classic.  My boyfriend got the Reggae.  Both were delicious and super filling!  Beer was good.  I was full for 3 days :)"}
{"text":"Poutine is definitely a unique local experience.  It seems like everyone knows to eat poutine in Montreal, except an outsider such as myself.  As a Californian, I didn't know what poutine was until my coworker told me I gotta try it on my first trip to Montreal.  So I did at this well known dive - where it was bursting at the seams with people.  When we got there the line was out the door.  I found that poutine is just like chili fries from home, except it's not necessary chili that they put on top of the fries - there are a variety of toppings available.   We ordered the breaded chicken which came with gravy and this other one with mushroom and steak.  They were both good but I liked the steak better than the chicken.  The regular sized was enough to share for two, but looking around I saw people ordering larger sized plates which made me wonder how they were going to finish the whole thing since we were already struggling to finish the regular size between two people. The nice servers at the establishment all spoke French and were very helpful and it had a nice ambiance.  Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Place incontournable pour tous nos amis de passage sur Montréal et aussi pour nos fins de soirée à éponger ...... J,ai un faible pour la Galvaude et ses petits pois verts ou encore La T Rex !"}
{"text":"The wait may discourage you. The location is not the most central. But it's all worth it. La Banquise is one of the first places I go to after a long trip away from Montreal.  For the \"classic\" poutine, I don't think it's the best one out there (that would be Ashton's in Quebec City) but the choices of poutine is incredible, the cheese and fries are fresh, the portions are huge and the prices are decent. Go and satisfy your poutine craving. I wonder why is there no other places like this in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand why this place is well regarded (is it or have I just gotten recos from the wrong people?). Their fries are nothing special and this results, generally, in a very ordinary final product. Maybe their excellence comes from the variety of specialty poutines they offer? I just ordered the regular poutine, so I don't know."}
{"text":"The ultimate comfort food!! I grew as a child making a big bowl of french fries and covering them with ketchup and hot sauce. Resto La Banquise took it to a whole'nother level. Being in Montreal for business, I had experienced other fine food previous to this adventure but the Poutine with ground beef, bell peppers, and onions was like no other. I could have ate it AAAALLLLLLLL day long, it was so good. I could imagine being in college, ordering a regular and sitting on the sofa, studying and eating all day. What is in that gravy? Don't know! But where is the gravy? GONE, I ate it all!"}
{"text":"I heard this place had excellent poutine so my boyfriend and I went while we were on vacation in Montreal. One huge plus is, La Banquise offers a vegetarian sauce and I was unable to find many other places that offered that. I  I ordered La Taquise with the vegatarian sauce. It was my first and only time having poutine, so I can't really compare this poutine to others. I ended up choosing the large size, which was indeed large. It may seem expensive for fries, but it's completely worth it.  One note, I don't know French well so I ordered in English. The French waitress took the time to understand what we were ordering and answering any questions we had."}
{"text":"This place is bonkers!!  Fries, gravy, cheese curds and three....yes three meats on one plate.  Those french Canadians really know what they're doing when it comes to putting all sorts of goodness on french fries.  It may be worth a trip to Montreal for a poutine from this pace.  they just crank our french fry perfection.  As amazing as it is I can't help but think that its even better after a long night of drinking.  We went on a weekend afternoon and a part of me wants to go back to Montreal, party hardy and binge on poutine. We ordered the Poutine Matty and the Poutine Trois Viandes (3-meat!!). I think the 3 meat poutine was just a little too much to handle. The Matty was delicious.    Doesn't really matter what you order - just make sure you get a poutine. They're all amazing!"}
{"text":"Wandering the streets of Montreal close to midnight looking for this place was an adventure.  The sign is really small.  In our search, we stumbled on a bar run by an artists' collective.  Had some stiff drinks.  So, getting lost was cool.  I like greasy food, so I liked the poutine.  I had the sausage, bacon, onion poutine.  It was pretty good and hit my gut like a rock.  Along with beer, it was a great combo.  Pretty happening at all hours."}
{"text":"There's no doubt that this place is an institution. Probably a good place to bring your friends (if it's your first year in Montreal) to show that you gor your local fav spots under your your belt.   But, this place does not serve the best poutine in town. Plus the always slippery floors you feel like you're gliding on fry fat all the time.   If it's 3am and this is the nearest choice, go for it."}
{"text":"La Banquise is good! Whenever I have someone visiting me in Montreal I always bring them here due to the large selection of poutines (and they even have a vegan one). As someone who lives in Montreal however, this is not a restaurant I come to often. There's almost always a huge line, even in the winter, and the service is very lacklustre. The waitress and waiters definitely want to get you in and out in a swift manner, and if I am taking too long finishing up eating my food and leaving I feel very rushed and uncomfortable. Sometimes you just want to sit and enjoy your food you know?   As for the poutine, I always get the same thing, \"La Festival.\" It's a poutine with Swiss cheese, ground beef, hot peppers, and onion rings. I LOVE what I get, however this visit the onion rings were VERY small, compared to the amount I usually get, and I felt like I didn't get my money's worth. Otherwise it was really delicious.   I would definitely recommend this place to any tourist visiting in Montreal. It's a cute restaurant and it definitely has personality. I can attest that there is no poutinerie quite like La Banquise so definitely give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Poutine!  First time having it, and it was truly epic. I will definitely be eating there again upon my next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"My Canadian friends recommended me to go to this place for good poutine and it did not disappoint!   This was my first poutine ever and I'm glad I waited to go to La Banquise. The portions are huge and they have so many variations of poutine that my friends and I all had trouble deciding what to get. We each got our own regular sized poutine and a large original poutine just to try.  We tried the Matty, Elvis, T-Rex, and the Mexicaine. All of them had the gravy sauce and the cheese curds which were chewy and delicious. The Matty and Elvis were pretty similiar except one had bacon and the other beef. In my opinion the T-Rex was a meat feast which was too much for me, but if you're a meat lover this is the one to order. If I were to go back I would order the Mexicaine with the tomatoes, guac, and sour cream, just because its refreshing to eat fresh vegetables on such a heavy dish.   My only negative point is that they didnt put enough vegetables in their poutine (such as bell pepper or tomatoes in their respective dish). If this is your first poutine, I feel that you don't need to order the original just because all the variations are similar to it, just more meat.   If you've never had poutine, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????10???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????20????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Best poutine in town period. If it's summer, grab some poutine and go have it outdoors in the beautiful La Fontaine Parc nextdoor. If it's winter, go skating then head for some hot poutine indoors. Anyway, La Fontaine has to be part of the experience."}
{"text":"Gros assiettes poutines pour les gourmands. Bcp d'ambiance. Terrasse disponible l'été. Ouvert 24h. Prix raisonable. Adresse à retenir pour dépanage apres minuit ...."}
{"text":"Every fan of poutine must, at least once in their lifetimes, make a pilgrimage to La Banquise.  Though, make sure you bring cash or Interac or hit up the onsite ATM because they don't take credit cards.  They're always open, though if you show up between the hours of 9pm and 5am, they'll make you pay in advance.  It's like the old sign at the bar \"if drinking to forget, please pay in advance.\"  Also, since it is such a popular institution, you may be waiting outside for a while, even if just ordering take out, so make sure you dress accordingly.  Of course, if you're walking outside in Montreal in the colder months, a hat and gloves should be standard attire anyway.  Speaking of drinks, they have a variety of canned sodas and bottles of beer, but, of course, this place is known for their dozens of varieties of poutine.  I typically order the T-Rex, which comes with sausages, hot dogs, and a third meat.  Most recently, I went with the Mexican, which had jalapenos, olives, and tomatoes.  I wasn't expecting the veggies to be uncooked, but it was still a delicious  and interesting take on poutine.  Still, I think I'm gonna spend the extra couple of bucks to get meat next time.  The french fries are done just right and the gravy is savory and always piping hot.  It's amazing how they're able to turn out so much food with such a tiny kitchen.  They must get daily truckloads of potatoes, cheese curds, and gravy.  On the topic of spending a couple extra bucks, I also highly recommend going with \"le grand,\" or the large.  For just a few dollars more you'll eat and eat until you can eat no more and then you'll still have a solid third to a half of the dish full for next time.  It's never quite as good as it was fresh and hot, but for a few dollars, you can't go wrong with an afternoon or morning snack later on.  Basically, I'm agreeing with Ashley H. that these portions are enormous and will leave you saying \"that's it,\" when you receive a normal sized entree at another restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my third time trying poutine but never liked it before. I must say, if I ever find a place like this one in Toronto they got me as a client. Best poutine I have ever had."}
{"text":"My wife and two friends drove into Montreal and the very first thing we had to do was try one of the best restaurants serving up poutine (essentially fries, cheese curds, and gravy). We were staying near Mount Royal so we walked down a cool street to this place. It was PACKED at 10:30PM on a Sunday night (has to be good!). They are know for their classic poutine and T-Rex. My friends got the classic and the cheese curds were squeaky (the true sign of good cheese curds). I got the T-Rex and it was great.  Warning: DO NOT ORDER THE LARGE ORDER. It's way too much even for two people. This is the heaviest meal I've ever had so a regular order is more than enough for two people!"}
{"text":"Great food. If you haven't been to la banquise, you haven't had real Poutine. Wait time can be long though."}
{"text":"I like mcdonalds fries better. Sorry :/ Was not a fan! Maybe because I am not used to these types of fries. They tasted overly greasy and salty."}
{"text":"Malheureusement la banquise c'est plus ce que c'était :) oui toujours de la poutine, mais fonctionner sur une réputation c'est pas cool"}
{"text":"Toujours une place pour passer un bon moment et manger du bon Poutine, il y a presque toujours d'attente pour entrer mais ça veut la peine"}
{"text":"Wow. This was a nice twist on a classic Canadian favorite. My fiancé and I split a large La Reggae to go and really enjoyed all the flavors. It was your typical poutine fries but with ground beef, tomatoes, guac and jalapeños. It kinda reminded us of carne asada fries with cheese curd and gravy instead of sour cream and cheddar. It was so big we had to save some for later. They have tons of poutine options so it took us some time to figure out what we wanted. They're cash only so make sure to bring some cash!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  I had to make a pit stop here before my way back to NY. Luckily there was no wait on a late Monday afternoon.   There are so many choices! I was in a hurry to order and settled for the hot dog. It didn't add much to the poutine, and if anything made it saltier. The gravy was tasted, nothing overly special. I would get the original next time.   The small should cheaper considering the price of the large!"}
{"text":"While researching good poutine places in Canada (which by the way I've been moronically pronouncing it 'poo-tin-nay'. Yep, I learned the hard way when I tried to order it at a Dairy Queen and the employee looked at me like I was a stupid American), my studies have shown me that the cheese should be squeaky when you bite down on it.  The cheese in the poutine at Resto La Banquise did just that. Granted, this was my first time trying poutine so I really have nothing to compare it to (not including that Dairy Queen fiasco) but something just felt right. Was it the steamy hot gravy caressing each fry? Was it the smell that wafted through the air and into my heart? I don't know. All I know is that this place got it right.  We only had enough time (and room in our stomachs) to try La Classique (the regular one) but if I ever come back to Montreal, I would surely try one with meat. Preferably bacon because c'mon...it's bacon!  Tip - the regular size was enough to split between four girls since it is pretty heavy. Unless you're in training to become the next star of Man v. Food, I would just stick with that."}
{"text":"Only been here pretty hammered but I love it love it love it. So does my girlfriend! Ocea (@oceaoceaocea).   I've only ever gotten the poutine with all the guacamole and the Rachel. They were really good! They don't take credit. That's been a problem for me in the past because all my money is in US dollars. So Americans be warned ;)!"}
{"text":"I looove this place, and it's not because it's \"the best poutine in Quebec\" as their slogan claims:  I love that 1) I have taken 3 people here within two weeks (on 3 different occasions), and they love it. 2) I have been here at 3am with a friend, and he loved it. The atmosphere was awesome! 3) I have tried half of the poutine dishes on their menu and cannot find my favourite! 4) they made corn & poutine so yummy! 5) I hate fat foods/grease/high calories/unhealthy foods, yet I don't feel guilty eating here :) it's toooo gooodddd  So crowded, washroom is absolutely gross, occasional terrible service..... 5 stars!  Yes, my favourite poutine restaurant so far"}
{"text":"We got here around 1pm on a Saturday afternoon and there was a lineup outside, that was a surprise! It was about a 25 min wait and when we got seated everything inside was really cozy. We ordered La Bacon to share between two people. The food took a little long to arrive, but that was understandable since they were so busy. The food was excellent, very warm still, fries cooked perfectly, cheese were curds and chewy! Which they are suppose to be, the slightly disappointing thing though, was that their bacon was very thin, it looked like they used Maple Leaf instant bacon in their dishes. The most pleasant surprise was that our waiter came back to check on us to see if we needed anything, even though he was super busy. Usually if they're too busy, they just drop off your food and forget about you.  Cash and debit only, no credit!"}
{"text":"The first time I came to Montreal, I was bummed that I wouldn't get to try poutine because it's not vegan. I was told about La Banquise and was so sad that I wouldn't get to go. During my last trip, I searched \"vegan poutine\" and LB came up! You have no idea how excited I was.  VEGAN POUTINE: I came expecting the fries to be soggy (Duh, covered in gravy), but for some reason I was still surprised, it feels like the fries were never crispy though. But I know some people LOVE soft fries, so I'm just not one of those people or I wasn't on the day that I went. The vegan gravy is very tasty, I forgot how good gravy can be. I'm not sure if you've ever tried the gravy that comes with some frozen vegan meats, but it's usually pretty watery or just not very gravy like, how I remember meat gravy to be. Most of the time it's just an herby/spicey thick sauce. But the vegan gravy here is so yummy. The vegan cheese is like a lot of other vegan cheeses, which is kind of not that great but what can you do. They also have tabasco sauce which was awesome because I was in the mood for some hot sauce. $9CAD and you get a huge plate of it. I was sad I couldn't finish, but took the other half and gave it to a homeless man I saw later (hopefully, he didn't notice it was vegan! Or hopefully he did and loved it!)  THE PLACE: I went on a Saturday at 1:30 so obviously there was a line out the door. But it's useful to note that there are two lines: the one on the right is for dine-in and the one on the left is for take-out. If it weren't raining, I definitely would've gotten mine to-go and ate it in the beautiful Parc La Fontain which is right there. The place is open 24/7 by the way. It feels very diner like inside, which is awesome and perfect for a poutinery, I'd say. They serve a selection of beers here, which seems like a great poutine pairing."}
{"text":"I confess I was a poutine virgin until my Classique arrived. I've lived in poutine country (upstate New York) for 10 years now but didn't see how this fat-on-fat extravaganza could do anything but clog your arteries. But the Classique opened my eyes as well. The salty beef (?) gravy, firm cheese curds and excellent fries were in perfect harmony, much like lettuce, tomato and onion on a nice greasy burger.  By way of comparison my teen, a fries fanatic, ordered the Savoyard with bacon and onions and couldn't finish it. Moral of this story: order the Classique."}
{"text":"Bonne poutine mais cher pour la quantité. Le prix va à cause de la réputation. Beaucoup de choix, malgré que si vous voulez la traditionnel, vous serez très fort probablement un peu déçu. Souvent beaucoup de monde et de longue fil d'attente."}
{"text":"Fantastic poutine. Great size for sharing (the large.) I got the 'La Taquise' poutine and it was sooooo good! The best I've had in Montreal! They are open 24 hours which is a blessing and a curse in my book. And to my vegetarian/vegan friends: they have vegetarian sauce and vegan cheese for an additional cost!"}
{"text":"What did a trip to the highly praised La Banquise teach me and my whole family? ...We don't like poutine.  I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the poutine at La Banquise, it's just so hearty and gooey and cheesy. Wait, that sounds good, right? Well, it wasn't for us.  Mother was under the impression that her poutine was going to come with very little gravy and a lot of oxtail - see, that is what happens when your only experience with poutine is a fusion interpretation of it.  The bf is a fake-poutine lover. Every time we're in Canada, he pleads to go eat poutine. But even he didn't really care for it this time."}
{"text":"In my humble opinion, La Banquise makes the Best Poutine in Montreal!!  They make all kinds of variations of this Canadian delicacy.  It can be confusing deciding which one to order.  So what is poutine?  It is a dish consisting of French fries and cheese curds topped with a brown gravy.    I ordered a large La Sud-Ouest Poutine rather than going with their La Classique.  La Sud-Ouest's ingredients include, bacon, red onions, guacamole, onion rings, and chipotle sauce.  Yeah, nothing traditional about it at all.  Boy, did it taste incredible!!  I was polite and shared it with the family.  Everyone gave it the thumbs up.  Each family member ordered something other than Poutine from the menu.  We then shared my order plus one other order of Poutine. Honestly, though, I think you should only order Poutine when you visit La Banquise.  I look forward to trying more of their Poutine menu in the not too distant future.  Do yourself a favor and drop in to La Banquise.  You can visit any time of the day because they are open 24 hours!   They aren't a fancy diner, but their Poutine sure is scrumptious!!"}
{"text":"The poutine at La Banquise made our whole trip to Montreal worth it.   Down to the last bite, the frites maintained a satisfying crunch despite being coated with an unparalleled blend of gravy and cheese curds. (Yes, we're boring, we only tried the original style instead of one of the dozens of other varieties. We're not complaining.)  Tip: You can't order booze on the patio."}
{"text":"this place was very unique, and for the first time ever having poutine it was really good. I don't think I'm a huge fan of poutine but the place was very cool."}
{"text":"Best poutine I've ever tasted. Long wait times and lines, but all worth the wait. The portions were great and the beverage selection was adequate. A must try."}
{"text":"Yummy poutine - fries could have been crispier, but alas..   The meat was smoked and flavorful. And altogether it made an amazing breakfast cold the next morning."}
{"text":"I was a little bit hesitant to go to this place, as I'm a vegetarian and the gravy it's not at all... But I went there anyways because my boyfriend wanted to try the BEST POUTINE HE's ever tried. I have to say I was surprised by how many choices of Poutine you have, and also they had VEGAN!!!! I was the happiest person ever!! Anyways, the fries are crispy even with the gravy; the poutine was tasty and very good!  My boyfriend took one with mushrooms, onion, pepper and bacon and he LOVED IT We actualy went back for a second try, and it was as good as the first!!!!   Service is awesome as well, they are very friendly. And price is totally ok! Good portions!!!!"}
