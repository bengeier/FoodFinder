{"text":"Food was cold and nasty, don't bother with the mega package cause you won't get all the stuff on it and service was slow.   Kids had fun if that's the only goal but at the expense of the parents trying to keep a straight face at the rip off.   Do not fill out the survey before the party is over because you will rate services not completed and realize you should have said more."}
{"text":"First time back in many years, but since Boneyard closed we re-tried it.  They upgraded to \"swipe cards\" instead of tokens but still spits out tickets - no longer .25 each game, now they vary.  Was going to get the buffet but that consisted of a bowl of lettuce (bagged with precut veg), 2 or 3 pizzas and a cinnamon pizza as dessert - not appetizing at all in appearance and nothing like the ads stating buffet spread.  Place was clean although didn't use restrooms or order anything - forgot how loud it was!  Is good for young kids, but over 10 years old - over it :(.  I tried."}
{"text":"It's okay remember it's a place for kids so they enjoy it. The food is not bad it okay. The pizza is actually underrated. Come early because later in the day it gets packed in here. The location is rather small and can use more games. Overall it's a cool little place for kids."}
{"text":"Took my nephew here to blow off some energy (he's 6) so I knew he would like the place. I knew better than to eat here so we had some good ol home cooked grub before stopping out. The staff were very young but everyone was polite and helpful. I guess my issue is that it was pretty dirty, trash all over the floor throughout...funny that the bathroom was actually cleaner than the main floor.   The entertaining area is rather small but then again I'm not sure what to compare it to, it just felt smaller than it should be and very cramped. There could be a better selection of games geared toward younger kids but I guess in such a small space you only have few options.   I would have preferred taking him to the park and then for some ice cream but I made the mistake in saying, \"Where do you want to go today?\" I can't blame the kid, I mean he is 6."}
{"text":"this location is vastly understaffed. we had 26 kids and one barely present, bored-to-death \"hostess\"... we ended up serving the pizza and drinks ourselves. she cut the cake but it took a long time for the cake to come out and even longer for her to cut it, so we served it too. the person in the chuck e costume just radiates hatred for his/her job (this has been the case every time we've come here). i mean barely moves. throws up a thumbs up every now and then. they set our tables on dirty tablecloths with hunks of cake and spilled juice on them. i wiped the booths myself so people would have a clean place to sit. the party manager tried to \"help\" and seemed friendly but spent most of her time explaining away her mistakes and then told me they were trying to work on it and asked me for a good rating on the postparty survey. when it came time to check out there was one person behind the desk and about 2 dozen people waiting to get prizes. again, understaffed, and the staff there don't seem to think the guests waiting for anything is a problem. i paid over $400 for this birthday party and had to run it myself, basically. the 2 rating is simply because kids love chuck e cheese. but as a parent i will definitely not go to this location again because management is trying to run it as cheaply as possible by understaffing with people who can't be bothered to show an ounce of enthusiasm at a 5 year old's birthday party, much less actually get the crap i paid for to the table at a reasonable time or to clean said table."}
{"text":"I get it Chuck E Cheese, you nailed the mind numbing, brainwashed children, sub par food, first job as a teenager market, bravo, something to be proud of.  As I'm sure you are profitable, I just can't see me latching onto your bandwagon even with my 10 month old quickly approaching the days of skeeball and spending tons of cash for very little tickets and then trading them in for $1-$10 toys.  Let me divulge.  So we went there on a Saturday for a 2hr birthday party which included snacks, pizza, wings, sandwiches, soda, and tokens.  I will try not to get into too many details but a couple low lights are the following. The food really isn't that god.  The pizza is plain, flavorless, and overpriced.  I know you need to cater to mostly children but save something for the parents to enjoy besides the smile on our kids faces.  Wings are tiny, I mean choking hazard tiny.  Although the sauced ones I tried had good flavor, I would just need to eat a whole $25 platter to get full.  Ice cream is that stuff that the elementary school lunch room serves.  Guess it's safe for kids but the wife and I are determined that it got our 10 month old sick only 5-10 minutes after having a couple tiny spoonfuls.  2 drink minimum beers and wine, enough said.  I don't want to get drunk but something needs to help me get past the $250-$350 sticker price I'm going to see after tip at the end of the night.  2 hours is really not enough time.  I'm positive CEC does it only because they have people knocking down their doors to get in there for parties.  We were there with 4-5 kids and were still opening presents at 2pm, had the parents and another kid helping with the opening of the presents just to make the deadline.  Not a way a 3 yr old should enjoy gifts.  CES tries to stuff too much activity in those 2 hours for anyone really to enjoy.  Our birthday girl seemed overwhelmed at times and definitely confused.  Poor kid.  Maybe turning up the volume so everyone can hear the instructions or here's a thought, take some of the massive profits and upgrade to 46'+ LCD TV's.   So I guess I'm the 10% of the market that CES still has yet to tap into for which I say NO WAY!!  Your lucky I added the extra star because you do have a very profitable business and I applaud you for that."}
{"text":"Best time to go is between 1-4.  After lunch rush and before dinner rush.  Grandaughter could play all the games she wants too.  Great now they have cards instead of tolkens."}
