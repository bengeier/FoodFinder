{"text":"great new taco joint on Roosevelt. Friendly staff and you can't beat the price. The tortillas are amazing"}
{"text":"Music here will make you want to get up and shake those hips - at least for me. Very cool, trendy space. You order at the counter and find a place to sit, which in this particular night we went (Saturday night) it was a little tricky as it was super packed. Seating available inside and outside and it is street parking only so that's another thing to keep in mind. Food was pretty good and their tortillas are hand made and you can actually see abuela (grandmother) in the kitchen making them which makes them that much more authentic. Ordered the flan that tasted like creme brulee. It was a good night."}
{"text":"First let me say the restaurant is super cute love the decor and outdoor seating area. The staff was great very friendly. The food was very disappointing. I tried the fried fish carne asada and barbacoa tacos. No seasoning at all. Even the salsas that were on the tacos didn't bump up the flavor at all. The carne asada was probably the best flavored but it was just grill flavor. The corn tortillas were really good seemed like they were made fresh. The margaritas were very good. I feel for 3.50 a taco there are better options in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Like the vibe enjoyed the tacos and the Nehru modelos. Cool spot has a nice open feel had two Barbacoa tacos were tasty. This place is around the corner for me and open most of the time so a good little break in the middle of the day spot"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING! Had the chips, salsa and guac looks like the chips are made in house which makes them taste wonderful. The tortillas and handmade you can see the lady making them. I ordered a barbacoa taco, a carnitas taco, and a fish taco. Barbacoa was the winner. There are 3 salsas my favorite one was one that came with the chips had a cumin/lemony taste. It was perfect.   Now you're probably wondering why I gave it 3 stars. The reason for it is that their service is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. You walk in and no body greets you, you order at the counter on the far end of the restaurant under a sign that just says \"tacos\". The people are not friendly. The girl that took our order was very short and did not seem to care. The second person i spoke to was a girl behind the bar, I  asked where the restroom was and she told me \"i'll give you the key\" then said \"go outside past the other restaurant\" and walked off. I didnt know i needed to go out the front door or the patio door and when I asked which way she had already walked off. So i just went out the patio door and found my way to the restroom. The third person was a guy that gave us our food, we sat at the bar as there were no other seats available. When he dropped the food off he quickly turned around and paid no notice to my bf who waved his hand to try to get his attention. We needed salsa, limes, and salt. Come on its a taco! We need the toppings. We flagged another girl down and we got what we needed, this place could be sooo great if the service didn't suck.  We will be back for the food, hopefully they aren't as careless next time we go.   OVERALL: go for the food but don't expect good service."}
{"text":"This new addition to Roosevelt Row is pretty good!  I went the first week they opened and it was clear they had a lot of kinks to iron out, the next time I went was about 3 weeks later and things were running much smoother.  The food is good but a bit overpriced for the portion you receive. I appreciate that the tortillas are made in-house, and when I asked for additional salsa it was happily provided. I wish they had bigger salsa portions or even a bar for the chips and salsa because a little condiment cup isn't enough when you're eating tacos and chips. The margaritas are great!! I would come here just for that, they're strong and delicious whether you order the classic or flavored versions. All in all it's a must-try."}
{"text":"FINALLY made my way to Taco Chelo a couple of weeks ago and it was worth the wait. The decor and artwork inside is amazing (huge Gennaro Garcia fan) - the staff was all so friendly and helpful - and the food was delicious. I am a big taco fan and these didn't disappoint. Everything tasted homemade, fresh and authentic. Salsa/guac was great - my sangria was so refreshing and my tacos (carne asada and pork) were awesome. Also, I think my new favorite way to eat a taco is quesadilla style. WOW. Highly recommend the \"quesadilla taco\". The shell was so crispy, cheese was melted and pork was tender and flavorful. YUM. Can't wait to come back! Gracias, Taco Chelo."}
{"text":"I love this place! SO SO SO MUCH! So much that I came two days in a row and I'm considering heading out there to make it three. Expect long lines during rush times. Be patient. This place is small just like most places in DTPHX. I was lucky enough to snag some seats at the bar. The service as great as expected. We had so much fun chatting it up with the bartenders. Their playlist was on point the entire night. They were playing so much Ozuna, Mana, Shakira, Nicky Jam, Plan B. I loved it. I didn't want to leave. Not to mention, Taco Chelo is so aesthetically pleasing. Gennaro Garcia, the artist who decorated the restaurant, paid such attention to detail and really knocked it out of the park. From the Frida Khalo mural to the vibrant neon sign that reads \"Taquero Mucho\" to the Spanish sayings written on every chair. It's beautiful.  There's always a few things I look for in mexican restaurants and this place has hit all of them. Being from Mexico has made me pretty picky and judgmental. I rarely try anyone's guac but this place has me addicted to theirs. The carne asada is how it should taste. I've been looking for carne asada that tastes as great as theirs. The corn tortillas are handmade and cooked to perfection. The flour tortilla on my carne asada quesadilla was just the right amount of crispy. The fish taco comes with a spicy crema, pickled onions, and cabbage. Do not skip out on it!!!! They have a few different salsas but the fire roasted one is by far my favorite.   I'm so glad they chose to have mezcal. I don't see a lot of places with mezcal cocktails. The Mezcal Paloma was very refreshing as was their Tecate Michelada served in super cute Taco Chelo mugs.   FYI they aren't selling their mugs YET. The bartenders let me know the artist made a very limited amount but in time they'll have them for sale they believe along with T-shirt's. Nearby parking is limited. Also, they have one of those community bathrooms around the corner just ask the cashier for the key.   The menu is small but it speaks volumes with the flavors of the meats and salsas. Suny Santana did an outstanding job. Thank you so much for my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Never knew what my life was missing til I bit into a dressed up chicharron piece that came with fresh lime, hot sauce and guac. Whats even better is it won't cost you a guap!"}
{"text":"Really great addition to the area. We look forward to our next visit and exploring the rest of the menu. The surprise was how great the veggie taco was. Thank you"}
{"text":"Love this place! The workers, food, drinks all so good. The decoration is cute & very Mexican(which I love). The tortillas are by far my favorite thing they are hand made & delicious. Had the quesadillas with meat, tacos are good. Going to go back and try the fish tacos. The hype is real."}
{"text":"The tacos were delicious and the place is really cute. Taco Chelo is a very authentically \"Phoenix\" place.  I'm glad to see this addition the the Roosevelt area."}
{"text":"Super cute place. Loved the decor and fast service. Tacos were ok, don't really worth the price. They make tortillas handmade however mead didn't have much flavor. Had to add extra sauce to get some kind of kick. If you are looking for a cool vibe and don't care much about food this place is definitely cool. But if you want good tacos you are better off finding and authentic hole in the wall place."}
{"text":"This is one of the best taco shops in Phoenix! They have authentic Mexican street tacos and not over priced. You walk up to the counter and order. Then your food is served at your table. While you wait you can see all the beautiful work by local artist Gennaro Garcia. You can also see the tortillas being made by hand and the chefs cutting the meat.  My favorite tacos are the fish and veggie. The quesadillas were also delicious!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a late night snack before heading back home and scored with this place! Had ourselves some quesadillas and the chips with guacamole, it came with two little salsas as well. You can never go wrong with a tortilla and melted cheese you know what I'm saying. We got a cheese, vegetable and Carne Asada quesadilla and they were just what we needed! They are small, like a street size. Food came out fast and everyone was pleasant. Don't wait for your order to be taken, walk up to the register by the kitchen and order yourself. This is a super chill spot. We enjoyed the food, the music, and the art! Nice patio set up outside too! I saw they have aqua frescas, but only had one flavor this night. Hope they are an all the time item there and they change flavors often or have more than just one flavor. So down to the nitty gritty....Nice job Taco Chelo. Hasta la pr√≥xima vez"}
{"text":"The food was good, but not a standout compared to the many other taco joints around Phoenix. The ordering and seating situation was definitely confusing and frustrating. We would've had nowhere to sit when our food arrived, if not for a kind server who felt bad for us only after we flagged him down and asked for help. The decor is beautiful and I love the other Chamberlain restaurants... but this one missed the mark for me."}
{"text":"This is an absolute gem in the heart of downtown. Great atmosphere and their food is absolutely amazing. I highly recommend the fish and carne asada tacos. The staff are some of the nicest people you'll meet and provide excellent service. Emilee's knowledge of tequila will blow your mind and is easy on the eyes!"}
{"text":"We visited Taco Chelo last week and ordered a few of the pork tacos and barbacoa tacos.  Barbacoa, albeit the meat was cold, had good flavor.  Pork was also good, but overall it's not a meal I would find myself craving.  Salsas were great, and the margarita was excellent.  With all the hype, design, and work to have this place open in our neighborhood, I expected more on the menu.  You have $3.50 tacos, chips/salsa, and a couple other appetizer type foods that could rival a food truck - not a full service restaurant.  I can see us returning for happy hour and potentially a pre-dinner sort of situation.  If I want to have a real (full) meal, I've got a list of other places we can go visit for that."}
{"text":"Inexpensive and delicious!  Variety of tacos and drinks.  Everything tastes fresh and authentic.  U can spend less than $15 during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Stopped by after a coworker mentioned a new spot near our office. For the sake of having tacos on a Tuesday we went. No specials, but a normal menu offering tacos and appetizers. Tried the Asada, Carnitas and Barbacoa tacos. The corn tortillas are freshly made and are on point. We tried two appetizers: chicharrones and frijoles a la charra.   Let's start with the tacos. Priced at $3+ they didn't come with enough meat and looked bare. The meats were ok but did not taste different in any way to have them stand out. The frijoles were missing something but were good, probably should have put them on the tacos to fill them. The chicharrons were good, extra crispy.   Would I come back? Maybe in a couple months see if they change it up or something.  Decor inside is legit and on o"}
{"text":"Holy mother of tacos! I cannot breathe! Lord baby Jesus take the wheel and drive us to Taco Chelo again! Granted I am the vegetarian of the bunch but seriously if you can impress with simple vegetables you can pretty much own Phoenix! Lily, the general manager is attentive and super pleasant! Can we have more people like her? Needless to say the decor is gorgeous you are quickly transported to a taqueria in Mexico where people can't help but smile because their bellies are full. The music is awesome too! You guys, hurry and take the kids out of school and come eat here."}
{"text":"Steer clear of this place. I got carne asada tacos, barbacoa, and a fish taco. Fish taco was ok. Asada was completely tasteless. Anyone could do better than this. Cmon guys. No business charging $3 per taco. The tacos are big in size but still with such an absence in flavor, this price tag cannot be justified on any level. Was expecting much more based on photos and reviews. Didn't even try the barbacoa. Def won't be back."}
{"text":"Great new place on Roosevelt! Got my tacos 5 minutes after ordering. Main takeaways: freshly made tortillas, unique salsa options, and authentic taco ingredients. Loved the chips and guac, carne asada, and carnitas tacos. The place is decorated very chic and rustic, staff is very nice and professional. Only downside is the tacos are all $3+ dollars. Didn't see if they have deals on Tuesday's but it would be nice if they had a 3 taco plate deal. Regardless, I Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Aioooooght.  Don't have too much negative to say about this place. I enjoyed their tacos. Although, I really don't like when establishments put certain seafood products in their Micheladas... some people have allergies or eat biblically.   May come back one day."}
{"text":"5 star service! This is an order at the counter place, with lovely outside seating. My husband and I stopped by for a quick lunch of chips/quac, and 4 tacos.   After 20 minutes we had not received our tacos so I went in and asked about it - unfortunately they he thought we already received our order but apologized and said that it would be out in 5 minites. They brought out our 4 tacos, plus 3 additional tacos, 2 quesadillas, and a tres leche cake all complimentary due to our wait!  We were extremely impressed by the service and highly satisfied with the food. The tres leche cake is a must order!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place did not deliver all the fuss that has been around it since the opening. I found their prices to be high for a taco in Phoenix. $3.75?!?! Hmmm I ordered a mix of tacos. If you asked me what was my favorite taco, I couldn't even remember the flavors... as they were lacking. In my opinion so many restaurants now are focused so much on their decor and \"hip\" look that they forget why people go to restaurants to start with : food! I guess I need to try something else on their menu next time."}
{"text":"Chef Aaron Chamberlin & I have had a somewhat lackluster relationship over the years.  I've visited Chef Chamberlin's other Phoenix creations (Phoenix Public Market Cafe & St. Francis) with mixed results.  Chamberlin certainly has a penchant for beautiful adaptive reuses of old buildings, but the food more often than not has left me underwhelmed.  In Taco Chelo, Chamberlin is making his first venture into the Mexican food realm inside a building on Roosevelt Row that most recently housed Flowers Beer & Wine (a craft beer & wine store that I dearly hope will reopen again nearby someday).  I don't always observe Taco Tuesday, but with a new taqueria just a few blocks from my apartment, I decided this Tuesday at happy hour was the right time.  As of my first visit here, the restaurant had been open for just barely a month.  You'll find it on the southeast corner of 5th Street & Roosevelt inside the old Flowers building (now part of a growing adaptive reuse complex called The Blocks).  Taco Chelo takes up about half the space that Flowers Beer & Wine once did, and the space is a hip modern urban neighborhood design that dreams are made of.  An absolutely gorgeous array of exposed brick, gold trim throughout the ceiling, wooden tables and seating, as well as turquoise hues throughout the bar area.  You'll also find beautiful art on the wall courtesy of artist Gennaro Garcia.  The space is completely unrecognizable from the Flowers days, but in this case I mean that as a compliment.  Inside there's seating for close to 30 (including the bar) & probably room for 40-45 more in the picnic table seating area outside.  They will most definitely need to get more shading for the outside before summer hits, but the foundation is solid.  Here you order at the front register helpfully marked with a Taco sign, grab a number, & sit wherever you want.  Dining solo for happy hour, I saddled up to the bar.  The menu at Taco Chelo (co-created by Chamberlin & chef Suny Santana) is somewhat limited, but concise & easy to digest.  You've got 4 apps, 5 tacos, 2 salads, & 1 dessert to choose from on the food side.  On the drink side it's more diverse with a fairly wide array of cocktails, beers, wines, & non-alcoholic drinks.  I haven't had mezcal in ages, so I started things off with their Mezcal Paloma.  Lime, ginger, bitters, grapefruit soda, and of course the mezcal itself.  I think they threw in a little house spice mix in there as well for an extra kick.  A very pleasant refreshing beverage to start with a spicy tartness to boot.  For the apps, most are ones you find at most sit down Mexican joints anywhere.  Chicharrones however are somewhat unusual to see on a menu so I grabbed those.  Basically fried pork rinds covered in cotija cheese and chimayo chili mix, with sides of guacamole and Cholula hot sauce.  Mine came with ten pieces in all.  Super crunchy (sometimes rock hard) & messy, but a pretty good vehicle for the guac.  The cheese & spices also work well here (that is of course if you can keep them from flying everywhere).  Now then, this is Taco Tuesday isn't it?  And I was feeling particularly ambitious today.  Taco Chelo's five taco offerings include:  Vegetable, Fish, Carnitas, Carne Asada, & Beef Barbacoa.  Although I'm disappointed they don't offer Al Pastor or Lengua tacos yet, I decided to give all five current varieties a try by ordering one of each.  For those wondering about the veggie, just know that there's a ton of mushrooms in this version.  Mushrooms aren't my thing so I wasn't a fan of their veggie taco, but you might come to a different conclusion than I did.  As for the rest of the tacos, I was mostly impressed.  The tortillas are made fresh by the staff for each order & the meats were quite delicious.  The Barbacoa fell a little flat for me but the Carnitas, Fish, and Carne Asada tacos were perfect.  After all that food, I had just enough room for their one & only dessert.  Their Tres Leches cake dessert is about twice the size of a hockey puck & topped with almonds and orange slices.  Its served cold with a smooth creamy texture, which certainly helps to soothe your mouth after all those spices from earlier.  The flavor profile overall was respectable, though not spectacular.  Total cost for all the food and my drink including tax and tip came to about $45.  First impressions?  A fantastic space and neighborhood hangout with decent (at times great) food & drink options.  My biggest beef is really what's missing from the menu.  Horchata?  Al Pastor?  Lengua? Nowhere to be found.  Even the most basic taqueria should have those offerings (in my humble opinion).  Its early yet so maybe that will be on the menu in due time.  For now, its worth a look if you're curious & definitely a great hangout spot for small groups.  With so much great Mexican food throughout Downtown, its not easy to compete.  Taco Chelo has potential.  Potential I hope they'll be able to fully exploit."}
{"text":"Good food but WAAAYYY too expensive for what you are getting. For $3 you can get 1 taco that consists of a tortilla and steak bits. That's it. The fish taco were a little more expensive but worth it. A side of chips was $3 which I think was not worth the cost for a small bag of chips."}
{"text":"The tacos, chips and salsa and cheese quesadilla were all very yummy! Since this place is new I think they are still working on getting things consistent have been there 3 times and each time was a different food experience. The first time everything was on point. The food came out hot and fresh! Sangria was amazing. The next two times things weren't quite as consistent but they have all new employees so not gonna ding em on that!"}
{"text":"This is literally the best tacos place in Phoenix! The chicharrones are simply delicious!!! Fish, asada and carnitas tacos are awesome!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and vibe at this new taco restaurant. I was happy to try it and since it's still new, they have a couple of kinks to work out. The line was out the door (to be expected- Friday evening AND it's a new restaurant) but we were able to snag a seat shortly after ordering. Drinks are a bit over priced in my opinion (canned Arizona sweet tea). Employees were friendly and attentive. I would recommend telling servers that it's not wise to tell a customer NOT to order something because of the assumed wait (fish tacos). I don't eat pork or beef and came there specifically for fish tacos hehe. We ordered 5 of them plus veggie tacos and they all came out rather quickly. They were very delicious! Would've missed out had I listened to the server (I'm sure she meant no harm) ;-)"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere. It would be great if there was sit down service, but because of the small location, it hard to actually execute. The tacos were good, but not necessarily amazing. I would recommend this place, but not a must."}
{"text":"We stopped in Sunday for lunch to check-out the new taco place in downtown Phoenix.  The atmosphere is lively and fun and the staff was very welcoming.  We took a seat at the bar and ordered some tacos and a side of beans.  The beans were absolutely amazing, but the tacos were just ok - especially considering the stiff competition in our neighborhood with Centrico, Chico Malo and M'Ole.  The meat was not overly flavorful and a little chewy.  Hoping they can work on the recipes and we'll definitely give it another shot!"}
{"text":"The tacos we're delicious and the staff was friendly. I love what they have done to the place. It looks awesome. The fish taco was my favorite of the three I tried. The guacamole and chips we're fresh. Next time I will have to try their margarita."}
{"text":"I think I know a bit about Mexican cuisine.  Lived in Cuernavaca for nearly a year and helped manage a large Mexican themed flea market with two Mexican restaurants.  Since closing it thanks to the Arpayaso I have constantly struggled to find good tacos particularly in central Phoenix.   You will not be disappointed, taco chelo is the result of two creative geniuses putting their heads together to create an upscale taco destination.  Everything is excellent.  You must try it."}
{"text":"I absolutely am in love with this place. The concept is a sit down restaurant, however, you go to a counter at the back of the restaurant to place your order for wonderful specials (they were making tres leches last time I was in), chips with salsa and quac (classic), bomb ass tacos (smaller/serval bits tacos) and dranks on dranks.  So far the sangria has been my favorite. The sangria is sweet enough but not overall sweet. You can also order food if you sit at the bar instead of getting in line for food (lines can take a while during prime time).   Overall decor is colorful and modern with an awesome painting near the bar/large window area in front. The bar is an awesome place to sit for a while and grab a drink or food. For those interested, there is also a tv.  Food - awesome but tacos are slightly small. Decor - modern, fun and flirty Dranks - derriosiois Happy hour - hellll yeah EVERYDAY 3-6 (includes $ margs and sangria) Service - nothing by friendly and helpful  PS Bathroom is not in the same building as the restaurant (you need a key and it's a build over on the back that's connected by an alley)"}
{"text":"Came in on opening day for lunch was treated fantastic. Came in one Friday night sat st the bar for 10 minutes no one said anything to me. Actually moved over a seat so 2 other guys could sit down, they instantly were served drinks and asked about food. Another 10 minutes goes by and have yet to get asked for a drink sitting directly next to the guys who are now getting food served to them whom I moved for. Stood up and walked out not a single person there there said anything to me."}
{"text":"Love the place! one of my go to spot :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic new taco place downtown!  Food and drinks are awesome!  Tortillas are the bomb!  Staff was so friendly.  We will be back....often!"}
{"text":"We missed opening weekend as we were on vacation in Japan for two weeks but upon our return we took the family to Taco Chelo and ordered everything on the menu except the beans and the vegetarian taco. All were excellent with the exception of the barbacoa tacos. The meat was just greasy mush. The flan was the best flan I have experienced in the United States. The drinks were strong and flavorful. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Born and raised in Phoenix, and as a kid rode my bike in this hood, so it's nice to see more business being built here.  I had the fish taco, carne asade taco, and quesadilla with carne asado with corn tortilla, and it was delicious.  You could tell the meat was of high quality and the texture of the tortilla was perfect  The salsa was fresh and even the lime and radish were fresh.    I was impressed with the young kid taking my order who called me \"brother\" and our food came out fast.  My friend asked for no tomatillo in her taco and the server noticed the error and gladly gave her the correct order and the left taco there, so of course, I had to eat it.    Cute place and I will be back."}
{"text":"Pretty cool seeing abuelita behind the glass making the tortias fresh. Great drinks, ok tacos, horrible service. One of the guys working here literally looked so miserable and was unhelpful and rude. I'm here on vacation and I asked for a glass of water and he pointed to the water jug on the side of the bar and looked at me like I was an idiot as if I knew it was there. He also yelled at the crowd for not being in a straight line and asked everyone to make a line out the door in the heat (which is fine I get it things need to be in order) but I just think he could've been a little nicer about it. There were flies everywhere in the outdoor seating it was so uncomfortable that when we finished our first round of drinks we left."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place out! Food was good, had the carne asada taco, a quesadilla with carne, and the barbacoa taco. Also chips and guacamole. Smallish portions but everything was there. Salsas were great! Seemed a bit pricey, but daily HH on drinks is always appreciated. The ordering situation was a little different at first, and I prefer full service, but that's that.  Great music + atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The tacos were delicious and the service was great, but the price per taco is ridiculous. For a carne asada taco, it costed more than $3!! That's insane... I'm not expecting it to be like $1, but damn, $3? Atmosphere is nice and there's outside seating as well. Alcohol is also served at this location! It's near a barcade, so if you get the munchies, it's right around the block. :) Don't think I would come here again if I came back to Arizona; it's a little pricey, but worth the experience."}
{"text":"Portions are small but are well worth the price. Get the carne asada & fish tacos with chips, guac & salsa. Worth every cent."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and the decor. Awesome art and cool vibe. At first I was irritated about waiting in line but the wait honestly wasn't bad. The tacos were super hot and the tortillas were great. Unfortunately, the beans weren't hot. There's no way they were up to temp. The Chelo Salad had great flavors but the amount in my bowl was way different than other bowls coming out. I also noticed that my half filled salsa, guac, and chips didn't compare to my neighbors full order 15 minutes later. The servers were either super nice or less than thrilled, it depended on who you dealt with. Ups and downs that hopefully get worked out. Most importantly- portions should be consistent and food should be hot."}
{"text":"I've been waiting with bated breath for Taco Chelo to open and just like the other Aaron Chamberlin restaurants in the Valley - this one is spot-on.  The decor inside is truly amazing. Every detail is special and the atmosphere is picture-perfect. The only thing I don't like is the counter-service, but just because this place gets so busy!  I ordered the asada, carnitas and fish to get a good spread. Surprisingly, the fish was my favorite. The crisp, freshness was impressive (coming from someone who doesn't usually eat fish).  The drinks are also pretty good. The sangria is a favorite. Very refreshing! The Michelada was unique - kind of a bloody mary, beer fusion. I liked the spice!  Overall, I'm looking forward to seeing this place succeed in the Roosevelt District!"}
{"text":"Great taco place where you can see grandmas in the back making tortillas and tacos. This is a cool place with a great atmosphere and great tasting tacos.  Only thing is their policy on refills is that they are not free."}
{"text":"I stopped by this taco shop and had both fish and carne aside tacos. They were amazing! It's hard to find good mexican food downtown and this place nailed it. The micheladas were spot on and have been back several times. Service is also great. I recommend this Taco joint. Great job."}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the jardin salad and I highly recommend adding fish to give it some extra freshness. It's perfect for a hot day in Phoenix.   This place is amazing. The ambiance is chill and fun and the staff are incredibly friendly. The main chef knows what he's doing. The only negative is the bathroom situation (make sure you guys check on that every once in a while).  Thanks for the amazing experience!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for dinner. Pros: handmade tortillas, tasty mesquite grilled carne asada, cold beer. Cons: salsa was excessively mild,price was too high for the portion sizes, not authentic Mexican. For the same money, we could have gone to Santisimas for a serious taco feast."}
{"text":"In Phoenix, there's no shortage of places to get exceptional tacos. You could blindfold yourself, walk 10 feet in one direction and trip over a place that makes above average Mexican food compared to most of the country. With that being said, I like Taco Chelo. I can't say it's the end all be all destination for what it offers, but it's definitely a place worth trying.  First, I'll say that it warms my heart that they have an employee dedicated to making fresh tortillas right in front of where you order. It primes you for the entire product, because a place that puts that much care into one aspect of their food has to be considerate of all other parts. I ordered a few carne asada tacos, and I was pleased with what I got. The meat is cooked more tenderly than some other places I regularly visit, and that added an interesting layer to the experience. They come with the regular fixings of guac and onions with cilantro, with a few lime wedges on the side and a ramekin of salsa. My personal preferences for tacos tend to lean more towards having the pronounced acidity of the lime juice and some more heat from the salsa. I didn't exactly get that with these tacos. And while they do have Cholula bottles on the tables, that stuff doesn't add the kick that I like. On a side note, one of my dining companions said that the fish tacos are the best she's tried in Phoenix, and I'll mention that to be fair.  It was not bad food by any means, it's just what they're going for maybe doesn't completely align with my tastes in their culinary art.  The staff was friendly and helpful, and water is plentifully available from a larger decanters around the store. They have a bar there, but it's not the kind of place where I would likely drink. If you like a margarita with your tacos, go nuts. I think this place definitely adds value to the neighborhood, and it has food worth eating. So get in there while it's new and hot."}
{"text":"My wife and I were there yesterday for the second time in a week. The tacos are a 6.5 out of 10 the quesadillas however are really good. We are seat at the bar people so we enjoyed the ambiance and my wife loves the pastel de 3 leches. Tortillas are great and salsas are good as well, the best part of our experience however was our bartender (Jose) He was friendly, attentive and extremely cordial. Thx Jose! Friendly service can sometimes make up for the lack of anything else!"}
{"text":"Fun place!  The staff is friendly!  The crowd is hip, college, young!  Started with the chips, salsa, and guacamole. The salsa was full of flavor with some heat!  Guac was fine, normal, not memorable, but good!  Then the veggie taco.... good!  A vegan cheese option would be nice. Anyway, after that, I forgot I was vegan and tried the fish taco. It was crisp and fresh. (A little too much orange sauce)It reminded me of taco trucks in Encinitas.  They need to offer side condiments to go with the tacos. Wine list.....Valle de Guadalupe. Will I come back???  Absolutely!"}
{"text":"Great flavor! Fresh corn tortillas (although sometimes they come out a little chewy) service is ok but not terrible considering it's a walk to order place. Good size beers. The reason for the 3 stars is the price. Like many other people have mentioned, there are many places that are considerably cheaper. I can easily eat more than 5 tacos but at this price you think twice ordering 3. I know that there is no chance in the world they'd lower prices so I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome vibe and good tacos. I had the carne asada, carnitas and fish tacos. By far the carnitas tacos were the best. Nice and juice and flavored well."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great casual atmosphere, and terrific happy hour. Tacos are top notch and the service is excellent. Stopped here on our return from Sedona to Tahoe. Suggest all do the same- really worthwhile.   Hint- park on the side street safe and free!"}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I've got in Phoenix! Definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"This is exactly what downtown needs! Such a cool taco shop with absolutely exquisite decor. It is order at the counter which I typically have a real aversion to, but after I ate, I couldn't hate on it because my food was so gooooood! We ordered tacos, chicharrones and horchata. The menu isn't big, but what was served was really delicious. I'm still thinking of the horchata, and it was the best I've had in a really long time, maybe ever. There were two things that I'd like to make note of, and they are the reason for minus two stars. First, some customers brought a dog into the restaurant, like actually inside. The employees were petting the dog and they were allowed to sit at their table inside the restaurant with the dog while they ate. Now, this was clearly not a service animal, and I don't even need to tell you how the Maricopa County Environmental Services Department feels about this. Big no no for me, I do not need pets where I eat my food. Secondly, the prices are pretty high! For our above mentioned food, we spent over $40. At $3.50 a taco, it adds up quick. There are a lot of good taco options in Phoenix that don't charge near as much, I was a little turned off."}
{"text":"Food was alright. I guess I would recommend this place for drinks and a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Chances are if you don't like tacos we're probably not friends. This place transports you to every nice restaurant in Mexico City. Love the decorations, great music with a very friendly staff. If there is one thing you eat on this earth before you die. Make it the Carne Asada Taco or Carne Asada Quesadilla at Taco Chelo! All five stars given to this place are specifically because of the Carne Asada. Easily one of the best tasting meats I've had on a taco. Don't be surprised if you have one and end up having to order more. That's what happen to me on my very first visit here. The Skirt steak flavor is really that good! Watch out if this place ever gets taco Tuesday deals. There won't be any room in the restaurant to stand."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that my experience is extremely limited as I only ordered chicharrones. Now, I am no expert in pork rinds, but these tasted different than I was used to. They were extremely dense and almost chewy. The guac was fine, nothing special. Our friend thought the salsa had almost a burnt taste to it.   The staff also seemed confused by my ordering. I probably won't return."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite cantina - very chic, tacos are simple, fresh and come out quickly."}
{"text":"A little Mexican restaurant located in the Roosevelt district. The space offers both indoor and outdoor seating. Seating is on the smaller side inside and they have the large style picnic tables outside. With the warm weather coming up it would be nice if there were some covers to block the sun and make it  less hot if dining outside. With that being said, the restaurant is counter service. The menu is pretty simple. They offer a few appetizers, street style tacos and salads. My husband and I ordered two fish tacos, two carne asada, cheese quesadilla, side of beans and chicharones. I thought the tacos lacked flavor and it was a bit on the bland side , but they weren't bad. It just didn't have that wow factor. The price of the tacos weren't to bad but I don't think it was worth 3.50. However the mini quesadilla we ordered was definitely not worth $2 . I did enjoy my pineapple Fresca. It was refreshing and not overly sweet.  The one thing I didn't enjoy was all the flies inside. Since they do leave the door open, there were so many flies and it was annoying trying to shoo the flies away while you ate. On the plus side, staff was friendly and service is fast . Your food comes out fast and it's nice not having to wait long to get your food. If you're looking for a quick bite then this is the place, but if you're wanting to sit down and dine, I would suggest going elsewhere. The foo"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night.  Cute place. Yummy drinks. Tacos we're OKAY.  Probably won't go back for the price of their food and portions."}
{"text":"It looks hip. It's in a hip part of town. So I went for it. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either, and in a city where there's a world of options for good Mexican food, this falls somewhere along the lines of average. The idea is pretty similar to that of a Mexican food truck, but the options more limited; the burrito about half the size of what I'm used to at just under double the price. Quaint little place, and yeah, cool/modern in appearance, but there are better options out there to get my food truck fix."}
{"text":"New taco place in the hip Roosevelt District.  The space was a little smaller than I expected although they do have a back patio.  It seemed like they had a lot of flies inside which was a little bit of a turn off.  I sat at the bar and had a fish taco and a carnitas taco.  The fish taco was my favorite.  Their beers are mostly Mexican but they had a Huss Copper State IPA on tap which was excellent.  At $4 for happy hour it was a great price as well!"}
{"text":"Waited in a long line only to be told they are out of fish - so they weren't serving fish tacos.   Forced to get three veggie tacos which consisted of beans and lettuce.   Pretty obnoxious experience. Minuscule, child-sized tacos."}
{"text":"Two words: Handmade tortillas. Some of the best tacos in downtown for a reasonable price. Very pleasant atmosphere with friendly staff. Will be back many times in the near future."}
{"text":"The overall experience here was just okay. Nothing was bad (aside from the slow and odd service) but nothing was great. The taco meat was very tender but I felt I had to kinda make my own taco by adding avocado/salsa/lime/etc. There was no spice and that was kind of a let down. There was ample staff but most were kinda just wondering around with their heads in the clouds, and the few customers at the bar either had empty drinks or hadn't gotten to order at all. Salsa and gauc served jn very small ramekins.   I don't see myself returning; there are far too many taco joints in the phx to just have mediocrity."}
{"text":"Our favorite gem on  Roosevelt Row ... Taco Chello never disappoints! I highly recommend the Mezcal Paloma!! Hands down best bartender is Anthony, he makes a mean drink and is knowledge about the food menu as well. Tonight i had the Mexican Flag Tamale Special i would show i picture but i ate it to quick - delicious"}
{"text":"Everything was tasty but expensive for the portions. We had a few tacos, sangria, beans, spent a bunch of money even on happy hour pricing and left still hungry. Went to Pop n Tea bar after for desert (left there still hungry and poor too by the way and ended up having second lunch at The Stand). The decor is cute - loved the playful signage and details. Went on gay pride weekend so the area was quite festive and the nice weather brightened up the space."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend. We arrived at 1:00pm and were able to get a table inside. It has a nice interior and a patio in the back that would be great during cooler weather. I was greeted promptly and advised of how to order. You stand in line at the register and place your order and they give you a number and bring your food to the table. I'm not a real big fan of this style of ordering but the process did seem to go quickly. Since I was waiting on my friend I decided to order the chips/salsa/guacamole for $3.50. It was okay however I really wished there had been more guacamole. The salsas had a good flavor and none of them seemed to be really spicy. I ordered 3 tacos as I knew from reading the previous reviews that they were small. I probably would have been fine with just 2 (since I had been snacking on the chips) but I couldn't decide on which ones so I went ahead and went for 3. I ordered the fish, the carnitas, and the carne asada.  All are served with the traditional onions, cilantro, and limes. Hands down my favorite was the carnitas. I just wish there had been more meat in it. The little tablespoon or so just didn't fill up the corn tortilla it was in. The fish was okay but just had too much breading in my opinion. I prefer my fish tacos grilled and unfortunately they do not offer that option. And the carne asada had a good flavor but unfortunately I encountered a giant piece of fat/gristle in my 2nd bite of it and it kind of ruined it for me after that. They only serve bottled soft drinks and bottled iced tea (Pure Leaf) and if you want to add sweetener to your iced tea then you have to make do with their simple syrup from the bar which I despise. So at this point I doubt I will be back anytime soon as I thought the prices for each of the tacos was pretty steep ($3.50-$3.75 each) and I can think of a lot of other places to get street tacos at a better price."}
{"text":"We are so excited to have such good quality tacos so close to our house. The fish tacos are an absolute favorite. The staff and cooks at Taco Chelo know what they're doing and they are doing such an amazing job. We will be returning quite often. So good!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My girlfriend and I went there last night for dinner and already want to go back for more. It is very reasonably priced and the food is delicious. They make their tortillas right there in front of you as you wait in line to order."}
{"text":"Such a great place! The staff greeted me the moment I walked in and handed me a menu. Although the menu is very limited almost everything was perfect. My friend ordered a salad and I must say skip on the salad and go straight for drinks and tacos.  -The chips and salsa were delicious. -The carne asada tacos were delightful! I almost freaked out because my tortilla was green and it made me hesitant to try but they were great.  -My friend had the flour tortilla barbacoa tacos and mentioned that they were really good as well.  -I had the blended margarita and it was good but I must warn you it is strong! So if you plan on drinking do it slowly.  Overall a great atmosphere, great food, and awesome service!"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for dinner on a Friday night and I was so impressed! First of all the location is perfect and the vibe is really fresh. Ordering was super easy but it was hard finding seats (which is a good thing) I'd recommend maybe going on a week night if you want the full experience. We started with the chips and guac and it was really tasty and then our food came out shortly after and it was absolutely delicious. I got 3 tacos (Carne Asada, Barbocoa, and Fish) the fish was probably my favorite but each were super fresh and full of flavor. My Wife got a veggie quesadilla and the Taco Chelo salad and it was perfect, just the right amount of flavors and portion. We dined on the patio and the spring AZ night was the perfect match to go with our evening. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Very nice location and cute little place! Good it's good I just believe their portions are small for the price same with their margaritas! The michelada it's great tho, good size and flavorful! I will definitely come back to check out what's new!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican tacos with warm hand made masa tortillas the way only Mexican abuelitas and moms know how to make. You really can't go wrong with any taco meat choice but the veggie taco is tastier than you think!"}
{"text":"Just okay, had high hopes.  Food was mediocre esp for price, tiny margaritas, mooshy fish in tiny child sized tacos, underwhelming other tacos.. we tried one of each-ugh.... Skimpy on salsa.  Don't plan on drinking there... with the teeny cocktails you will be waiting in the counter line to get another drink!  Dirty tables & hot AF in there, it's Phoenix... we need air conditioning!  And the darn flies everywhere!!  Cute place but meh... do yourself a favor go to Gallo Blanco!  Cheaper, cleaner, a true happy hour & food blows this place away and it's pretty close to Taco Chelo. You will thank me!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant that I frequent! I work & live in the heart of downtown Phoenix. This is by far my go to for a quick lunch during work hours or a great margarita after work. The tacos here are extremely authentic, and the quesadillas are amazing. If you're here and it's your first time, try sitting a the bar. The bar has a great atmosphere and all is the bartenders are super friendly! Ask for Jose, he makes a great margarita and is easy on the eyes."}
{"text":"Nice addition to Roosevelt row. I pass by all the time and decided to go in. Cute and cozy atmosphere that gives the customer her space. A small menu provides some very delicious options. There are daily specials available to change things up. I was a little disappointed that there were no chicken tacos available, but the ones I ordered (fish, barbacoa, and carnita) were all delicious. Also enjoyed a margarita during happy hour, which for the price was fair, though if the size is the same any other time I wouldn't invest. Overall a nice routine place to drop by, but not anything outstanding. Go if you have a chance, but don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"Big difference between when I went during their soft opening and when I went this past Saturday night. During the soft opening mode the fish tacos only had red cabbage. My fish tacos from Saturday night had cabbage, pickled onions, crema, and pico de gallo (everything the menu states). I really wish I would've gotten a picture of my tacos from Saturday because they look significantly different than the picture I already have posted from their soft opening. I've stopped by a few other time, but just for a drink. I'm really glad that Taco Chelo has found their groove and adjusted well past the soft opening/grand opening stages."}
{"text":"Was expecting a lot more out of this place. The location is really cool. Ordered 2 carne asada tacos and a margarita. Date ordered one carne and barbacoa and a margarita. Total $30. The tacos came out and honestly only had the meat on them and a little cup of salsa. No cheese, no greens, no peppers, nothing. We basically paid for four homemade tortillas and grilled meat. Not to mention we had to stand in a super long line, order, then go try to find a place to sit. Pry won't come back unless I start getting a little more bang for my buck."}
{"text":"Love the vibes. I had carne asada and fish tacos and was very impressed. Their micheladas are amazing!"}
{"text":"Where can you go wrong with tacos!!!!  Came in here and after cruising around downtown Phoenix and totally would have to say that this place is radness all around.  It's totally casual dining which is great because it doesn't dent the wallet at all and the food is on point. I have a saying that the only places I will totally trust are places with your mom cooking the food.  Walked in and found a lady working the flatiron cruising and producing the tortillas.  Legit for sure!!!  Literally ordered the menu and was totally in love with everything I put my face to work on.  Had some beers and will have to check out the cocktails next time but I'm on a return path soon!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I found this place! It's my new favorite Mexican restaurant in the downtown area. Great service, delicious food, and a solid drink menu. The staff has always been friendly and great a recommending drinks (*cough* Adrian *cough*). I've been a few times now and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Four stars, date. Great atmosphere but not a lot of flavor in the fish tacos. The Carnitas however were tasty, so perhaps we missed out. Price is reasonable, and the chips and guacamole were good. The salsa was great!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and authentic Mexican food.  There's also something for everyone. Salads and tacos with vegetarian and gluten free options. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had a fish taco and carne asada taco, both plain (because that's how I roll). The Carne Asada taco was excellent. I put on the salsa that came with it and it upped the game. Hot and flavorful. NIce!  The best fish tacos ever made can be found on our Mexican boarder in Nogales. But I'm now bringing to question that previously held belief of mine. This fish taco was awesome! Although it only got one small strip of deep fried fish, it was hot, crispy and delicious.   Welcome to 5th Street v2! So far, so great."}
{"text":"Taco Chelo is a little taqueria that recently opened up in that uber-cool area of Roosevelt. You know that neighborhood where all those giant apartment buildings mysteriously popped up overnight and look over a strange mixture of tiny homes that are either business-operated or completely abandoned? Yeah, that's the place. Graffiti is welcome. Parking is not. But Taco Chelo fits right in just fine. And it has a St. Francis connection to boot.  They had only been open for about a week when my girlfriend and I visited, so I was surprised to see a line going out the door this early in the game. But a lot of that has to do with the setup. Chelo has a little bar, but for food, they're shooting for the good ole' \"order at the counter\" approach. If you walk in through what appears to be the front door, you'll be very confused, as it's actually the exit. The beeline starts around back. It's a bit weird.  Given the layout of the restaurant, I'm not so sure if this is the best idea and I wouldn't be surprised if they eventually abandon it - especially if they want their servers earning tip money. It just felt like kind of a mess.  The menu is fairly simple, with a few appetizers and traditional street tacos that fall somewhere in-between taco truck prices and hoity-toity taco prices. They might want to update their website, because the big bowl of guac pictured on their menu isn't quite an accurate representation of the actual teaspoon-sized serving in a plastic cup that you actually get. Nevertheless, their guacamole was excellent, or at least what little of it I was actually able to try. Their quesadilla, although much smaller than what you're probably accustomed to, was also a respectable starter.  The menu on their website states that their tacos come with lime, but ours did not. My girlfriend had to cut through the line to request them, which they had to retrieve from the bar. In terms of their flavor, it's sort of a mixed bag. We both found the carnitas to be a bit too dry, while the barbacoa was just so-so and pretty much comparable to what you'd find at any run-of-the-mill taco place. The asada was actually a bit surprise, having a nice smoky flavoring that I wasn't expecting. We would have been better off just ordering a plateful of those.  When we left, the line was even longer, so clearly many people are very eager to try this place. And given their whole trendy and lively setup, I'm sure they'll do just fine. But to put it bluntly, it's really nothing groundbreaking. Everything you can find here can also be found within spitting distance. But prices are reasonable and the food is mostly decent, but as a few other reviewers have noted: Competition is stiff.   Check them out."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed. For the hassle with parking i wish I could say the tacos were worth the hoopla but they were just ehhhh basic tacos nothing amazing. The vibe was cool, it's small inside with a nice patio. For it to be a taco stand with a pretty basic menu the tacos just weren't worth all the effort. I asked for their 3 most popular which were fish,steak and pork all just ok. My friend had the veggie and fish she sd the veggie was better so there's that."}
{"text":"Place was packed and we had to order to rather than sit outside where it was super sunny and hot. Would really like to see some west side shades added. Had the green chicken tamal which had a good moist masa and great green chile flavor but very light on the chicken. The asada tacos were the perfect seasoned grilled meat, the fish taco was a big chunk of fish, and the quesadilla had that mexican griddle flavor and perfectly salted cheese. The horchata had real authentic rice grains and was also perfectly made not too sweet or cinnamony or milky. Yum can't wait to come back and try the other meals."}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the al pastor tacos and my group shared the trio of chips. Great outdoor seating! Definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"After seeing Taco Chelo featured on DTPHX's Instagram, I was intrigued and decided to check it out with some girlfriends for taco Tuesday.  Located in the Roosevelt district, we thought parking would be challenging but it wasn't, we found several open meters near Bliss/Rebar and walked.  The space is very well done, the ambiance is perfect for the area. It has a similar vibe to Joyride Taco, though a little less hipster and a little more urban. There is both indoor and outdoor seating available, but the space is on the smaller side. While we were able to snag a picnic table outside right away, others didn't appear to be so lucky.  The restaurant is counter service so we waited in a pretty long line to order, even at 7:30. I ordered a quesadilla, the taco chelo salad and chip & guac, whereas my friends ordered a quesadilla and carne asada tacos. Everything was delicious and fresh except the salad (pictured). The ingredients were all cut in different sizes which made it hard to eat and the overall flavor was just blah.   The portions are small. The tacos and quesadillas are made on street taco sized tortillas, so if you're hungry know you'll want to order more than one. That being said, the prices I felt were reasonable.  I'm looking forward to going again and trying the tacos and beans!"}
{"text":"Taco Chelo has stole my heart!!! Finally we have a taqueria downtown. The food is amazing and service is wonderful! One down fall is sometimes they sell out on certain meats due to it being popular. Other than that amazing new place in downtown Phoenix"}
{"text":"I had barbacoa, steak and fish tacos, my favorite one was the steak one, the barbacoa one was my second fave.  On the fish one I'll say it needed a little something, not sure what.  Their corn tortillas I thought we're pretty good.   This place gets five stars cause the staff was really nice, the food overall was pretty good and they delivered the food fast.  Coming back to try their frijoles a la charra and their tres leches."}
{"text":"We have been following this place for a while now and anticipated the grand opening! Found out it was finally open and took the hour drive from Buckeye.. we were not disappointed. For being opening day, we were impressed. Great margarita, beans were yumm, and tacos got 2 thumbs up. We even enjoyed the music playing. Waited about 30 minutes for food, which we expected, but we were very hungry. The staff noticed and kindly brought us flan on the house. It wasn't your standard flan, but more of a panna cotta texture, it was good. We can't wait to be back (sans kids) and try some of the other options. Overall, portions were on the small side, but great food. Kudos to the team."}
{"text":"Very nice place the food is great. You are in the area check it out u won't regret it."}
{"text":"Experience: A foodies aesthetic dreams! From the modern frida khaki pictures to cool led lighting, the place is VIBRANT and filled with picture perfect decor! I enjoyed laughter and a open space both indoor and outdoor.   Drinks: I was quite happy with the options of Jarritos! They also had other drink options ranging from alcoholic, to non alcohol like horchata, and even agua freska. I really want to try their horchata and agua freska next time!   Food: The fish tacos... GET IT! The perfect balance between a savory batter and a drizzle of sour lemon squeeze!!! The tortilla wasn't soggy and tasted warm and fresh! My friends lived the vegetarian tacos, so I deff want to try them next time. For meat eaters, they have that option too.   Would I go back: So the place was a bit pricy for single tacos, but I'd still consider going back because of the ambiance and tacos."}
{"text":"this joint is a great spot for a bite with friends. the outdoor patio is friendly and comfortable. the tacos are delicious, if a bit expensive"}
{"text":"I liked the resturant's vibe. I thought the flavor of the tacos was good.  The corn tortillas are fresh and that stands out anytime you get a taco. We ordered the fish, carnitas, and carne asada tacos.  We preferred the carnitas and fish was pretty good too.  The carne asada was just a carne asada taco, nothing really stood out.  The reason it's just a-ok is the price. The serving size is pretty small. It's not much more then you'd expect with a street taco so like you'd need a lot to actually get full off of them.  I've been to numerous hole in the wall places and mexican grocery stores that have fresh tortillas so that's not enough to justify the price to me.  Can't say I'd be inclined to come back."}
{"text":"The food is not the greatest.  The price is not so good.  The space is pretty cool, looked like the Bar was nifty.  I am a bit to thrifty, so I will say this place is not so nifty.  I will get my taco Tuesday fix at a different spot."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Roosevelt Row! Super great quick service and enjoyable ambiance creates a welcoming and warm environment. My favorite by far is the fish tacos - I will definitely be back! The kitchen is an open concept, there is a gal making every single tortilla by hand! It's mesmerizing. I love the walkability is the location, give you that authentic downtown feel!"}
{"text":"This taqueria is dope! They brought the Mexican street tacos into an art gallery. The asada and barbacoa tacos are really good - the tortillas hecho a mano is an excellent touch."}
{"text":"I tried this place on 6/21 and again today thinking \"maybe the first time was just a bad day for them.\" Both times the tacos were underwhelming. Although the tortillas were really good, the meat severely lacked seasoning and at $3.75 per taco, you expect them to at least taste better than your neighborhood Filibertos, Vaqueros, etc. The chips and salsa were great, but not worth returning for. Very disappointing considering how everyone raved about this place."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Pricey tacos that aren't very special at all. Couldn't distinguish them from Tacos Chiwas as far as taste (not a compliment). If you're a taco snob from Deep South Texas where street tacos are a religion and dining at a taquer√≠a is like attending mass, then this place isn't for you. It's not a gringo taco place either but there's absolutely no reason to pay $14 for 3 tacos and beans unless you're ok with paying for the trendy Roosevelt Arts District venue. If you want a tastier taco with the same side of trendy and high prices then opt for Gallo Blanco in the Garfield District instead. The menu selection and bar will keep you more entertained there anyway. The service here is lackluster. Servers had a flat affect at best. Finally, the worst part of this trip was the charro beans. They mix them here with escabeche. Normally, I'd be overjoyed but I couldn't get past the extreme saltines of these charro beans. I couldn't even finish more than 3 spoonfuls. For street tacos at the best price, you still can't beat Charlie's in the Melrose District. And even then, meh. Man, I miss Texas!"}
{"text":"This is place is fire. I see some comments about people complaining for a long line.....well yeah that's a good sign! Patience people...Also, the servers are friendly and they have a real life Nana making the tortillas for you. It's great. My fav is definitely the fish tacos. I took a date here but then I realized one of my ex girlfriends is a bartender here. Now i can't go on Saturday's lol. Seriously though check this place out, it's very good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Taco Chelo had me eating in my driver seat! I know my fellow yelper friend (Andrea S.) loves this place so I had to give it a try when hunger stroke! I am one super duper picky taco eater and these tacos were up to standard.  I ordered the Chicarones which paired nice with the guacamole and hot sauce that all fall under the same price, no guac extra here! They were crispy and topped with Oxaca cheese I would absolutely order again, try them out for yourself and find out why I reccomend it!  The fish taco was my favorite and with the pickled red onion, it paired famously! The fish was crisp and fresh, shoulda ordered 2!  The carne asada taco was also very tasty and not too busy. The cilantro and chopped onion complemented the meat and didn't over power the meal. Thumbs up for both!  Next go around I must try the tres leches and of course, my favorite meal: margaritas!"}
{"text":"Damn good tacos - five different kinds to choose from.  We had the fish, carne asada and carnitas, and all were excellent.  You can save a couple bucks on your draft beer during happy hour, and they have a nice selection.  I like the fact they do not have a huge menu.  In fact it's rather small. But that means they're focused on making a few things very, very well.  I'll become regular."}
{"text":"So my wife and I thought we would give this a try. We enjoy St. Francis and we LOVE Public Market. This place left us a bit flat.  You should defiantly give it a shot.  The staff was great! The service and ambiance is great. I read some complaints about the meat ratio. But, I don't expect a ton on \"street tacos\". I thought the ratio was fine. The corn tortillas were really good and fresh.   However, we ordered the chips, salsa and guacamole. They told us they were out of guacamole, but we could do the chips and salsa if we would like. Sure! No problem. Except the still charged us for the \"chips, salsa and guacamole\". Still, not that big of a deal. That is rookie employee mistake.  10 min later, they start serving guacamole again. Never bothered to bring us any, even though we paid for it. I feel that is bad coaching.   Margarita was good! Defiantly had tequila in it!!! You could taste it, for sure. I get them OTR, because I like paying form more than ice. I have never had this much ice in a OTR margarita.  We will go back, once they work the kinks out. I defiantly think you should give it a try."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Definitely recommend the fish or carnitas tacos. Chips are bomb too. Emily helped me and she was amazing. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great tacos! Home made and freshly grilled! You can watch the chefs make the tortillas as your order. Amazing tacos but i feel that the price is a little on the high end. The taste of the food is a 5/5 but i gave it a 4/5 due to price. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Great location, ambience and food! A much needed hip addition to Roosevelt row! Very economical with easy parking."}
{"text":"Great Tacos! The Carnitas was the best one! And then with a margarita was perfect you need at least 2! If u have room for dessert make sure u get a piece of their tres leches cake which had an orange taste to it which made it delicious!"}
{"text":"Pretty pleased with our visit here. Food was tasty and good for belly of my being. Really enjoyed the Chips plate and Fish Taco. My kids enjoyed their food as well; Carnitas and Quesadilla. Definitely a place to bring friends from out of town to eat. Eating space outside is nice (only off-thing, someone warped gold lines on a landmark mural that's been treasured for years)."}
{"text":"Really cool interior and location   I got the carne asada, carnitas, and fish taco. All good!  You have to order up front while waiting you can't miss the ladies making fresh tortillas and chips.   They were out of Barbacoa . Damnit !  The fresh tortilla chips with guacamole and salsa was the best part,  not saying everything else was not good but sometimes the simple things can really excel."}
{"text":"My brother actually told me to try out this place and I am sure glad I did! The corn tortillas were made right there in front of us and they were honestly the best tacos I've ever had! The menu is limited as well as the seating inside but it's absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and friendly staff. Had I not known you order at the counter from previous reviews then I would have been really confused walking in on how to order.  The counter you order at just looks like the side of the bar. I ordered a fish taco, veggie taco, and chips and salsa/guac. The fish taco was yummy, good flavor and a nice crunch on the fish, the veggie taco was just okay. The veggie taco didn't have a ton of texture, just soft zucchini, beans, and pico, also they put arugula on it and it gave it a weird taste and again a soft texture that I really didn't like. The salsa was great but they all come in very small plastic cups and the portions are small. Would be hard to share with two people if both are fans of guac as the portion is teeny tiny. Nothing really special with those expect the guac was nice and chunky! With both tacos being 3-4 dollars I really expected more. Cute place with a lot of potential but as of now I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Finally made it out here! Tacos were great, quick service despite the lunch hour. I love the tortillas, nothing like a fresh corn tortilla. The barbacoa reminds me of what I grew up eating versus the more common one in red salsa. The beans were also very tasty. Overall great spot for some authentic tacos!"}
{"text":"What is there to not love about this place? Aesthetics are popping and the food is even better. Quality ingredients done by quality people. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was excited to go to this place because we have very little Mexican food in the area that is worth it. The place itself was extremely cool and I liked the vibe. The food was extremely lack luster. You can get more flavorful meat from Food City. I'm not sure what the idea was behind this restaurant, but perhaps they can create a more flavorful marinade or at the very least brown the carnitas. Maybe don't squirt globs of cream on my fish taco? I probably won't go here again. Habaneros makes a much better platter that blows this place out of the water.   I wish you the best in your taco experiences. I tried the carnita, carne asada, and fish. Bland, just very meh."}
{"text":"The food is good, not great. The wait to get the tacos is horrible. No side salsa and for such a expensive taco they are skimpy with the meat!! Look at all that extra tortilla."}
{"text":"Tacos are pretty good here. I tried the asada and barbacoa tacos and I really liked the asada tacos. The barbacoa tacos did not have a lot of flavor and where not as good as the asada tacos. The chips and salsa and guac was amazing. I did not like the horchata because it tasted very grainy. The tacos where about $3.50 each and it was pretty expensive for just tacos. The tortilla is made by hand but I still think the price is expensive for the tacos. Also, you have to order your food at the register and then you sit down and they will bring out your food. Overall, I found more negatives than positives for this place so we will probably not be returning."}
{"text":"The food is really good but the prices are too much. I don't think $3. 75 or $3.50 is even worth these tacos. If they added more meat or toppings or even added some kind of side to it than yes but as for now I don't think the price of these tacos are worth paying for. Good taste but not worth the price. I'd still go back but, not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Taco Chelo is a great and fun addition to the area. Since it is new, there tends to be a little wait on weekends. There is not a lot of seating inside, but if you wait a bit I'm sure you will be able to find a table outside by the time your food starts arriving.   I was originally planning on ordering three tacos, but saw some tamales on the specials menu and decided to switch my order to two tacos and a tamale.   I got one veggie taco, which was okay but not amazing. My second taco was the Fish, which was my favorite part of the meal. Unfortunately, because it was my favorite, I decided to save it for last and by then it was no longer hot and crispy. So I recommend eating your fish taco first! The tamale I got was cheese and pepper, which was also tasty but nothing special.   To start we ordered the chips and guacamole, which also comes with two salsas. I enjoyed all of the dips but was not amazed by the chips. I was also sad to learn that they do not do refills for the chips, which is a little disappointing considering that places with free chip service do refills."}
{"text":"Stopped in during their soft opening.  Great fresh food. Friendly service.  Fun atmosphere.  Best of luck to the owners & staff."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican fare, but the service and setup leave a lot to be desired.   I grabbed a variety of tacos with the fish being the best. Nice crisp batter and great flavor. The tortillas are really good, homemade with great texture. Salsa has a nice smokiness and def has a little kick.   But the real big issue was the service. Couldn't get a napkin or a refill on water. Servers were just chit chatting in the back with no regard for their customers.   You also have to grab a key to use the bathroom which is behind the building and all the way around the back. Basically you're walking down an alley to get there and there was zero toilet paper.   On top of having to pay for parking the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended). The food was good but still wouldn't put it in the pantheon of great tacos we have in the valley and really isn't worth the hassle and the poor service."}
{"text":"Obligatory write-up. Just wanted to give 5 stars.  Get your shit together, Yelp. Sarah and Anthony and Amelia are awesome!"}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos tasted like they were the scrapings off of the grill. Sort of overpriced for small tacos. I like my ghetto taco trucks better."}
{"text":"I came in here with high hopes that this was going to be my go to taco shop and although the tacos are decent 6.76/10 the price for them suck. If they were at a decent price I'd go back but they are all small portions and don't ask for guacamole because the portion size is sample size"}
{"text":"Chicharones were already out at 6pm...not a good start. Ordered chips salsa and guacamole instead. Salsa is decent but guacamole is clearly no better than bad grocery store guacamole. But then the real food arrives. We had to go back to order more. The carnitas is the best I've ever had and the beans are amazing. Definitely worth the visit. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Busy night as it was first Friday but Kaitlyn working the register was super nice and really awesome throughout the dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for so long for this place to open, finally went today and didn't have a great experience. It's really hard for a place that sells alcohol to be counter service. My friend and I wanted to leave our tabs open so we could easily order additional food and margaritas. Unfortunately this couldn't have been further from the truth. We ended up waiting in line at the counter, to be told we had to order at the bar, then at the bar they told us we couldn't order food. It was very confusing, and the lady helping us made it seem like it was our fault, but we were just doing what we were told.   Then many of our orders came out wrong. We kept having to remind the employees what we were missing from our order. I assume this will get worked out as they continue.  If you're a vegetarian this probably isn't the place for you. They only have one vegetarian taco and there are no substitutions (I'm picky and hate mushrooms, so I was bummed about that). However, my meat-eating friends liked their food. Also the margaritas were pretty good. I'd maybe come back if they went away from counter service. I love margaritas but don't want to have to wait in line and close out a tab every time just to get one."}
{"text":"Firt time authentic carne asada flavor.. Horchata water amazing..so delicious ..fish tacos great .."}
{"text":"M'eh food in a great setting poorly managed.  Be sure to go on an off night as they simply can't effectively handle a rush.  Ambience done well, but otherwise they really need to step up their service game."}
{"text":"We never dined at Taco Chelo's and decided to stop in to give it a try for dinner. These were some of the best tacos we've ever eaten. We had fish, carnitas and barbacoa tacos along with some chips and salsa. Fish tacos were cooked perfectly, with tasty toppings, radish lime and a mayo based smooth sauce. Really good!!!  Carnitas were also really good with onion and cilantro. Pork was super tender. But the star of our taco feast, hands down, was the barbacoa beef taco. This 2 day slow cooked beef melted in your mouth. And so flavorful with a slight kick of heat. This was the best taco I've ever had. Nice surroundings and super friendly help."}
{"text":"There are so many great taco places in Phoenix but this is just not one of them for me. The interior is beautiful. Horchata is spot on and I would get that again. The tacos were not good. Two of us tried the vegetable taco, fish taco, carne asada taco, and barbacoa taco. Vegetable taco was inedible. Fish taco was not bad and had a large piece of fish. The others were super fatty/greasy and gave us stomach aches. The service was not the best either.  I do not think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this restaurant is super cute. Extremely.    A friend and I came in for HH, narrowly missing lines out the door to get some tacos and drinks. This place has drink specials, but no food specials. Anyway, we ordered a margarita, a sangria, and two tacos (pork and beef I think). It was all....ok. The tacos were plain, nothing bad, nothing mind blowing. I think a 3-4$ taco should be better than ok. The drinks were suuuuuper strong! You could really feel them. Despite that (or maybe because of it), they weren't super tasty. Anyway, I want to try Chelo again after they've been open a bit longer and will update!"}
{"text":"I'm a taco-holic, so any new taco restaurant s perk me up! Got a chance to try Taco Chelo in downtown Phoenix. The ambiance is nice, down to earth and comfortable. It is stand-and-order, and they bring the Your food to your table. I ordered the Carne Asada and Carnitas tacos. The meat was freshly cooked and had a wonderful flavor. They were topped with onions and cilantro, and came with a side of salsa. Food came out fairly quickly. I also ordered chips and salsa, for an appetizer, but all the food came at once. Overall, a good experience. I'll be back  Anthony is a great server!"}
{"text":"The food was okay here. My favorite of what we ordered was the chips, salsa and guacamole. The salsa was great and had many flavors in it! I also ordered the Taco Chelo salad with fish. I did not enjoy the salad that much. The greens were just lettuce - I would have enjoyed mixed greens more. The dressing was nice and light and tangy. However I wish the fish was more flavorful and that the outside was crispier and the breading less doughy. When I dunked the fish in salsa it tasted much better.  Also the doors were open and a lot of flies were bothering us!"}
{"text":"Stopped in late at night. The atmosphere was relaxed, not very busy for the unsatisfactory service we received. The food was decent, but the two male bartender/servers were not so friendly and the rest of the staff seemed to be the same. After ordering, we weren't checked in on, my cup was empty and not once were we asked by any waitress or bartender if we'd like a refill. We waited about another 30 min for them to give us the bill. Very disappointed in a place we were looking forward to coming to."}
{"text":"I'm sure this establishment means well and they have a concept. But it's really sad to see how much revenue they are losing by making people get in line for food and then for drinks. That's just a horrible way to run a bar/restaurant. The food is alright. The quesadilla was my favorite. But the meat needs some work because it tastes really cheap. Only one bartender, and he can't keep up. There were only 4 people at the bar.  The concept and place are cute. But their food is a 2 or 3 for the price."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Lilly was extremely helpful and made our party feel at home... cool music and atmosphere... AMAZING guacamole, tacos, and Palomas!!!!"}
{"text":"I order a carne asada, pork and barbacoa taco and out of those the barbacoa taco was the better of the three. The salsa they used in the tacos was very salty and no spice really. I got 1/4 of a lime for a total of 5 tacos and also no salsa choices for I actually got the tacos. The pork taco, carnitas, was my least favorite and had the least amount of flavor. Overall the tacos aren't worth the price, maybe 1.25 but really no more. The servers are super cool and quick to help, seating is first come and i recommend if you're are in a group to have someone wait in line while you grab a table. Traditional banda, norte√±o and etc music. The place a cool little spot.  Tequila selection was not great and had more wine which was disappointing."}
{"text":"Cool place, interesting location, beautiful building, good food. The chips, salsa, and guacamole were really good, especially the guacamole! Great offering of bottled Mexican sodas and nonalcoholic drinks. The carnitas taco was okay and the carne asada taco was above average, but nothing out of this world. (Arizona just has too many good tacos to choose from!) Overall, I really liked this place and would definitely visit again. Also, the service was quick and efficient, even on a Friday night, which is a big bonus."}
{"text":"Great little stop on Roosevelt Row. Fast and friendly, clean, and most of all - delicious. Tacos were very good and my El Chelo Salad was top-notch. Loved the agua fresca with basil, cucumber, and mint. Their bar menu was also terrific. Sitting outside on a lovely spring day in downtown Phoenix with chips, guacamole, and a beer ... what's better than that???"}
{"text":"Very cool space, great concept and reasonably priced. First, I'll admit I'm a fan of the operator, I think all his restaurants are unique both in the food and ambiance. Taco Chelo doesn't disappoint in either. The indoor/outdoor space is perfect for the March weather! The murals, artwork and finishes give it a great feel. I thought the prices were fair for what you got, but if you are hungry go ahead and over order! We had the fish tacos, vegetarian tacos, carne asade quesadilla, an excellent salad, chips, salsa and guacamole....they have two types of salsa caution one is hot! Everything we ordered was fresh, made to order and tasted great. Our two children were asking for 2nds! There were plenty of vegetables included as well.  I would highly recommend Taco Chelo. Easy to get to as it is right off the 1-10 and 7th Street. Be prepared to wait a little bit which is what you want in a restaurant that serves fresh food! Congratulations Aaron on another great spot!"}
{"text":"Great street tacos. My favorite were the fish and pork. Beef, no so much. Chips, salsa and guac were first rate. Friendly service and nice place. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic tacos. Great looking buildout. You have to wait in line to order but that's ok because you can watch a sweet old lady make tortillas. Great addition to roosevelt district"}
