{"text":"I recently came in with my daughter while visiting colleges, we were waited on by Nicole and Mike, super helpful and friendly.had the yummiest French Blonde cocktail! My mouth is watering!   We started with steak tartare and endive salad.. delish! Loved the spice walnuts on salad. I  Had the rabbit and loved it ( sorry rabbit owners) my daughter had the steak which she loved as well, she was worried peppercrust might be too much but it was perfect! Grand Marnier creme brûlée totally perfect. Great atmosphere and convenient to our hotel. And special thanks for helping guide us on college visit!!"}
{"text":"I don't normally take to to write reviews but I thought this place was so poor that I had to share.  First - the atmosphere is unchanged from Sonoma and is looking old and tired.  Second - the service was horrible - they had no idea what they were doing.  Third - the food was mediocre at best.  There are too many good restaraunts in Pittsburgh for this to survive.  If you're looking for good french food and a sweet experience go to Paris 66 in the East End."}
{"text":"I went with a group of six people to check out the new Le Lyonnais downtown. We made reservations for the bar area and when we arrived, we were greeted warmly and professionally. Since there were so many of us, we decided to split a few appetizers to get a broader sampling of the menu. Two people in our group had never had French food before, so we were excited to have them try some new things. We went with the Chèvre Chaud (the clear favorite of the group; we ordered two), Tartine Aux Crevette, and two cheeses fresh from the Cheese Cart. It was served with warm, fresh bread and seasoned butter. It all was delicious. Their bread is from the local Five Points Bakeshop and it was amazing. Just based on the bread alone, I could tell I was going to enjoy my meal. The menu is nice and easy to read; especially because they have pronunciations next to some of the challenging words. Everyone had fun reading them and it made the experience seem interactive and casual; not always my experience at French restaurants. For dinner, I ordered the Onion Soupe Gratinée, my boyfriend ordered the Blanquette de Veau (veal), a couple friends ordered the Lapin Chasseur (Rabbit) and RAVED about it, Saumon en Papillotte (very light and fresh), and another had the Boeuf Bourguignon. Everyone was absolutely satisfied and said they couldn't wait to come back and try other things. Our waitress was attentive and knowledgeable about the food and drinks. There's something for almost everyone on the menu. The dishes are fun and different. The food is delicious and authentic. I think this is the kind of restaurant Pittsburgh was missing... an authentic, unique French bistro with affordable prices and a great happy hour. What a gem! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"If you love slow, indifferent, lazy service with a bad attitude from your bartender then you'll love this place.  A friend and I were in there last night--a relatively slow Monday.  The bartender (short, dishwater blonde) made some pretty nice Manhattans, but otherwise the experience wasn't good.  And I had the trio of pate, which was presented well on the plate, but all three pates were sub-standard.  Yick."}
{"text":"When the restaurant was known as Sonoma Grille, I usually loved the food and hated the service. In its new incarnation, everything is unfortunately the same except for the name and the menu. When asked which vegetables were used in preparing the Saumon in Papillotte, the waiter told us some turned out to be incorrect. Why wouldn't he know?   Why does this restaurant take so long to get food to its customers? We waited 20 minutes after ordering to have bread brought to our table. Then, after the waiter assured us that our food would \"be right out,\" another 10 minutes went by without being served. How long should a salmon filet take? 9 minutes tops. When I brought this to our waiter's attention, he patted my hand and told me to calm down. I was annoyed, but not flailing. Where does he get the nerve to put his hand on me?  The manager was of little help. There was some sort of problem in the kitchen. That's what we were told last time there was a long delay. Both times we were one of only a few parties in the restaurant, early in the shift. The new menu looks interesting, and the salmon was delicious, but I can get interesting and delicious food served all over downtown Pittsburgh, promptly and without being touched by the servers."}
{"text":"Hello cheese, wine and Pittsburgh foodies: I had the opportunity to eat here last night and it exceeded my expectations! Perfectly designed menu including pronunciations of French cuisine, I ordered the salmon dish and my fiancé ordered the rabbit--which he never had before. Both were fantastic and we couldn't stop raving about it the remainder of the night. Reasonably priced with a great atmosphere, I encourage everyone to try this out!"}
{"text":"Fantastic apps,  happy hour was very affordable.   The trio of  pate's was excellent."}
{"text":"I found my way here from the Rennaissance, just 10 min walk. Great wine list, I just missed happy hour which ends at 7 but I had a lovely Tartine of grilled shrimp and a wonderful white Cote de Rhone. The bar staff were friendly and attentiveness. Atmosphere was welcoming and comfortable."}
{"text":"Most enjoyable and delicious dinner recently .  Interesting  first courses and good entres. Chicken, fish , beef, rabbit and quenelles, a gentle fish purée in a marvelous tomato sauce. Good wine list that Sebastian guided us through.  Food a bit slow coming out of the kitchen. For sure we will back."}
{"text":"Came here for an impromptu dinner after a happy hour elsewhere. We had high hopes and were not disappointed. The pate trio was amazing. The waiter gave great recommendations. Great French flavors and was well worth it. We totally would order again. We also ordered the Beef Bourgogne. It was not in the style we had in France, but it was equally as good in its own right.   The Happy Hour is what I plan on pushing the office work crew to go to soon. $2 domestics and some $5 drinks. In addition there are some great Happy Hour snacks and French apps. Looking forward to the next visit. If you work downtown, you have no excuse not to try it. It's where Sonoma used to be on Penn.  9/21/17 Update I've been back multiple times with girlfriends. Love this place. Even my picky husband loves this place!"}
{"text":"Food was better than expected. Wine as well. Went for a Bordeaux.  They wheel out a variety of cheeses for you to choose from; very nice.  I had pork tenderloin, wife had New York strip steak.  Parmesan frittes are frittes done right.  Big frittes guy.  Had to try the poutine as well. Stellar poutine.  Would return. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Only been here once for lunch. Based on my one visit, the service was a tad slow, especially since the rest of the restaurant was pretty dead.   I ordered the beef bourguignon baguette sandwich. I was unimpressed. I expect beef bourguignon to be really saucy and there was no sauce on it! Just came with some sautéed mushrooms and lardons that were too chewy and fatty for my taste. The truffle fries on the side though were solid.  I really want a French restaurant to do well downtown and so will come back again and give it another shot and maybe try some more items. But pretty disappointing first experience."}
{"text":"We called for a reservation for 6 at 9. Everything was confirmed. Got to the restaurant and was told they did not have our reservation. Things happen, I understand that...the hostess was argumentative and acted like we were ganging up on her just by asking about our reservation.  No apology, no let me see what I can do...just dismissed."}
{"text":"Wanted to try the latest Yves Carreau creation. Started with traditional cocktails, 4 in total, all mixed beautifully. Crusty house baguette with an herb/honey type butter that was delicious. Surprisingly the restaurant itself was empty - Let's go Pittsburghers, new restaurant concept / new menu / same great chef!! Service was friendly, we sat at the hi-tops in the bar area and the staff walked us through the whole menu at my request.  CHÈVRE CHAUD Roasted Goat Cheese | Bacon | Honey | Rosemary A generous square of goat cheese baked with a bacon party wrapped around it. Tasty yes, potential to be better, yes. Very greasy with underdone floppy bacon around it. And I wasn't sure how to eat it... so I spread it on the complementary baguette, that worked well. Rosemary flavor was hard to find - coming from the girl who uses way too much rosemary at home.  BOURGUIGNONNE Tartine Braised Beef | Caramelized Onion | House Made Garlic & Herb Boursin | Baguette Generous portion as well, 2 long sliced on the bias hunks of baguette topped with the above. The caramelized onions were a little less than caramelized but still a delicious accompaniment to the beef and boursin.   SALADE LYONNAISE Bacon Lardons | Poached Egg | Croutons I'm not even a salad person, but this was one of the best salads I've ever had and I WILL get this next time. It has a very light and fresh vinaigrette dressed on it. Mix in the egg and go to town!  LAPIN CHASSEUR Rabbit Leg Confit | Boar Sausage and Wild Mushroom Ragu | Ratatouille Exotic meats are a favorite of mine lately, so when presented with the opportunity to get both rabbit and boar I jumped on the opportunity. This rabbit leg was phenomenal. It was cooked perfectly, tender, crispy and so much flavor, I'd order it again just for that. I couldn't find the wild boar and mushroom parts, perhaps it was left off by accident. The veggie ratatouille had eggplant, green and red peppers in it.  All in all, I'll go back. Everything else on the menu looks delicious and I am interested in trying the braised veal and lamb. Also looking forward to breaking into a bottle of French red wine ASAP. Service was good, knowledgeable suggestive staff, excellent bartenders, plates were coursed well, plating was impeccable, temperatures were on point, dessert was offered but politely declined, prices reasonable. Having never been to Sonoma in all the years it was here, I'm glad I went to try something different. See you again."}
{"text":"The last restaurant I visit during my stay in Pittsburgh was a spot that was on my radar from day one. This restaurant used to be something else, but then was reborn as a French restaurant a few weeks before my visit. It had nice outdoor seating, but my colleague and I decided to sit inside.  The inside was large and open, with high ceiling that created feeling of even larger space. They had plenty of seating, and with the front wall facing the street wide open, it was filled with natural light. Very relaxing and welcoming atmosphere.  This restaurant offers \"French comfort food\". Which to me is unique and unusual. When I think of \"French cuisine\" I think of fancy. Here, your opinion of French food can be changed a bit. The owner and the chef at Le Lyonnais is from Lyon, France and wanted to share simple, affordable, yet delicious dishes inspired by food that he grew up with. Nice!   For the main course, I wanted something light, so I ordered a salad. I went with Salade Lyonnaise. Our waitress asked if I wanted add protein like chicken or salmon, and without thinking, I said \"salmon\" which added extra $4. Now, if I had known how huge this salad was going to be, and how huge the salmon was going to be, I would have said \"no\" to salmon... I mean, it was really, REALLY big!  I also had Parmesan & White Truffle Frites and I shared desserts with my colleague. We got Grand Marnier Crème brulée and Mousse au Chocolat.   I had a great time here, delicious food and drinks, warm and welcoming service. I wish if this restaurant was in NYC. Our waitress Lisa took a great care of us with a big smile, gave us nice recommendation and we were never rushed. A funny thing about their menu is that each items had its correct pronunciation next to it, like \"LYONNAISE [Lee-Oh-Nez] \" which I thought was cool. If I ever go back to Pittsburgh, this would definitely a place I would love to visit again!"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night. Evidently people were there pre-show and in fact there was a pre-show menu. Many of the customers were yelling at the waiters that they had a show to catch and didn't have their food yet. We ordered drinks and appetizers of snails and quenelles. These arrived relatively quickly and were fair at best but in the middle of eating them a waiter arrived with dessert that we did not order. Our entrees arrived before our plates from our appetizers were removed. I had the cassoulet which was acceptable but not good and my son had steak frittes. The frittes were soggy and horrible, certainly not twice fried. The steak was somewhat overdone. We then ordered dessert and waited over 45 minutes. I drank a cup of coffee but was never offered a refill and never saw our waiter to ask for a refill. The dessert arrived after 45 minutes, an apple tart that was inedible. The pastry was soggy probably from sitting out so long and the whole concoction was way too sweet. While I did not expect the quality of food I found in Lyon, FR, this was horrible as was the service. There is no excuse for this and would recommend you cross this place off your list. Many other people in the restaurant were clearly upset by the service and food. The restaurant removed the charged for the dessert due to the 45 minute wait but the wait was a small issue compared to the overall poor food quality and poor service. Zero Stars!"}
{"text":"My first time here since they changed from Sonoma Grill, and there is a lot to like. Very authentic French food and excellent service.  It's a great addition to the downtown restaurant scene. Fills a void. I can see us coming here before a show in the future.  Really enjoyed the mushroom soup and others at my table liked the onion soup. I had the salmon entree which was very good. Wife's veal & pasta dish tasted great but needed more veal. Desserts were outstanding, as you would expect from a French restaurant. Also the homemade soda was a really nice choice.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on the whim while walking around downtown Pittsburgh. The maître d' was amazing very nice she asked me if I wanted to sit inside or out. I said outside the waiter greeted me very quickly and was very polite. I ordered the fettuccine and had a French baguette with delicious butter. The fettuccine had shrimp scallops mussels and sausage and was over-the-top delicious. I would highly recommend anyone coming to Pittsburgh if they want a little taste of France to stop in here"}
{"text":"Just went for a late lunch and was excited to try the revamped restaurant. I had high hopes that Le Lyonnais would be better than Sonoma Grille, but was sadly disappointed. There were maybe five patrons in the restaurant and service was extremely slow. The lunch menu looks delicious and we ordered the Croissant Au Poulet and the Croq' Monsieur.The Croq' Monsieur was very greasy, the ham was under cooked, cheese wasn't melted and the bread was soggy. My first bite into the Croissant Au Poulet was chewy...aka a piece of fat. They probably shouldn't have had brie on the sandwich because it was nonexistent. I left the roasted chicken and ate the croissant. The presentation of both sandwiches were not appealing and they brought out a different sandwich instead of the Croissant Au Poulet, which they had to go back and make. The only good thing about this meal was the company and the Sarrail Esprit Rosé we ordered. I'd go for happy hour, but that it...maybe."}
{"text":"My first impression was that the atmosphere was very quiet and the hostess quite rude. Once seated, however, our server was helpful and attentive. Our meal was excellent though they were out of escargot which was something to which we were looking forward.   We started our meal with the bacon wrapped goat cheese along with the ham and emmenthal croquettes--both were very good. I then ordered the steak and puréed potatoes which were perfectly cooked and delicious.   Overall, the meal was great even though the hostess was not."}
{"text":"We were walking by and decided to stop in for lunch today. The first part of our experience was the attentive, courteous staff.  We were pleased with the variety on the menu with what we felt were very reasonable prices for the portion sizes. The quiche du jour was divine... Mushrooms, goat cheese and shrimp. Had the seafood salad as the main course and it was quite delicious. We were very pleased with our experience."}
{"text":"The food here is terrific, and are honest renditions of favorites from Lyon. We had the quennelle, beef tartar, braised oxtail, and bananas foster crepe. All were superb. The food is not pretentious, the portions are generous, and the prices are reasonable. We were very happy. Just keep in mind that Le Lyonnais is not trying to push the boundaries of creativity.  The restaurant itself has very high ceilings and large open spaces. It's not very cozy, but is a nice place for a night out, or for a group."}
{"text":"Where do I start...we arrived at happy hour and was definitely excited to try the food. The service at the bar was slow and unfriendly.  We placed and order for cheese and bread that took almost 30 minutes. A guy next to us felt bad our cheese didn't arrive so he asked as well. The guy behind the bar was rude.  Our bartender was also terrible.  Slow. Unfriendly. Only thing that made it somewhat forgiving is they comped our food.  That was a nice gesture but it was too late by then.  Will not be back. Wish Sonoma was still there."}
{"text":"First time here since the remodel and it was awesome! Great happy hour specials for food and drink. Loved the cheese plate and the wine list was awesome"}
{"text":"Soft music. Friendly service. Congenial Happy Hour. Oh and by the way, the food was creatively delicious."}
{"text":"This is the new concept that replaced Sonoma Grill. It's now a French style restaurant...well French-inspired cuisine. The restaurant space is basically the same.   The food was delicious. I had the slow cooked beef and creme brûlée and both were fantastic. Very well prepared and huge portions. The beef wa Avery tender and basically fell apart with a fork- perfect! The creme brûlée came with homemade donut holes on the side so it was basically 2 desserts in one.   The reason for the 3 stars was the restaurant experience and ambience and not the food (food was great!). This restaurant space is pretty big. We got there on a Friday night with a reservation for 5pm. When we arrived there were no tables in the dining room...zero. There were some folks at the bar, but no one seated at tables. They sat us all the way in the back in a dark side room that was half empty. Literally, the room only had tables in half the room. The other half was just an empty, unfurnished space. We commented on how we felt like were being hidden or punished and they didn't offer to move us or anything. They just asked for our drink order. Even though the dining room was 100% empty, I guess we weren't allowed to sit there.   This restaurant has really good food, but they need to be more cognizant of how they seat their customers. Nobody wants to sit in a dark empty room for a nice dinner out. I expected more from Le Lyonnaise, especially since this restaurant group has a number of nice restaurants and has been around for years."}
{"text":"I was surprised by Le Lyonnais. The reviews seem kind of wishy washy, but I really enjoyed my experience here. Bonus points to any place that serves complimentary bread and butter for the table. I ordered some poutine and french onion soup. Both were really great. My mother got a roast-type dish and raved about how tender and delicious it was. My father and brother also really enjoyed their meals too. Our server was also attentive and provided great service."}
{"text":"I was attending a concert at the AWC, and my tastebuds were ready for a Sonoma Grille salad with pears.......Well, my server advised that the restaurant was switching over to Le Lyonnais  Hmm, do I stay or go?....Initially I was disappointed, but I decided to give the new menu a try......The good news was I could still order my favorite salad (which was so delicious).....However, all of the entrees were new  I wanted to try something totally unfamiliar, and my server recommended the Quenelle. The Quenelle Lyonnaise was a whitefish dumpling with a smooth texture, and was very flavorful.....The Lobster sauce was clearly made from a rich stock, and the accompanying sides worked well with the dish.  I'll be back soon"}
{"text":"Walked over from the Northside for a weekday evening's celebration. It was great. The staff were friendly and helpful (and indulgent). Waitress was knowledgeable enough and didn't mind asking her colleagues when she didn't know. Food was either good enough or excellent. I had tartare appetizer. The pork entree was smooth and luscious over a swatch of amazing butternut purée. All well portioned. Drinks (hey, Jean Claude!) and wines were excellent. Didn't have dessert, but they looked good.   Glad the Yelper from France chimed in on the ambiance. It is open and airy. Other Yelpers have described it as cavernous. I found the spaciousness gracious, luxurious almost, and much like the Parisian restaurants (not bistros) I remember.   A welcome addition to downtown."}
{"text":"5+ ambiance! Great Cheese Cart, great lamb shank (served lukewarm). Fabulous strawberry sorbet and cafe au lait. Chance was an awesome server. Will return but I hope the food will be served hot in the future."}
{"text":"A mixed bag.     The food was quite good.  The cream of celery soup (a special) was really excellent, and I enjoyed the bacon-wrapped goat cheese as well.  By the time the entrees came, we'd all eaten too much, so I barely touched my veal but what I did have was prepared extremely well.  The rabbit got high praise from the husband.    The wine list was a pleasant surprise, as there were many reasonably-priced quality wines, and we were able to taste before ordering a bottle.    The big issue is the ambiance and the service.  It does not appear that any redecorating was done since the spot was the Sonoma Grille, and I don't think Sonoma Grill was ever redecorated since it opened 15 or so years ago.  It looks, frankly, like exactly what it is, which is a restaurant attached to a mid-priced chain hotel.  As to the service, our server was working very hard and was extremely nice, but she was waiting on tables in all different parts of the (very large) restaurant and was overwhelmed.    Finally, the restaurant was pretty much dead on a Friday night, and they were turning away a few people super early, like at 10pm. The food is the most important thing, so I'm hopeful that Le Lyonnais can work out these other aspects of the experience."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed with lunch at Le Lyonnais today. My coworkers suggested that I might be disappointed. My parting words as I left work for the restaurant were, \"Who can screw up quiche?\" Well, guess what, Le Lyonnaise created a bland and tasteless (goat cheese and cremini mushroom) quiche served with a big glop of (what I think was supposed to be) crème fraiche on top. The side salad was over-dressed with an unusual tasting redish dressing that made me think of watered-down ketchup. I kept asking my lunch date, \"What do you think this tastes like? Is it bacon?\" Her croque monsieur didn't even look appetizing...and I assume it wasn't since she only ate about three bites. Something is really amiss here; my guess is that Le Lyonnaise will be out of business before the year's end. Big Y, what's up?"}
{"text":"I had a birthday coupon for a free entrée so I decided to give Le Lyonnais a try.  Overall, it was a decent dining experience, but not something I absolutely loved or would rush back for. The décor is clearly still mostly from the prior restaurant.  I suppose the Tuscan landscape could be somewhere in France, but it just seemed out of place for a French restaurant.  The restaurant is also very large and cavernous.  We were there for a date night and it just doesn't have the intimate or romantic feel that you would expect from a fancy or French restaurant.  We were seated towards the front of the restaurant and ended up getting a cold chill every time the door opened.  If we were to visit again I would request a seat further back. Our server was attentive and informative without being intrusive.  He was helpful with both drink and entrée choices. I chose the steak tar tar as an appetizer because I usually love it and it isn't offered at a ton of places.  It was ok.  It didn't have a ton of flavor and the portion was smaller then I expected.  Not something I'd order again.  For my entrée I was trying to decide between the gnocci and the beef bourguignon and I wish I would have chosen the beef.  The gnocci did have a nice flavor, but it kind of all melded/mushed together instead of having any discernible texture.  My husband had the steak and was pleased with his selection.  Both had decent portion sizes, larger then you would typically expect from a fancier restaurant.  We split a crème brule as our dessert and it was honestly my favorite part of the meal.   I'd probably return but with different expectations for atmosphere and food quality."}
{"text":"We came here and got a table outside on a fine summer evening.  The weather was great and the table right on the street.  Observing the scene downtown, I noticed many people dressed as animals.  Seems it was Furry week in Pittsburgh.  This was cause for a drink.  A round of French Blondes (yes this is a drink) were ordered.  A Delicious grapefruit concoctions with gin.  Next up was the table side cheese.  Now I was concerned that one of these furry creatures may grab one, but the waitress boxed them out successfully.  The cheese was quite good.  Nice selection.  It when well with our bottle of rose.  Dinner was the Salmon En Papillote.  The salmon was moist and medium rare.  Quite good.  The rice was also fine.  We also sampled the seitan vol au vent dish.  The curry flavor was amazing.  I preferred this to the salmon.  As for sides, the truffle fries are tops.  Overall a quality meal while watching the furries.  It was so good, we ate it all.  No table scraps for the furries."}
{"text":"I ordered the whitefish dumpling with lobster sauce.  It was a wonderful surprise.  The dumpling was light and fluffy and just melted in your mouth.  The lobster sauce was rich and delicious without being too rich.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Food was definitely good for the price.  But the food wasn't anything super special.  It was better than average but not super gourmet.  That's okay...we weren't paying gorumet prices.  However, the service was slow and sloppy.  My appetizer plate was on my table the whole time...which is fine...I'm not a total snob but I know it's a classy restaurant no-no.  Also, the decor is rather dated and the atmosphere is a little old / drab.  Overall...for the price...not bad.   The restaurant has potential to make a new start with the new menu but all aspects have to follow...the atmosphere, the service, etc."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at the Lyonnais! My wife and my family came to dinner to celebrate a birthday and I felt like I was in France, where I was born. The French white wine was very good. The Quennelle, the charcuterie, the boeuf bourguignon and the rest were cooked to perfection everything taste very good and our waiter was very attentive. i will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My wife surprised me with dinner here as kind of an inside joke having to do with it being French (I'll explain later).  At first I was like uh-oh.  The Sonoma Grille died a long agonizing death and this is the same owner, just a new concept.  I had heard some negatives about Le Lyonnais because of this so I was worried but kept an open mind.  I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.    Like others said the hostess was a little harsh but our server Aarone was great.  He walked us through the menu and wine list landing on excellent choices all around.    We started simple with salads, which were very good. The avocado mousse left a little to be desired but it was on the side and did not detract from the dish.    I got the special filet medallions and my wife the salmon nicoise.  These were both excellent - great portions, flavorful, cooked perfectly.  Then it was time for dessert and things turned south.  We ordered the lemon tart and the parfait.  The table next to us ordered dessert after us and got theirs first.  Aarone showed up and said they were working on it.  10 minutes went by and nothing.  We were pushing our time limit because we had to be somewhere, so I tracked Aarone down - I literally got up and found him in the restaurant.  A few minutes later he came back and said they were having trouble plating the parfait.  Huh?   He eventually took the desserts off the bill and apologized and since we were in a hurry, we just paid and were on our way.   Definitely disappointing.  They wasted 20 minutes of our time, couldn't explain why and offered nothing in return.  Sounds like the Sonoma Grille all over again. The food was good but I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Went here with a group that had a predetermined menu for us to choose from. The apps were delicious. Good bread with dipping oil. I had the steak and French fries. I was disappointed in the steak and the pile of french fries was so large, not necessarily a bad thing, but took away from the effect of an\"nice\" restaurant. For dessert we had the crepe with mascarpone. It was huge and tasted very good. I left absolutely stuffed!"}
{"text":"Le Lyonnias is one of few places offering French comfort food in downtown Pittsburgh. Literally meaning \"of Lyon\" this spot offers charming small plates and indulgent meals inspired by classic french cuisine. I had the pleasure of enjoying a meal here recently. We ordered a few tartines, which are open-faced toast layered with deliciousness.  POIRE ET BLEU:  Duck Rillette | Grilled Pear | Fourme d'Ambert Blue Onion Jam | Baguette CREVETTE: Garlic Grilled Shrimp | Oven Dried Tomatoes Garlic & Herb Boursin | Five Points Baguette JAMBON CRU:  Prosciutto | Truffled Scrambled Egg Shaved Mimolette | Five Points Sour Dough  They were are really well made and flavorful, but my favorite was the Jambon Cru, the truffled eggs were truly decadent, creamy and rich. Made me wish they were open for brunch :) I would highly recommend adding this spot to your lists of places to try for a meal out on the town or a unique happy hour."}
{"text":"I actually liked the Sonoma Grille, so when I heard that the owners were changing the restaurant's concept from California inspired cuisine to French Bistro food, I said to myself, \"Hmmm!  I wonder how this concept will work out in that location ?\".  Me and my usual lunch partners in crime decided to give Le Lyonnais a tryout.   My one lunch partner ordered the Cassoulet at $5 with navy beans, garlic sausage, duck confit, smoked Pork Belly and fried kale, and the Steak Tartare at $14 with raw hand cut beef, capers, cornichons, red onion, harissa mayo, baguette crisps, frites and Salade Verte.  My other lunch partner and I ordered the Baguette Bourguignonne (BOOR-GEE-NEE-ON) $11 Braised Beef Chuck, Pinot Noir Demi, bacon lardons, onions and mushrooms served on a baguette along with Parmesan White Truffle Frites.  The Baguette Bourguignonne reminded me of a po-boy that I had in New Orleans, LA that had roast beef \"debris\" on it.  The only difference is that the debris was a little more \"beefy\" tasting.  I don't know if that was what this restaurant was going after, but it was just off by a tad.  (I think that if the beef and wine flavors were more pronounced and the gravy was a little thicker, they would be spot on.)  No complaint about the fries at all.  (Tasty fries with the addition of truffle flavoring.) My lunch buddy who ordered the cassoulet and tartare said that they were fabulous and that the accompaniments were spot on. (That's a pet peeve of his).   I think that I will order the BAGUETTE DE FRUITS DE MER $13 with Grilled Shrimp,| Salmon, Calamari, Baby Lettuces,Tomato, Egg, Anchovy Caper Mayo and Frites next time.  The good thing is that we must return to try additional dishes."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the terrible service, I would've given this place a 5 star rating because the food was pretty legit. However, our waitress Nicole was not. Being a server myself, I expect a certain degree of competence and friendliness at an upscale restaurant. To start, we were her only table and when my father in law attempted to make small talk with her she was painfully unfriendly. Then we ordered and all just got some apps, a cheese plate and very expensive wine. I asked for the Bourguignon** Tartine (I apologize if I spelled that wrong) & just in case I pronounced it wrong, I pointed to it on the menu! Everyone's small dishes come and the food runner brings me a giant entree sized portion of beef bourguignon over egg noodles. I called Nicole over and told her I ordered the tartine and this seemed to be the entree version of that. She rudely said \"Well yea, I rang in the entree for you. If there's a problem I can take it back but the tartine is just that on top of a piece of bread with some cheese added. So if that's what you really want....\" I didn't feel like causing a scene or waiting for her to correct my meal so I just said it was fine and I'd eat it. I did however reiterate, just so she knew, I originally ordered the Tartine (I freaking pointed to it on the menu for her!!!) After that we got dessert and I decided to try the Isles Flotaint* & it was different and good but nothing exceptional so I only took a few bites. Nicole comes back over & says in a really nasty tone \"Umm were you not hungry or did you just not like it?\" I said I wasn't too hungry and also wasn't too impressed and she rolled her eyes and walked away. Idk Nicole! Maybe I wasn't hungry because you incorrectly brought me an entree when I ordered an app. Anyway, it's a nice restaurant with decent food but I'm really just unsure how that girl has a job at a nice restaurant when she clearly sucks at effectively interacting with customers. Clearly not a people person."}
{"text":"Put in reservation, they lost it? After 3 minutes of starring at Ipad,  Hostess NOT providing alternatives or being friendly, we left. Open Table said spots were still open so beware of this place, very disorganized!"}
{"text":"Somehow I didn't know that this was no longer Sonoma Grille. The name came up as me and my dinner partner were deciding where to go, and we decided that it would be perfect for a dinner before going to a show. We were definitely not disappointed!   My dining partner and I both decided upon the soup of the day. I honestly am not a big soup fan, but anytime I see potato soup I feel the need to try it. I definitely did not regret it! It was a creamy bowl of amazingness. It wasn't just any potato soup though. It had wonderful chunks of cheddar throughout and was topped with fresh bacon bit. So so good! Being that I wasn't hungry enough to eat a whole entree, I decided to get the amuse-gueule (appetizer) of ham and emmental croquettes. Oh so delicious! Had a great ham flavor and the cheese accompined it so well! But the roasted pepper aioli and bechamel sauce definitely set off all those wonderful flavors.   My dinner guest decided to get the beef cheeks bourguignon. Oh my lord was the beef tender! It was glaced perfectly with a pinot noir demi and topped with some fried onions. Definitely one of those comfort foods you would want to eat on a cold winter night.    Even though I was stuffed, we decided to share a dessert. So many good choices, but we decided to go with the Tarte Tatin (Apple Tarte). We definitely did not regret that. The apples were baked perfectly and were perfectly caramelized.I cant decide what stood out the most though, the torte, or the oh so amazing sea salt caramel ice cream. They were honestly a pair made in heaven.  The service was absolutely fantastic. We received our food in an adequate amount of time and our waitress was the absolute best. She was very helpful when it came to the menu and was very attentive."}
{"text":"My parents and I were looking forward to visiting Le Lyonnais since the \"re-branding\" of Sonoma Grille, looking forward to a different cuisine as well as more reasonable prices.  The write up in the newspaper indicated a desire to introduce Pittsburgh to French comfort food in a way that was less pretentious and more affordable than what many often think when they hear \"French Restaurant.\"    The renovated space still reminds me of Sonoma, however the large open air space in the front of the restaurant was welcomed improvement as we snagged a high top table in the bar so we could still listen to the jazz music from the festival outside.  There was a decent crowd at the bar, but we had no trouble getting a seat at 5:30 on a Saturday afternoon.  We opted for the bar menu, and were immediately drawn to the table-side cheese plate, as well as a beautiful shrimp tartine that was full of flavor and perfectly presented.  On the cheese plate we could select up to five cheeses ($18) from the selection of six presented two us, with additional accompaniments including pistachios, blueberries, and a fruit jam that was heavenly.  The cheese options were mostly soft cheeses, with two different goat cheeses, brie, blue, and a mild cheddar-like option.  I'm not sure if the cheeses change seasonally, but my preference would be to offer one goat cheese and then opt for something completely different...it seemed a little heavy on the soft cheese this particular day.  Both my parents were pleased with the wine list, and I opted for a champagne and pomegranate cocktail that was the perfect blend of bubbles and sweetness.  Overall we were very pleased with our food and drink selections and loved people watching in the cultural district on a fun summery night!  So why you ask did I only give this establishment 3 stars??  Because despite our best effort to engage with and be patient with our server, he was quite possibly the least personable, most unhappy person I've seen in the service industry in Pittsburgh in a LONG time.  When I tell you there was no smiling, minimal eye contact, abrupt \"Do you know what you want?\" and descriptions of the cheeses included, \"This one just pretty much tastes like milk to me,\" I'm not exaggerating.  We tried repeatedly to give him the benefit of the doubt that perhaps he had a tough table earlier, or was just having a bad day, but despite our every attempt to be friendly and patient, he wasn't having it.  It was an unfortunate circumstance because with so many great chefs, bartenders and servers in the city these days, half the fun is getting to know them and then returning to see a familiar face.  That wasn't our experience this time, but we won't rule out Le Lyonnais for a future visit...I just hope the next time we order that cheese tray the person who comes to our table is a little happier to be there :)"}
{"text":"For your $11 cocktail, adequate. The hours here seem flexible depending on staffing, business, and the weather, so be prepared for an earlier closing. The service was appropriately condescending for a French-styled place, but the ambiance is nice - a converted wine-cellar restaurant that has outdoor cafe seating in season and pleasant open high ceilings and wood decor inside. I can't comment on the entire menu but the starters we ordered were tasty if not transportive. Expensive for the fare offered, though, in my humble opinion; I'd expect three-star (Michelin-guide style) food for the five-star prices."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to having lunch at this new restaurant and for the most part was very pleased with what they have to offer. When the hostess called me to reconfirm my reservation I asked about parking. It was then I learned that they share valet parking with the Courtyard by Marriott hotel next door. This is very important if you plan to come during the week. Valet parking is only $8.00 when you dine in the restaurant. Should you fail to tell them about your parking then you will end up paying the Courtyard's rate of $12.00. It is up to you to tell them that you had valet parked because they would have no way of knowing. This way they can add the charge to your check.  I had a choice of eating either, inside, outside, or in the lounge area. I chose to eat indoors but since it was a beautiful day they had one whole side of the building open for people passing by.  The lunch menu isn't overly extensive but I found that you can pair a choice of soup and salad together for a minimum of $12.00. If you wanted a meat as I did with chicken then it would be $14.00. I opted for the French Onion soup and upon my waitress recommendation got the chopped endive salad. This salad came with walnuts, Gruyere cheese, and apple pieces. While i was waiting my meal she brought out a large baguette that was sliced. It was okay. Some of it had large holes in it and really wasn't anything spectacular about it.  I noticed that many people were ordering salads today and they do come in huge portions. I got my meal within a reasonable time frame. My meal didn't seem overly big but it was very filling!  The soup was out of this world delicious! The salad I must admit tasted different but otherwise was very good. The roast chicken seemed slightly dry in one of the pieces but the majority of it was indeed filling and enjoyable. As I was eating it a man came around whom I would assume would be the owner and asked how everything was. I was fairly pleased with my choices so I answered in the affirmative.    I paid my check and inquired about Sat afternoon hours. The hostess told me that for the time being they aren't open for lunch on Saturdays but giving time and as summer events pop up they may change their mind.  Since I had noticed they have a lot of egg dishes on the menu I am hoping to try them out as well as they quiche which is usually an add on in the menu. Most of the sandwiches and eggs come with fresh fruit. I inquired about the fruit they use. It is mostly melons, cantaloupes and grapes. One thing I did learn is that once you pay for your valet parking you do not have to leave the downtown area immediately. If I had known that then I could have done an errand I've been putting off for sometime now. Still it is the best rate you can get if you are parking in the city during the weekday hours. They have an more expansive menu for dinner but be prepared to pay higher prices for it. Be prepared to pay for sides if you do come for dinner.  I didn't get to see much of the bar area but they have a map of France with where the wines originate nearby."}
{"text":"My dinner was outstanding. I don't understand why this place isn't packed. The food was fabulous. Fantastic happy hour prices and the service was great."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I will say this low rating is based on the service I received and not the quality of the food and cocktail.  I love this restaurant as an addition to our downtown community. As someone who is a French speaker and has spent significant time in Lyon, it is a true delight. I believe my expectations were high coming into my first meal here, and the food and cocktails were fantastic. I had an array of cheeses to start, my entree was lovely, and my cocktail and dessert was equally as pleasing.  However... the service was deplorable. Our waiter was rude. Case and point. I will be calling the restaurant to speak with a manager, and that is something I have never done before. I asked if the he spoke French as competitor French restaurants in our city do. I was informed he did not, WHICH IS TOTALLY FINE, but he then had the nerve to TAUNT ME for pronouncing menu items correctly with proper vowel sounds and intonation. I was appalled and embarrassed for speaking the language of the restaurant theme. After that experience, the waiter was increasingly dismissive, not attentive and... just probably should not be in the service industry.  Le Lyonnais has a great menu, food quality and atmosphere. However, your patrons are looking for an authentic dining experience even if they can not speak the language. Remember, your patrons can go about 1.5 miles in one direction and 3.5 miles in the other direction and find French wait staff and authentic dining experiences."}
{"text":"Had an excellent time here. Their wine selection is diverse and easily paired, and the specials are always in and available, featuring an interesting array of options.   My favorite here is the Chicken Dijonaise. Smoky, juicy chicken breast in a Dijon-beer soaked ale sauce. Absolutely delicious   Also, give the rabbit a try if it happens to be on the menu. Scrumptious.   Service is consistently outstanding. Give this place a try for a casual, yet rewarding culinary experience."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour. They have great happy hour prices on drinks and appetizers. We decided stay at the bar  and share a few appetizers. We started with trois fromages, 3 cheeses served with a French baguette, sweet & spicy candied walnuts, and caramelized red onions. Then we split a  quenelle lyinnaise (a whitefish dumpling in lobster sauce - omg!!) and the boulettes de viande ( veal & pork meatballs).   We were very impressed and can't wait to go back for the dinner menu. Good service, delicious food."}
{"text":"You are all sleeping on the happy hour here. They have several beers available for $2, and $2 jager shots (M-F, 5-7). You're welcome.  ...But if you decide for some reason that you're \"an adult\" and too good for taking multiple shots of jager on weekday afternoons, I suppose you might like to know that they also make quality cocktails in this surprisingly huge, well-appointed French restaurant.  Although I haven't had the pleasure of a full meal yet, the onion soup gratineé and the cassoulet are solid, and as an added bonus, served with great bread and a honey butter.  Do it."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour in Pittsburgh with great service in a classy atmosphere!  Great Happy Hour Food!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a whim, because we love French food. In all, it was a good quality meal. Server was flighty and was not very attentive. We did not get greeted right away--another server had to apologize and got my glass of wine while we waited.  When I asked our server questions about the menu, she seemed unsure about her selections. She also had to pick up my menu to read what was in a few of the items I had asked about.  Decor needs improvement. It is very obvious that they did nothing to improve the decor from Sonoma Grill and you can tell. Looks like they pass it off as \"French Countryside\" but has the exact same murals as Sonoma. Takes away from the \"French\" experience.  Steak Tartar was okay...not out of this world delicious but enjoyable enough. Wouldn't order again. My husband was very happy with the duck and I thought my pork was prepared perfectly, and had a good taste. Meal was of good quality but not out of this world. I'd be surprised if this restaurant sticks around for good, because nothing particular stands out."}
{"text":"A fun downtown restaurant with tables on the sidewalk. Makes her excellent people watching. I was impressed with the dishes and they had various vegetarian options. Strong craft cocktails!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had made plans to go to dinner and a show and we had decided to make dinner reservations here to try it out & we were very happy we did. Typically, I wouldn't take the time to type a review, but considering that we both work in the food service industry ourselves we know that many people only take the time to write a review if something has been wrong, but I'd like to take the opportunity to express how delicious everything was.   We started with the cheese cart (the peach & pepper jam was a wonderful accompaniment) to go with our bread and herbed butter and an order of crevette. Honestly, you could probably order crevette as an entree and be extremely happy and satisfied. The crunch of the toasted baguette, the herbaceous and garlicky bite of the Boursin cheese, the incredibly savory sundried tomatoes and the sweet baby shrimp....perfect.   I had the pork chop. It was beautifully cooked, the walnut stuffing was very savory and who doesn't like apples with pork?   My boyfriend ordered fettuccini basquaise. The way it was described is exactly how it tasted---paella, but with pasta.   For dessert I ordered creme brûlée and it was delicious, but the iles flottantes was something special. It's a massive fluffy merengue floating ontop of a dessert soup (it was blood orange when we were there) and the garnished lend a lovely crunch.   Suffice it to say that the food and the service were both outstanding and we were very impressed. It will easily become a favorite spot to dine when we find ourselves downtown."}
