{"text":"I did not like the froyo here. I usually love froyo, and I always get original, mango if available, and some sort of wildcard. I didn't like their original or mango. The flavors here are kinda in froyo limbo - not quite ice cream sweet like TCBY, but not really tart either, at least these 2 flavors which I've usually encountered in the tart version. However, the watermelon sorbet here is actually delicious and actually tastes somewhat like watermelon, though I'm still not quite sure if it's sorbet-like froyo, or just sorbet but I like the texture and flavor a lot. The other options were all ice cream-like (cake batter, etc).  Points for self serve, but the selection is limited and there are only like 8 fruit options, and not all of them are fresh fruit. Lots of little compartments of dry toppings though. You have to open each and use this teeny little scooper that has pretty much no handle, but it's just a minor annoyance.  Good enough for mall-ing I guess, but even then I wouldn't go too out of my way to get it to eat in the mall, especially it's inconveniently located on the 2nd floor next to the entrance to Macy's."}
{"text":"The North Hills doesn't have milk/bubble tea ANYWHERE, except for this small shop in Ross Park Mall, but I'm not complaining, it's better than no bubble tea at all. They also have self-serve frozen yogurt.  The tea is from Rose Tea Cafe, so the stuff is legit! We live 5 minutes from the mall so we come here when we need a quick fix. I always get the Taro and I'm never disappointed.  We also love their froyo and I'm head over heals for their salted caramel pretzel flavor. It's so delicious. They also have a cake batter flavor which I am equally obsessed with. In the toppings department, they have popping bobas, as well as fruit, syrups, cereals, and candies. If you aren't familiar with popping bobas, I suggest you get familiar real quick! These guys are little balls filled with juice that pop in your mouth. I'm obsessed.   In all, I still prefer going to town for my bubble/milk tea and froyo, but this place is great for us North Hills dwellers who don't want to have to go in town every time we want some tea of froyo."}
{"text":"Yo Place is the new frozen yogurt shop inside Ross Park Mall.  I wouldn't have even known it opened if I hadn't been looking for it, since it was added to the directory online.  The location inside the mall isn't great--it's on the top floor back in a corner by a door I never enter through, so if you're just wandering through you wouldn't even see it.  They have six flavors of frozen yogurt, which is OK, a minimal selection of toppings and also bubble drinks from Rose Tea Cafe.  There aren't a lot of chairs, but if you want to eat and stroll the mall it's an OK place to go.  Nothing about it wowed me, even though I do love fro-yo...I'm sticking to the e-bar for treats."}
{"text":"Sheepishly trying boba tea, after the amazing ones in Albuquerque. .... verdict pending! It is very hard to top the boba tea I had at Boba Tea Company (when are they going to move East!?), however when it comes to a nice crisp Taro Green Tea, Yo Place is not bad!  I wish they used larger Boba so that the little ones the do use do not get too soggy. Overall, for a mall Tea Place that is actually dedicated to yogurt, they did quite well, that's why 3 stars.  Try their drinks with caution: smaller boba are aspiration risk!"}
