{"text":"First of all this is one of the best pizza places in an area that has a bunch of good pizza places. The reason for this review is to remind the owners that this is the year 2016. I'm not sure if they have noticed but the intrawebs have become a pretty popular thing. I would love to be able to at least look at a menu so that I don't have to order the same thing every time. Please put you menu on the internet."}
{"text":"My family has been ordering from Reddi's ever since we moved to Macedonia 22 years ago. The 1/2 sheet pizza and the antipasto salad is always our go-to meal. The pizza is nothing fancy, but it's the right amount of guilt and greasiness you need from a pizza. We've never order anything fancy- just a pizza with pepperoni and sausage- and it's so good! The crust is crisp and the cheese to sauce ratio is always on point.

If you order the salad, always get the Italian dressing. It's homemade. They also have a pretty bomb ranch dressing that's solid with pizza, because let's be honest- ranch is life!

The last time we came here we ordered the wings for the first time and they were on point! They were decent size and the sauce (sweet n sour) was so good! It was a cross-breed between Italian and Chinese. Sounds weird, but they were delicious!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza place around this area. My family and I will not order from anywhere else since we've discovered this place. It's a little pricy but definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in the area. We've been looking for our go-to pizza shops since moving here two years ago. We just happened upon Reddi's and are so glad that we did. The large is smaller than from most places, an 8-cut, but the quality is a serious step above other shops. The price is reasonable, as well."}
{"text":"I have been working in the Cleveland area for 2.5 years and Reddi's has the best pizza. Coming from the Chicago area this was a great find."}
{"text":"I wanted to grab some Farinacci for lunch yesterday. They don't open until 4. So I decided to try Reddi's. I had the Reddi's in Maple and was really impressed. It is owned by the same family. The Reddi's in Twinsburg has a conveyer belt style oven. I prefer the ferris wheel style one in Maple and in general. I had a lot of leftovers, as I always plan on for the weekend, and the facility or maintenance department at my work threw away all of my leftovers! I guess every Friday they clean out the fridge! I wish I knew that! I am pissed!"}
