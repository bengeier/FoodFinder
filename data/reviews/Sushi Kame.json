{"text":"this place is actually pretty good, and I like the fact that it's not too trendy looking inside.  It feels more traditional, and the tempura is awesome! Yet, I guess it's not that hard to make tempura.  I love, love LOVE when they give you the sliced cucumber, cold noodle and rice vinegar small plate. OMG! what a great way to start a wonderful meal of sushi.  Plus, this place has a lot of good memories. My first dates with my bestest friend ever, and he's still in my life. Hm, maybe I should take him there for ol' memories.  I HIGHLY recommend this place for traditional sushi/japanese food."}
{"text":"I'm very surprised at some of these reviews.  Both times I came to this restaurant I received rice that was cold on sushi that looked like it was made hours ago and on my last visit, got food poisoning.  I honestly refuse to go back to a place that failed inspection with a score of 10 and then managed to stay open with a score of 40 (5 points above failing).  Honestly, Champaign really needs to enact a law to protect patrons by requiring establishments to post their score card on their doors like other cities.  Thank goodness for cu-citizenaccess dot org."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town.  They're also reasonably priced, making sushi night possible more than once a month!  I like eating there before catching a movie at the Art Theater.  The service is great, they even give you warm washcloths before you eat - sweet!  My only complaint is the Udon soup.  It's not tasty at all - pretty flavorless in fact.  Other than that, everything there is great!"}
{"text":"Sushi Kame is tied for my favorite place to get sushi in Champaign. The sushi is very good.  If you're going for lunch the bento boxes are hard to beat when it comes to bang for your buck! I've always been happy with the food. The service is OK, I've never had the long wait times that some others here have posted about. I guess my only complaint is that I tried the Chirashizushi once and while it was good propotions and delicious it was one of the less ornate presentations I've had. Of course for the price I couldn't really complain. So yeah- if you're in the CU area and looking for sushi, this is one of the two places I would recommend!"}
{"text":"This was my first introduction to real Japanese food options, not just sushi and tempura. The food is quite good. The service can be patchy, but the servers are always polite."}
{"text":"Great sushi. They also hook you up with appetizers like Miso soup, noodle salad. I recommend you try the roll with the baked smoked salmon. You really can't go wrong with any of their rolls."}
{"text":"The food is actually not so bad. However, while I only spent $9.31, I was charged two times, one $9.31 and one $8.50. I don't understand why. I think there shouldn't be such a stupid mistake."}
{"text":"Wonderful sushi. Had spicy scallop, love-love and spitfire. All great flavor. Service was very slow or would have given 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"a local favorite, no need to wait for a table and great for groups.  considering all the other sushi places in town, this may be the only spot if you dont want to overpay for a decent sushi lunch or dinner.  i used to stick to the sashimi lunch box, but have gone 100% chirashi.  yea, the interior may be kinda blah, but you can always take out.  keep the big beers coming!"}
{"text":"I like their dragon roll series. Went there twice in two weeks and took my family there. It is way better than Miko's or Kamakura and it's less expensive."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best sushi place you can find in Chambana area. Their rolls are as good as anywhere, but nigiri and sashimi are the best I've tried away from the Coasts. Rice is particularly good. Fish to rice ratio is just right, and the fatty pieces of fish are melting in your mouth. They have improved a lot recently. The service is hit-and-miss but mostly OK."}
{"text":"Food came out fast and it was tasty.  The made special vegetarian rolls for some in my party, which is always a plus.  Prices are very affordable and I would go back."}
{"text":"Lunch Bento set is of good value - the portion is decent and the food tastes great.  The ambience is also good and the restaurant looks clean."}
{"text":"I guess if I was going to get sushi in C-U, I'd come here, all things being equal.  But it still isn't that great... the fish tastes a little old (sushi in central illinois factor, most likely) and the rest of the menu is nothing special.   Ko fusion probably has slightly better rolls but then, you're paying way too much for them."}
{"text":"Witnessed one of the worst things tonight at dinner. The manager and Sushi chef totally started yelling and giving another table a hard time - all because these poor customers had to wait from what we heard over 1 and 1/2 hours for their food that arrived to their table inedible.   We were so uncomfortable and felt bad for them. Horrible customer service and won't be back. BTW - our food was subpar too."}
{"text":"I used to love Sushi Kame as demonstrated from my previous review. However, after my experience today I can no longer recommend the restaurant to ANYONE. Not only did no one come to our table until I got up to ask who are server was after waiting for 10 plus minutes, we had to go and find our server again after about 15 or 20 minutes of waiting to order. Two of us ordered appetizers and only one was served while the other person waited and waited. Then when they brought us the complimentary noodle dish they simply did not give one to my friend. The final and last straw was when they brought the food out for everyone but one person in our party. She was forced to wait over 10 minutes for them to bring her food while everyone else was eating. This does not lead to a nice dining experience. Finally, when we were trying to pay our bills, they started to clean up the table. As my friend pointed out, they were as slow as possible to serve us, but had no problem trying to grab the soy sauce dishes so they could close up and leave. Meanwhile everyone around us was being thanked for coming and treated with the utmost respect. The service staff should be ashamed of their discriminatory behavior. It is beyond shameful."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Great prices. You must check out if in the area!  Try the combo tempora appetizer"}
{"text":"Waited one full hour for sushi deluxe and bento box. The salad was lame, and the sushi was fair at best. A couple pieces were less than fair, almost inedible. This is my first time that I have been so disappointed in a restaurant that I actually did a yelp review"}
{"text":"The food was good it was a little expensive for me just the two of us me and my son and it cost us $100 and we just drink soda but like I said the food was really good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here. I was surprised at the small courses that were brought out in between-- cold noodles, miso soup, watermelon; it was a pleasant surprise. I'm not a huge sushi fan, but I loved the sushi here. They had tons of sushi combos to choose from, and were fairly quick at tending to our table. The decor seemed a bit cheesy, but the food was great!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has 4 stars...  The set up of the restaurant is awkward, and the decor isn't very planned. The server was almost too timid, but she was at least attentive. I agree with other reviews that said the food didn't taste very fresh. The price wasn't too bad, but overall not worth it for what we got. As a side note, they play bubble-gum J-pop music over the speakers, while I think more mellow artists (like YUZU, Mao Abe, Yui,  etc) would be a much better match for a dining experience.  Sakanaya on Green St. is a bit pricier, but an all-around better experience."}
{"text":"Very unassuming from the outside, and even from the inside, but don't let the looks fool you. This is the best sushi place in town. What it lacks in style it makes up for in great prices, great service, and quality ingredients. I am a huge sushi fan, which is tough when you're stuck in the midwest. But places like Kame help to ease the pain. Some of the other reviews talking about the (lack of) freshness confuse me. I've never had anything but fresh sushi there, and I've been many times. If you're in town and you get a craving for good sushi make sure to check this place out."}
{"text":"After moving from L.A. where there's good sushi on every corner, I was a bit apprehensive about finding a good sushi place in the middle of Illinois. However, after reading the reviews here on yelp and going to try for myself, Sushi Kame gets a big thumbs up from me. An earlier reviewer complained about the service, but I've never had anything but attentive waitresses. Prices are more than reasonable compared to all the other sushi joints in town, and the sushi is excellent. The roll selection could stand to be a little more varied, but whatever. Overall, this place is awesome. Love it."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Champaign... The fish is fresh and they have some tasty appetizers.  The rolls are much better than KO Fusion, especially since they changed their menu  (new chef?) a couple years ago.  Nice extras like cucumber and cold noodle plate, green tea, and small watermelon slice at the end of the meal.  Comfortable and cute environment- don't need to be dressed up but also a good place for a date."}
{"text":"so i've been verrrrrry skeptical about getting sushi since moving down here, but the other week my boy and i ventured out to get takeout from sushi kame. i still believe this was a big mistake.  i opted to stay fish-free and get the avocado maki, sweet potato maki, edamame and miso soup. the rolls were okay, on the smaller side and not really anything to write about...on the other hand, i don't know if it's because we got takeout, but our portion of edamame was ridiculously small! i'm talking like the container was 1/3 full, and not salted at all. at all! who eats edamame without some salt?!?! geez. and the miso soup was funky...i had one spoonful and that was enough. i still can't put my finger on why it tasted so bad, but i will for sure never ever get that again at sushi kame. come to think about it, i won't ever get anything again from sushi kame because i won't be going back. the boy decided to play it safe as well and simply ordered a chicken teriyaki bento box. he said the panko crust on the tempura was delightful, and that the chicken teriyaki was cooked well and had some flavor, but he threw away the salad and california roll after opening each container. why? the lettuce in the salad was wilted and should have been tossed out weeks before, and he said the california roll looked completely inedible (i didn't get a glance at it).  since he has never simply just tossed out any food by the looks of it (my boy likes to eat!), i took his word for it. so yeah, sushi kame? no thank you. i'll keep looking for a decent sushi place around these parts and hopefully i'll be satisfied soon...."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in town.  It's great for a quick, delicious lunch for a reasonable price, or a nicer dinner.    Before eating, you always get the miso soup and cucumber salad.    With the lunch bento boxes, you also get a ginger salad, a few pieces of tempura, some caliifornia rolls, your entree choice, and some rice.   The best choices are the sushi and the calimari, I think, but it's all really good.  The prices are very reasonable, too - about $7-8 for all that food.  The soups are massive and very good, too.  I am not sure if there is anything better for a cold winter day or if you aren't feeling good.  For dinners, there are meals like the bento boxes or sushi.  I've never been disappointed with the sushi here, either and it is definitely some of the very best I've had in the midwest.  They do not skimp on the fish, either - with the nigiri, there is always plenty of delicious fish.  Prices are reasonable, especially for what you get.  This was the first place I had uni, the delicious creamy sea urchin.  It's a little scary looking  at first, but it is incredibly good if you are feeling adventurous.  I've never ordered dessert because I've always been too full from the entrees.  I have been here many, many times and the only time the service was slow at all was on a busy Saturday night.  Generally, service is quick and attentive.  Decor is not overdone.  Like I said - one of my favorite restaurants in town, and definitely my favorite sushi place."}
{"text":"Really good sushi, the food here is very good while also not being incredibly expensive. I've never had to wait for a table here since it never seems that a ton of people are there. The miso and the cucumber salad are tasty and I would recommend the volcano roll, the lobster salad roll and the canada roll. Love this place, can't promote it enough."}
{"text":"I definitely got food poisoning from this place. I do not usually have a sensitive stomach and this is a very rare occurrence for me. Other than the food poisoning it was good though. I went there for lunch and got the sushi bento box. The food was average but it was also a good amount of food for being relatively inexpensive."}
{"text":"Two words: Golden Rice! You cannot go to Sushi Kame without getting the golden rice (sometimes called egg yolk rice, depending on who is working). Its phenomenal! Unfortunately, it sells out very fast and they don't always have it made - so I always make sure to call beforehand to make sure its in stock. Several times, they told me that they did and when I arrived, I learned that they had lied. So be careful.  Their sushi is pretty decent quality, but nothing extraordinary. Its a bit on the expensive side and the rolls are somewhat bland, but if you know how to order correctly, you can get a great meal. I'd suggest getting either the Love Love Roll or the Vienna Roll, which comes with miso soup and a small cucumber salad. Then I usually get a house salad (it comes with a very good ginger sauce) and a side of golden rice. It comes to about $13 and leaves you filled to the brim - making Sushi Kame my favorite sushi place in Champaign."}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi in Champaign.  Reasonable price and prompt service."}
{"text":"After patronizing every sushi place in town more than a few times, I consider Sushi Kame to be the best (perhaps barely beating out Yellowfin).  The sushi is fresh, they don't skimp on ingredients, and the servers are friendly while keeping the prices similar to other competitors."}
{"text":"Sushi Kame is the best sushi place on campus (and by on campus, I mean a 5-10 min bus ride on the Green, but it stops right in front of it). On the outside, the place doesn't look like much, but the interior has a warm atmosphere and the staff is friendly, if a bit overwhelmed (my only complaint was the service, but I attribute this to their being understaffed)  If you're a sashimi person, be warned that the prices are a wee bit on the \"are you kidding me?\" side, but it's worth it; I don't know how they do it, but the times I've had their American Sashimi, the salmon and tuna were PERFECT - fresh, succulent, and slightly chilled. They have a large collection of rolls, and being a pro-spicy person, I like their selection of spicy rolls.   Great place, and highly recommended"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi rolls, extensive selection with some interesting options. I got the rolls with fried chicken in them - Chicken Run, different and tasty. I also got the Crunch rolls which were great. Everything was ideally arranged and fresh.   Business travelers: OK for eat in, reasonably nice interior. I got takeout which was easy and not messy for eating in a hotel room."}
{"text":"Sushi Kame is probably the best Japanese restaurant in town. The interior is no Kamakura but overall it was great! I ordered a mixed tempura dish that had all my favorite foods. I also had requested that my side of white rice be changed to fried rice and boy did I make the right choice. Sushi Kame has the best Fried Rice. The rice had a coating of egg which is so hard to come by and had great veggies within it also. I was more than please with this restaurant and i will be more than happy to eat there again. The service was also good."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite sushi restaurant in Champaign-Urbana.  The bento boxes are relatively cheap and HUGE, and every roll that I've had has been delicious. The salmon don bowl is pretty amazing, too. I keep meaning to try the noodles, but when faced with the list of delicious sushi rolls, I always succumb.   Cute location downtown, and great staff. My only minor complaint is that they often seem understaffed, and the poor servers seem a bit overworked during dinner.  But they are  unfailingly kind, and the food is always delicious."}
{"text":"My favorite place for sushi in Champaign. Lunch is my favorite time to go but the dinner selections are great too. We always order a variety of rolls. Anything with tuna is excellent. The rainbow roll is my favorite."}
{"text":"The best sushi place in Champaign, and the cheapest. They also give you a noodle dish, miso soup, and free green tea with your meal.   Compared to Yellowfin, the food quality is better, the price is about the same, and the atmosphere is about the same.   Compared to Kofusion, the price is better, the food quality is about the same  (although I prefer Sushi Kame's rolls), and you don't have to deal with the the pompous atmosphere you get at Kofusion."}
{"text":"Worst sushi experience of my life. While theres value in the bento box, the fish was not fresh, the seaweed wrap stale, and the rolls haphazardly put together. The eel was notably rank. Do yourself a favor and stick with Sakanaya."}
{"text":"i like sushi kame.  their fried rice is good.  their veggie sushi rolls have never disappointed.    but to the totally stressed out older lady who seems to run things over there...  take a vacation, because you're rude to your customers.    on their menu it says they will make rolls to order.  i asked if an inari roll could be made for me.  basically a little fried bean curd wrapper with rice and cucumber inside.  i have made them myself, and it takes very little effort... and is extraordinarily cheap.    not at sushi kame!    the first time i went, the price was $6 for 4 rolls of this type.  i thought it was a little steep, but whatever.  it was good.  i enjoyed it.  the next time i went.... the same order.... SIXTEEN dollars.  yep.  apparently inari rolls now have gold flecks in them or something, because in a little over two weeks the price skyrocketed by $10.  i brought it to said stressed out older lady, because she had taken my to-go order.  she just kept repeating that it was \"today's price\".  she totally seemed angry and upset that i had even asked.  i had though.  because....listen, lady... i don't think tofu has a market price like seafood.  even if it does... it's f'n tofu.  no one had to go out on the wild seas and wrangle it.    i paid it.  for some reason two cucumber rolls, an order of fried rice, and 4 inari rolls came to a little under $30 that day.  i gave that rude lady $16.... and i hated every minute of it and every minute of eating what now felt like total rip off inari.  i haven't been back since that.  it's a shame too.  the food is really not so bad.  not gold plated tofu prices, but good enough."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch during a Sunday and tried their calamari bento box (which was delicious by the way). The prices of their lunch specials are very reasonable and it comes with a decent amount of food. Their miso soup is amazing and the service was excellent. I'm going to come back in the future to try their sushi, but the nostalgia I encountered when I saw bento boxes on the menu was too much to pass up during my visit."}
{"text":"Was very hopeful.  New to Champaign, and truly excited to be living downtown with so many unique places to explore. This was my first sushi. Had the spicy tuna and rainbow rolls. Absolutely no love put into their sushi. And the prices are on par with any big city. Very underwhelming. But if you're new to sushi, or not overly picky... then this place would work."}
{"text":"Was in Champaign for the weekend & was jonesin' for some sushi. Went to sushi Kame after seeing good reviews on Yelp. When I walked in I immediately noticed that there were Japanese folks eating at the Japanese restaurant. Always a good sign. The service was excellent, and despite a somewhat limited (and eel-heavy!!) menu, I had a really tasty lunch with good quality sushi, at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Sushi Kame is a clean, unpretentious, and the most authentic Japanese restaurant in the area. It is more representative of the restaurants in Japan than the many Japanese, fusion, buffet, what-have-you type of setting which has become the norm now. The sushi was well made, with quality ingredients. Efficient and courteous service. And since is is off the main strip, there is almost never a wait. Would recommend this over any other sushi place in the area."}
{"text":"Sushi Kame has some fantastic Japanese food and some of the best prices in town, especially for the quality. I've sampled several dishes from their menu, from sashimi to sushi rolls to noodle dishes, and I've been very happy with each and every one. I have yet to try Yellowfin restaurant, but in my experience, Sushi Kame easily beats the other area sushi restaurants in terms of quality and price. As a previous reviewer said, service isn't always the best, but, in my experience, that's only been in terms of table visits by the waitstaff (they seem to get overwhelmed easily). Having said that, they have always been friendly and our food has always been quick to the table.  Oh, and they close for a few hours between lunch and dinner, so be sure to call ahead if you're not sure if they're open yet."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in Champaign-Urbana. After living in Japan for a short period, I am crazy snobby about sushi. Certainly, compared to the quality you could find in a major/coastal city this is nothing to write home about, but in a midwestern college town this is as good as it gets. I've not tried much here besides their sushi but what I've had I liked. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but the food is the obvious draw here."}
{"text":"After trying four different sushi restaurants in the area, I would without a doubt say Sushi Kame ranks above them all. I came here with a couple of friends on a Wednesday night and had a very pleasant experience.  The service was very good. After taking our order, we were served some miso soup followed by some cold noodles. Our sushi rolls were brought out not long after the noodles. Between my friends and I, we ordered rolls of spicy tuna, negi hemachi (sp), unagi, dragon, shrimp tempura, and crab. Everything tasted great. However, I personally liked the dragon, unagi, and spicy tuna above the others. It can become a little pricey but it is worth it for good sushi in this town. Overall, it was a  pleasant experience and I shall be returning soon."}
{"text":"I woke up with a craving for sushi and in my experience Champaign hasn't been the best place to find a good sushi spot.  Regardless, I yelped to my heart's content and settled on Sushi Kame.  To start, when I looked at the menu I was shocked at the prices.  They were charging $4.50 for a bowl of edamame and some of their other appetizers and sushi rolls were just way overpriced.  The miso soup was very bland and the barely filled up half the bowl.  I work at a sushi restaurant and our miso soup isn't amazing or anything but it has flavor to it that the miso soup at Sushi Kame was lacking.  As for the portion size, I just didn't understand why they couldn't fill up that extra portion of the bowl...  Next, the house salad.  The dressing is a staple that I've tasted at many Japanese restaurants and this one was just too sour and I couldn't take more than one bite.  Now, the main course.  I ordered the Love-Love roll and the Sushi Special, which comes with 5 pieces of nigiri and a california roll.  I'm not a fan of the california roll so I asked the server to replace it with a spicy tuna roll and that I would gladly accept any upcharges.  She didn't know how much it would be so I asked her to just let me know.  She came back and informed me that it would be $0.25 extra.  She then returned 2 minutes later saying that it would actually be $1.00.  Now I wouldn't have minded paying that if she told me that from the beginning.  But it seems to me that if you're going to tell a customer a certain price for something you shouldn't go back on it...that was a little off-putting.  My love-love roll was okay, but the cilantro was a little overpowering.  I don't know if i would use whole leaves of cilantro in one roll..and the spicy tuna that came with my sushi special, well..it was one of the worst spicy tuna rolls I've ever seen or tasted in my life.  It had no flavor to it, and it was falling apart.  It was basically like the sushi chef put a piece of tuna and a little spicy mayo over it.  Again, because I work in a sushi restaurant I know that it takes a bit more preparation than that to make a spicy tuna roll.  And if you can't manage to make a simple roll like that, I don't know what that says about your skills.  The only thing that I enjoyed about my meal was the nigiri as the fish was fresh.  Needless to say, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Just walk by this place and head East to Kofusion. We've been here half a dozen times and each one worse than the last. The latest found us standing like idiots for close to ten minutes at the door while the servers kept walking by refusing to acknowledge us. The restaurant was half full but only two servers. When we were spoken to it was to ask if we could wait another ten minutes. Had they offered us a seat and told us the wait time, we'd have been patient. I'm pretty sure they just wanted us to go away, and we did, never to return. Besides the bad service this place is dirty, dingy, and not worth it. Head East!"}
{"text":"The asparagus beef roll was delicious! And u have to try the teriyaki beef! It's really tender and tasty!"}
{"text":"I miss Japanese food.  I grew up in Southern California, with Japanese-American family and I'm jonesing here in the midwest for a good chicken katsu, or a decent Udon.  Kame's the closest I've come here to being satisfied.  I like it a bit better than Kamakura, and the servers are both friendly and on point.  The miso's pretty good, the udon is a trifle underwhelming, but the katsu's quite lovely.  Although---you can get cheese on it?  WHAT THE HELL?  Is that a terrifyingly midwest thing?  Cuz I've never heard of this.  ICK.  That aside, i'm bummed that they only have chicken katsu curry (one of my favourite things in life ever) one day a week.  I want it now ;)"}
{"text":"My bro and i were home for xmas and seriously craving a sashimi plate.  After doing some pokin around, this is the place we were pointed towards.  The fish was fresh, which is the ultimate MUST for decent sushi.  Didn't have any rolls, just a big plate o' raw fish.  I was pleased that I could find this in Chambana."}
{"text":"Though I'm not a fan of raw fish, my fiance thinks that this is one of the best places to get sushi around town. For people like me, I think that their bento boxes are usually good, but last time I came here, the beef bento was a little too salty. Their serving sizes seem like they're getting smaller over the years, but not a bad place to try once in a while."}
{"text":"I recently started becoming a frequent sushi eater, but let me start by admitting that I am no sushi snob. The beginning of this experience was fun! We got seated quickly, the servers were very nice, and they greet you with warm towels and complimentary miso soup (although I only got one piece of tofu in mine). We decided to go here because we saw the sushi boats that they serve your food on and it looked really neat! There also aren't many sushi places in Urbana/Champaign, so we thought we might check this one out since we've been to the others.   We got the Shrimp tempura as an appetizer which was good. And for the Sushi we got 8 rolls for the 5 of us girls. From the ones I remember I think we got the Spicy tuna, love-love, california, vienna, spicy salmon, volcano, and sake bomb. It took a while between the appetizer and entree which was a little awkward, but when the food came the presentation was well done and we were ready to eat.   Some negatives: The first one I picked up wasn't rolled very tight and kept slipping through my chopsticks. It ended up plopping into my soy sauce dish. -_- The sushi overll was just okay. A few other rolls weren't rolled very tight, and on one of the rolls the rice seemed a bit dried out. Maybe it was because we went at around 8:30? But still, dried out rice? meh!  Some Positives: the spicy tuna and spicy salmon were actually spicy! Which was good! The love love roll was also pretty good. The service was friendly, and we got seated right away.  If you're in the mood for some quick, cheap sushi, I definitely recommend this place. If you're looking for some great quality, fancy place, I would stick with ko fusion and sakanaya."}
{"text":"Visited the first time a few weeks ago. I got the Bento Box (chicken teriyaki) for dinner. It was a LOT of food. I don't for CA rolls, so I passed that to my bf. Everything else was great, though. The BF got their chirashi, and he thought it was great. He has been back, and said it was good on his second visit."}
{"text":"Good sushi place in a city with few options. Food was very good and the service was great. I didn't have any issues other reviewers had and will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried Sushi Kame for lunch today. I am no expert on Japanese cuisine, so for this Midwestern girl, the Japanese food was delicious. I had the salmon bento box and my husband had a chicken fillet. Loved my salmon and grilled vegetables. Had three pieces of vegetable tempura, two pieces of California roll, lettuce salad. The restaurant was not very busy for a Friday lunch time. There seemed to be one cook and one server running the place and we had no waiting. There were several people coming in to pick up carry out orders, too.  We will give them another try and be more adventurous in our selections."}
{"text":"This place was much better than we expected after walking in and looking around, it is really not much to look at! But overall, we were really impressed. There were definitely some high points and low points to the meal. The service was very efficient, but in an inattentive sort of way. By that I mean, our drinks were ALWAYS full, but getting the waitress's attention to place our order was a challenge. The pacing of our meal was non-existent. We received appetizers of miso soup (really good) and a cold noodle cucumber salad (nothing special). We also ordered some gyoza, which was below average. It was soggy and poorly fried, I wouldn't order it again. The Spicy Tempura Roll and Spicy Crazy Roll were both well liked by the spicy folks. The Unagi roll was a good standard. The Crunch Dragon was my least favorite, the flavor fell a little flat and it tasted a little mealy. I really enjoyed the salmon and salmon roe nigiri. My favorite part of our meal was the side of veggie fried rice. It was a huge portion and tasted amazing!!! Overall, so pleased we gave this place a try."}
{"text":"I really liked the sushi here. It's grey tasting and fresh. Plus, they have a really good tasting soup that is given before the meal.  Just the waiting time was bad."}
{"text":"I don't know how long this place has been here, but I've been looking right past it for at least a couple of years' worth of periodic visits to Champaign.    My dad is a big sushi fan, so he was glad to discover another local option (Kamakura is still apparently his favorite, but I can't speak to their sushi as I've only been for hibachi).  The wait staff at Kame was friendly, attentive and kept our meal going at a great pace.  The kitchen was keeping up excellently with our staggered ordering.  The vibe inside feels, oddly, much more like a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered the Calamari Teriyaki Bento Box. It offered a series of foods that were sincere to the subtleties of flavor and aesthetic characteristic of Japan."}
{"text":"I recently had the opportunity to come back with my parents and I'm happy to say that Sushi Kame is still as wonderful as ever! Instead of dinner, we came during lunch, and we were pleasantly surprised at the great deal of the bento boxes and other lunch specials! For about $30, we each got a golden scallops appetizer, a teriyaki steak box, a tonkatsu box, and an order of chicken yakisoba. We finished with stuffed bellies and had leftovers to go! The service was quick and the restaurant was clean as usual. The bento boxes came with a lot of rice, two pieces of California rolls, salad, and tempura. Everything was delicious and the pork and steak were really juicy. Prior to getting our food, we were served a complimentary miso soup and cucumber noodles.  Besides that, I want to really highlight the golden scallops! While Sushi Kame is a sushi restaurant, don't neglect the rest of the menu - ORDER THIS!! It's soooo yummy! The menu description is \"sea scallops topped with light egg sauce\" which sounds uninteresting, but it's definitely worth ordering. The menu literally does this appetizer no justice. Served on a lovely shell, slices of scallop are baked with Kewpie mayo giving it a melt-in-your-mouth texture and savory, yet sweet taste. It's covered in a light egg sauce and there's also a side of it that comes with it. The salty flavor and creamy feeling of the extra sauce really compliments the scallops. Pretty to look at and great to eat! Sharing may not be possible even with the large amount of scallops - I really devoured this! While Sushi Kame is off-campus and less accessible than Sakanaya, I love it so much!"}
{"text":"Normally I'd leave 4 stars but the service wasn't up to par. Sushi was good by Champaign standards. But the service was slow, and we had to wait 30 minutes to be told they ran out of the dessert we had ordered."}
{"text":"I'm completely enraptured with Sushi Kame and Jay-San the Sushi Joa. I've been coming to this restaurant since it was Hinode. In the years since Kame has opened, I have developed a love of Japanese food that I never knew before.  Sitting at the sushi bar, I developed a close relationship with Jay-san for at least 5 years now. The best part about the hosts/owners being so kind and hospitable is that they offer menu choices you rarely find at other Japanese restaurants. You can literally create your own roll out of anything! This Japanese restaurant additionally offers authentic and amazing Korean foods. Just out of the kindness of their hearts, Jay and Mimi have shared with me, and numerous others, rare touches of their culture that I could never replace- I've never had a masago roll with a cracked quail egg on top before I came here! I always have the absolute best eating experiences here. Even when they're ridiculously busy- I've been known to sit hours here and drink sake and forget how long its been since I've seen my waitress. The food and people are just that good. So, if you're the typical American consumer looking to get in, shove food down your hatch, and get out, don't go to Sushi Kame. Walk down the street and spend twice the money at KoFusion."}
{"text":"The steak teriyaki here was great! I was expecting something mediocre but it wasnt whatsoever. I got a bento box. I also really liked the side of battered/fried veggies. There was green beans and sweet potato. The only thing i didnt like was how ginger-based the salad dressing was (but this is just a matter of preference)-- but overall great place!"}
{"text":"The first time I tried Sushi Kame I thought it was good. I didn't exactly try their sushi. I got the chicken teriyaki bento box and that was okay. My second visit I ordered various rolls. They were decent. I thought I would enjoy it more but it would either be lacking flavor or it wouldn't be enough. I do enjoy their appetizers- the miso soup and the cold noodles. I wish I knew how to make those.   As for the ambiance, it's comfortable. It's good for dates or meetings. That said, it's a little more chaotic on really busy days. Expect the sushi to take a while especially when everybody else is ordering them. The service is fine as well.   Nevertheless, I wouldn't completely forget about Sushi Kame. There's such a few selection of good restaurants when it comes to sushi at Chambana and Sushi Kame will still be able to satisfy your cravings."}
{"text":"Fairly disastrous visit. A hot night and the air conditioning was off or non-existent, so the meal was spent in a light sweat. Our server seemed confused and unwelcoming. Hot towels came before I was finished with the menu and I really wanted to wipe the sticky menu residue off my hands.  By the time I was done with the menu, the towel was cold and dry.  Many mistakes were made on the order and I had to insist rather persistently in order to get the food I ordered rather than the food I was (erroneously) brought.  * The miso soup was passable, but the scallions were none too fresh.  * Nigiri is priced per piece rather than per pair, a disturbing recent trend.   * Inarizushi was passable but not flavorful.   * Tamago was thin with an uninspired flavor.    * The \"real\" Kani was awful -- although the menu did not specify, it was soft shell crab and super tough, fishy, and chewy. I would have been better off with \"krab stick\".  * The house roll, the \"chicken run\" had tough, dry chicken as though it had been fried long ago and left to languish in the air.  * I received an ikura nigiri for some reason. Not sure how that got in there -- not something I would order.  * The \"Philadelphia Roll\" was listed smoked salmon, cream cheese, avocado and cucumber. I am not sure how the trend of putting avocado and cucumber into a Philly came about, but in my view it should be smoked salmon, scallion, and cream cheese.  Since this was a special dinner and a treat, I ordered very specifically: \"smoked salmon, scallion, cream cheese, inside-out\".  I got something else entirely. I asked for it to be corrected and it was, however the scallions were scant and the roll was not inside-out. It wasn't bad, but I was far from impressed.  I am glad that when the bill came, there was no attempt to charge us for the mistakes that they made, so at least that came out okay."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant in Champaign, hands-down.  I don't like Yellowfin (inconsistant with freshness), I don't like Sushi Rock or Sushi Avenue (both cheap but neither tastes very good), I definitely don't like Kamakura (bad service and crappy food), I don't like Miso (Urbana...across from Carle??), Oishi is ok (#2 on my list for sushi, but a very distant #2 -- they get points for creativeness and plating) and Kofusion is local but is very over rated ($1 sushi night on Monday is ok, but most selections are cooked and have either cream cheese or something \"tempura\" worked into it one way or another).  And it still stands that there is no good gyoza in Champaign.... no one pan fries them properly... they're usually very soggy and the filling sucks.  Better off to make your own.  They have bento boxes for about $10-$13 for lunch.  They start you off with a cold noodle dish (very good) and some miso soup.... I had my one year old son with me once, and they brought out more tofu cubes for him.... he gobbled them all down saying, \"More cheese! More cheese!!!\" (whatever gets him to eat tofu! LOL).   The fish is good -- I mean, it's not the kind of fresh fish that you'd get in Tokyo or NYC, but it is GOOD.  The rice is seasoned well.   The tempura in the box is also very good -- not a heavy breading like other restaurants have.     I came in the other day at 1pm and it was BUSY.  The busiest I've ever seen.  There was only one waitress.... but the service was OUTSTANDING for it being one service.  She had some sort of system down because she had it down -- no one was left waiting or fuming.  Water glasses were kept filled, food was hot (or room temperature if you ordered sushi), food was prompt, checks were dealt with fast and I was left dumbfounded -- I couldn't believe how wonderful the service was that day -- I mean, I didn't want the waitress chit chatting with me but for the amount of tables she was dealing with, it was excellent.  I tipped her well that day..... and this is why I gave this restaurant five stars today..... usually it would be about a four star.... but her service (and I believe she is either the wife of the owner or at least a long standing waitress) was impeccable."}
{"text":"This restaurant was fabulous. The restaurant itself is very pretty and clean and there were very few people inside which led to very fast service. I got the California roll and the salmon roll both were amazing. They tasted very fresh and you get a good portion of both!  You also get a bonus miso soup with the rolls and this little noodle teriyaki salad which were both very yummy as well. Everything was reasonably priced my meal was under $20 with 20% tip and I felt comfortably full.  Highly recommend, quick, delicious, and fun!"}
{"text":"The Love-Love Roll ($6.95) is what I order every time. It has everything I want in a roll and it's affordable and filling! I do enjoy the fact that they offer their guests a small portion of sliced cucumber, cold noodles w/ rice vinegar and a cup of miso soup before the meal. You don't get that anywhere else in town...  Sometimes, it is difficult to have a power lunch due to the fact that the staff is outnumbered by its customers."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Definitely don't feel rushed, and pleasant to sit and visit with friend.  Sushi was very good. Soup and noodle salad w meal was very good as well.  I tried saki for the first time...$12 carafe.. Thought this would be better. Didn't mind paying that price but wasn't as yummy as I expected. But wasn't their fault.  Location was good.  Will return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"In town for a triathlon event at UIUC. Loading up on spicy shrimp tempura tuna, Philadelphia roll, Love-Love roll, green turtle roll and ended  with a University roll.  Fabulous. Fresh! Tasty! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sushi Kame is a decent sushi place in downtown Champaign. The sushi is definitely authentic, and some of their sushi was definitely right on the money. That the sushi was relatively cheap only made the experience even better.  The interior is unassuming, which is fine, because it usually means good things for the food. The Nigiri was quite good, and the sweet rice was cooked perfectly. The rolls we had were Crunch (good flavor with a good crunch), sweet potato (best tempura-based roll I've had), Alaska (pretty good, I don't remember much of it, though), green turtle (better than the Crunch) and volcano (not nearly as spicy as it should be).  I sort of wished the soy sauce wasn't just salty (it tasted like the stuff that comes out of the bottles at standard Chinese restaurants). Some of the rolls could have been a bit more flavorful. Overall, though, I'd definitely go back to Sushi Kame when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I came here to treat myself and friends to some we deserved \"good\" food nearly 3 years ago. I remember telling myself to \"treat my self\" (parks and recreation reference) and for sashimi.  I felt like crying because the sashimi was too thick and was obviously not fresh. It was very chewy and took me quite some time to try to get through one pice of it without wanting to puke. Raw fish needs to be fresh and cut into thinner slices so that a person can enjoy it. Sashimi shouldn't be chewy but should melt in your mouth. I am now scarred for life and have learned my lesson to not just eat sashimi from anywhere."}
{"text":"Sushi Kame is probably my fav restaurant in C-U! The food is fresh and awesome-ly priced, with a great selection of sushi fo beginners or sushi-pros! I eat here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Soon after leaving Naperville, IL, I drove down to Champaign, IL to check out this small town in the middle of Illinois.   Champaign is a true University town (unlike faux places like Duluth) and it offers a wide variety of local restaurants and great coffee shops.  Having a second craving for sushi, I stopped by Sushi Kame to see if it would be a good option should I wind up living there.   The place was small and pretty empty as the University was on spring break, but the sushi was very good.  The spicy tuna hand roll was clean and layered (opposed to mixing chunks of ahi with the ubiquitous spicy sauce),  I also had the tempura scallop roll, which was awesome! Again clean flavor and the scallop was noticeably fresh.   I had  a few other simple pieces and each one was well prepared.  I would definitely recommend Sushi Kame to anybody looking for a solid roll."}
{"text":"On the outside, Sushi Kame looks like a dump. But when you enter, it looks like a standard, normal sushi place. The decor is a little dated, but I think that adds to its character!  I went with a group of 4 people. Between the four of us, we ordered about 8 roles. I understand this is a lot of sushi to make, but it took about 25 minutes to get our food. I wished that the sushi was chilled a little more, but it was just made.   I am not a fan of miso soup, but my friends liked theirs. I also  had the cucumber noodles. I was not a fan of them.   We ordered the avocado role, two salmon rolls (one spicy and one mild), and and shrimp roll. They were all good. I did not have a problem with the fish being \"rancid\" like many other reviews.   Overall, I liked Sushi Kame and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for some casual sushi."}
{"text":"Black magic, thats how they do it.  In a small city called Champaign, isolated in the middle of the United States, far away from any ocean body, the people at Sushi Kame conjures up some of the best sushi I have ever had.    In the middle of freakin Illinois, who would've thought.  My roommates and I were feigning for some sushi and decided to try out this place, what a great surprise.  Its a small joint, nothing fancy, with cute waitresses and cheap dining furniture.  But who gives a damn, they make the best Uni and salmon nigiri.    My all time favorite sushi is the uni (sea urchin).  Every place I have been to, except for one, had uni that tasted really fishy.  And I hate that!  But this place had the most buttery, savory, fresh uni that I have ever had.  It was so good, I ordered 12 uni nigiri pieces the third time I went.  The second time I went they had ran out of uni, crushing my delicate little heart into tiny tiny pieces.      The food is great, my roommates ordered some rolls and teriyaki dishes which were all excellent.  The prices are very reasonable and service is good.  If your ever out here in this quaint little college town, Sushi Kame is a must."}
{"text":"I've had sushi at a lot of places in Champaign, but nothing comes close to how good the sushi at Sushi Kame is. I love to go here because it is never too crowded, they provide a full meal for you, and it's reasonably priced.   The service provided is great and fast for a sit down sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"For champaign, best sushi. Very good prices for its large portions. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A cool place to stop by if you want some cheap sushi, but they DEFINITELY over-rice their rolls and put way less fish. The vegetable tempura is tasty but service took forever while we were just waiting for a to-go order...nearly a one hour wait and only one other table was in the restaurant. I don't know if I'd ever go back."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Kame- it's cheap, cozy, and the staff is great- very attentive and friendly!  They start you off with complimentary soup and a little salad. The sushi is fresh, rolls are awesome,  and this place has none of the fake pretentiousness of some other places.  Also, after your meal, they bring you a little piece of fruit- perfect!  :) A++ for service, sushi, friendliness, and lack of pretentiousness!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a friend. They didn't have many veggie options for the rolls but they customized it for us. They started us off with a complementary miso soup, noodles and a house salad. The house salad was delicious. It had this ginger dressing which was to die for. That was probably my favorite thing here at this place. The service and the staff is nice. The place was pretty clean. Would definitely go here again and get the salad!"}
{"text":"one word...AMAZING!  I have been to all, and I mean ALL, sushi restaurants in Champaign Urbana area, and this place has the best sushi. My friends and I thought we should give this place a try last Sunday, and I'm so glad we did. They first give you complementary miso soup, and a small bowl of noodles with a cucumber. I loved it! Especially the noodles! The food came out fairly quickly given that the place was pretty busy. We got spicy shrimp tempura, love-love, volcano, dragon, and other sushi rolls (we ordered too much, so I don't remember all the names). Everything tasted wonderful, and I love that our sushi rolls came in a huge BOAT! Overall, service was great, the fish was fresh, and the rolls were lovely. My friends and I will be back soon :-)"}
{"text":"Sushi Kame gets my vote for best sushi in the area. Consistent service, food, and value."}
{"text":"Had to wait 10 mins to be seated while two waitresses passed by. Had to wait forever to get menu. When decided to walk out, a waitress passed by but didn't even bother to ask. Very poor customer service"}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi spot in town. The prices vary from ridiculous to good, and the lunch bento boxes are probably the best lunch deal I've seen at a local Japanese place. I usually don't really notice service or atmosphere one way or the other but the restaurant is near perfect on both of these counts."}
{"text":"This review is for my take out order of salmon sashimi and the chicken teriyaki entree.  Likes: - entree comes with a ginger dressed (though just plain lettuce) salad, miso soup, and rice. - plentiful menu! - convenient location downtown right across from the Hyatt.  Dislikes: - chewiness of the chicken teriyaki; it was rather dry. - slightly slimy and fibrous/chewy texture of the salmon sashimi; I've had much fresher. - too many styrofoam boxes in the take out order!  Not very green.  I noted the interior and tables/chairs are worn and dated, so it could use a refresh.  I'm glad to have tried Kame, but would return to Sakanaya or Kofusion for my future Asian food cravings."}
{"text":"The food is fairly good, not too bad. The place was spacious for groups. The sushi was pretty good but the udongs weren't that great. The bento boxes were pretty good. If you're looking for a group of friends to eat together, then I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Got a bento box.  Food was plentiful for the price and tasty.  Will eat there again."}
{"text":"Great place and certainly less crowded than Ko Fusion on a weekend. The service was courteous and I really enjoyed the chirashi I had which is basically sashimi over rice. My friends also had the chicken teriyaki and a couple different rolls. We were all content with our meal and I definitely plan on coming back. This is a much simpler sushi place with more traditional dishes you'll see at a regular sushi place compared to Ko Fusion which has a lot of American sushi rolls and honestly sometimes gimmicks."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy sushi. Of the sushi restaurants in the Champaign / Urbana area, this is our favorite. Their White Dragon Maki is fabulous, as is their Love-love Maki. Those two are probably our favorites, while we rotate through many other excellent choices. The service is always friendly. The experience is always enjoyable."}
{"text":"Firmly believe this place is doing the best Japanese food in town.  Def the best bento boxes!    Their tempura actually tastes like, I don't know, tempura.  As opposed to other, trendier places in town where the tempura tastes like the fried veg you'd get at a county fair.  The sushi here has been spot on.  Can't rave enough about the tasty and cheap eats."}
{"text":"Heard about this on Yelp, my girlfriend and I went there for the first time today. I lived in Japan for 9 weeks a couple years ago and understand the quality of food and service that you get there, but I certainly wouldn't hold restaurants in Champaign to that same standard. This is a small University town and access to fresh seafood is limited at best.  Having said that, I was rather underwhelmed by Sushi Kame. The server (a middle-aged Korean lady) was very demanding and impatient. My girlfriend takes a long time to decide what she wants and when we were given the extensive menu, I knew it would be a while. So I asked the server if we could order the egg yolk sauce with rice dish side-dish while we looked at the menu. She gave me a very accusing look, as though I was committing some sort of crime, and then scampered off to put the order in.  When she returned,  I attempted to order several more authentic Japanese items like [kama] toro, uni, and oyster, only to find none of these were \"in season\". We settled on a special spicy salmon roll, the green turtle roll, and several pieces of nigiri.  As others have mentioned before, the egg yolk sauce with rice was really delicious. It is very rich, so you will need to share it with someone. The sushi was rather ordinary (by Champaign standards). The rolls fell apart prematurely indicating the rice did not have the right consistency/stickiness. The ginger was mild in flavor, the wasabe obviously dyed horseradish, and I swear they served regular soy sauce, not the special variety for sushi, because it was extremely salty.  I can't comment on other dishes on the menu, and they may be delicious, but I'm not likely to come here again. For me the rudeness of the server coupled with the subpar sushi was enough to deter me from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good sushi at reasonable price. Definitely try the spicy salmon role and spicy tuna roll."}
{"text":"Fine but not great sushi. I think they will need to up their game now that sakanaya is in town. Don't really think this mediocre looking place will stand up to the fancy new places that have recently opened in town."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. By the time my lunch hour was up, I still have not gotten my food. Asked the waiter to box my meal instead, and even that took a while. The restaurant really shouldn't have weekday lunch service if it cannot serve food within 40 minutes of ordering."}
{"text":"Wow, I was surprised at how fresh the fish is here and how tasty the rolls are.  The lovelove doesn't sound good but I promise its amazing!  I have tried the bento boxes, nigiri (raw fish over rice) and rolls, everything has been delicious.  I travel quite a bit and rarely find a sushi restaurant in a land locked city this good.  I will be back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been to Sushi Kame lots of times, and it's always a great experience.  I would definitely say it's my favorite sushi place in the area.   They start you out with a free cucumber and somen noodle salad.  It's small, but very appetizing.  I still can't figure out exactly what the dressing is, but I always drink the extra.  After that they give you a (also free) miso soup, which is pretty good as far as miso soup goes.    Oh, and the green tea is free and they use real matcha as far as I can tell.  It's got a really nice, light, floral taste.  I've also been to Yellowfin a few times.  While Yellowfin is good, the reason that I like Sushi Kame more is probably their \"American Sushi\" combo.  For about $14, you get three pieces of salmon nigiri, three tuna nigiri, a salmon roll, and the house salad, which is lettuce with ginger dressing.  The slabs of fish on the nigiri are nicely cut and usually pretty thick, giving the sushi a rice-to-fish ratio that definitely favors the fish.   Speaking of the fish, it has always been fresh and clean-tasting, never \"fishy.\"  Admittedly, I've only had non-midwest sushi once, so my basis for comparison is only other sushi in Illinois.    When it comes to maki, I usually stick with the simpler stuff that lets you taste the fish more, so I can't offer much of an opinion on the super tempura fried california rolls or whatever.  The unagi rolls are good though.  I've had the sea urchin here as well, and while it's softer than the stuff at Yellowfin, there's also more of it and it tastes really, really good."}
{"text":"Bento boxes are a good deal for what you get: delicious entree, rice, tempura, pieces of cali sushi roll, salad, miso, and noodle salad. If you're looking for a good priced bento box, this is the place to go.   If you're looking for good quality sushi: SKIP IT. Sushi is mediocre and fish quality is poor. I mean, if you don't have much experience or knowledge for what good and fresh quality sushi actually tastes like, then you might enjoy the place because you don't know better.   Nothing special about the atmosphere and servers aren't exactly charming."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh sashimi! Had the chirashi don and it was great! Very affordable and would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sushi Kame is placed in downtown Champaign surrounded by the more pricey restaurant such as Jim Gould, Escobar, and Kofusion. You would expect some overpriced meals at Sushi Kame but the items on the menu is reasonably priced. The food is simple and not gimmicky like the trendier places in town. Also the people are very polite.   You can't go wrong with any of the items on the menu. If you would like a warm soup for you meal, go for the Udon soup (I believe it's $2.00 for one tempura shrimp to be added with the soup). If you want something with a little bit of everything, the bento box consist of the meat and served with 1 roll of California tempura, salad, and rice. More importantly, the sushi is great and they never run out of fish!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today and were SO pleased. Thank you yelpers for directing us here!  We got two rolls and the sushi bento box and enjoyed everything we got.  The Love-Love roll was especially good, with each bite a little explosion of flavor from the cilantro, spicy sauce, and pepper.  Everything tasted fresh and was neatly prepared, and, while California rolls are usually just sushi filler, the two pieces in the bento box were fantastic and would actually be worth ordering on their own.  The Sunset roll was expensive, but good.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place is rated so high! I had many different rolls of sushi here and save for two, they were all terrible. Most of the rolls were doused with a very spicy sauce. I live in Texas and am used to spicy, but this was so much, I could barely even continue to eat the sushi (we had to stop). It was so spicy, you couldn't even taste any flavors of the roll... which completely defeats the purpose of sushi.   The edamame was good but grossly overpriced at $3 for a tiny little bowl. The tempura sampler dish was really tasty and priced fairly. It took forever to get service any single time we needed anything, even though there was almost no one in the restaurant when I came one weekday night.   I came here with my mom and sister based on Yelp reviews hoping to explore some new joints in the Champoobanana area and was immensely disappointed. I'll stick with Kofusion for all my Champaign sushi desires."}
{"text":"Great Beef Udon! Nice, fresh, fat noodles . The broth in the beef udon is divine, some of the best I've had in years since I left Okinawa. I was expecting the same fare as most Japanese restaurants in the states, it was great to see a bit of variety. I'll be back to try the gyu don, katsu don and other bentos."}
{"text":"Waited an hour and a half for some of the worst rolls and steak teriyaki I have ever had."}
{"text":"This place is good. I always worry about sushi in the Midwest. This place was clean, the ingredients fresh, and the service very good. It's the kind of comfy place one wants to come back to."}
{"text":"My new favorite place in town for sushi! Very quiet atmosphere.  The two times I have been in already it was very quiet. Perfect date spot. On top of your meal and/or appetizer they bring out little appetizers free of charge so you're not starving while you're waiting.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"They have the best sushi in town. I don't know if I call it the best sushi but I do eat here when I crave sushi. There is almost always a place to sit so no waiting."}
{"text":"I used to have mixed feelings about Kame. I love sushi and I can walk there from work, but the atmosphere was a little odd and I thought the food was expensive for the quality. I can say with confidence now that Kame's food and service has gotten way better. I used to feel guilty for spending the money, but now it's worth it to me.   Large variety of rolls to choose from. I love the caterpillar roll and anything with eel. And I've never had fishy or rancid fish here. Dinner bento boxes have so much food! The price may look steep, but you'll fill up quick.   Good job, Kame! I'm so glad you're growing on your potential."}
{"text":"Sushi Kame, I love you.  Ironically, I never come here for the sushi. Good sushi isn't very hard to find, but good Japanese food is especially in a town this size.   Granted, service isn't very good. The waiters weren't very experienced, but to be honest I don't care that much about service."}
{"text":"The food is average and the service is highly below average. My friend and I came here and ordered two sushi rolls each. They literally took 1 hour and 35 minutes to bring our food out. I would not recommend this place for sushi because the food isn't that great, it's over priced and the service is terrible."}
{"text":"Ehhh.  It's better than Ko Fusion but that's not saying much.  I also am rather dissapointed that they serve the same things when they were running Sushi County on campus.. except with higher prices!  I don't really think their regular rolls (like tuna or even spicy tuna) is that good even though they are cheap.  I think the rolls with no fresh fish and more expensive (like dragon roll or any eel or crunch roll) for ~$10+ are good.  The service is really mediocre.. they only have one or two waitresses that obviously don't have much experience.  You can wait a long time to order or even get water.  I would drive to Chicago or Bloomington, IL and save your money.  They have yet to have a decent Japanese establishment in Champaign."}
{"text":"After a recent visit to Sushi Kame, I thought I would update my review with even more positive, tasty comments and suggestions.    First (and this is kind of a silly compliment), I was impressed by their spicy tuna roll.  Most places use older, leftover pieces of fish to make spicy rolls, hoping that diners will overlook the borderline-spoiled fish once its been finely chopped and masked with mayonnaise and chili.  Compare that shady technique with the way it's done at Sushi Kame, where the chef applies the spicy sauce alongside WHOLE slices of tuna (not that minced stuff).  You can still appreciate the freshness of the fish without having it saturated in a misleading sauce.  As far as I'm concerned, the spicy rolls at Sushi Kame are totally legitimate.  As usual, I was also delightfully surprised by some of the offerings on their \"daily specials\" menu.  For my appetizer, I asked for the takoyaki (a regional specialty from Osaka that consists of octopus encased in pan-fried bread).  This made me giddy with foodie glee--this dish is relatively rare in the United States, and much more so in the Midwest.  The takoyaki came topped with a classic Otafuku sauce and katsuobushi shavings (dried bonito flakes).  While not perfect, I give Sushi Kame props for serving a Japanese street dish and some delicacies beyond the usual expected fare at Japanese restaurants.  Unfortunately, I don't think they offer the daily specials menu everyday (ironic?).  I think it's only available on certain nights during the week, but if you happen to receive that small, hand-written insert in your menu, I would definitely give some of their other dishes consideration."}
{"text":"I was surprisingly impressed with Sushi Kame!   My mom and I went for dinner and each ordered a bento box. The bento box is huge! and it has a bit of everything... some salad, assorted tempura, rice, california rolls (that can be replaced with any of their regular rolls with a small charge). Definitely don't recommend the bento box if you just want a light dinner. Luckily, I was really hungry so it was perfect for me!  I ordered the Tonkatsu (Deep fried pork) bento box while my mom ordered the salmon teriyaki bento box. My tonkatsu bento box was really good except for the one piece of ebi (shrimp) tempura. I don't know how to describe but it just tasted really weird. I think they don't let the oil drip and dry after they deep fry the shrimp so it doesn't get nice and crispy. Instead, it was kind of soggy which was disappointed. Also their Tonkatsu sauce tasted funny. I don't know if they make their own sauce but it definitely didn't taste like traditional tonkatsu sauce.   My mom's salmon teriyaki was delicious! Salmon was cooked so nicely and it came with sauteed vegetables as well. Between the salmon teriyaki and the tonkatsu, I'd definitely say the salmon was the better choice!   The good thing about sushi kame was the service. Our server was really helpful and nice. She recommend the love roll to me in replacement of the california roll and what a great recommendation it was!   Overall, I was very satisfied.. oh, did i mention that a bento box is only 12 dollars? All that food for 12 dollars!!!!! Amazing. Definitely will come back again soon."}
{"text":"Don't ever dine in unless you're not hungry and planning to stay for over 3 hours. No doubt, the WORST service I've EVER experienced in my entire life.   Yes, they were busy, but what restaurant in downtown Champaign isn't on a Saturday night? DEAL. 25 minutes for the server to take our drink order. Another 20 minutes to get our 4 waters, then we tried to order, but she ran away. Flagged her down and put in our order another 10 minutes later, then started making bets to see how long it would take to get our food. Mind you, we were already there for 55 minutes with only water.   Needless to say, we all were under. It took them, I believe, 57 minutes to bring out 2 rolls, sashimi, and soup. ...but there were 4 of us. Our fourth order didn't come in until after everyone had already made a dent in their food (he felt bad and didn't want us to wait until he got his food). I was so angry, I can't even remember how the sushi tasted. We also didn't receive that cucumber salad thing that every other table received, and only got our miso soup upon flagging her down.   We TRIED to be patient, we TRIED to get attention from any waitress we could, but nothing. I felt I should express how completely dissatisfied I was with the service to the manager, so I did (very kindly, btw). She responded with something along the lines of, well you didn't make reservations, then continued to say that because we hadn't made reservations, they're not obligated to cater to us as quickly as the customers that did. ...REALLY?  Moral of the story? ...make reservations or you'll get treated like garbage here."}
{"text":"Was in Champaign for business 10/14/15 and had a taste for sushi. Yelp pointed me in the direction of Sushi Kame. I went with the Maki Combo off the lunch menu which included a spicy tuna roll and a California roll.  The Cali was ok but I have never seen a Spicy tuna roll with so little tuna and a big wedge of avocado?  I know...avacado!!  Next time I want an avocado roll w extra rice and a dash of spicy tuna, this is my place....otherwise there are many other sushi places that care about serving quality food. This place disappoints big time.  Look at the photo. What a joke!!"}
{"text":"The initial wait for the food was a little long for how not full the restaurant was, but when it came, everything was amazing. In my group of three, we shared the sampler appetizer, and each had either entrees or sushi rolls. Everything in terms of food was amazing, but as I stated at first, the wait time did not correspond to how almost empty the place was. But it still wasn't really a problem because our server was really sweet and I was in good company. Overall, worth it and I'd gladly go again."}
{"text":"I love this place! Close to my work for a lunch out & a peaceful ambiance, despite being located Downtown Champaign. I try new things every time & never disappointed! Very friendly, accommodating staff, too. My recommendations? Love love roll (obviously- see my pic), sake bomb, spicy crazy, sun set, crunch, & university (expensive, but wide roll with incredible flavor!). House salad always a must for maybe $2. Golden scallops app also delicious if you're looking for warm, creamy, buttery, savory. Come here for a nice, quiet date :)"}
{"text":"Hey, who would have guessed you'd be able to get decent sushi and sashimi in the middle of illinois?   Huge menu with probably something for everyone, including hot cooked items for those who don't want to order raw fish.  Recommend: Rainbow - pretty good Alaska - Ok a little spicy Caterpillar roll - great amount of sliced avocado to eel to rice ratios.   Skip: Chirashi -- great selection. the white tuna and salmon were fantastic. the yellow tail and the tuna should have been fresher. mm, may i repeat, white tuna... mmm.. [this was previous review based on the time i went in the summer when no students were around]  EDIT ::: WENT BACK AND TRIED IT AGAIN B/C I HAD A DECENT SET LAST TIME BUT IT IS NOT CONSISTENT. TONIGHT'S CHIRASHI was not good, I give it barely a 2 star. Fish were all poorly sliced, they even left 2 MUSHY chunks of the back end of the tuna with a trailing white dribble of tendon, DISGRACEFUL, all fish lacked flavor or seemed as if they were sitting under a plastic cover too long since they all had this strange empty taste and smell to it... that white tuna I wrote about before? this time it was a bit icy, with poor texture and no taste. then comes the ginger, which has gone bad and made most of the dish smell like a dirty rag. Perhaps all the customers during the school year makes it so they don't have to care as much about quality? Some fish also seemed precut and must have sat on the plate too long. NO no no.  Maki - insignificant. Spider roll, non spicey - about half of the amount of crab that should be in there. Uni - sure try it if you are craving it but it's not a great representation  Kind and attentive service. Hot tea. Good presentation. Mediocre ambiance. Stick to the rolls."}
{"text":"This was most definitely the slowest sushi restaurant that I have been to before. The waiters were slow to take our order and when we finally were able to order, our food came out even slower. Usually I wouldn't complain but seeing as there wasn't many people in the restaurant, I really dont see an excuse to why it was like this. The waiter even forgot to bring us soy sauce... I just felt that they really didn't care. The sushi wasn't the greatest. The fish was good and fresh but the quality of the rolls ruined some of the overall experience of the sushi. Also, do they offer any drinks other than water?? I would probably pass on recommending anyone to eat here in the future."}
{"text":"I went back for dinner. We had 2 different regular maki that were really good: the fancy spicy tuna and tempura sweet potato. I also ordered pieces of Hamachi (yellowfin) and Unagi (eel) that were also great. The unagi was as good as any I can remember. We also got their nightly special, \"the Ninja Roll\", which was filled with all manner of goodness and wholly delish. With tea for two, miso, and their little cucumber/noodle dish (miso and cucumber dish is included with all meals), the total was only $31.00. That is a really good price in my book, and is why I raised the rating."}
{"text":"If I'm going to buy some expensive sushi, I expect them to be of high quality. These sushi rolls were not. I ended up spending $16 to get a three roll special of California roll, spicy salmon roll, and spicy tuna roll. The spicy salmon tasted like it wasn't that fresh. The service was very amiable. I wish their servers wore name tags so I could thank them by name."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Champaign for sushi. Prices are reasonable and the food is delicious! I've only come for sushi, and have tried a handful of rolls, but the Spitfire roll (tempura tuna, jalapeno, cream cheese, spicy sauce in a soy wrapper) is what keeps me coming back! You get miso soup and a little dish of noodles before the meal. Awesome! My friend also loves the beef soba soup.   Service is very fast during dinner hour and the waitresses are very attentive."}
{"text":"Waited nearly 1.5 hours for our food in a half empty restaurant on a Thursday night.  After watching other later patrons get served before our party of 3, we finally asked the waitress to check on our order.  After our long-awaited sushi dinners finally showed up, it looked like some rookie person threw our sushi together with the rice crumbling all around.  When we brought it to the manager's attention (including the ridiculous wait time), the sushi chef overheard us and started yelling across the restaurant in front of all the customers.  We apologized to the chef and tried to explain, but the manager then turned on us and said, \"You can either eat and pay full price or get up and leave.\"  Hungry, but now embarrassed and upset, we just all got up and left.  Horrible experience from people with obviously no care for customer service and no care for providing a good dining experience.  Many more options in Champaign-Urbana area.  Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"After dining in, it turned out not so bad after all. Also, I feel much appreciative of the fish-to-rice ratio of their sushi."}
{"text":"I have two completely different experiences at this place. I think it is the best sushi in Champaign but the service makes it hard for me to commend them.  First visit: slow night so I was immediately seated. Great dishes (I recommend the bento box for those who are not adventurous) made fresh and service was pretty good.   Second visit: Trash service. We were constantly missing items. Some orders were late and others just never arrived and there were no apologies. We had to call waitress over several times just to get ordered and she still missed things. Overall I was pleased with the shrimp fried rice and sushi rolls.  I'm not sure what is going on there but they need to get it together."}
{"text":"What I got to eat was really good. I requested my rolls to be wrapped in soy paper. First one came out Devine I really enjoyed it. Spicy crab with shrimp. I also ordered a bento box and when it came to the table California roll wrapped in seaweed paper. I sent it back repeating my request for soy paper. The cook said he would not change it. It came back to my table. I said I would vomit if I ate it  and I was not eating it and so I sent it back. Bless her heart she came back with it again and I was told to eat the other food on plate. I said no I wanted my check. She took it away then brought it back and said he would fix the roll the way I wanted but it would be at an extra cost. I said no thank I asked for my bill again and that  I was leaving. I tipped her good but I also looked on my check where she wrote what I wanted and in her handwriting it said soy paper on roll. Really?? And I would have to pay extra?? Don't think so."}
{"text":"We came in tonight at 9. They were pretty short staffed but managed everyone pretty well! Service was a bit slow but nothing too disappointing. The sushi boat was awesome! They have tons of different kinds of rolls. Something for everyone! It can be hard to remember what you want so the ordering sheet is pretty handy. They also bring out a bunch of little salad and soup prior to the sushi. It was pretty cute and tasty! My boyfriend ordered teriyaki chicken which was good but a little salty. All in all, we had a great time and everything was tasty and not super expensive."}
{"text":"Sushi Kame was the first place that I tried sushi, and it made my fall in love with it. They have a wide selection of rolls for a very reasonable price, especially when you consider the little extras they throw in there between meals. This is the place that holds the standard for sushi for me, and most places don't compare. Great service, great prices, great food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places in Champaign.  The atmosphere could be better but overall I enjoy their food."}
{"text":"Their salmon bento box for lunch is amazing and delicious! I have really enjoyed it. I've always had great service coming here. I wasn't too happy with the chicken udon soup I tried today. It was good flavored but it seemed to be lacking noodles...and chicken. There were just a few scraps here and there, and it was pretty disappointing. I recommend their sushi rolls and bento boxes."}
{"text":"Of all of the places in Champaign, I think that Sushi Kame does Japanese food the best. I have gone twice and each time ordering something a little different and I can only offer praise to this restaurant.  I once asked for a chicken tempura which was not on the menu but they went ahead and made it for me. It was really good so I am puzzled why they do not put it on the menu at some point. Their teriyaki glaze is quite good: not too salty but not too sweet. I also like the cut-up vegetables they put alongside it. The yakisoba is great too with a little more noodle than veggie and/or meat. The sushi, while I chose the tame Tuna roll, was very tasty and well wrapped. It tasted fresh and I felt like I did not have to pay an arm and a leg like I would elsewhere. The miso soup was also likeable and that is a big compliment from me because usually I am not a big fan of miso.  Anyway, give this place a try. Definitely worth the trek downtown and it is the right price range for a college student."}
{"text":"We had a group of 6 on a Friday at 1pm. The restaurant was not crowded. Decor was dated and almost dingy. Calamari was good but in a long stick shape I've never seen before. Fried dumplings were ok. Edemame was, edemame. I ordered the Bento Shashimi Lunch box with fried rice. The portions were generous and the fish tasted clean and fresh. I also ordered the Campus Roll (soft shell crab, avocado with eel on top) the eel was kinda fishy but probably just less BBQ flavor than I'm used to. Giving 3 stars because it's pretty much what I expected to find. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Quaint little sushi place downtown Champaign. Went there over lunch on a Friday with coworkers. There was no wait time and the service was fast. Got a two roll lunch with squid salad. The rolls were terrific and came with a small side of miso soup and salad - around $10. The squid salad was $4.50, a bit pricy for its size but tasty. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim while in downtown Champaign with my girlfriend. I saw the yelp rating before and decided that it was worth a shot. Boy was I wrong.  It started off bad, we waited at the front for a while before being seated, then waited... and waited... and after maybe 20 minutes we were given our menus. After ordering a bento box, a bowl of yaki soba, and a small appetizer, we started our next wait. After an outrageous 30 minutes, our appetizer came out, tasted alright, but the 30 minute wait for that was not acceptable. (it was the korokke, I can't imagine that taking very long to make). Then we waited another 30 minutes for our main course. I had to ask the staff for an update, since they never even spoke to us after we made our order.  Well now we got our food at least right? Well I wish that was the end of it all.  The food was terrible.  My beef yaki soba was tiny and there was barely any meat in it at all.  Curl your pointer finger to the tip of your thumb. The empty area between your fingers can fit all the meat that was in the dish. The meat that was in it had NO flavor at all. It was as if they forgot to add anything, not even salt. The noodles tasted alright, but they were nothing special, average at best.   My girlfriend got the salmon bento box. The piece of salmon in it was tiny as well, and was so salty she couldn't eat it after the first two bites. Same goes for the veggies that were soaked in that sauce. The rice in the bento was probably the best part of the whole meal, and it felt like they didn't add quite enough water to it.  After being first ignored by a waiter when I tried to get my check, we got to wait another 15-20 minutes before it was brought to us.   Awful experience. Not even considering giving them a second try after that (and I'm usually willing to try every place at least twice) Stay away"}
{"text":"Amazing food for the price. I love the cucumber salad they start you off with. The bento box is also awesome. It's great if you want just a little bit of everything and at around $8, it was well worth every penny. Their sushi alone is also amazing. It feels more like a traditional Japanese restaurant compared to other restaurants in Champaign. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yeah, most of the one and two stars are sadly true, we ended up eating our sushi with nothing to  hold soy sauce in so we can dip the sushi in.    The wait was incredibly long. Like long. Loooooooong.  It's a great place to have a date with someone you really like, like when you are on a dopamine rush and you can just stare into each other's eyes for hours, because it'll take that long to go through your meal.   The salmon sushi was pitiful. But the eel was good.  The sushi was not worth the money, it was pretty expensive.   The server we had was really nice and was apologetic for the wait, but I rather kofusion, I at least can get drunk off the white dragon there."}
