{"text":"Not sure what to say about this place...we arrived on a Saturday night at 9:30pm and walked up to the bar to ask to be seated. I guess the waitress(?) asked us to pay $5 cover- my gf asked 'for what?' We wanted to eat! After being seated, we were given food menus, (no wine or drink menus) and then were ignored by approximately 8 ppl who appeared to be working there. No music, no service...and we left. Can't comment on food or the 4pz glasses of wine.  Disappointing experience as we were  excited to see this place open up- looked really nice."}
{"text":"I had been waiting forever for this place to open and as time went on my expectations grew higher and higher. Was invited for there opening night but did not get the opportunity to try the food. Upon walking past last night my husband and i decided to check this place out. VERDICT: Very tasty food...  jerk chicken delish... redneck sushi..... yum yum.... and my husband who is a huge critic when it comes to food gave his tacos \"two thumbs up\".  TORONTO corktown is changing so come take a walk on the wild side and come check this place out."}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends to celebrate another friend's birthday...I have to say that the decor is very nice with dark stained hard wood floors...art works on the walls that you could buy...and the music is very much to my liking, deep house lounge, sort of St. Germain type...now for the food...I started with the Szechuan Edamame...it was ok but I was expecting it to be at least spicy since it was Szechuan...others had the wings who indicated those were good...another friend has the sushi with bacon and plantain, this was good...my main was the basa tacos with this spiced bundle of fried string potatoes, awesome flavour...my better half had the brisket that had a marvelous smoky flavour and tasty BBQ sauce...for dessert, the birthday girl had the house cake...three words: de lich ous! Yes, the service was different than other restaurants, my tacos were lacking the appropriate toppings, but I would go back again and again...have to support local businesses such as this place which has enormous potential to get it better...they off to a good start with some flavourable food."}
{"text":"The place was very cozy and welcoming. A group of us went for dinner for our friends bday. We were greeted very nicely and I had no complaints about service here. Food was absolutely delicious, again, no complaints there. What disappointed me was how a friend and I didn't get our food until everyone was finished theirs. Our entrees came out, but wasn't complete. They forgot to give us fries for our order. So the server came to us with 2 plates of fries and had the audacity to say, \"I'd like to apologize on behalf of the chef for taking so long. The fries are compliments of the chef\". In my mind I was like, \".. Please, they're rightfully ours\". The wait for my food already ruined my night, then she had to add more bs..

Delicious food wasn't enough to satisfy the ruined night.

Go again? .. Maybe"}
{"text":"My close friend actually came across this place from another website, so it was necessary for us to try Que Supper Club.  In the heart of Corktown, Que has only been opened for approximately a month.  At the northeast corner of Queen and Parliment, Que, prounced Que since its on QUEEN is a breath of freshair to this neighborhood.  The ambiance, decor, long bar counters, and contemporary furniture was appealing.  

Tandoori Fusion Tacos: first off, the pita bread was nice and thick, hence it was able to hold all that delicious flavor together.  The carmelized stringed carrots, infused with the flavors of the tandoori chicken really brought this dish together.  Also the hint of creativity making stringed potato chips was a nice touch to the overall dish. 5/5

Eggplant Caprese: perfectly presented, the combination of cheese, tomato, and eggplant was the perfect marriage of flavors.  In addition, the arugula salad with the light dressing added freshness to this entree! 4.5/5

Pineapple Mojito! very creative, although I am not a mojito fan, it tasted yummy. Perfect balance of alcohol, and juice...nonetheless a delight 5/5

Lemon Ice: Again part two of my drinks lol..it was just as enjoyable as the previous drink..4,5/5

overall this place has a lot of potential, and in need of marketing itself well in order to bring in more clientele.  Nik, the owner, along with Tyson, the server were very polite, and accommodating! 

I wouldn't mind coming back here again... Good JOB QUE!!"}
{"text":"Que Supper Club is one of the newest spots on Queen East and takes a mish-mosh of Southern BBQ with Asian and Latin inspirations to a serious new level.

Complete with their own version of \"Redneck Sushi\", Fusion Tacos, and more, Que looked too interesting to pass up, so I decided to pop by here last week with a group of fellow foodies to check it out.

We came on a Tuesday and Que was pretty empty. There were a few other diners but we mostly had the place to ourselves. The décor is sleek and modern - and it really seems to set itself apart from many of the other establishments near Queen & Parliament.

While the service was extremely friendly, we did feel that our waitress could have been a bit more present (check on us more often, refill water more often, etc.) given that they were not busy and there were not too many other patrons in the restaurant.

We started off with a pitcher of pear sangria and it was light, refreshing, and fruity. A little light on the alcohol, but perfect for a warm summer evening.

Onto the good stuff: the FOOD! The menu has a lot of interesting variety, and different sizable plates. If you want to order an entrée for yourself you can do so, or if you want to order a few plates for sharing with others many of the items are easy to do that with. I sampled the following:

Kim Chi & Bulgogi Beef Tacos: OHMYGOD. These are done RIGHT. The flavours of the Kim Chi & Bugogi beef were fantastic, the taco shell was warm and fresh and perfect, and they came with a big ol side of their delicious signature fries (think shoestring fries, but thinner, crispier, and with some spice. Fantastic.)

Korean Short Ribs: A-OK. Not knock your socks off like the tacos, but still yummy.

Crispy Jerk Redneck Sushi: We couldn't come here and NOT get the redneck sushi. Think regular sushi, but warmer, and this version came with bacon, rice, coleslaw and plantain. Also on the A-Okay front. Their coleslaw is fantastic but the flavours I felt got muddled a bit. I think I'd like to try a couple other versions of the sushi to get a real feel for it.

Que Brisket with Garlic Mash: The garlic mash was fantastic. Like, lick your plate clean fantastic. It also came with some melt in your mouth carrots and broccoli. Brisket fell apart nicely, and had some good flavours going on.

Skewers: The skewers are cheap and great bar snacks. The shrimp was seasoned fantastically and I would eat TONS of those skewers. The apple pork was more dry and lacking on the flavour front - I'd stick with the shrimp going forward.

Overall, Que is really a gem of the area. There is so many things on the menu I want to try, so I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"What a stunning and chic addition to the neighbourhood!
Beautiful decor, great music, delicious food (spicy!) and impeccable service :)

My friend and I started off with a pitcher of the Pear Sangria - very refreshing! They have an interesting drinks menu, I really want to try them all :D There is one called Finding Nemo - I wonder how that would look/taste like - I will get it next time :D #lovenemo

Appetizer, we went with Korean Kimchi Tacos with bulgogi shaved beef. Presentation was amazing. Love the Que signature fries... kinda taste like spicy Hickory Sticks :P

For entree, we ordered the Durty South Pulled Pork (Mmm!) with garlic mashed potatoes, creamy coleslaw and crispy corn bread. The only thing that threw me off was the corn bread. I was expecting it to be the traditional kind - soft and sweet - but I couldn't really taste the corn. Overall this dish was very tasty, each item complemented each other... even the corn bread lol.

As for dessert, Que doesn't have a dessert menu (yet? I forgot.) But they did offer their signature dessert - Tres Leches! It was a slice of cake made with 3 different types of milk. In my head, I was like cow's milk, goat's milk....???! hahaha... they actually really meant - regular milk, condensed milk and whipped cream LMAO! It was a bit too sweet for me, but my friend devoured it in seconds... got the sweet tooth XD

Overall, it was a great experience! Definitely recommending this to all my friends! I'm going back this Saturday for a big birthday bash - Que is very accommodating, thank you so much :)

P.S. They have live music every Fridays and Saturdays at 10pm. Time to party it up :D!"}
{"text":"My Wife and I just went to Que for the first time... Simply Amazing!

Before I even discuss the food, I must mention how refreshing is it to go to a place that puts a true premium on their customers and more so the overall dining experience. We walked in and were greeted - we then were joined by the manager/owner who wanted our input and thoughts about the food and service. This was very refreshing to say the least. The place has style- class and very cool ambiance. They really did a nice job on the interior.

The service again was impeccable- They care, my feeling is that this is the way the place would be run even if they were a neighbourhood staple rather than a new establishment. The owner and his son go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. Our waitress was kind, attentive and the little things like water etc were always attended too. 

The food- Was delicious- Fresh and well presented. The pulled pork was amazing - The mashed potatoes were incredible- Both the wife and I finished everything. They also have a live DJ and dancing - haven't checked that out but we will. 

Overall what a great first experience- Highly recommend you check it out too. Thanks Guys for a great night. Cheers"}
