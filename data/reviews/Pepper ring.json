{"text":"Ive eaten here 3 times so far, all 3 consistent and delicious. I like their lunch specials, and the servers are really nice, very good at recommending things too. Definitely a good addition to the restaurant lineup in liberty."}
{"text":"Just dropped in to this new Liberty Village pan-Asian place tonight and was happily surprised. Best calamari I've had--crispy outside and perfectly soft inside--and I've tried it in many places (we'll have to see if they are consistent though). The chicken Pho was exactly what I needed (dealing with a sore throat/virus thing) and they were great about adding broccoli on request...and lots of it. The noodles were larger than the usual vermicelli noodles, but good, only weird thing was that they were all cut up into shorter noodles? No idea why. But really that was a small thing. The broth was excellent and the portion was amazing for 7.99. My partner had the black bean beef dish with steamed rice on the side. Quite decent though not spectacular. Also, they served Stassen green tea, which is a cut above the green tea usually served in Asian restaurants.   Pros: Great food and service. Very affordable. Large and interesting menu (Thai/Viet/Chinese). Friendly staff. Nice modern decor with high ceilings. Bathrooms were cute too. Offer take out.   Cons: Eating in an empty restaurant is weird, but I think that will change as more people discover them.The fact that they cut up the Pho noodles into smaller noodles was odd, but otherwise I thought everything was great. Also, it would be wonderful if they added some fruit shakes to the drinks menu. Right now it's just tea, juice and pop.   Overall, a great addition to Liberty Village (and close to our place). Looking forward to going back (when I'm not sick) to try the long list of appetizers."}
{"text":"I wish I could've had the same experience regarding the food as Shawn P. but alas, no such luck. We ordered the two person dinner special: spring rolls, shrimp rolls, general tao chicken, pad thai and 2 servings rice. Wow did everything sucks. The springs rolls were mushy and flavourless on the inside. The shrimp rolls were just rolled up spring roll wrappers, I don't think there was anything inside it. The general tao chicken was WEIRD, I've never had it like that. Hints of honey but mostly tasteless. The pad thai had hints of ketchup but most tasteless. Before tasting it, I was pleasantly surprised it was the chicken and shrimp pad thai.  The mini veggie springs rolls were similar to the regular spring rolls in that they were mushy and flavourless.  We ordered through just-eat indicating we were going to pick it up. Instead it got delivered. They didn't seem apologetic about the situation as I sent the driver away since my boyfriend was already at the store to pick it up.  I was excited to try such reasonably priced take out in our area, but won't be coming here again."}
