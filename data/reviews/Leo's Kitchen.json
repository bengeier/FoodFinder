{"text":"This little gem of a restaurant is a MUST if you're looking for something different or you're just plain craving good 'ol soul food!  My mom, sister, and I TOTALLY enjoyed the baked chicken and porkchops, tender and flavorful, along with mouth watering homestyle collard greens, mac-n-cheese, broccoli casserole, and sweet potatoes!  There are several other wonderful soul-side dishes to select from as well - very nice variety.  The meals were hot and DELICIOUS with fresh and unique flavors.  Our  lunches were under $6 apiece and an incredible value!  Leo's Kitchen will no doubt become one of the area's favorite restaurants for quality, service, variety, uniqueness, and the owners could NOT be more friendly and accommodating.  It's a pleasure to finally be able to write a 5-star review for an overall experience worthy of the rating. Bring your friends!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Ribs, fried porkchops, gizzards, beef stew, pinto beans, sweet yams, okra.  I have had a lot off the menu and haven't found anything that wasn't great, if not amazing.  Good people, always friendly, and the place is kept up well.  The prices are low too!

If you like soul food, don't skip Leo's!  A hidden gem in Waxhaw..."}
{"text":"Fried chicken was cooked to order and delicious! However I was not a fan of the side dishes I got (green beans and mac & cheese). Friend's mashed potatoes and broccoli casserole were good but nothing special. Will try some other options next time...a good soul food offering close to home."}
{"text":"Great Soul Food - Daily Specials that do run out fast.  Check them on their facebook page.  Very reasonably priced!

{"text":"We had take out for the first time and everything was great. The fried chicken was flavorful and juicy. My daughter loved the baked spaghetti special. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic home cooked food! I had the fried chicken and it was melt in your mouth yummy. The eat in section is a little disappointing, feels like you are eating in a cafeteria. But again, the food is great!"}
{"text":"An excellent soul food meal!! Really good cooking of all kinds of meats and veggies. But don't expect to stick to your diet. It's good ol' southern cooking."}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  We had been talking about trying it for several months and finally had the chance tonight.  Although it is currently only take out, they are expanding to have eat in!.  My entire family loved it, even the picky kids.   Meatloaf, collard greens and Mashed potatoes.  My husband love it so much he didn't save room for the banana pudding.  My older son loved the Fried chicken and said that the munchers and mashed potatoes were amazing.  I would agree that the Mac-n-cheese was VERY good.  Definitely home made.  The broccoli casserole tasted just like my mother in law makes.  Everything was fresh, and the chicken/fish were cooked when ordered.  This is a definite must try.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Soul food at its finest. Great variety of meat choices and your pick of 2 sides like pinto beans, sweet potatoes, collard greens, mac n cheese, slaw, broccoli casserole, and more. We stumbled across this place and most certainly will be back again."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best fried chicken I've ever had, along with the best coleslaw! The mashed potatoes and gravy were also delicious, and the homemade pound cake was to die for! I wasn't a fan of the mac and cheese, but everything else was delicious! Also, the staff are super sweet. I believe they're looking for a new location at the moment, which I hope they find soon. I will definitely be bringing my family here when they come to visit in October. :)"}
{"text":"County/Soul food. Mac and cheesy goodness. Food prepared to order, so you may have to wait. You order at the counter, pay, and food is brought to you. Cornbread was a miss, fried chicken crisp and homage goodness. 

Offer different meats and veggies daily. Have a med to a large plate. The sides are bigger in those plates, but you still get 2 sides. Vegetarian folks need not come here. A meat & potatoes paradise.

Different deserts also offered daily."}
