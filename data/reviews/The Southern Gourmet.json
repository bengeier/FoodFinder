{"text":"Very fresh food. I had the spinach summer salad with grilled chicken and it was great ... Will be back!"}
{"text":"I recently used The Southern Gourmet to cater dinner for 25 executives at our CEO's house. I must say that Randy was very accommodating to our needs (we had some last minute changes). On the day of the event, Crystal & her assistant showed up on time and served the managers their plates. The food was delicious and very flavorful. They even went around and picked up finished plates, provided real stemware which they cleaned after use. They made it super easy for me as the planner because they left the space in tip top shape; wiping down countertops, tables, etc. Overall, the food was FANTASTIC, but most importantly the service and professionalism was out of this world."}
{"text":"Southern Gourmet does it again !  You have to TRY the Tomato Pie - simply amazing!~  Combination of fresh chopped tomatoes, basil, olive oil, cheese/spices baked into an open faced pie shell.  It's wonderful!  Call the office - get your scrip and go get you ONE!!!  (Call ahead - rumor has it they can't keep the pies on the shelf and they do close over July 4th ). Two locations - Monroe Road and inside Black Lion in Pineville!  Thanks Randy and Crystal !!"}
{"text":"During planning our out of town wedding I researched various caters in the Charlotte area. I first contacted TSG in early 2013 for my October wedding, and spoke with one of the owners Crystal. She was friendly and to the point, and I decided to book with their catering business due to the great reviews and availability. Our meeting and tasting went well, and over the months they were relatively responsive to my requests. However, it seemed like after time, the responses were shorter and less thorough, to the point where sometimes I wouldn't get a response. I am very detail orientated and probably over-emailed on some subjects, but when you are planning your own wedding that does tend to happen...  The day of the wedding I was mostly busy getting ready, but as soon as the caters arrived I started receiving complains from my guests and wedding party about the attitude the caterers exhibited. I am not really sure where this is coming from, when they arrived there was even less work for them to do because I went ahead and had us set up all of the table arrangements... apparently there was a discrepancy about the placement of a table, where the coffee cups were, about a pregnant woman having some Hors d'Oeuvres before they were passed, about the home owner of the venue (my uncle) requesting a bottle of champagne for their table but being denied by  the bartenders..... ah, on and on and on. Cleanup was a huge rush, almost like they were rushing the guests to eat.   My biggest irritation was when I spoke with the rental company I used a few weeks after the wedding. There was 14 missing napkins and a ton of missing silverware, all of which I have to pay for. It's not so much the cost of it, while the caterers were responsible for the cleanup I realize some of the guests may have \"thrown\" their silverware in the trash on accident.... but without any information from me or my guests, the owner of the company asked who I had the wedding catered by, because he could tell that \"whoever it was, did not take care of my items\". He was referring to the dishes, the glasses, the silverware, etc. Hearing that from someone in the business, without any prompts from outside sources, was extremely discouraging.    On a positive note - the food was excellent. Perhaps if they just remind themselves why they are there at the event in the first place, that it's not just a chore or a J-O-B but an extremely essential part of a landmark for a couple, they can align their attitude with the quality of their food. If that were to happen, they would definitely deserve 5 stars."}
{"text":"I work near here and we go often for lunch.  The food is fantastic!  The owners are extremely nice and even know your name!  My favorite is the Southwest Chicken salad - especially the homemade dressing that comes with it, but everything looks fantastic.  They have also catered some lunch meetings for us and we have gotten nothing but compliments from everyone eating.  I HIGHLY recommend the Southern Gourmet!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was our first \"office visit\" here and it was really good! The people behind the counter (I'm assuming are the owners) are extremely helpful and are really nice!   I had the Steak Wrap that was with Roasted Peppers, Onions in a Spinach Wrap- Very good and light it was served with a side salad I had a Red Vinaigrette with it.   This is really close to our office so I anticipate going here more in the future! I look forward to trying more of they're menu"}
{"text":"SOGO catered the wedding rehearsal dinner for our son's wedding last summer.  Not only did they serve up a great selection of southern favorites, but the table decor and presentation of the food made it even more of a high class afare."}
{"text":"While visiting the Charlotte area, my new friend decided I had to try this spot near her job. I can say there is only one other place(ROXIE'S SF)that gets high marks for sandwiches. Well now, I HAVE A NEW ONE! My friend recommended the Moroccan Grilled Chicken Panini. It came on a lightly toasted ciabatta, grilled sweet onions & the chicken was moist & full of flavour! I had a pasta & black bean salad on the side. It was fresh & appetizing. The portion was the perfect size. I also had to have a slice of the blueberry/lemon cake w/ butter cream frosting. IT WAS DREAMY!!! Next time, I will be grabbing some of the banana pudding I saw!"}
{"text":"My niece had her wedding at our home and catered by Southern Gourmet...so I will submit my review based on a two categories:  food and service.  The food was very good.  We had pork Marsala and Tuscan chicken for entrees.  Both were quite delicious and overall, the food was tasty and cooked well.  The service, on the other hand, was sorely lacking.  I realize that a caterer is there to do a job, but the abrupt attitude and overall rush to get plates off the table had me hovering over my dinner because I was afraid someone would take my plate if I didn't guard it!  I (we) were really put off by the (dare I say bitchiness?) sorry attitude.  It was supposed to be a fun event, not a race to get food served and removed!  And, in fact, we set up all the tables, not the caterer as arranged, so you would think they would have been appreciative that they didn't have to take the time to do it.    Overall, I think I would probably look elsewhere for a future event.  I don't need attitude in my home from someone I'm paying for \"service\"."}
{"text":"I was married at the Reid House  in Matthews in October. I met with Crystal  of Southern Gourmet,  one of the owners, for catering services. I found her to be very flexible  meeting with me more than once to ensure I was happy with my choices. They were at the venue on time, delivered delicious food, and were very professional and courteous. I also met with Heather her baker, about my cake. I was extremely pleased with the cake. It was simply beautiful and got rave reviews from my guest on how wonderful it was.  I would highly recommend Southern Gourmet not only for the catering but also for wedding cake. You will not be disappointed. S. Klein"}
{"text":"The panini wrap I got was very bland.  My friend got a \"skinny\" sandwich and the bread was so thin it started falling apart after two bites.  We put in our orders with one person in line between us but it took a full fifteen minutes longer for hers to come out.  I also ordered a coffee and never got it!  We won't be back."}
{"text":"This is one of the very few places in the area who serve fresh food - as opposed to frozen or processed - the reason why I'm giving it 3 stars   The food is pretty good, but nothing exceptional. Portions are acceptable but not generous, pricing leans to the gourmet side of the equation more than the flavors do. The location is cute and eclectic.   I seldom complain about service, which I'd describe here as Southern combination of polite words with unpleasantly brisk and rude manners at the same time. I don't want to rehash but I've eaten here a few times and never left with a good feeling, I doubt that I'll be back."}
{"text":"Our office just moved and was looking for a good place for my lunch meetings. This is the best on the area. We are surrounded by fast food and it's nice to have a respectable and delicious place to take our clients. And VERY personal service"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today.  Met the owner, who I had a short but delightful conversation with.   I tried the strawberry basil cheesecake, which I am happy to report was VERY GOOD!  Also picked up some homemade oat cranberry squares, which where moist and obscenely delicious.  The place has that authentic southern charm about it. Wonderful for finding a quiet table in the corner, sipping on some peach tea, and reflecting on how good life is :)"}
{"text":"Not very kid friendly. No high chairs. Other oddities include the grilled cheese only came out halfway - where's the other half? No coke only Coke Zero. They want you to order up front but the menu is large - so it's a weird in between sit down and fast casual.  With some very basic improvements this place would be great."}
{"text":"Crystal catered our rehearsal dinner and wedding, and we couldn't be happier! The food was delicious, the wait staff were courteous and so nice and went out of their way to make our event special and beautiful. Crystal was wonderful to work with. Highly recommend The Southern Gourmet!!!"}
{"text":"Super cute and drool worthy desserts!  I had the classic chopped salad for lunch, which actually was not very chopped up, but still very hearty, with ham and turkey included for extra protein.  The little cafe has limited seating, but we had a large group, and they accommodated us easily.  Giant menu of options from sandwiches and salads, to hot food options."}
{"text":"Nice little cafe-deli-bakery. Although it's part of my neighborhood, it's my first time here. Nice menu selection, yummy deserts, friendly staff. Not a place for kids, or should I say not for my hyperactive kids. In order to keep them busy, the wait staff provided crayons and paper...that was a very nice gesture :) I ordered grilled cheese for my boys, croissants, and that Mac and Cheese cupcake was a very creative idea! My sandwich was delicious Asiago-Parmesan Fish Filet. I'll be back to this place, but without the kids :)"}
{"text":"Wow, for the longest time I did not know this was right around the corner from where I work! Now I know, and now I plan to visit more often. The name says it all about the type of food they serve here, southern gourmet. I had the Tuscan Chicken with green beans and cornbread. The flavors were right on, portion size was good, the owners and staff are very friendly. I can't speak for their catering, but a sit down lunch is very nice here. They also do cakes, the hummingbird cake is so so yummy! It is so moist and rich, and the frosting is just right. I like this a lunch place and will continue to visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I held our wedding reception at Southern Gourmet's newly-opened venue, Southern Garden Events (right next to the Southern Gourmet cafe). The company both catered and hosted our event.  Crystal, who co-owns the cafe and catering business and manages events at the Southern Garden Events, was professional and aimed to please. She followed our wishes concerning every detail for table arrangements, decorations, and activities for our event!   Heather, the company baker, did a fantastic job on our cake. We had a small GF cake and 50 cupcakes in two flavors. They all were moist and delicious!  I did not catch the name of the chef, but she did a phenomenal job on the food. She prepared chicken with carmelized vidalia onions, ham with berry couli, roasted potatoes, and grilled veggies. The food was superb. As my sister, the maid of honor, said of the chicken, \"This chicken makes me sad that I've eaten any other food in my entire life.\"  The dinner was served plated, and the women who waited on us were attentive and helpful.  The venue is unique and beautiful with twinkling fairy lights and charming garden-themed decor. Many of our guests raved about the atmosphere and decor!  Thank you, Southern Gourmet. You were all wonderful."}
{"text":"Found SOGO because of YELP reviews and was not disappointed.  The Cubano sandwich, Cobb salad, Chicken Caprese sandwich, and coleslaw with crasins were all tasty and well prepared.  We took home a selection of desserts that look tasty"}
{"text":"Small little cafe with great food! Try the corn Braff pudding if it's available that day. Amazing!"}
{"text":"I work up the hill from this place. It's a special treat for lunch when there is an occasion to celebrate, or a client or coworker to treat.  Service is fast, they remember customers' names, and it's a laid back place. One of my coworkers said the women's rest room is a designer showplace. So ladies (and gents), wash your hands.   For about $11 a head including tip, you get wonderful food. I've never been disappointed here. Today, I had a roast pork tenderloin in a dreamy mushroom sauce, some incredible collard greens, and an orzo/black-eyed pea salad concoction that was outstanding. I topped it off with Southern cornbread and really good coffee, and was ready to go back to work, staring at my MacBook Pro as it backed up all my files prior to a long trip.  Snnnzzzzzz...  Well, okay, it WAS a heavy meal, but not *that* heavy. I never quite fell asleep. And I finished every morsel.  This place is on the same side of the road as McAlpine Park, on the other side of the railroad bridge. They also do catering, and lately, they've been selling gourmet olive oils. Give them a try. They may be in a strip mall (Greylyn Park?), but they rock!"}
{"text":"Small seating, but thye are mainly a catering outfit. I was lucky enough to attend one of their catering events and it was southern BBQ/BBQ chicken was delicious! The sweet tea is okay.  Since I'm gluten-free I couldn't eat the pasta salad, banana pudding or the brandy soaked bundt cake but, they were definately favorites at my table.  If you have an event check them out, I grabbed there catering menu and the prices were right in line with what you would expect to spend."}
{"text":"Several weeks back, my husband and I had an out of town guest.  Our favorite place to get an order to go is Southern Gourmet.  We were able to dine in private at our home and visit with our guest without having to cook.  The buffalo burger, salad with a fabulous vidalia onion dressing, and other fare were consumed with no crumbs left on the plate. Very fresh!  The mac and cheese cupcake was just like my mama used to make.  Portion sizes were just right!  I only wish I could go there more often.  Just thinking about it makes me hungry!"}
{"text":"My company placed an order.. My favorites were the rolls, green beans, mashed potatoes, corn casserole and mac n cheese. So so items were the cornbread stuffing and sweet potato mash (although many of my co-workers were not fans) and pumpkin cheesecake. A lot of people ate the ham, but i didn't hear praises or negative feedback."}
