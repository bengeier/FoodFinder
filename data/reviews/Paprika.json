{"text":"use to be one of the best indians in airdrie. well not now, for the last year the food has went right down hill, it always seems to made in a rush, all the sauces seem to taste the same, an dont get me started on the delivery service, if it makes it to you in under an hour its still cold. worst meal i have ever had.
if your thinking about a takeaway think on, GO ELSE WHERE"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and I mean really good this time, every trip to the Airdrie I order from Paprika. Can't wait till next time."}
{"text":"My parents live in Airdrie, Glasgow and this wee shop is very close to their home! Sometimes we order pizza or other kinds of food and always been happy with the food. Their delivery is fast and food is mostly fresh so would recommend it!"}
