{"text":"Myself and my best friend were on our way to Cactus Club for a quick easy meal when we took a wrong turn and ended up at Dobson's. WOW. What an incredibly pleasant surprise. The service was spectacular, the food knocked both out socks off, and the prices were fantastic. She had the curry bowl, I had Tuna tacos and the tuna appetizer. All three were exceptional. Then, due to the fact that our meals were amazing, we ordered dessert. She the miniature pecan tart, I the key lime cheesecake. Both of which we equally enjoyed. The server explained the wine we ordered was a feature brought in by wine reps to decide whether to put on the menu, and it also was delish. I and her are both thrilled with our experience, from the smile at the door, to the wine, to the food, to the gentleman playing his guitar and singing into the microphone, to the final bill. We have thus decided this is our new favorite place and will be back quite regularly."}
{"text":"Dobson's was a pleasant surprise.  From the outside, you might think it is something else. We decided to check it out  as a nearby place was busy.  I know a few friends of mine had tried it out although they had never told me what they thought of it.  Right away we were impressed with how stylish yet casual it was inside. Simple, modern decor and a range of seating options. We were quickly greeted by both the nearby bartender and a server. Nice. They asked what type of table we'd prefer (which is always nice).  After a couple of minutes we were asked for our drink orders and they came back with the drinks quickly. Their menu has a decent selection of options - enough that there is something for everyone but not too much that they over complicate things.  We ordered the olive oil poached tuna to start...really tasty and a nice portion for two to share. While we were waiting for that to arrive the server dropped of an amuse bouche which was a nice touch. It was really good.  I then had the smokestack burger ( a burger with bacon and BBQ short rib) and the man had the steak frites. The burger was huge. The presentation was awesome, on a cutting board with a baggy of homemade fries with salt and pepper. It tasted great although there was no way I could finish it. The man said his steak was delicious and was still talking about it the next day.  We opted to skip dessert as we were full. The bill came with two salted chocolate covered pretzel sticks. Again, another nice tough and really tasty.  Service was friendly with just the right amount of attention given. We were also impressed with the prices of the entrees especially given the attention to taste, local suppliers and detail. It would be a great place to go with a group of friends, or on a date.  Well done Dobson's. You'll be seeing a lot more of us."}
{"text":"We moved over the summer & were suddenly without a favourite local. After trying a few different places, Dobson's quickly became our number one choice.  They have done well in their transition from a sports bar to a gastro-pub. (No worries! There are still a few screens in place to catch the latest scores.)  As a whole, the staff is great! Some are downright friendly (while a few are a little more distant, but effective & quick.) They are a big part of why we keep coming back.  There have been times when we have been in a rush & other times where we have wanted to sit around and linger. Neither is ever a problem. They won't ever rush you out the door - even if they are busy.  Lots of local choices! From tap (Village Brewery - SCORE!) to foods sourced from Kingsland Market across the street. Being someone that really values fresh & local, this is a huge plus to me.  While not everything I have had has been a favourite, their food is consistently good. Portions are generous. Food is fresh. Things are cooked properly - nothing over or under.  Miss: We found the charcuterie board to be very disappointing. It lacked substance, variety & volume. VERY overpriced for what was brought to our table. Shame as this is one of our most ordered items at other restaurants.  Don't miss out: Get the chipwiches! One of the best dessert values in Calgary."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it opened, as we know most of the staff and managers. They have changed the menu numerous times since the start, which I'm ok with now, as they cater to GF.   I had the gluten free grilled ham and cheese sandwich, which was made with proscuttio and a couple types of cheese, and a side salad. It was pretty good, the gluten free bread they used though, I found pretty sweet, which is common with gf bread. Still yummy and the fact I was able to eat a gf grilled cheese I was pretty pumped about it.   My friend had the Niqouse (spelling?) salad, she said it was ok, too much dressing though and our server didn't seem to care when she commented on it. Which was disappointing.   My hubs had the double stacked burger, which is a burger topped with pulled pork and grilled onions. He said it delicious, huge burger though.   They have Bards, which is the best gluten free beer, so I was happy with that. Our bill was pretty decent and we get a discount. So another point for me.  If you are in the area, definitely pop in for a bite."}
{"text":"Dobson's is an interesting place. The Atmosphere is great; nice lighting and elegant booths and bar area. You can set own channel on tv's; just ask. I've got them to turn from sports to something I like: CNN, Animal Planet, Discovery, or The Frame HD.   Food good - locally sourced but nothing too fancy - it is just simple pub food that is cooked well, with a few twists. The chicken parmesan sandwich is one of my favorites (always fresh, melts in your mouth), the charcuterie is also great; not the finest cheeses and meat but a huge portion that you could not make at home for the same $10; compared to spending $30-$40 for the same thing at The District. I also liked their quesadilla, and salads.  Soup is yummy, and you have to try the yam fries. Best yam fries in the city; homemade and cooked in oil twice to be the right crispness and softness inside. Also spiced nicely and served with a homemade dip.  For dessert avoid the mini donuts; I sent them back it was that bad. The ice cream sandwich cookies are amazing; simple but delicious. I've heard good things about the bread pudding thing too.  The service is has improved a lot. First night I went there in Feb 2012 I was horrified; the waitress took 32 min for drink order of 4 of their signature cocktail. Kept trying to promote desperadoes the whole damn night too; 4 staff members approached us trying to get us to go clubing with their free vip promo. We were not interested or impressed. Every over time I have been there though the service has been great, especially on a slow night.   Last is the drinks; they are great. This is one of the few bars that when you order a burnt martini they do it right. Try their \"Not your average Joe\" too for an awesome cocktail. It has good quality gin, cucumber, pepper, lime, and 7-up. Sounds strange but it is yummy! They can make any drink you want even if it is not on the menu; they have trained bartenders. Also the glassware is nice; this place has class and they really could charge more; i'd pay it."}
{"text":"I had never heard of Dobson's before going there after work with a few colleagues. I was presently surprised by the bar/restaurant; it's a pretty relaxed place, but by no means a dive bar. The decor is modern, and table sizes vary so you're good with a big group, or just a friend or two.  It's a well stocked bar, and the servers were on-the-ball. The food, I'm happy to report, was very good - think less a pretentious version of Earls food.   If you happen to be looking for a place on Macleod Trail, give Dobson's a try."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm totally biased here, just warning.  I've been to Dobson's only once, today, like half an hour ago, and I fell in love.  I don't know how, but they do literally everything right.  Drinks menu? Nice and very well selected. Food quality? Awesome. Portion size? Right on the buck. Price? Not that cheap, but worth every penny. Neither too expensive or something - right money for a right thing.  For gosh sake, even the parking spots were wide and comfy, exactly what you need to feel comfortable when driving away after a couple of beers!  I liked the waiters service. Blinding fast, cooperative, helpful, professional. Close enough to make you feel welcome, distanced enough not to bother without need.  I liked the food - and the fact that I got it with apologies for even a tiny insignificant wait, and a fair explanation why.  I liked the ambient, the decor, the overall feeling of being in the right place in the right time! I enjoyed being there. Whatever you've written on those chalkboards, guys, you did that right.  No, they don't pay me for all this praise. And I am honestly happy to give a five star review to someone who totally deserves it, and did not do anything special to earn it. They've treated me as good as anyone else, and that's a very comfortable feeling.  Awesome work, Dobson's people - thank you! I will surely be back. Not just one of those days tomorrow - I feel like I've found the right place to get rid of all that daily accumulated pain and brain burn. You made me feel good. Thanks again!"}
