I hope this helps.

My honest review, everyone has different pallets, but there is no way this place should call themselves authentic!
Everything is out of a box and/or frozen, dethawed and placed in a mircrowave.
I grew up eating this food, my family is from Istanbul and this is a far cry from decent, it's barley eatable.
Doner is suppose to be cut thin, full of flavour and specific spices.
This was frozen, hard to chew and cuts of fat all over the place.
The owner should more honest with themselves, you would not eat this food at home, so why serve this uneatable food to paying customers.
Save yourself some money, go somewhere else.

{"text":"Great, great food with super friendly service! Delicious and free red pepper spread, huge portion of juicy doner shwarma meat, and tasty bulgur pilaf for around $15. The salad was a little boring but the rest of the plate more than made up for it. Will certainly come again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely NOT closed.  Was there Friday October. 30, 2015 and ordered the lamb kebobs and chicken shawarma dinners.  The lamb was excellent, moist, juicy, and very tasty. The chicken was also very good and was fresh, not dry as other places as the chef prepared it just as got there.  the 3 staff were very nice, with offered hot tea and complimentary balava while i waited.  They were not busy at all since i think people are under the impression they're closed. They're Open and well worth the visit. I personally hope they will be opened for some time to come."}
{"text":"This is a good place particularly for lunch. They feature a steam table with a limited but tasty offering. I had the stuffed red pepper, kefta, rice and bulgur, potatoes and a fried eggplant based dish. Everything was tasty, and fresh. The price for the all-you-can-eat lunch is $ 6.99 with turkish coffee at $ 3.00. The coffee was not ground fine enough and did not settle.....it probably took away a star....but overall a nice place for a quick meal."}
{"text":"We went to Sofia Istanbul Grill last night.
Ordered an entr√©e of tenderloin kebab; owner came out and apologised that they didn't have tenderloin but suggested that I have a veal kebab, with the proviso that I didn't have to pay for it if I was dissatisfied. It was excellent. My Wife ordered lentil soup and chicken kebab which were both very good. Both entrees came with a good quality house salad with lots of peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes and very generous portions of fries and roast potatoes.
Only complaint I had was that service was slow. This place needs more servers on a Saturday night.
Will be back !"}
