{"text":"This place is great, lots of well kept equipment I needed was available and prices are reasonable. Jessica was very good about answering my questions."}
{"text":"I'm glad i found this business on Offer Up.  Came down and got the grill and burnertop i needed combined into one piece.  Very nice. The staff is super friendly and very accommodating, Jessica and Missy helped me on different days.  When it comes to getting info on the product, they had all the answers pretty quickly.  Also, they have a very talented maintenance man who double checks everything before and after it sells. Also, if it doesn't get set up right, they offer to send the guy to make sure everything is right. My unit plugged right into the gas and had zero problems. I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for quality used equipment. I will be back to get a refrigerator. Thx EEL."}
{"text":"I am so glad we found EEL! We needed a to of martini glasses and I was able to walk in locate them easily with the help of the amazing staff at EEL. I will be back again!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this place for a quick look over. Little did I know how huge this place was! We spent hours looking at all the stuff they had, no matter what you need, they have it. Had two nice girls helping us the whole time,  Adriana and Mitzi. They helped us with our purchase, and offered plenty of answers to all our questions. We will be coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"This is THE place to go if you need anything for your business under one roof! The staff is great, Mariah helped me out finding EVERYTHING, I'll be back 100%  Thanks Mariah!"}
{"text":"These guys are great. I have been in business for almost three years and bought almost every major Kitchen Appliance and Small Wear from them. My chef and business partner has had such a great relationship with Amando and his family. Its a family ran business and they warranty a lot of their stuff. We are opening our first restaurant (We have owned food trucks and catering company) and been able to outfit the entire place with EEL! Great people and great business."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Mariah was super helpful and they had a ton of equipment.. My new place for plates for sure."}
{"text":"If you are looking for used equipment this is the place !!! Best customer service and best prices in town !! Don't even look further just go straight to economic equipment locator !!!"}
{"text":"The best place in town to find used smallwares and kitchen equipment!!! And bottled water while you shop."}
{"text":"The staff and owners of EEL could not have been more helpful, accommodating and generous. We are a non-profit that is renovating a soup kitchen on the Mexican border. Not only was EEL helpful in selecting the right equipment, they were extremely generous in donating resources and supplies to help us provide a working kitchen for  those serving the poor. Great company that gives back!"}
{"text":"Customer service was great!  Jessica was attentive both over the phone and in person.  Luckily, they had what I needed in stock, willing to worked with me on price, and had several different brands/options for me to choose from.  I own 3 restaurants, and am constantly in need of equipment.  I will definitely be back, either to buy or to possibly sell my commercial kitchen/restaurant equipment. Thanks again Jessica! -Schuyler"}
