{"text":"I had to give 1 star because 0 was not an option. The service was terrible. Longest wait time I have had in years for drinks. The two drinks I had tasted like soda. I'm not sure there was alcohol in them at all. We had the nacho's for an app and decided not to stay for a meal. The cheese was not melted, the chips were stale and the sauce was thick and really sweet. Overall this was the worst place I have been in a long time. I had high hopes too because of all the tv' sand decent music."}
{"text":"Just had brunch here, the service was rushed and the food was medicre at best.  I hadn't even finished my coffee yet nor was I ready to pay and the server was shoving the card machine in my face.  Felt like was being kicked out.  Poor environment, bad food and if you don't order more, they'll rush you to kick you out.  It should be noted that the restaurant wasn't even a quarter full.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"I got fed up with the \"Cage aux Sports\" and wanted to try a different place... We went there on one of the last Habs game of the season... A lot of screen (even our private TV in our booth :-) and the food was great.  I had the club sandwich and it's made with fresh ingredients at a very decent price.  I can't wait to go back in the playoff, the atmosphere will be amazing. 

Don't let yourself fooled by the location of this place (industrial park), it seems to always be packed."}
{"text":"En veux-tu de la télé? Il y en a...! Sérieux c'est super, pichet pas cher..Mais le fait que ça soit éloigné et dans un quartier industriel, attendez-vous à voir une clientèle de monsieurs moustachus qui sortent de la shop..."}
{"text":"Malheureusement, leur politique d'entreprise laisse à désirer. Nous étions dix à manger et boire de la bière et quand notre amie est arrivée plus tard en soirée et qu'elle a demander un verre d'eau, le serveur et également de gérant d'établissement ont refusé de lui donner de l'eau. Ils avaient comme raisonnement que le client doit prendre soit de l'alcool ou bien manger pour obtenir un verre d'eau. Horrible gérance et ce n'est pas une place recommandée pour ceux et celles qui désirent être conducteur désigné. Probablement qu'ils devraient revoir les valeurs humaines."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre and the beer selection is nothing special, but in terms of watching the game or fight, it does the job. 

There's no place you can sit without a Piaget view of a tv.  Also, since they line up so many tvs, they set it up so they show two different games.  Great so you can still watch NFL when the habs are playing. They're also usually open to changing channels if you ask nicely."}
{"text":"the food is mediocre at best but the service isn't Dishes take forever to be served it's not even like it's a packed house.

I asked one waitress to change the channel on our tv in the booth and they failed to do so, i asked 3 other people and none of them could have changed the channel it seems.... what a horrific experience, stick to any other location but this one ....DO NOT COME HERE."}
{"text":"Dropped by here to watch the Habs lose a game in spectacular fashion. What I find about this place is its odd location completely placed in the industrial section of Vimont.

Went in with a buddy expecting a dive with hopefully better service than a place such as Le Cage des Sports and I got far more than expected. What received me is firstly a young energetic polity little lady in a micro skirt more than willing to seat me at some great booths.

What really caught my attention? The 80+ screens all over the place. Mind you some of these were kinda overkill and the quality of them weren't the best I've seen but it was an impressive display.

The service in general was exceptional for this type of place with this type of volume of clients. We were greeted by another charming little lady and beers were ordered, we got them mere minutes later. I felt like a big burger. Our food order was then taken and received WITHIN 15 MINUTES.

Are you reading this Cage of Sports? A burger shouldn't take over an hour to provide to your clients! On top of it all, it was delicious with a fantastic moist bun that in general hit the spot.

The rest of the night things well well with refills and I enjoyed watching the Habs lose once again.

The price tag is decent as well.

My only complaint about this place is the parking, their lot is far too small and in winter it can be a bit of a FUBAR.

All in all, will visit again."}
{"text":"This is hands-down my favorite place to watch UFC for 3 key reasons:

TVs - The place is plastered wall-to-wall with Sharp Quattrons showing one or multiple events. I'm not exaggerating when you can go to the bathroom, do your thing, and sit back down without ever having to take your eyes off the action.

Drink - If you're drooling after seeing the cornucopia of TVs, you will be when you realize that some tables are fitted with their own taps. Yes, you can sit and pour your own beers to your heart's content. I heard through the grapevine that the owner has a deal with Molson, which is why his beer is priced so much more aggressively. The food isn't gourmet, but I wasn't expecting it to be so. It was, however,  tasty and satisfying. I recommend burger, fries but not wings.

Service - There's plenty of staff to ensure that everyone receives prompt service. From my experience, they're always courteous.

Overall, if your looking for a good place for a burger, beer and sporting event, this is your mecca."}
