{"text":"Food was decent. But damn they have rude employees! My husband asked for the burrito to be cut in half and the man working sad \" no, I would rather not\" them turned to his coworker and bragged about it!  We won't be returning"}
{"text":"This is the little shack in schenley plaza that used to house Conflict Kitchen. Although I was super sad about their closing, I have no complaints about this new place! New Mexico themed. As a group of friends, we ended up ordering just about one of everything on the menu. Everyone liked their food! I was expecting just a single tamale or enchilada, etc but they also came with rice and beans so it was more food than we expected, considering we just wanted a little snack.   The dessert was like something brought down to me from heaven. Lavender-infused panna cotta with blackberries and a piñon (pine nut) brittle. OMGGG. I will be going back again and again just to get that! It paired perfectly with the piñon coffee, which is just regular coffee roasted with pine nuts so it has a smooth, nutty taste.   The worker happily described some of the different menu items to us and even checked on us after words to see if we liked it. Really sweet of him!"}
{"text":"One of the more economical food choices in the area. Their $5 breakfast burrito (available all day) is a substantial amount of food for the price. And tasty! All menu items are gluten free. The coffee is outstanding as well."}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican food, served up quickly. When I'm in a hurry to eat, it's great to have an option that features quality food.  The prices are very reasonable, a bit lower than Conflict Kitchen.  The Schenley Plaza is always a great place to relax and hang out."}
{"text":"I like how they have changed up the menu. Been here several times now. When Mesa opened, the food was about 3 stars and could be bland at times.  Really happy with how they have continued to tinker with and update the menu - for the better! Now the food is in the 4-5 star range and of similar quality to Conflict Kitchen which was formerly in this spot.  The breakfast burritos (served all day) are amazing. Particularly when they have chorizo on the menu. The chopped salad and carne enchiladas are also a good choice.   Also recommend the Mexican coffee / hot cocoa when they have it to spice up the cold day as well."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. I was really excited to try this place.   The enchiladas were super small, and bland. Yes, you can add hot sauce but shouldn't there still be flavor? It literally looks like it came out of a microwaveable meal. I feel bad giving it a review like this but this is my honest opinion. Maybe after some time they'll improve the food and this was just because they're getting use to things but for the quality of food and having to pay ~$8-9 for two small enchiladas with a small portion of rice and beans, this is not worth it.   The rice looks like it would be seasoned but it was extremely bland. Not enough additional hot sauce can hide this.   I've shown this picture to several people who all agree that it looks like it could be a frozen meal."}
{"text":"Stopped by here this morning for a breakfast burrito that my friends always seem to get since it's conveniently right next to Hillman library.  $5 for a huge burrito filled with a ton of stuff!! I thought it would come with some sort of meat in it but I didn't specify when I ordered so I ended up not getting any. But apparently you can get like chorizo or bacon in it for no extra added cost! I don't know everything that was in mine but there were onions, peppers, egg, potatoes and cheese all in a grilled tortilla and it's so delicious! I think this is a pretty good deal for the portion size and it's convenient location. The other food I've had here was good, but this breakfast burrito is great! I'd definitely recommend it."}
