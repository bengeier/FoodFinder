{"text":"I went out with a couple of work buddies where my friend's father happened to be playing with the band performing that night. 
The tables were very small and the place was packed but I was delightedly surprised by the great ambiance where everyone talked to each other with a jolly approach and to find delicious food at this old fashion bar seemingly a bit sketchy at first. I enjoyed a Dominion burger, one of us took the Chicken supreme which looked very good, some of us shared the truffled fries and another one had the $9.00 poutine which is definitely over priced.
It's a laid-back joint to go kick back with pals and have a few beers while doing your thing on the dance floor when a good music band is getting the crowd going."}
{"text":"Service: hit-and-miss. one time i sat on the patio during a busy period, it took the server a while to notice me and get me a menu. another time, it was slow, and i went out to the patio and waited and waited and waited... the two servers were chatting inside and i had to go in to order my beer at the bar. other times, the service has been very attentive.

Food: regular pub stuff, nothing special. 

Beer selection: pretty good. lots of local/craft beer. 

Atmosphere: patio is nice. inside is divey.

Overall, I'd probably not make a point of visiting if it wasn't so close to home."}
{"text":"hot jazz. nice beers + cider on tap. nice grub. 

BUT what is up with the super sketchy people walking through the bar glaring at people as they make their way to the pool area? it's disconcerting to say the least, and totally detracts from such a cool little spot. both times i've been there i've experienced this phenomenon. bah humbug."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I'd never been til the other day, I was meeting friends there, but went in early cause I was already in the area. I sat at the bar by myself and drank pumpkin ale at $7 a pint. Their beer options were extensive, on tap and off. There weren't any creeps there, and I seem to be a creep magnet, so I was happy with that. I did however, make a friend, Herman at 72 years old and from Holland. That was pretty funny. Anyway, there were ukelele classes going on in the back and afterward the place was FILLED with people and some of them performed. It was all older people, and very enjoyable. It was nice that there were more than one bartender, so you could get your drinks in a timely manner since it was so busy. There are a couple different rooms with pool tables, so it was nice and roomy and if you wanted to move (especially away from Herman) you had somewhere to go. The patio was also of decent size, we were the only ones that seemed to be using it really, and it was closed off to the rest of the world by a super tall wooden fence. Which was different. But it gave you privacy from the street if you really wanted it.

I'd definitely go here again. Not the cheapest place ever, but it's definitely classy and the prices match the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We've been frequenting the Dominion on Queen for well over a decade and never miss a uke night so if you go for the live shows and beer, you'll have a great evening out. Just eat before you go, the food is absolute shite."}
{"text":"I just moved in up the street, so I decided to visit this place with my husband for supper one evening while we were in the midst of moving in.  The beer was apparently \"on sale\", an eclectic regional brew for $2.50 a pint and it was really good.  The service was wonderful, very attentive (mind you, it was very dead when we got there, I almost didn't think they were open!).  The food leaves much to be desired.  The menu is a mixed bag of fusion and staple items, only 3 or 4 appetizers, one salad, and another 3 or 4 entrees, with a special or two each night.  VERY very limited choice.  I had the catfish sticks, YUMMY, eat them hot, super good, the sauce that came with them was excellent as well.  The paprika barbecue chicken that came after was awful.  Tasted like they took a normal bottle of Kraft BBQ sauce, added a bunch of stale paprika and then baked the chicken.  Not good.  So when your food menu is SO limited and the items you have aren't good, why would I come back?  Disappointing since they're so close and their music scene is good.  I would only go back for the beer and fishsticks."}
{"text":"Classic old bar that has hosted the Corktown Ukulele Jam every Wednesday night for the last 3 1/2 years. Good food, and excellent fries, both sweet potato and regular."}
{"text":"- pretty standard pub. nothing really special to write home about EXCEPT....
- but what gives it 4 stars is the weekly corktown uke jam on wednesday nights
- held in the backroom from 8 to 9pm, youll get to know that there are tons (there were over 100) of peeps in the GTA who are ukulele players!!"}
{"text":"6 months ago I would have agreed with the reviews of Dominion Pub, but since then they've hired a new chef who has run it into the ground. The menu used to have so many great pub classics and variety, but is now half a page of miscellaneous grub. The final straw for me was when I ordered a panini and wanted to replace the salad with fries but it was refused by the chef. It's a pub! Not the 4 seasons, Jackass."}
{"text":"This place was a strange mix of awkward. 
Went in one afternoon for a quick bite and drink with a friend. I'm sure the space would be less noticeable in the dark if there were more people there. But in the light of day, with only a handful of other patrons, the hicklety-picklety decor was off putting. It kind of felt like a mix of church pews or out-dated old train station. 
Decor aside, I was also disappointed by the menu. I wasn't expecting much, and that's what i got. There wasn't much choice, so I just got the sweet potato fries. A bit strange that they come served with sour cream, but i like sour cream so I dealt with it. But the fries weren't very hot or crispy at all. Kind soggy and blah. 
The only redeeming quality was the very friendly and attentive bartender. Since it was the afternoon, he was also waiting the few tables in there. 
I'll give this place another chance and maybe come again for an evening/night of live music. But not again for an afternoon of awkward food."}
{"text":"I enjoyed very much coming here for Sunday brunch because they had Rockabilly Sunday brunch where a live band plays old school tunes.  The space is perfect for this kind of music and it does not hurt the ear to listen to the band while you eat.  I also admire that they use ingredients from local vendors such as Rowe farms and St. John's bread.  The vibe is definitely casual with old posters and nice photographs of other performers on the walls.  The furnishings are a bit worn-out as what you would expect for a venue that has survived many years of delivering great performances.  The music is definitely the priority in this place, then the vast and interesting beer selection.  The food was good enough.  I had the Eggs Benny, which was a little dry but the eggs, which were organic, the muffin from St. John's and ham from Rowe were delicious.  I would love to come here again on a sunny afternoon and enjoy the wonderful music while I eat."}
{"text":"Such a laid back place where the  manager  goes the extra mile.. Went during the jazz festival.."}
{"text":"Great patio- terrible dried up wings- catfish bucket was terrible as well- you can't mask frozen fish doesn't matter how much mayo you use!
Service super friendly and beers great, but I won't go back as nothing was appetizing."}
{"text":"Evelyn W. is right, the outside of this building is pretty stunning. You'll also hear many a stunning sound coming from the inside of it. The Dominion is well known for its Bluesy Brunches on Sunday with live music. You can often hear live jazz a flowing from the place during the week as well.

They wouldn't have the best food in the world but they have a rocking patio, the staff are great and they are fantastic for for a beer and some live tunes every so often."}
{"text":"So cute and cozy - candles everywhere, great patio for the summer. Location is great, streetcar stops right there. They have open mic nights on the first Monday of every month so if you can play/sing/whatever - DO IT! Don't be shy. It seemed like everyone was super friendly. They have a lot of events throughout the month - some are free, some are about $10-15 bucks. I went on a Monday night so it wasn't full but I bet it gets packed during the week. 

I didn't eat here, but I had beer and they have a pretty good selection. 

PS I smelt curry while I was drinking. And it smelt delicious so I have some kind of hope that this place will have good food :D"}
{"text":"excellent burger. cozy room. Ontario draught list. friendly staff."}
{"text":"Because it's further east than I typically venture, I don't get here often.  However, when I do, it's well worth the trip.  Last time I hit here was a Saturday where local comic Dave Martin records the Corktown Radio podcast at the back.  The back area is a secluded bar making it great for private functions, busy weekend spill-over, or in this case, recording a podcast.

The d√©cor is definitely very pubby, but still with a strong sense of history in that this is one of the older taverns in the city.  Add to this the raised stage at the front that will typically house tables of diners during the day, or jazz and blues players at night.  One of the few jazz houses in the city?  Nice.

My assumption that the food would be typical pub fare dissipated when I ordered lunch.  Great Panini, fresh salad, flavourful and just chock full of awesomeness.  I look forward to going back for another podcast, another lunch, and another few pints of dandy beer.  See you Saturday."}
{"text":"After we saw Death of a Salesman at Soulpepper last Saturday, we walked a few blocks north and had supper at Dominion on Queen.

Gord ordered the Club Chicken Panini.  He said it was good and he would order it again.

I ordered the burger and fries but without the cheese, onions, egg and lettuce.  When it arrived, it had lettuce and onions which I was prepared to scrape off.  But the fries were cold so I sent it back.  When it came back, everything was hot and tasty.

Ron Hayward & his Trio were playing 'til 7:30pm.  They played rockabilly and twangy country and were good."}
{"text":"Terrible!! The wings are dried up, glasses dirty,patio has no sun. The owner did nothing when we complained about staff and lack of service. The place is run down and the tenants that live in the building stat next to us perched on beer cases drinking next to the garbage bins."}
{"text":"Respectable east end spot with daily specials and quick service. They also offer live music and comedy nights, but I think the place is better suited for drinks and food. The east-facing patio is small, but a good place to booze after work in the summertime.

Obligatory Title Pun: Holding DOMINION over local alternatives.

Menu Readability:  Single pager, as I recall. Poor choice of typeface.

Need to mention: Terrazzo floors and way-too-high ceilings for a pub. This girl ain't pretty.

What this place teaches me about myself: I'm up for a drink any time of day."}
{"text":"The outside of this building is stunning. Classic old Toronto, and it's East without heading into Leslieville, which is a nice.

They have a basic mediocre bar food menu, and decent drink deals. My fave part is the music, often big band jazzy music, that you can hear coming out of their front stage as you walk by. Sometimes it's awful, but usually it's good and can really pull you in off the street. 

The inside decor is really crap, though. It's kind of like Dominion is that really pretty girl you went to high school with who was a real crap disturber on the inside. A cornucopia of ugly inside walls and menus. 

PEPPER POINTS: For their patio and back room for special events.
