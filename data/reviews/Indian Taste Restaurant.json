{"text":"This is a really great authentic North Indian food stop. Do not come here for the decor or to be served with a fake smile. The food is great and the owner is even better. The buffet is all day and you can take out a ton of food not by the pound. You can also order to go but prepare to wait 15-20 minutes as they make everything fresh! As you wait the owner offers you samples of food from the buffet (which comes with rice and naan). The only downsides are the lack of A/C and it's not cheap...but what Indian places around here are? Must try once!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Food is authentic and delicious. It's not too spicy and naan is flakey and crisp. Rice is cooked perfectly! Such nice staff and my new go to Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a lunch visit today.  Don't be confused by all the Donut signage outside and inside.  It's now Indian Taste Restaurant, with no trace of a donut in sight.  They do lunch buffet ($10.99) from 11:30am-2:30pm dinner buffet from 4:30pm-8:30pm. The website says they have breakfast, but doesn't give any morning hours.  I also saw take-out containers at the buffet, so you could presumably take the food to-go.  The lunch buffet was great.  There was a wide variety of dishes (3 chicken dishes, 4 vegetable dishes, rice, pakoras, samosas, chutneys, raita, gulab jamun, salad, dal, etc.), everything was full and fresh.  They brought fresh naan to the table, and came back often offering more.  They also give cold bottled water for no extra charge.  I saw someone else get a lassi, which he must have ordered special, although I didn't see a menu anywhere.  The server was friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired.  The parking lot is confusing.  The dining room and bathroom were pretty bare-bones and dingy, but not really dirty.    There was a sign posted that said $5 minimum for credit cards, but today they were only accepting cash.  Normally I would dock a star for that, but the man running the place really gave a good impression and I want him to succeed."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant 2.5 stars I certainly would. Positives: this restaurant had great saag paneer and naan. Now the negatives: this was a truly bizarre restaurant experience. As other reviews have noted, Indian Taste is located in a converted donut shop. The owners have really taken very few efforts to disguise this fact (i.e. there are still donut trays on the side of the restaurant). To the buffet - I really wanted to like it, but the food temperature was somewhat concerning. My companion bit into a piece of chicken that wasn't even room temperature. Several of the warming lights on the buffet actually seemed to be broken. The other dishes we tried were lukewarm at best. In addition, the buffet was not replenished during our visit. Last but not least, the customer service was...odd. We didn't know where to sit, the employee was on his phone the whole time, and we were given warm water bottles to drink. I think this place has potential. However, given the food temperature issues and the overall strangeness of the experience, I couldn't see myself coming back."}
{"text":"The indian taste restaurant is located in the Donut Works restaurant.. I asked the hostess if they still carried donuts she said yes but that they switch over to buffet after, pretty weird but whatever.  The food was pretty good the buffet price at lunch time was in the 10.00 range.  No kid prices for the buffet just one price.  Bottled water is the preferred drink I suppose it was cool so that was a plus.  I also ordered a mango lassi which for 2.49 was a deal in itself. I couldn't even finish it.  Takeout is on the expensive side but If you're going for good authentic indian food GREAT!! If you're going for the decor, make the drive to Jaipur Junction in Hudson."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Buffett. The best spiced most varied and fresh Indian buffet in northeast Ohio. Hidden in a former donut shop Indian taste has the kindest most helpful owner I've ever met, and family working in the back, and with each bite you can tell the energy and effort that went into each dish. Plan to try take out ordering soon which the menu lists, want to try their Indian spicy! If you believe in supporting local businesses and want some culturally divergent food choices in this black hole of applebees and burger kings I highly suggest you try. If you don't like this food it's not the food, it's definitely you."}
{"text":"Super nice owners, great food, affordable. This is our favorite place, and you will feel great supporting such a nice family business. And it's one of the few Indian buffets around! They also have a menu you can order from."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic food. You're not going to get better more authentic food around this area. It won't look it, but you'll quickly realize this is a gem in disguise. Had the buffet and loved it (I'm Indian and have had many buffets). The veg options were killer and the service was super nice and inviting. If you ask for something they'll do everything they can for service. TRY THIS OUT BEFORE IT BECOMES MORE POPULAR YOU WONT REGRET IT!!"}
{"text":"Really delicious Indian food. I tried a little bit of everything from their buffet, and it was all good quality and good. The interior isn't 5 stars, but the food is great."}
{"text":"We came here and found no air conditioning ! We couldn't deal with the heat so we left. Cmon, your in the suburbs and your a new restaurant... turn on your air conditioning and stop being cheap ! Food is absolutely amazing though"}
{"text":"Don't come here looking for donuts.  Although the outside sign says donuts, they don't sell them anymore.  The Indian food is amazing though!  Authentic North Indian food with great flavors.  They offer lunch and dinner buffets and bring fresh naan out to each table straight from the tandoor.  My second time here and I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Nan was excellent and the proprietor super friendly.  The buffet was limited and the quality of food average.  Overall Good for an Indian food fix but that's it."}
{"text":"Don't let the subpar curb appeal fool you this place is an absolute gem! Owners are friendly and helpful. Buffet style and delicious."}
{"text":"Solid Indian buffet! Would love to come back and try it for dinner! The butter chicken and saag paneer were definitely stand outs! Some of the food is a bit cool (perhaps something wrong with the buffet) but that aside the food has excellent flavor which means a lot cause I can be a stickler about things like that"}
{"text":"I stopped by this restaurant to order food to go as I was headed home from a doctor's appt. I'm not from the area, in fact, I'm originally from Houston, TX and was a regular at the Hyderabad House restaurant down the street from my house, so stopping in at Indian Taste restaurant, my goal was to determine if this restaurant would be my new \"go to\" comfort food and indeed I'm happy to say IT IS! Turns out instead of ordering to go, I stayed, ate and spoke with the owner, Mukesh. The saag paneer, galub jaman, naan and dal were amazing! His goal and plans for serving healthy, wholesome food tailored to customers dietary needs is far ahead of the way present day restaurants are set up and his customized tiffin meals, I know for sure will be a success. Don't judge a book by its cover, the food here is excellent and fresh. Thank you Mukesh and I will see you again soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on a Saturday night a couple of weeks ago.  It was... different.  We were the only customers in the place.  And the place is an old donut shop that has hardly been redecorated.  The furniture looks like it was purchased at a cheap garage sale.  This place doesn't quite make it to \"dive\" as far as the decor.  The only menu selection, at least for dinner, is the buffet.  But it was a good buffet.  Just about everything we had was good.  I thought the tandoor chicken was kind of dry, but I like everything else (particularly good butter chicken).  And they had my favorite Gulab jamun for dessert.    Very limited beverage selection, no alcohol.  The staff person was very friendly and we chatted with him for a while, though it was kind of weird being the only customers.  He said lunch was the busy time.  Probably would really give it 3.5 stars, if that was an option.  If they fixed the place up a little, it would be a lot more inviting.  But I'll probably still be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in for the lunch buffet as they opened at 11:30am.  The owner greeted us and answered all our questions.  The food was delicious and we ate our fill.  Not only was the naan bread excellent the owner brought us seconds and offered more.  Definitely recommend and will return."}
{"text":"Unbelievable Indian food!  I've eaten a lot of Indian food around the world, including more than 30 trips to various cities in India. This place as no atmosphere but the service is friendly and the food is amazing.  Go if you like Indian food. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"We went with a big group for dinner. The buffet was perfect for us and everyone loved their meals.   The tea was also good. We will be back."}
{"text":"Best Indian Restaurant on the East side!  Very nice owners and take out buffet!  Everyone should support this local start up restaurant!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time, still not sure what to think.  It's like they took an old donut shop and rolled in the food carts for a buffet and they will finish the place later.  The food was good, which is why I'm here, your drink choice is limited to a bottle of water, although there are a few cappuccino posters but they may be remnants of the donut shop???  If you're in the area and want Indian food, stop in, you will be happy.  If your looking for a fine dining experience...about that..."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place. It used to be a donut place and it's easy to pass this place up from the outside. I went in and got the buffet.  This food is reeeaally authentic. You could literally eat anything in the buffet and it'll be amazing. The tandoori chicken is like crack."}
