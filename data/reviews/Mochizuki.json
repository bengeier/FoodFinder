{"text":"When Mochizuki first opened, it was quite a good experience, the interior was very nice and romantic. But as with most restaurants, it went downhill pretty quickly, especially when they installed the rotating sushi place. There wasn't much choice at the rotating sushi, you were better off ordering dish by dish. Glad to hear that the rotating sushi table is gone. This place is also too pricey for some average sushi. Not worth the time, in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"Sadly, I will not get to try the rotating sushi belt at Mochizuki as it appears to have closed down. Flying to Tokyo for my conveyor belt sushi, I guess."}
{"text":"The review is based on the sushi bar.  The food isn't bad but nothing special. Not worth the price though and service is so-so."}
{"text":"I died and went to sushi heaven when I ate here.

I have never had a more delicious time eating sushi than I did when I was here. The service was fantastic, the sushi tasted fresh and delicious, and there was something so appealing about having my sushi march on by via conveyor belt.  What a yum time here :)"}
{"text":"I love sushi on conveyor belts. I know, say what you want about this generalization- but I find there to be something immensely satisfying in the mystery of eating whatever comes by. I was in the restaurant on a quiet weeknight, so at first there wasn't anything too odd coming by, but as it became clear that I was staying there for a while (let's say late in hour 2) I saw some crazy things that I had never seen before.

In short, I don't know what they were. But they were delicious- the sushi was fresh, well prepared, and I had probably the most fun I'd ever had in a restaurant alone. (I was away on business, so really- it's not the kind of thing I would normally do)

Highly Recommended."}

This place is definitely not your standard Japanese restaurant. Although they still do serve the standard sushi rolls and udon, teriyaki, etc they have a large variety of other Japanese foods as well! We ordered the Sea Bass Japanese Shishkebobs and wow they were tasty, I've never had sea bass with that type of taste and texture!

Regardless I wouldn't come here for the Sushi as the prices are a couple dollars more than other places but not much better (their presentation is great, fish are rather fresh but don't taste much better than cheaper sushi shops in the Annex). I'd come here mostly for the other stuff (which will be a bit more expensive, $20-$30 pp for dinner).

I would definitely bring my significant other here for a special night, they have a 6 course and 8 course tasting menu (apparantly the \"experience\" lasts for 2 hours) and some other fancy stuff so check it out!"}
