{"text":"Hang on... This place is called Aris Grill, while there's a place just down Roncesvalles called Aris Place... coincidence? Nope.

Aris Athanaselos, whose family runs Aris Place, retired a few years ago, but apparently couldn't sit still and wanted to get back into the diner biz. The scuttlebutt is that they wouldn't let him back into Aris Place, so he started a similar (but subtly different) operation up the street.

Aris Grill is brighter and more cheerful than its decades-old predecessor, and focuses more on the breakfast/brunch trade, and also makes specialty sandwiches. They don't do big dinners here like they do at the other Aris, but their breakfast specials are on longer."}
{"text":"Seriously, if you like every single thing you eat to be cooked on a griddle with pig juice go here.  As a vegetarian and having ordered and partially eaten the greasy home-fries and `vegetable` omelet I was then horrified to see how it was made when I went up to pay.  Right next to the bacon with the juices used to cook my meat-free lunch.  I feel sick writing this.

The waitress and cook, who were very friendly by the way, acted as if I was talking a foreign language when I asked if anything they served did not come off the grill plate.  Not healthy and not clean.  The year is 2010 and they should know better."}
{"text":"A Great Family Day Breaky! 

Up nice and early with the Prego Girlfriend and lil bro for nice tasty breakfast. Prego had the Big Breakfast with all sausages (5). Lil bro had the Cheeseburger and I had the Eggs Florentine. The Prego said \"yummy\" and lil bro said it was great. I myself found quite satisfying and with this price I will be coming back."}
{"text":"And today when I went back for the same meal mentioned below, the man at the cash (ari?) said he read my review and gave me free coffee! Perfect ending to one of the most ideal hangover breakfasts."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed breakfast at Aris Place (south on Roncesvalles) but never made it into Aris Grill. Today I was beckoned in by a sign that promised a gourmet poutine menu.

This is one of my great weaknesses. I'm fussy about my poutine. I like squishy curds and a sumptous gravy resting on top of fries that would be beautiful undressed but are transformed by poutinification. But I'll forgive a lot for getting one of the three right.

Alas, Aris Grill is not forgiven. Handcut fries end up sloppy and soggy in the dish, gravy is one of those glutinous brown messes that cannot be associated with any particular animal, and the cheese was a bland tasting goo that I have to assume was some kind of \"cheese product\".

Perhaps this is a good thing; I don't need convenient access to good poutine. But in a town where oxtail gravy poutine is considered yesterday's news, you should be careful what you're calling \"gourmet poutine\". I deliberately ordered mine without any topping so I could evaluate it independently, but if you are up for it, you can try pulled pork poutine, mediterranean poutine and two other kinds I can't remember. 

That said, the joint was jumping. I think that Aris likely has a loyal patronage of breakfast/brunch eaters who enjoy the diner atmosphere and don't find the proximity to a brow-mopping cooking crew toiling over the grills off-putting. I can confirm that the staff are pleasant and welcoming. I would be back to try breakfast and hope to give it a better review."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday for Lunch. Had the Chicken Soup and the eggs and bacon. It was a huge portion! Nice and clean for a dinner as well."}
{"text":"The Grill really needs to have a higher rating - 3 stars doesn't do this place justice. This is a marvelous greasy-spoon diner which satisfies. Their breakfasts in particular are awesome, and some of the best value in Toronto, especially for the quality.

I agree with other reviewers - the big breakfast is your best bet. If you can handle it, that is, it's quite large. I would recommend really anything on the menu, though, it's all delicious. 

I always see a lot of regulars, which for me is a good sign. While the place is kind of lacking in atmosphere, it's a great place to meet friends as well. 

Quick note: While the menu does have some vegetarian-friendly options, keep in mind they cook on a single, mixed grill. 

If you like (real) diners, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Quick, tasty, fast, Ari's Grill has it in spades! If I'm craving/desiring/desperate for a giant filling breakfast for under $10 on Roncesvalles I know where to look!

I had the malted waffle combo with eggs and bacon and it was more than enough food for me, but it was so tasty I finished it in no time!

Unfortunately I was already hyper caffeinated at the time and didn't try the coffee so I can't compare to my other lovely brunch places in the neighbourhood. 

The staff were quick to take the order and just as quick bringing it by. Everything was nice and warm and smelled fantastic!

The atmosphere isn't very fancy, it strikes me as a great quick-bite place, not much coziness to be had, I do wish the tables were slightly larger as the platters and glasses took up almost the entire table!

I'll definitely be back though, those malted waffles...droool."}
{"text":"Sure, kindasorta trendy and swankier Sunrise is up the street, but if you're like me, you enjoy giving the business to tried-and-true family efforts.  Ari seems to have made the mark for breakfast places along the Roncy strip, having once been The Man behind another resto that (this has gotta hurt) actually still bears *his* name.

Aris Grill is a greasyspoon diner par excellence, offering solid, stick-to-your-ribs breakfasts made by friendly and approachable people.  (I've even had the experience of my server offering me fresh, homemade... like, for real homemade... raspberry jam straight from the mason jar.)

Some tips:  If you're a pancakes-and-eggs person, get the Big Breakfast instead of the pancakes and eggs: it's the same price and more bang for your buck.  Try their liver and onions.  Ask for the password for their free Wifi.

Just remember:  it is a greasyspoon, so expect to know that everything was made on the massive griddle there.  That includes \"vegetarian\" options, so be warned, rabbitfood eaters: even your nibbles will have been made directly next to the bacon and sausages."}
{"text":"Eggs and sausage. Sure, it's a simple order, not much complexity to it; but when it's done right, you can tell! 
The SO and i used to frequent this place every weekend when we lived one block away but then the food started to go downhill, and the service started to not be as friendly. i recall the glasses being dirty, my eggs weren't done properly, the sausages were drenched in grease, and just tasted off, and the coffee was weak. After 2-3 last chances, we finally let go to find another place for our weekend b-fasts. We found Aris Place down the street which became our new regular breakfast spot until it recently started to go downhill (food was getting sloppy, my order was never right! service was rude at times, the quality wasn't what it used to be, the bathrooms and carpet are gross). 

we still come to Ronces often and we tried Aris Grill today b/c of the terrible last visit to Aris Place, and it was good enough to come home and write immediately write this review. 
The service was excellent - the waiter was polite, friendly, fast, and attentive. 
The food was spot on. Eggs done perfectly, sausages done nicely, my toast the way i like it. the meal was NOT overly greasy. The coffee was also very good.  we were really happy with our breakfast! $13 for the both of us. amazing. 
The restaurant is a bright family owned restaurant with the ambiance to match. Casual and appropriate for a couple, family, any group of people. 

We met the owners and they bought the place in March. They were super friendly and  happy that we had a good meal. I would definitely say if you have eaten here before, do come back and try it again. There is a new menu so it'll be worth going back for a quick burger and fresh cut fries too."}
