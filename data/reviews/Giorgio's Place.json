{"text":"I admit it I am a pizza snob, with New Haven pizza as my gold standard. The people at Giorgio's are extremely nice and I appreciate that it is a neighborhood place, but it is bare bones decor and eh pizza. I have not tried the pasta dishes and I expect we will on a don't-feel-like-cooking night. I guess what is bothering me is that although I know the pizza was made fresh, the crust almost tasted like a frozen pizza, as did the sauce etc. Darn you, Modern Apizza, Sally's and Pepe's, you have set the bar too high."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots on the northside for yummy and inexpensive food.  I really love the sandwiches that are toasted making the bread nice and crunchy.  I also really enjoy the thin crust pizza especially when I get the pepperoni and meatball toppings.  YUM."}
{"text":"Best Sicilian pizza in the immediate burgh that I have found aside from driving to Mineos all the way in squirrel hill."}
{"text":"Came here while in Pittsburgh for work. Got the Pazzo Cheesesteak , very good. Ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza to go, it was excellent. Parking would be the worst part, but I'm sure the north east are is a lot different than Houston, not everything is in a strip center lol."}
{"text":"I\"ve ordered lots of items on the menu. Pizza sits out on a rack drying out and has hardly any sauce on it. Their spaghetti was the only item i enjoyed..."}
{"text":"Really underrated hidden gem of pizza in Pittsburgh. Would definitely return. Only wished they delivered."}
{"text":"Food was okay, not great. We had pasta take out. We had called in our order, were told it would be ready in about 20 minutes. I arrived 20 minutes later, and was told it would be a few more minutes. However, it was an additional 70 minutes before the food was ready! Several other people were also waiting for orders, some left in frustration. The woman taking orders and money apologized, blamed the delays on her son, but offered nothing more to compensate people for the excessive delay. We will not return, the food was not worth the wait time."}
{"text":"This place won't appeal to most foodies (if any), but if you're looking for very casual dining, unpretentious food that comes in generous portions served by unpretentious people, this is your place.  These have to be some of the most down to earth, genuinely nice people around in the restaurant biz!  They'd get 5 stars for that.

This is my place for local pizza or a baked fish hoagie when I need a break from my own heat n' serve cooking and need something on the cheap.

Nothing but cool vibes here.  Be sure to check out the photo of Michael Douglas while you're there."}
{"text":"Went here for take out on the recommendation of my brother and we loved it!  Had the gnocchi with marinara and a neopolitan pizza with 4 toppings.  The gnocchi was so light and the sauce so rich.  The pizza was delicious, also, with very generous toppings.  Very reasonably priced, friendly service from placing my order to picking it up.  Will definitely return when we're back in Pittsburgh!  Credit cards accepted so the \"cash only\"reviews are no longer correct."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in North Shore. I choose Georgios every time when I get a pizza craving. No delivery and cash only doesn't bother me, and if you want a good pizza it shouldn't bother you either. My favorite is good old pepperoni. They use the little pepperoni slices so they curl up and the grease pools in the middle mmm mmm! This is the way pizza should taste! A+ 

-Review by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and myself."}
{"text":"if you are in the northside try to visit this little mom and pop pizza shop on western ave. their deep-dish pizza's are absolutely delicious!! one of my all-time favorites has sausage and pepperoni and green peppers toppings. it takes a good 30-40 mins to cook one of the deep dish pizza's so make sure to call ahead before picking up or dining in."}
{"text":"Let me just say I have always loved the pizza here as well as mama bear who is usually at the counter. Sadly this evening she wasn't there and this place just lost a loyal Italian customer. The food is good and if you eat in house you usually doesn't wait long. But this evening after waiting I asked for a refill on my coke. I was told it was a dollar. Excuse me?!! I have eaten here several times and now it's a dollar. Considering I don't carry cash you're going to run my card for a dollar? That means after merchant fees you make nothing. Or they want to charge more for the coke to cover the fees!! There is so much ice you get maybe if you're lucky 4oz of coke.  Now I know there will be people who reads this and says it's petty and stop whining. But it's the point. You take care of regulars as they are like family to your business. They are the marketing who tells friends and family that brings more business. If I have never been charged before then why now? And if you need that dollar so bad why don't you take it out of the tip I left you! I'm not obligated or required by law to tip. Yet I do every time and that's the thank you. Yeah that will be a dollar for ice with a side of coke! This is Pittsburgh so trying to find good pizza isn't very difficult. It's practically a given you're going to find pizza that's good just about anywhere. I come from a family who owns their own business an that's not how you say thank you for your patronage. Now I know this isn't going to send them into bankruptcy. Point is when you have someone over and over spending their hard earned money to support your business you do what it takes to keep them coming back. And for the love of Pete it's a box of syrup that's not costing them hundreds of dollars. In business you have to spend money to make money. Now my money will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in the Northside. The Sicilian pizza with homemade meatballs is the best! The steak and bacon hoagie is really great too.

Very casual dining, but well worth it. Love supporting a great local business.

We no longer live in Pittsburgh, but I think about Giorgio's often. They're cash only, which is a bummer, but there is an ATM a few steps away at the Modern Cafe."}
{"text":"This place has excellent pizza and hoagies. Nice thin crust and super tasty sauce. And the reason for the fifth star is the customer service. I think I've met everyone who works there by now and they all make me feel special. They're just so sweet. Check this place out--come for a slice and leave with a smile."}
{"text":"Giorgio's isn't a bad option if you're a north-sider. Decent when it's HOT and COLD! The deep dish isn't as deep as you'll get in Chicago, but it is delicious and affordable. Toppings are very fresh, especially the veggies. The service is friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the first time for a quick lunch. The atmosphere is nice and it looks recently remodeled. The hoagie I had was absolutely delicious. The bread they used was great. I see a lot of reviews saying they are cash only, but I used a credit card here (the guy said it was recent that they added the card machine). The service was great as well and they were super friendly. Will definitely be back to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"I live on the north side. I saw a gentleman who is part of the family that owns this place in the lobby of the YMCA. I asked about delivery because there are few good places for pizza in this neighborhood. He then told me he would never deliver on the north side because its so dangerous and he doesn't want to get shot. This was an atrocious response to a pleasant request. They own a business in a neighborhood and they insult the residents. They will never get a dollar from me again and I will be loud about this experience."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! Great friendly service!! So happy to have good pizza on the north side!! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This place has been here for a while, I always heard positive things about it. This past week my partner ordered pies for a long meeting, and came back raving! So much, that I bought my shop lunch today. We had a big chicken salad, 2 different steak hoagies, a meatball sub, and a pizza. Pretty good cross sample - the sandwiches were excellent as was the salad. The pizza was very, very good. Sauce was a touch sweet - some love it that way, some don't - YMMV. As other's have noted, it's a family run business. Clean inside, smelled great when you walked in the door.
While I was waiting, a police sergeant from the station up the block stopped in to pick up a few orders - I take that as a good sign also.
Bottom line, everyone at work gave Georgio's 2 thumbs up - I'll be going back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I want to really like Giorgio's Place because it's so close to where I live.  But when all I really wanted was a deep dish pizza, I was disappointed.  It's probably my own fault, I was craving a deep dish pizza in the Chicago style.  What I got was basically a pan pizza.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I felt misled.  It is good to know Giorgio's is here when I just want a slice, so we'll call this first taste a learning experience.

Prices are reasonable but be advised this is a cash only establishment."}
{"text":"Unfortunately for Northsiders such as myself decent pizza is almost impossible to find. The downtown delivery options all serve the same spongy crust topped with way too much cheap cheese style of pizza.  That's why when craving pizza I turn to Giorgio's. The crust is soft and fluffy while still being crunchy on the bottom. They are very generous with the toppings, but are happy to make the pizza however you want (I like a little more sauce than cheese on mine). The prices are also great; my standard order of a 2 topping medium pizza with 6 wings is $14. 
*A note on the wings, they are wing-ding style (breaded then fried) so order them with the sauce on the side otherwise they get soggy.

Giorgio's does have some drawbacks which result in me knocking off a few stars. 
1. They do not deliver
2. They are cash only
In my opinion these are two significant inconveniences when it comes to a pizza shop. I have do some serious pre-planning if I want to order from Giorgio's. In general when I'm craving pizza I'm not in the mood to hop in the car, find an ATM, and run back and forth. If they at least started taking cards I would be happy...Come on Giorgio's, let's move into the 21st century"}
{"text":"I would personally give this place one star, but as everyone else at the table enjoyed their meal, I'll give it two. While deciding between gnocchi or tortellini, I asked the older woman working the front of the house if their tortellini was homemade as well. She assured me that the tortellini was also homemade and was very good. (I shouldn't have believed her as her story kept changing from SHE makes all the food, to her mom makes all the food.) So excitedly, I ordered. The wait was forever in the small, sweltering hot, hole-in-the-wall dinning room. And I knew from across the room as the waiter FINALLY brought my plate, that my dish was made from frozen, hard, tasteless, out-of-the-bag tortellini. I was ticked. The meatball I added to the meal only made matters worse as it was bland and mushy. (An opinion all of us that had gotten the meatball shared. I choked it down after a few doses of salt and red peppers.) I will say their spaghetti noodles are ACTUALLY homemade and are pretty good - but good spaghetti without a decent meatball, in a hell-fire-hot dinning room is just not worth it. 

Lesson learned here: had the front of the house been honest when I was ordering - I would've opted for the gnocchi instead and this would've been a positive review. 

(Also if you're going to boast about how your food is all homemade and made fresh daily. DONT CARRY FROZEN ITEMS ON THE MENU. AT ALL)"}
{"text":"This place makes the best pizza!! I always get bacon and pepperoni toppings and its soooo freaking good.. They also sell by the slice which makes it great when your on the go.. The staff is amazing and hospitable.. It's a family owned restaurant and it's excellent!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times over the years and like this place a lot. Unfortunately, I no longer work on the Northside so don't eat here very often. I absolutely LOVE the 5 cheese calzone and the pazzo cheese steak hoagie. Just a step below is their stuffed manicotti. I'd give this place 5 stars except in not a big fan of the pizza. The dough is very good but I don't like the sauce they use. Anyway, over all it is very good with friendly staff."}
{"text":"I was delivered a very soggy, wet and unappetizing deep dish pizza.  The manager said she thought most come that way.  I...don't think so.

1 star for you.  Bye bye..."}
{"text":"We placed a takeout order for about 7 people. When we got there, we had to wait at least 15 minutes after it was supposed to be ready. We were told the wrong total over the phone and then the woman gave us attitude about it. The woman argued with the guys making the food and was extremely unprofessional. The food lacked flavor and the orders were incorrect. I won't be going back. The only reason why they aren't getting a single star is because i heard that their pizza is good, but we didn't order pizza."}
{"text":"Cash only, no delivery, and the guy at the counter can be pretty surly. Pizza is pretty good though. Not good enough to deal with the previous mentioned items however."}
{"text":"Food is good. Not great.  They do not follow their posted business hours so don't be surprised to find the establishment closed at 830 on a Saturday when the door says 930. Also the staff is very rude. Especially the miserable lady that takes orders. She acts as if she's doing me a favor when actually I could have chose any other pizza place in Pittsburgh. And I will!"}
{"text":"This place is good and friendly. We went here to order pizza for my students. The pizza is very good. I will be back. Nice inside."}
{"text":"We love this place for take out. For some reason everyone we tell about it never heard of it. I always get the chicken philly hoagie. It's one of the BEST hoagies I've ever had if not the best. My wife always gets the gnocchi with meatballs and she is like an expert when it comes to gnocchi and she swears it's the best she's had even from high end Italian restaurants. Nothing fancy here just really good food and I love the staff  who are always friendly. If you haven't tried it you really should."}
{"text":"This is a true example of old family recipe and dedication to making a great pizza.   The grandmother is always there when I walk in.  The sauce is homemade.  The dough is homemade.  The cheese is fresh.  I am not sure what else you can ask for from a local family owned shop.  

I did not rate it 5 stars as I have not tried anything else except their pizza.  So the missing star is not their fault.   I have tried the white pizza, the red pizza, Sicilian, thin crust, and most of the toppings.  Every time it has been on point.  

You can buy a piece, a small pie, or a large pie.  They treat you the same every time.  

The service is friendly as you order at the counter and they bring the food to your table.  There is barely ever a wait to order and always a table available.   

It is a great place to grab a slice for lunch which is what I usually do.  If you have not been there, make the effort to stop by.  I will probably be there as well."}
{"text":"This place is dangerous because it is so GOOD. Favorite pizza in Pittsburgh. I love the Sicilian cut with mushrooms. I've even turned my coworkers on to this place as it's our go to whenever we're in the mood for pizza in the office. Giorgio's now delivers to businesses and accepts cards!"}
{"text":"Casual pizza and pasta place. Order at the counter and they bring the food to you. Great deal for the dinner entrees - about $9 for spaghetti and meatballs with a side salad and garlic bread. Nothing fancy - just simple but service has two thumbs up. Bathrooms and overall establishment are clean and spacey. My grips are that it is $1 for a refill and cash only."}
{"text":"Never had a Italian sub that didn't have capicolla. .....honestly there was 4 cuts of meat on a half of a Italian sub....only 4 cuts of meat....the Sicilian pizza was good not great but I won't order from here EVER again"}
