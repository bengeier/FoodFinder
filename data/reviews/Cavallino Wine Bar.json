{"text":"Great go to place if you're looking for Italian, little off the strip so you won't have to wait for a table I've had almost everything on the menu and haven't had a bad meal  I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"A favourite place of our friends from Toronto. The welcome was so warm and friendly.   This is an authentic restaurant serving great pasta, seafood and veal dishes. Whether it was the pasta with rabbit, the pasta with scallops, prawns and mussels or the spaghetti the cooking was perfect.....consistent high quality pasta. The starters too were excellent and memorable was the grilled octopus.  This restaurant has a good wine list and it has a feel as though you are eating at home....very friendly and caring in every aspect of the visit.  We finished with good coffee.  This is a little Italian gem in the suburbs....and certainly worth a visit."}
{"text":"Well it's a hidden little spot up here in Woodbridge, Very nice atmosphere although your view from the window is a parking lot and islington Ave lol .. But hey it is what it is .  Food was very good ,very fresh and classic Italian . Service was good aswell and made you feel welcome !  I'd recommend this for a date night for sure !"}
