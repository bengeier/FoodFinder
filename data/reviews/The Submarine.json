{"text":"Had to stop in and give this place a try after reading the reviews. By far the Best Viet Sub & salad rolls I've ever had. Both were made fresh to order. Everything was extremely fresh exploding with flavor. Very nice owners with great food! 
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was wanting to have Chinese take out for lunch, but all the places were too busy... I really craved Vietnamese, and didn't want to go to my usual spot because I didn't want to drive all that way... When lo and behold... The Submarine...  All I read on the signage was Vietnamese Pho, and Vermicelli...WINNER!!!  Didn't know what to expect, and it blew me away.  This is my first review, but I had to write one because its so lovingly made, by a Mom and Pop shop.  I ordered quite a bit of food and bubble tea, and everything was so Fresh and seriously well done.  Now, it did take a while for my large order, but the owner did say it would take longer.  I have to say well worth the wait, AND she gave me a hug after she packaged my meal... Oh, the SUBS are Perfect, with a hint of spice, caramelized onions, savoury cilantro.  The Bun Vermecelli was excellent as I ordered 1 of each meat for my Family to try and they all were super tasty!  Such a great find, and so close to my home...WOW!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here on our way to the airport and picked up a chicken and beef sub for the trip.  The service was fast and the staff was friendly.  The sandwich was outstanding!  We didn't eat it until after going through security and customs and it exceeded our expectations.  The flavors were outstanding and the bread was not soggy.  We wished we had bought a second one rather than sharing one between us (even though we were both stuffed after the first one).  We will be stopping here again the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Great food, fresh and delicious. People are nice too.
lI highly recommend this place for the quality."}
{"text":"This is one of those random finds that quickly becomes a favourite joint. It's a hole in the wall (I believe it replaced the Yellow Submarine), ran by an older couple.  

Service and the food is amazing! Sub meat (beef sate for me) was freshly prepared and delicious. Buns were fresh and crispy. Everything about this place has a very simple, homey appeal.

In the last week, we already went back twice. 

This is one of those small family businesses I will go out of my way to support. And you should too."}
{"text":"Love the Vietnamese subs and the bread and ingredients are always fresh. This place is a hidden gem and has a friendly atmosphere as it's family run. I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place that we could get some tasty lunch to take home to our sunny backyard deck. Not sure what to order so we asked for a suggestion. We were told that everything was very fresh and made to order. We were told we would like it all. We ordered a couple of subs to go.  While they were being prepared the very friendly owner chatted with us about business in the area. We returned home to enjoy one of the tastiest subs I have ever had. I am glad this pace is so close to home. We have been back for there tasty food a few times now."}
{"text":"great food im a happy customer, its freshly in front of your eyes instead of the back like other places"}
{"text":"This spot was great. Inside a bit small for actual sitting but the food was on point. The owner also gave us some fried chicken bites to share on the house. Gotta love customer service like that. We had the beef sate sub and beef vermicelli. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken sat√© sub sandwich (#5 - $7.25) and delicious charbroiled chicken vermicelli. (#16 - $9.50). Sub sandwiches are reasonably priced and meal is prepared quickly. Don't look for atmosphere, this is a get-in-get-out kind of a place or good for take-out. Owner is very kind and considerate. My one complaint is the pricing of the bubble tea."}
{"text":"This is, by far, my favourite Vietnamese restaurant in the city. The sate beef sub and pho never disappoint. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"The pork sub was delicious. The meat was tender, bread was fresh, and there are these sweet, crunchy, marinaded carrots on it that are so good. As an added bonus, the lady that runs the place is so friendly and wonderful. She is so lovely and was incredibly confident that I would like her cooking. She was right."}
{"text":"When I first walked into The Submarine I immediately noticed how clean it was which is always a good sign. The atmosphere was very bright and a bit harsh almost like a Chicago cafe had sex with a hospital, but refreshing and light at the same time. Not a sit down with the family kind of place but stop in with your significant other when you don't want to cook and want a tasty meal. The owner is very nice and talkative and makes the best spring rolls! I don't really like Vietnamese subs in general so I didn't have that but my wife did and she said it was really good. I had a soup and thought it was amazing. Not the typical msg/sodium shot you get with most Vietnamese soups. It tasted very home made. I will definitely be back to eat here(and chat with the owner) again."}
{"text":"Very fresh, high quality and generous portions. We got the sate chicken and beef subs. Worth the visit!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food made by wonderfully nice people, this is a family run sub shop at its best!

I came by here on a recommendation by my mom. It's not like my mom's recommendations are always solid, but since visiting this restaurant she seems to have made it her personal mission to tell everyone about it, and now that is something! When she told me she's even taken to handing out the store's flyers (maybe one day she'll discover Yelp... far more effective...) I knew I had to at least check it out!

I asked the owner for a recommendation - \"Get anything,\" she enthusiastically urged, \"it's all good!\" It was by no means a cocky statement, she just seemed very eager that I try her food, because she knew I would like it.

I went with a Chicken Satay Sub, and she was completely right - It was wonderful! Good chunks of fresh tasting chicken with a delicious sauce. I told her I wasn't too afraid to turn up the spice and she gave me a sandwich with a tasty amount of heat.

With subs, there's not much to go on, so pretty much every single ingredient needs to stand on it's own and at The Submarine it really does!

A crispy length of cucumber, tasty carrots and bright, fragrant cilantro that looked freshly snipped topped off my sub. And then the most important part - the baguette. I commented to her about how tasty the baguette was and she told me they get them from a small, local bakery. \"I buy from them every day,\" she told me. \"They're just small, so they need us just like we need them.\" But the big reason she chooses their baguettes is because \"they're crunchy on the outside but also soft, so they don't cut the roof of your mouth!\" She's got a really great point! This baguette walked that perfect balance between crunch and squishy freshness.

It's a filling sandwich, so much thatI had to save half as a snack for later. At $9.50, they're not the cheapest Banh Mi in my mom's words that I'm sure she will now pass on to you - \"She doesn't want her business to be the cheapest. She wants to be the best.\" And I think they do one fine job at it.

Bottom line - Delicious home cooked Vietnamese-style submarines from a family you feel good about giving your money to."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for a banh mi. Why? The quality of the meats and sauces are far superior to any other place I tried. 

First off, when you order a sub, the owner starts grilling your meat up fresh! The beef slices were generous and tender. The homemade mayo and sate sauce is killer. Garlicky, salty and sweet. If you are into cilantro, it taste like it was just plucked from a garden. The portion is pretty big. It doesn't look like it from the picture because the subs are wide and packed with meat and vegetables. I was full for the rest of the afternoon, which usually doesn't happen to me when I eat a Vietnamese sub. 

My husband raved about his Sate Chicken sub, which uses good quality white meat. He said he'll drive me here any day to pick up a sub. The subs are a buck or more than other places, but its worth it when you see what you get in return. 

The spring rolls were juicy and meaty, not all wrapper and veg like some places. I want to try the pho and vermicelli bun next, but it will be hard to tear myself away from the beloved subs here."}
{"text":"Waited two + hours for our delivery. Called a hundred times with no answer. Finally got through and apparently you need to specify that yes you actually do want what you ordered, gave an adress and ask for the total. Otherwise you'll be waiting and waiting for nothing. Re-ordered ( God knows for what reason) and our total has gone up 3$. This place has terrible customer service.  Currently on our way to McDonald's. Never again."}
{"text":"Fresh bun.  Fresh juicy cooked chicken.  Vegetables a little stale but they don't get much customers so that's understandable.  For a north ban mi it is definitely the best and the freshest buns and meat.   There was no cheese on mine."}
{"text":"Sub was great. Meat was tender, bread was crunchy. Fresh, fresh. The decore was not very appealing as there wasn't any. The staff where friendly and even opened an extra area up for us to sit down."}
{"text":"Amazing subs - the bread is made in house and is extremely fresh. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"As the name suggests, sandwiches here were huge!  I ordered the pork and chicken bahn Mi sub with the satay sauce on the side, and was pleasantly, but not uncomfortably full after eating the whole thing.  The bread was crisp / flaky on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside, and meat was all white, tender and juicy and the sauce had a good kick to it. I'm glad I ordered it on the side to avoid excess sogginess.  

I also saw they had fresh fruit boba drinks here, though we felt the price to be a bit steep for us to give it a try.  Maybe next time :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful place to visit for home cooked Vietnamese food! Everything was made to order and they take great pride in what they do! Delicious! Order the deep fried wontons and the dumplings (neither are on the menu), you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"QUALITY QUALITY QUALITY.  I used to live behind this place for years like literally right behind it.  I had no idea it changed ownership and my friends and I came in one day right before a round of Frisbee golf FROLF and OMG I probably wouldn't have gone in because of how bad it was before this couple bought it. The lady that is in charge of this place makes some of the best food I've tasted. She takes such pride in everything she makes and it shows. I can't  believe I almost never came back here.  I don't know anywhere that cooks the chicken to order for the sate sub.  Make time to come here I live on the other side of the city and I make a point of stopping in whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Review: subs.

I loved Vietnamese subs since I was introduced to them as a kid. They are essentially subs made with Asian ingredients. I knew I had to try this place after looking at all the stellar reviews.

Bottomline: no frills restaurant that serves tasty subs with the freshest ingredients. Slightly more expensive than other places.

Atmosphere: although clean, the restaurant is not much to look at. Decor is pretty much nonexistent. Definitely not a first date kind of place. Service was one of a kind. She was enthusiastic and super friendly. Even offered a complimentary tea while I waited for my sub. Made me feel very welcomed.

Food: the sub menu is extremely small. It's either chicken, pork, beef or straight up veggies with or without sate. However, because of their limited selection, their ingredients were very fresh. There wasn't anything too special about their subs, but the freshness took them to a whole new level. Everything was well seasoned and ratios were just right.

Value; slightly more expensive than other Viet subs (1-2 dollars more), but worth the extra. Portions were average."}
{"text":"This place is a nice family-run establishment.  You can tell they take pride in what they do and the food they prepare.  I ordered a sate beef sub and was impressed with how big it was and how fresh the baguette was.  The meat itself was cooked well but I felt it could've used a bit more spice and sauce.

I will definitely be back to try the other Vietnamese fare they had on the menu.  Seating is available and they weren't that busy at lunch."}
{"text":"After seeing a fellow yelper heck in here the other day I had to try this out myself. The owners were very friendly when I waked in and were very quick to give suggestions. I had the beef sub and I can definitely say that is was delicious. The bread was fresh - a good crust that wasn't sharp and the bread was soft. The beef was tender and the sauce was on point with that hit of spice and peanuty goodness. If you are also craving bubble tea, they do have a good selection of both fresh fruit or powdered drinks. Yum!!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and waited over an hour and a half for my food... Called them twice... Never got it. Maybe better to not go for the delivery option."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and the soup broth is made from bone not package. Meat cuts are tender whether fir subs or soup. Enjoyed very much. Wifi: Shaw Open available but isn't free for everyone."}
