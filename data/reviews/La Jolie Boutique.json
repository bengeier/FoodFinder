{"text":"You can find pretty much everything there: nice wooden toys, scooters, costumes, board games, diaper bags, etc. It's probably your best option in the area for selection and affordable prices."}
{"text":"My first stop for birthdays and holidays. Everyone is helpful and kind, they have a good mix of toys, both mass market and harder to find."}
{"text":"Best option in the immediate area that I've seen for affordable and high quality kids toys, games and costumes. Nice wooden toys, cool lego, a really sweet collection of cuddly puppets in friendly fabrics. Some of the staff were incredibly mellow and nice, and one guy was a little overly intense, not a bad guy just too much for the otherwise sweet and magical vibe of the store."}
