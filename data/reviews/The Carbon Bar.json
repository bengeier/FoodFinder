{"text":"We just went there for drinks last night with the girls because a friend suggested it. It opened only three weeks ago, so it wasn't too full on a Saturday night, but when I walked in, the decor was amazing! I didn't expect to find such a nice looking bar in a little 'suspect' neighbourhood. The ceiling was very high, and the feel was very upscale.

We only had few drinks, so we didn't get to taste the food, but I enjoyed my wine selection and the service was very friendly, not snooty at all. I would love to have a birthday event or something there in the near future."}
{"text":"We went to this place last night and really enjoyed the dinner. Cool ambiance w/ a rustic loft warehouse vibe.  We ordered the sharing platter w/ the beef brisket, ribs, and fried chicken which were all unreal. We also got the burnt ends as a starter which had a great smoke flavor to them. The drinks were a little on the expensive side...

Worth checking out this place for a dinner/!"}
{"text":"Consistent BBQ, with decent accompaniments in a cool atmosphere. Carbon Bar is pretty close by my place, so I've been here a couple of handfuls of time. The pitmaster platter - fridn chicken, brisket and ribs m, with fries and pickles - is a good fill-me-up-with-tasty-food-at-a-reasonable-cost option. The fried chicken is deadly. Ribs are typically tender and juicy. Brisket is very good about 75% of the time (sometimes it's been a bit dry). Cocktails are good, and they allow corkage, which I love, but also have a bunch of reasonably priced decent wines on their list.  I almost always eat at the bar, which is generally busy, with a nice buzz. Sometimes when it gets super busy, the service can slow down a bit, but they typically do a pretty good job at being attentive. Fishmonger platter is not as good as the pitmaster platter - it's a bit light and lacks the equivalent substance which makes the pitmaster a pretty good value for money choice.  Sides and and other main plates are generally good, but sometimes lack the consistency of the main bbq event. I continue to go back and enjoy."}
{"text":"I was here for dinner twice, it was ok!  I came here to try the brunch menu, nothing special or tasty, small menu for brunch selection. But the server was horrible, attitude & no knowledges about food."}
{"text":"Carbon Bar is pretty standard Toronto restaurant, food was good, decor was confused, and it had a very 'rich young professional' vibe (not my jam, but to each their own). Best part of the night was the bourbon cart, the manager knows what's up when it comes to bourbon."}
{"text":"Go to the carbon bar to enjoy a nice dinner with good wine ! 
The service is good ! 
Well recommended !!"}
{"text":"This 40 ft high space was once the Electric Circus music venue, late 60's/70's, and was the hippest place in town.
Moses Znaimer then bought it and started City TV which was the hippest TV station of the day.
Now it's loud, but hip too and a great vibe.
The service here is excellent. The staff help make the meal a success
Sure everyone orders the Korean Fried Cauliflower which is excellent, but the star for me is the brisket, the hardest of all barbecue to get right, which is juicy, fatty and sweet.
Lots of interesting things on the menu, excellent desserts too
Go, and you will have fun and an excellent meal in a culturally historic building.
Cheers!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pretty good. The seats layout are comfortable. But the food was ok. Nothing really amazed me, little disappointed. We went there for my friends birthday and we mentioned while making reservation, but they didn't provide or greet us with any complimentary cake like other restaurants or say anything regard about the birthday to us."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Great neighbourhood joint :) highly recommend the hibiscus cocktail it is amazing!! Also check in on Yelp to get the free bar snack! It's a full sized vegetarian appetizer. Fried cauliflower that tastes like general tso chicken.... Yuuuuuuuummy. I shared the seafood platter and it was just OK. Nothing to rave about.... Overall great experience. Will definitely go back to try some other dishes and drinks :) Makes a great date night spot!"}
{"text":"Great place! The food is amazing and the restaurant has a good ambiance!
Def one of my fav restos in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Came here for their Summerlicious 2016 menu. We got the wild shrimp ceviche and ssäm which are both on the regular menu, the grilled salmon and the fried chicken dinner which also comes with two ribs, and the burnt basque cheesecake and peach cobbler. 

The ceviche was not that fresh and had a slight bitter taste to it. The ssäm was delicious, highly recommend--I believe it's called the Berkshire pulled pork on the regular menu. The grilled salmon was nothing special but the fried chicken dinner was quite good. Be prepared for a very thickly breaded fried chicken, the breading itself was really good, as were the fall off the bone and flavourful ribs it came with. I also recommend the burnt basque cheesecake--really loved the consistency and the contrast in flavours with the charred top. The peach cobbler sucked, very soggy. 

The cocktails were good, matched well with the bbq menu. Service was also very attentive. The space and atmosphere is beautiful, very open and spacious. They have a private dining area on a separate floor that overlooks the main dining area."}
{"text":"PARTIAL REVIEW

Crisp Chicken Skins ($7) Sweet Chili Vinegar- Can someone tell me how this could possibly be bad? Like Thanksgiving, but better. An order brings out four pieces of super crispy skin packed with rich poultry flavour. A little greasy on the fingers, yes, but the bright tangy dip helped to balance out the fat. 

Cheese Croquettes ($9)Apple-Chipotle Sauce- A warning to those wearing your fancy pants to dinner. Safety first with this one, folks. Secure the napkin on your lap and chest, and then lean over the side plate-these little bombs of hot cheese will explode upon contact. But let me tell you- messy ain't got nothing on deliciousness with these little bites. Crispy on the outside, and ooey gooey cheesy goodness within- I also liked the spicy sweet dipping sauce to cut the fat. Yes, please.

Queso de Cabeza ($13) Fried Suckling Pig, Pork n' Beans, Hen's Egg, Pickled Beets- One of my favourite dishes of the night because who doesn't like breakfast for dinner? The beans were sweet, salty and starchy, absolutely delicious with the fall apart tender suckling pig and the luscious runny yolk. What made the dish, though, was the unexpected addition of the pickled beets. With so much fatty goodness of the plate, that little bit of tangy veg just brightened everything up. I would totally consider just ordering this as my main.

Raw Salad ($12) Avocado, Pear, Radish, Shaved Coconut, Jicama, Peruvian Peppers, Coriander, Lime Vinaigrette- This is what I think we're going to see more of this 2014- chefs making vegetables super hot. This raw salad was a great example. With so many bright flavours, contrasting colours and irresistible freshness going on, even a hard-core carnivore would be enticed to try this. The vinaigrette was definitely more on the acidic side, which is my preference so I loved it, but those who preferring more neutral flavour may feel there was too much citrus. I do think those people suck.

Pit Master's Platter for 2 ($58) Ribs, Beef Brisket, Jalapeno Sausage, Pulled Pork, Turkey- I wish this platter were available for one person, because if two people ordered this, they couldn't have room for anything else, and thou shalt not make a meal of meat alone (unless you're down with a mean case of the meat sweats, of course). Regardless of the portion size, everything on the platter was super delicious. The ribs were a favourite amongst my group but I fell in love with the deckle bits with all the smoky bark - oh my lord, that was good. There wasn't anything on that platter I didn't love, I just wish it was possible to purchase a smaller portion.

Jalapeno Sausage (with platter)- Despite being part of the platter, the sausage came alone (maybe not enough space!), but was one of the best bits of the meal. These were some of the juiciest, most flavourful sausages I've had in a while, and the hint of jalapeno really offset the fat. Deliciousness all around.

Goat Ribs ($18, Fridays only)- I was really happy we ordered this, as they ended up being (in my opinion) even more delicious than the pork ribs. Surprisingly tender, with a good level of smoke and very little fat. If you happen to be here on a Friday, definitely get these ribs.

The Big Rib ($35)-Cumbrae Farm's Pit Fired & Braised Beef Rib, Savoy Cabbage, Parsley, Mustard, Horseradish, Pickled Relish- Hands down, everyone's favourite dish of the night. The smoke and braising method yielded a massive hunk of meat that was both smoky and well caramelized but also impossibly tender. Sweet, sticky, rich and savoury all at once. I also liked how the bright zippy horseradish in the herbaceous parsley salad refreshed the traditionally heavy winter main. A bit pricey, yes, but absolutely delish.

TCB Slaw with Corn Nuts (accompaniment to Goat Ribs)- It was a small portion as it came with the goat but man, was it ever good slaw. The dressing had a perfect ratio of creaminess and tang, while the contrast of the crunchy sweet corn nuts and supple cabbage was addictive. I would highly recommend this side.

\"Hot Mess\" ($11) Sweet Potato, Cheese Curds, Crema, Pickled Jalapeno, Chopped Brisket-This dish is nothing to look at but, its definitely damn tasty, albeit a bit heavy amidst the meat heavy mains. The ratio of sweet pillowy potato and spicy jalapeno paled in comparison to the mountain of stringy cheese, the tangy crema and the rich beef brisket.  Somehow, although I had reached my meat-threshold, I still wanted to eat it all. My suggestion to make this perfect would be to use a larger sweet potato, making the $11 price tag seem more palatable and helping to balance out the heavy toppings.

Banana Toffee Cream Pie ($16)- Growing up, one of my favourite desserts of all time was banoffee pie, and TCB's version didn't disappoint. Delicate flaky pastry, generous chunks of ripe bananas, thick luxurious ribbons of toffee and a mountain of cream on top. It perhaps sounds quite sweet and rich, but this pie was surprisingly light.

{"text":"Went here a couple weeks ago, just remembered to review.  The vibe and decor of the place is really cool.  Wish we could have sat at the bar.  We used the Yelp check in to get the korean style cauliflower as an app which was sooo good.

I had the octopus dish with beans and and egg, was really yummy and filling.  My friend had the brisket burger which I had a bite of and it was amazing, and I think my other friend had some type of mini wraps...we also ordered the corn bread which was amazing and a couple other apps I can't remember, but everything was delicious.  A bit pricy but it was an enjoyable experience overall and there was a bunch of other stuff on the menu I remember wanting to try.  Will come back in the future."}
{"text":"Friendly smooth greeting at the door even without a reservation. Seated in the lively bar and texted when a table became available.

The male bartender ignored us until we called for attention - a bit awkward. 

The gentleman with a beard was helpful in seating us sooner and the waitress was quick to take and bring our orders.

The ribs fell off the bone and had a strong smokey taste. The cornbread with spicey mayo was delicious. The slaw with corn nuts was fun. The fries were nothing special. 

The $75.00 bill missed our drinks at the bar which was odd.

Washrooms were beautiful - lol.

All in all - the space was really cool, most of the Service was right (attentive) and the food was ok."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a Monday evening with a group if 5, we were seated immediately. Carbon gets a 5 for style, I spent more time gazing at the chandeliers, high ceilings, open kitchen and floor to ceiling bar than the menu. I would suggest splitting the pit platter, (brisket. Pork ribs and fried chicken) it was plenty for two people, though very tasty I have had a better version of each meat at other places, and for a lower price.   The service was great and and an overall nice experience."}
{"text":"Great spot for an after work drink that feels more upscale than your usual chain casual restaurant.

We tried the BBQ platter and some of the appetizers. The fried cauliflower was the stand out dish.The other dishes were good but nothing I really think I would have to come back for.

Staff were very attentive and the food came out very fast. 

The interior is very nice and as other reviewers have mentioned, the first thing you notice are the high ceilings. I think the interior really stands out because the outside is so unassuming and the Carbon bar is in an area that's in the middle of a revitalization. 

Not much else to say - I'd come back if someone wanted to go but I don't think I'd make a trip to especially come back here."}
{"text":"A great Toronto spot for meat lovers! Speaking of which, get the meat platter which will not disappoint! The brisket is my favourite thing on that platter, the fried chicken is also good, but wish it wasn't boneless breast meat...fried chicken should be about the legs and thighs in my opinion. The KFC (Korean fried cauliflower) is to die for. Good for large groups and birthdays since this place has a lot of seating and a cool vibe. Cocktails are also good!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks here were fantastic!

Great signature cocktails (try the Mule); great flavours and fantastic mix of dishes; friendly service; great space."}
{"text":"I've been to Austin Texas for BBQ brisket and it was delicious! But the brisket at Carbon bar is even better than the stuff from down south.
As you walk in you are greeted by hostesses. As you step into the bar and resto area, you can help being mesmerized by the high ceilings, exposed brick and original zig zagging light fixtures with a large round base at the end.
To say this place is hip, cool, and happening would be an understatement. It's the current \"it\" place.
Not only was it a great trendy, hip, cool ambiance, the menu made me salivate. The had this master platter to share for two which comprised of fried chicken and brisket with fries to share for two for $60. Or you could order the brisket on its own for $23. I opted for the $23 option.
They also have a burger with fries for $21 which they allowed my friend to substitute with a piece of southern fried chicken.
The service was impeccable. Water and drink refills all evening long. We had a few drinks each, the total damage on the bill was $67 per person.
I totally recommend this place. I have yet to try the other items on the menu - beef tartar, oysters, etc but definitely try the beef brisket if you are a meat lover. It melts in your mouth - tender, all the right spices, succulent, the right amount of fat, to die for."}
{"text":"Having heard about The Carbon Bar FOREVER, I decided to book a table on a Saturday night. The atmosphere is as cool as everyone suggested. You feel like you're somewhere and instantly look around for a B-list Canadian celeb. There was no one.

The pit master platter was good. We appreciated that the server instructed us how to eat the dish starting with the brisket, moving to the ribs and finishing with the fried chicken. The brisket was delicious, the ribs were dry and the chicken was cold when we finally got to it. One sauce was over-cumin-ed while the other I wanted to drink with a straw. 

Overall, the service was excellent, the vibe was cool, the food was mediocre and the bill was outrageous. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"In serving up barbeque in a open and sophisticated space the Carbon Bar is trying something unique that doesn't quite come off. Barbeque is a casual and intimate meal and feels odd in a big and impersonal place like the Carbon Bar which feels like it should be serving up something more cosmopolitan. The prices also match the space rather than the food (which is good but not great.) It is pricey and the portions are small for barbeque. I also found the service to be weak.

Barbeque is everywhere in Toronto these days so there are far better options if that is what you are into."}
{"text":"4/5! Great food and nice ambiance. There is a private room upstairs for large parties. I recommend the seabass or ribs as a main."}
{"text":"The platter is delicious. The ambiance is fun. Make sure to get reservations on the weekend."}
{"text":"Great space and great service!  We weren't sure what to order so the waitress gave us a few recommendations.  
We started with the Hamachi Tartare and the Cabrito Papusa (like an empanada).  Portions weren't huge and the Cabrito Papusa came as only one so had to split it.  
We split the pork ribs which were great and thoroughly enjoyed but I wish the waitress would have told us that it didn't come with anything on the side.  It was literally just pork ribs on a place.
For dessert, we ordered the Carbon Bar chocolate bar which was tiny! Delicious but again, not really shareable (it was literally bite size).
I would definitely come back again as the atmosphere in here is great!  I was just surprised at the portions but it didn't throw me off enough to wreck my meal!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at the Carbon Bar. On a busy Saturday night, we sat at the bar and ordered food and drinks. The bartender was friendly and made us feel welcome. We took the recommendations of our bartender and we were not disappointed, the food was excellent. Highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"had the Pit Master platter for 2, The kfc, Mac and cheese,... FOOD was AMAZING!  And staff was so Nice and helpful, like for
Example Adam that took the time to go through the whole background story of Bourbon and guide us through their large selection."}
{"text":"After looking forward to Carbon Bar because of the great reviews and my love for barbecue, I was sorely disappointed. There was nothing wrong with the service, upon arriving we were greeted warmly and our server was happy, and attentive. The problem was the flavor, portion size, and price. I am a foodie, and I have no trouble paying for good food, but the Carbon Bar did not deliver. The scallop appetizer ($14) came with one scallop sliced into three. It was super thin and disappointing. The Crabcake & BC Shrimp, for $29, included one slightly more than average sized Crabcake with a table spoon of avocado and three tiny baby shrimp. Mostly breadcrumbs, this dish is way overpriced. Their Pork Ribs, while admittedly fall-off-the-bone tender, were lacking in flavor and only included 4 avg sized ribs for $19. And finally, the Carbon Chocolate Bar, is miniscule. About the size of one truffle, but nowhere near as decadent or delicious."}
{"text":"Meat overload for sure! This place was yummy and if I'm ever craving barbecue I'd probably come back (although at the time being I still need to check out Electric Mud).
Anyway! I came here w/ a friend. We started w/ the cheese croquette and fried oysters. Then did the meat platter ($27 per person) and had the \"hot mess\" sweet potato. 
Cheese Croquette - I thought this was just okay. It's really creamy and really gooey. I wouldn't order this again.
Hot Mess - this wasn't really what I expected.  It is kind of like a baked potato loaded with toppings. It was good but I thought it was overpriced at $11.
Meat Platter - This was great! It came with beef brisket, pork ribs and fried chicken.  Everything is seasoned nicely w/ sauces on the side which I like so much more than being slathered all over my meat. The fried chicken was my least favourite. It was nice to get to try everything and portion size was right for sharing. However, given that I wasn't really a fan of the chicken, next time I think I would prefer to just order the ribs and brisket, then a bunch of sides. 
The decor of this place is really cool. It's a nice space and pretty massive. 
It's a bit pricey for barbecue but the quality of the ingredients is good and the meat tasted great."}
{"text":"Delicious! 
Server was very friendly.  It was a busy Saturday night (we made reservations) all the food was delicious and way to much to eat so we took a bunch home with us.

Got the Burned Beef Tips lettuce wraps to start, they were very good. I would have that again and again.

We got the sharing platter (Ribs, brisket and buttermilk chicken) with a side of fries. The dip with the fries I could not get enough of, the brisket just melted in your mouth and the ribs just fell off the bone.  The chicken was very good too but we barely got to it because we were stuffed!

We also got the Banana Creame Tarte. Oh my! It was so good.

It was a nice ambiance and good crowd.  A must try."}
{"text":"The PitMaster Platter was very nice and perfect with a beer. Be sure to go for the brisket first, as suggested by the chef. You won't regret it! Melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness and easily the star here. Buttermilk fried chicken was also on point. I personally found the ribs a bit dry, but hey -- to each their own. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"I like my whiskey smokey and they do some of the best old fashioned in the city . 

Also happy hour is a great deal if you can get to it and if you know about it.. and I'm not talking about the one they advertise.. they do $5 wines with a choice of red, white and prosecco before 6pm and complimentary appetizers.. how grand is that?! but anytime you mention it to the bartenders they seem like they're annoyed.. thus, my only complaint-  the bartenders.. wish they weren't so sanctimonious."}
{"text":"Best take on Huevos so far! The pico de gallo was wonderful and the 4 corn tortillas were fresh and tasty. The French toast old fashioned is a must try!"}
{"text":"Very nice and patient hostess.  Maybe it's just my expectation in customer service is getting low but the hostess were patient and kind enough to explain to us that all the tables were booked for the night and to maybe try the bar.  And with some luck, we were seated in 20 minutes.

We ordered the platter for two for $60, the tacos for $16, and a corn bread for $8 I think.  This was more than enough to feed one dude and two gal.  The food is a tad better than most bar restaurant; jack and milestones, etc.  So you are really paying more for just the chic atmosphere.  

We had a great time at Carbon Bar.  Would recommend for party of large group if service is important for the night.  The staff are nice and attentive.  For myself though, I'd probably won't put it on my to go to list for bar food.  There are just too many restaurants that can dish out better food for almost half the price."}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday Dec 14 (their 2nd or 3rd night open) with my wife as a last minute change in plans, and a great change in plans it was.

The snowy weather likely had an effect on the crowd, as it was quite empty when we arrived shortly before 7. 

Service: 
Very friendly and attentive. Obvious that our server had been taken through every menu item already as he had knowledge of the taste and Chef's intention behind each dish. We took the manager up on his offer to be \"shown around\" after our meal - this may have just been luck of the slow night due to weather but it was a nice touch.

Food:
We ordered our dishes one by one and shared. We started with the Cheese Croquettes which are 3 types of cheese, battered and fried ... they were good - the apple-chipotle sauce was perfect for it and probably better than the actual croquettes. Next we had the Queso De Cabeza on our server's recommendation, which was fantastic - the flavours of the suckling pig, beans, and egg went together perfectly. 
As our \"main\" we ordered the Pork Ribs, an order of \"Hot Mess\"  and collard greens. Again we were very pleased with everything. The ribs are dry rubbed and come with a side of a tangy bbq sauce - the ribs are great on their own, but the sauce is too good to pass up. Hot Mess is a spin on a loaded baked potato (sweet potato, cheese curds, crema, pickled jalapeno and chopped brisket). It was delicious but on the small side of what you might expect for the $11 price. The collards greens were really tasty as well. We were too full for a full desert so my wife had the Carbon Chocolate bar which is a perfect sized little \"taste\" of sweet to cap off the meal.

Bar:
A great selection of signature and original cocktails but at $14 - $16 they're on the pricey side. I started with a Smokin' Manhattan (cigar infused bourbon, oak infused vermouth and bitters), and followed it up with a Heart of Gold (bourbon, port, sweet vermouth, chartreuse, bitters). I really enjoyed them both preferring the Smokin Manhattan. My wife (who is expecting) was very pleased that the bartender crafted a tasty virgin cocktail for her. So often she is just offered a San Pelegreno and a glass.

Layout:
It looks amazing! They pay tribute to the old CITY TV building that was there with a \"green room\" and cat walk as a private dining experience, electric circus sign, baby blue logo ... high ceiling, open kitchen, different size booths and tables - wide open bar area ... it really looks great.

Our total bill was just over $100 before tip and we left very satisfied. The menu is built perfectly for sharing. Portions aren't big - but they're packed with flavour. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Very chic, upscale , hip interior! We were able to walk right in with no reservations at 7:00 on a Saturday. Beautiful seating for diners. We each had drinks, Desperados and a charcoal martini, an appetizer of burnt beef ends, a seafood platter for 2--fresh, not cooked except for the snow crab legs, and we shared a slice of carrot cake. All came to $100. It was a real treat and a special meal . Everything was exceptionally good! The beef burnt ends were especially delicious. Diners next to us had the bbq platter for 1 which also looked amazing. Excellent wait staff. Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I'd heard some good things about this place so I came here for dinner during Winterlicious 2016. It was okay. 

HAMACHI POKE - 7/10
This appetizer was quite refreshing but also kind of bland. The presentation was nice though.

SOUTHERN SNAPPER - 5/10
Passable. The curry sauce served with the fish was tasty and not heavy, but the fish itself was a bit dry and pretty bland if it wasn't covered in curry.

APPLE CRANBERRY CRISP - 8/10
They did a good job with this dessert but but nothing about it wowed me. It was just a good apple crisp served with vanilla ice cream.

DULCE DE LECHE ICE CREAM - 10/10
I chose the apple crisp over the ice cream as my dessert of choice, against the waitress' recommendations. Poor choice on my part. My friend chose the dulce de leche ice cream and I had a bite and it was amazing. I've never had ice cream with such a rich caramel flavour. If I could have a do-over, I would pick this over the apple crisp.

Overall, the portions were decent but I don't think they're worth the $35. The service was a bit slow. We ended up eating for 2 hours with long gaps between courses. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks one friday night as a second choice, with some girlfriends, we arrived around 6 and were asked if we had a reservation, we didn't, so they said \"oooh, well if you want to have drinks, feel free to sit at the bar\" - the place had, i kid you not, 3 tables occupied out of the 20 that were in there. they basically said that unless you'll be spending money, you can't sit at a table, go find a place at the bar or at the communal table by the kitchen. When we left, they were STILL half empty inside! It's amazing how some Toronto restaurants think they can't seat you unless you have a reservations. relax guys, this isn't NY, no one wants to get in here anyway. Not coming back, food was alright, nothing to write home about, server was great and the drinks were alright, not worth the 14 dollars though"}
{"text":"Yes, yes: food is fantastic, atmosphere is fun, decor is cool. You're going to read everyone else's essays about each dish so I'll just give my standout synopsis: the service here rocks. 

From my experience, everyone here is on the ball. From the time you're greeted by the host, they have got you covered. Our server was lovely, but it's the littlest things that make the biggest impacts, so I'll get on with it. I was trying to shazam a song (great music btw) and couldn't pick it up. Didn't think a second thought about it, just a brief missed opportunity for some cool new tunes. A staff member came by a few minutes later and very professionally, said that he noticed I was trying to pick up the song and asked if if I had gotten it. When I said no, he said that he had written it down for me, passed me a piece of paper and wished us a lovely evening. Bam. That's some next level shit. It's a reflection of the management, corporate culture and brand to know that the level of service is so important. 

I'm a foodie to the core, but excellent customer service gets you repeat business and I'll definitely be back (next week actually!)."}
{"text":"I'm lucky enough to be the person who chooses the locale for our Work team outings and I very much want my co-workers to be impressed/be thrilled with the resto pick.

I really feel I hit it out of the park - and by me, I mean the restaurant - the food was incredible, I'd have to re-read the menu but there was one appetizer that was like a mini breakfast that made my eyes roll in the back of my head with joy partially due to a swirl of cracklin. LordJesus.  

We actually went when they had one been open for 8 days and my only complaint is that (admittedly a table of 10) our service was on the slow side. Slow, not being a problem when a group that size is feeling leisurely and maybe the resto isn't concerned with flipping tables vs customer happiness. Slow as in did I order a drink? I did, didn't I? When was that? And my boss wanted to cut out a little earlier than the rest of us and graciously was covering the bill - I can only imagine, we ordered a couple of everything, hello chicken skin you sweet siren, rounds of the meat platter (again menu consultation needed for the name - it was a plate o'magic meat) - and enough wine to kill an elephant - and from asking it was a 45 min turnaround. My mistake was ordering a drink infused with tabacco which made me nauseous as hell, but that's my intestine's, not the bartender's, fault. One co-worker that tried it called it a straight up kick to your face. Truth. 

All in all though, delicious. The space is gorgeous, the washrooms are fine. 

High fives all around."}
{"text":"My friends and I had to make last minute dinner reservations on a Friday night. It was one of those 20 below zero evenings on a long weekend in February, so things were pretty crazy when it came to getting a reservation. We managed to get a great, cozy table for our group on their balcony. So while we had our own private dining space, we really got a feel for the great space and high ceilings. i would say the place is trendy but not overly done. The service was attentive, friendly and efficient. Best part of the entire experience was the great food that was both sophisticated and \"comfort food\"  like\",interesting combination. 

We thoroughly enjoyed the sharing plate \"the fire pit combo\" with its slow cooked and tasty ribs, meats and fried chicken. We tried their tuna tartare and ceviche and they were both yummy to the last bite.

Their  creamy yet light banana tart was fresh, buttery, filling yet light. Hands down a great place that I will definitely go to again again."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday night with a group of friends for dinner(8). This place was highly recommended by a co-worker. We could only get reservations for 5pm because the next seating was a 7pm. The service was great and we weren't rushed out of the table although it was past 7pm. Our server was really great and walked us through the menu with patience.  Great wine list and the food was delicious. A number of us ordered the Pit Master Platter - pork ribs, beef brisket, buttermilk fried chicken, pickles, fries & chipotle mayo.  The meat just melted in my mouth. The beef brisket was perhaps the best I've ever had. This place is definitely worth a try and we'll be returning."}
{"text":"Tucked away at Queen and Church, Carbon Bar has a trendy vibe without the pretentious attitude. Great for couples or a night out with your pals. I'll come here when the carnivore in me is craving a big ol' plate of bbq/smokehouse meat. You MUST get the Pit Master Platter (for 2) - it comes with pork ribs, beef brisket, buttermilk fried chicken, pickles and french fries. Pair that with a side of collard greens that's topped with melted butter. Drool. I also dig the soulful and classic rock they play."}
{"text":"Had an excellent first meal there, especially enjoyed the seafood platter. Second time, not so much. The food was really not very good at all, and the service was incredibly slow. Sorry, but when I'm spending $600+ on a meal for 4, I expect the service and food to be decent. The drinks were still good though."}
{"text":"Exceptionally designed, this establishment is beautiful. Wait times can be lengthy, plan ahead.  As there was a forty five minute wait, we started at the bar and had a few apps. Our bartender wasn't very welcoming, but made an exception drink. We moved to on our table where we were able to experience what team work was all about.  I love going into restaurants and seeing everyone work so well together.  Our server was amazing and made some excellent recommendations. My fave dishes were the peppers, Korean cauliflower and the mac and cheese.  We had the meat platter and it was okay, nothing to rave about.  The brisket was the best, ribs were not as flavourful. The apple pastry was a great way to end off the meal. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"So my wife and I had dinner here last night. As soon as we walked in I was disappointed with the overall feel of the place, it felt like a slightly fancier dim lit moxies. 

We ordered a dozen oysters as our starter. They came on a nice heap of crushed ice with all the horseradish, lemon and hot sauce a man could want. Sadly though these were by far the saltiest oysters I have ever had. They were so salty we couldn't finish them, which is a shame considering the $38 price tag.  We mentioned to the server how salty the oysters were and she just said that they were salty cause they're from the east coast. My wife and I both have had east coast oysters on multiple occasions and they were nothing like this. 

For our main we had the pit master for 2. When the food came I was instantly unimpressed with the portion size but I do have to say that the brisket was very tasty. The ribs were good but nothing you couldn't pull off in your own backyard BBQ. Our server was very kind, informative and was keeping the drinks flowing. 


All in all it was a poor experience and we will not be going back."}
{"text":"The venue is gorgeous. Their cocktails are pretty good. Their BBQ platter is more than enough for two people. Their food is good, and their brisket is very tender, but just weren't off the charts. There are too many bbq places who does bbq well. But would still recommend coming here if you wanted to go to a place to chill with your friend of gf."}
{"text":"Great menu- food was tasty. Awesome brisket - fell apart was so tender. Oysters were great andTuesday night - half price!"}
{"text":"It's a great place to meet up for drinks after work.  The decor and design of the venue is very nice.  Ceilings are at least 30 ft high.

The food was good.  I tried a lot of different items with my friends.  

- Crispy chicken skin.  They roll out the skin and crisp it up some how.  When served, it looks like a flat bread.  The skin itself doesn't really taste all that good.  Probably because all the fat has been rendered off.  The sauce is good.  But who wants to eat not tasty chicken skin with sweet chili sauce?

- Frogs legs...tastes like chicken.

- Shishito Peppers - Great app to share.  A must order when there.

- Beef Brisket burnt ends - not much flavour...more burnt and dry than juicy and caramelized.

- Dry aged hanger steak - the first word in the item describes it.  It's dry and tough.

- Tunisian octopus.  Seemed sort of hit or miss...some pieces tasted great, some pieces weren't as good...texture seemed off.

- Hot mess - A hot no...waste of your money.

- Tuna Tartar - It was good...very fresh."}
{"text":"The venue, itself, is amazing and the food is very good.  

The management is horrible and incompetent.  Just don't try to book anything, and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I are were dying to try this new hot spot.
As soon as we came into the door we were greeted by the friendly hostesses and taken to our table.
The restaurant is beautifully decorated with lovely light fixtures that dangle from the 30 foot  ceiling, comfy  leather booths and a large U shape bar where you can get your drink on.

To start I had a Volstead, a  super boozy gin cocktail that I really enjoyed, followed by TCB caesar which had a very interesting smokiness to it..

Our server was attentive and made great recommendations for the table  

First up we all shared the kettle corn, cheese croquettes (these were amaze-balls), split peas fritters, the CB baby kale caesar salad (not as healhy as it sounds but I highly recommend it), cabrito papusa (delicious but very small) and last but not least the hamachi which was one of my faves.

From the wood fire pit  we shared a pit master, this platter includes pork ribs, beef brisket and jalapeño sausage.The ribs were definitely a table favourite.
We had a few of their 'fixings\" to go with our main; the pork and beans, cb slaw and \"hot mess\" (sweet potato,cheese curds and chopped brisket) delicioso!
We enjoyed our mains and sides with a bottle of Chianti Castellare Classico which was super yummy and best of all only $39!!!

To finish we had the carbon chocolate bar which tasted very similar to a Nanaimo bar but better.

I will  be coming back  for more ribs and  cocktails at the bar."}
{"text":"This place is great to go with a group of people so you can try a bunch of items on the menu! They've got a bar area for casual drinks or booths and tables for food. Highlights for me: Pit Master Platter and Korean fried cauliflower"}
{"text":"A few years ago, Carbon Bar was definitely my favourite and I was so excited to plan a friend's night out there last month.

The staff was amazing, very attentive, constantly pouring water for the guests and checking up on us. The ambiance was ok - very quiet for a Sunday night.

The food definitely has gone in terms of quality.  3 out of the 5 guests became ill after eating at The Carbon Bar. Two guests had an upset stomach, and one guest was vomiting the whole night - so bad he had to take work off the next morning. I felt extremely bad because I was the one who made the reservations.

I emailed the restaurant, and while they seemed like they cared, \"We informed the chef, but we did not have any other incidents that were reported. It's very hard to have cross contamination. Sorry that this happened to you\", their reply was a bit disappointing, to say the least. Their reply definitely made it sound, it's you, not us. Sorry but too bad.

Very disappointing and I would not come back again."}

The Carbon Bar on Queen and Adelaide opened not too long ago, in fact, just in time for my birthday dinner back in December! Obviously I was taking my chances since I haven't been to the restaurant before, haven't tried their food and bringing such a large group and everything. However, The Carbon Bar is brought to us by the same team behind the famous Nota Bene- well known restaurant near Queen and University where I've been before and had a good experience- so I wasn't too worried. 

Since there were going to be more than 10 people at my birthday dinner plus it was during holiday season, I did call 2 weeks in advance to make sure I got my reservation. 

I loved how they had coat check service at the front with tickets, during winter time it does get really hectic with heavy coats and I really appreciated that extra service when I walked in.

We were seated at the Chef's table where we could see all the action going on in the kitchen as well as get a good view of the restaurant.

Did I mention I love restaurants with high ceilings? well, The Carbon Bar def has a high ceiling and I loved the industrial feel of overall design.

Ordered: Crisp Chicken Skins 3/5

Served with sweet chili vinegar for $6, how can you go wrong with crispy chicken skin? this was delicious but just wasn't sure if it was worth $6

Ordered: Hamachi 4/5

Hamachi tartare, clementine, pear, coriander, kombucha vinegar for $14. This was a nice refreshing starter, it was small in portion but so colorful and packed with flavor

Ordered: Queso De Cabeza 5/5

Fried suckling pig, pork n beans, hen's egg, pickled beets for $13. I wasn't sure what to expect from this appeizer and the server kindly explained it as 'Mexican breakfast' and I liked the sound of that. This is def heavy as an appetizer but overall a really good dish. I am not the biggest fan of beans but the fried suckling pig was melt in my mouth and the brioche toast was just extra on top.

Ordered: Pit Master Platter 4/5

Ribs, Beef brisket, Jalapeno sausage, pulled pork- minimum 2 people, $29 per person. When I took a look at their menu online prior to my visit, I knew I had to have this. I love dishes where I get to try a little bit of everything and this was just perfect. Brisket was outstanding, it was very fatty and moist where I found the ribs to be a little too tough. If there are 2 people, I would recommend getting this with a side or two to share. Make sure you don't get a meat coma after!

Ordered: Pork Ribs

Serving for $18, this is exactly same thing that's on the Pit Master Platter, but just one serving

Ordered: TCB Burger

Pork cheek, Havarti, pickles, mustard and fries for $19. I didn't get to try this but my friend said it was a very good burger.

Ordered: Blackend Sea Bass 4/5

Yuca, chili, lime, coriander, tomatillo chutney for $22. Another solid dish if you are not a meat eater, sea bass was cooked perfectly and quite buttery- although a little small in portion.

Ordered: Porcini N Grits 5/5

Grits, sauteed porcini mushrooms, deep fried egg yolk, crisp kale, huitlacoche dust for $19. This was another dish that I was very surprised with. Usually I am not a big fan of porridge, polenta or grits but this was so good! Very creamy and the porcini mushrooms added earthy flavor to the overall dish and I loved it.

Ordered: Hot Mess 5/5

Sweet potato, cheese curds, crema, pickled jalapeno, chopped brisket for $11. This is one of the sides you can order and it is whole new level of your ordinary baked potato. Skip the fries cause this is def worth $11

Ordered: TCB Slaw 5/5

Served with corn nuts for $4, I really enjoyed this coleslaw- it was light, tangy, refreshing and perfect as a side to all my heavy meat dishes.

Ordered: Cheddar Ice Cream Sandwich

Aged cheddar, wafers and maple syrup for $9

Ordered: Pumpkin Pie Ice Cream

Rice pudding, barberries, wild blueberries, candied sunflower and pumpkin seeds and spiked eggnog for $9

Summary: I had an awesome time at The Carbon Bar, I loved the food, atmosphere and the service. They do heavily focus on meat dishes but there are lots of other choices for vegetarians as well. The restaurant is spacious and they do take reservation which makes it convenient for everyone. I will def be back for a dinner at Carbon Bar."}
{"text":"Birthday dinner! Not mine, a bestie's birthday dinner. Perfect spot for a celebration. The room is large and airy, yet dark, not too fancy or pretentious. Simply good service. 

We split a few things - duck tacos (one taco per person), seafood platter for two and barbecue platter for two. Obviously, we capped it off with the dessert pecan pie, also for two. We were six people, and if you were in the same position and very hungry it wouldn't have been enough. For us, it was quite perfect though. Got to try everything! 

One thing that I very much appreciated were the Sofie bottles of beer by Goose Island. These are somewhat rare in restaurants, and it's a very classy way to drink a beer! This went perfectly with the upscale BBQ atmosphere- highly recommend."}
{"text":"I would do a 3.5 star on this one. They do well at their food. It's the type of creative food you'd expect in a downtown restaurant with a trendy vibe. We went with the family style dinner and had a good experience with the food. The kale ceasar salad with beet soaked eggs is a must. It has a subtler taste of a ceasar which I liked since your typical ceasar tend to be too heavy on the sauce. The beet egg is nice to look at and taste like those Japanese ramen eggs. Although not as salty and well balanced. Next memorable item is their main course. The huge plater of brisket, ribs and fried chicken. All of which are nicely done. The ribs are very well charred and the charcoal is well BBQed in. It's not your fall off the bone type of rib but the taste is good. The fried chicken is very good also. It seems like balance is what they try to achieve there. The food is tasteful yet not overpowering while having a distinct character. For example the smoky charred taste is what hits you with a good balance of how a good rib/briske/fried chicken should taste like. 

Another worthy mention - the KFC (Korean fried cauliflower) it feels just like a Korean fried chicken but it's made with cauliflower. Quite unique and pleasing to the mouth. Highly recommended. You won't walk out hungry since the food was plenty. The peacan pie in the end was a good finisher and the whisky infused whip cream pairing was delicious. 

The food was great but the reservation system needs to be improved. We had to put a $250 deposit for a large group and they were adamant about being on time. With that in mind we made sure to be there on time but we were still put on hold for 30 mins past our reservation time. It is a busy venue but I do expect this aspect to be better managed at this kind of establishment. Let's just say that $100 for the meal is a very competitive price range in Toronto and the choices are abundant."}
{"text":"I tried Carbon with a group from work and were not disappointed. Absolutely delicious food to the point that I could barely touch dessert (and I LOVE dessert in general) 
First off - the place looks impressive - it was an old industrial building turned into a music hall and now the restaurant. The ceilings are incredibly tall and it gives the place a very open and spacious feeling. Really impressed by the way the place looks.
The food is where things get truly impressive. Started with the beef brisket burnt ends which were delicious. I love beef brisket and had some good stuff (including in the U.S.) but somehow there were beyond amazing. Excellent smoky flavour and melt in your mouth goodness. 
Continued with the buttermilk fried chicken which was an enormous portion - so delicious. I cannot find enough words to describe it. The chicken is somehow tastier than any other chicken I've had in Canada and the coating brings to a whole new level. They serve it with their own coleslaw which is very well done as well.
It has been a while since I had a WOW moment at a restaurant in Toronto. This is definitely one of the best culinary experiences I've had in a long time... highly recommended, despite the slightly steeper prices..."}
{"text":"Terrific wine, cocktails, food and amazing ambiance. Love it."}
{"text":"Come with a big appetite and enjoy the  BBQ offerings in a trendy wide open loft space that is fun and roomy.  The drink menu features interesting cocktails that are sure to delight. The wait staff are very attentive.   The ribs are fall of the bone dry rub and smoked and served up with a side of BBQ sauce, delicious coleslaw and a pickle, this all  screams BBQ despite the lovely ambiance . We also ordered the brisket which was very tender and served with an espresso bbq sauce on the side, and coleslaw and a pickle of course! The fries are good, the jalapeno corn bread had a nice presentation but I found it to be dry, that did disappoint. There are many competitors int he BBQ space in Toronto, The Carbon Bar is just a little above average, but it is a great choice if choose to do BBQ  stylishly  or if you dine  with vegetarians or oyster lovers."}
{"text":"The food was okay. A little disappointed after reading so many good reviews. I didn't like they serve minimum 2 persons items, too restricted."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an upscale restaurant with bbq fare, this is the place to be. The atmosphere provides a modern contemporary vibe with a smokehouse flare to the menu. The k.f.c. (Korean fried cauliflower) was recommended by our server and was quite delicious. Portion to price ratio is slightly skewed, quality is seen as priority over quantity, food and cocktails were delicious. I had the scallop poke, which was delicious but admittedly was still hungry after having it. Servers were friendly and attentive. Would definitely recommend and revisit! :)"}
{"text":"Trendy and great atmosphere. Great food and great drinks. Low light and intimate in the bar area. Back area is a diner style but cozy. Large private rooms in the back/upstairs. Coat check also which I love."}
{"text":"Honestly going to say that although we only had a few appetizers and a sample platter the food was outstanding, freshly prepared with great ingredients 

The ribs were tasty juicy tender, the fried chicken was cooked to perfection..... The brisket was melt in your mouth and the french fries seasoned to perfection 

My experience there was fabulous and I plan on going back and eating more than just the sample platter 

Try this place out, you will not be disappointed 

Oh yeah, and the decor is very hip 

Nothing bad to say about the place"}
{"text":"Got the chance to check out the new hotspot carbon bar last night. Girlfriend and I loved the food. We shared the fried oysters which were a great start to the night. Afterwards our mains were the lobster gumbo which is a must try and the beef brisket which I'll say is the best I've had in the city. So soft and melts in your mouth, very yum. 

Now the place and staff....you were ok. The decor of the place was pretty neat but limiting. They give no indication as to what the place was like before. EC show was never done there, it was only the night club which much music decided to later pay homage to as we all know. I made a fun comment about the DJ and sound equipment you see plasterd on the wall like art work and I jokingly suggested can I take em down and play with them. The hostess tried to catch up to my humor but didn't work, oh well points for trying. Our server was good to start with but by the end of the night I get the feeling she was trying to rush us out which I wasn't impressed with, kept trying to clear off our table numerous times. Lastly we were looking for a table at around 7-730 which they kept telling us they had none yet we stayed till almost 830 and saw those tables were LARGELY unattended for the entire time we were there. What's up with that?

Anyways great food and I'd go back with a larger group just to try a lot more stuff. Staff? you did your job and were fine but lets be a little more pleasing and professional I know you can do it :)"}
{"text":"Had a very mixed experience recently at the Carbon Bar. The food was excellent however the wait staff turned an otherwise wonderful dinner into something less than stellar. 

The entire dinner was rushed. The waiter was taking away dishes from our table before we were finished. The waiter was reluctant to answer questions about the menu and drink list and overall unpleasant. 

Will not return solely because of the staff. Sad because the food was great!"}
{"text":"The Carbon Bar is what happens with the team from Note Bene delivers southern style food with rock-inspired glam!

It's a gorgeous high-ceiling decked out restaurant 
-- And it used to be the home of Electric Circus!  
Now instead of EC dancers gyrating to good and bad 80's techno music, 
the space was packed with diners wanting some BBQ.

I arrived and checked my coat at the entrance.  The hostesses were friendly and showed us to our reserved circle booth for 10 people.  
We were seated by the open kitchen at a round booth which would be comfortable for 6-8 people.  For 10 people, the booth was tight, even though we added two chairs.

I started with a cocktail from the Signature Hooch list.
The Heart of Gold ($14) was a bourbon cocktail with port, Chartreuse, and orange bitters.  It was strong, sweet, and the best part was that it was garnished with a seriously yummy cherry.

For my appetizer, I started with the TCB Caesar salad ($11).
It was a good salad, but not not quite what I was expecting.
The kale made the salad seem more like...well a kale salad instead of a Caesar.
There was a lot of kale, but not much else.
The salad was served with buttery delicious garlic bread instead of croutons.
Instead of bacon, the salad had fried tongue.  salty and fried.. and pretty tasty.
The dressing lacked garlic and I couldn't taste parmigiano or anchovies at all.
I wish I had chosen the raw salad instead.

If you are there on a Friday, it is recommended that you try the goat ribs ($18)
I've heard great things about them.
They were tasty.  Leaner than pork ribs as expected and not super tender.
The sauce was pleasant and smokey.
However, the portion was not very large and the ribs were not very meaty.
I felt pretty hungry.

It was time for dessert and I shared the Banana Toffee Cream Pie. ($16 for 2 people).
The cream was the best part.
The crust was buttery which I liked.
The filling was not really banana enough and I didn't taste much of the toffee.

Still wanting more, I ordered the TCB Chocolate Bar ($3).
I expected it to be small.
It's smaller than the Halloween sized Mars bars, let put it that way.
I liked the dark chocolate topped with bourbon caramel.

Overall, TCB is a fun restaurant with a great vibe.
However, the price is steep for casual fare.  My portion was $70 including the automatic group gratuity of 18%.  Service was good but our food experience was a bit average.  Depending on what you are looking for, you might prefer another restaurant for some southern comfort."}
{"text":"If you go to Carbon, try to sit in Lorne's section.  He was the most attentive and responsive server I have had in recent memory and really made the meal memorable.  

The food was good.  We had the raw salad and the Pit Master.  Salad was yummy though just a bit too much dressing.  Pit Master was good.  Love the variety (brisket, ribs, fried chicken).  Not my favourite BBQ in Toronto (that still goes to Hogtown in the Beaches) but decent.  Also had the cole slaw and fries.  Both good.  

And the space is gorgeous!  Would be fun to go with a large group and order lots of dishes but we had more than enough for two people."}
{"text":"Best brisket that I've ever had ... even better than bbq joints that I've tried in Toronto. Excited to go back and try more items off its menu. Impeccable service and very knowledgeable staff. A great and surprising find ... we literally stumbled on this place."}
{"text":"Nice space, great service!  Food is mediocre... The ribs were dry and under salted.  The pulled pork was dry too. The platter for 2 was overpriced.  The wine list is TERRIBLE! And they were out of all the wines we asked for!  The deserts are terrible too.  The cheddar cheese icecream tastes as wrong as it sounds!  The seabass was delicious at least, but very small. I'd rather pay $30 for a decent piece than $22 for a too small portion.  We enjoyed our meal but not enough to come back."}
{"text":"I had a great time here for a friend's birthday.  We had the tasting menu which came with a variety of sides and just a huge portion and variety of meat. The collard greens were awesome and the brisket was like butter melting in your mouth. We split a few bottles of Malbec which paired really well with the meat-heavy meal. Awesome vibe inside, very lively, I would recommend it for almost any occasion."}
{"text":"Came to Toronto on vacation with my brother.

This place seemed decent, brother recommended it after seeing it on yelp.
Very upscale restaurant with an accommodating bourbon/whiskey bar.

The three stars are allotted to the great selection in liquor, house mixed drinks and delicious appetizers.
I highly recommend the K.F.C (Korean fried cauliflower) and the shishito peppers.

As for the cons:
Entree itself was meh. We got the Pit Master Platter (ribs, brisket, and fried chicken). The meat itself was tender and perfect texture but lacked flavor. Required sauce to accompany it. Personally I would have a flavorful meat and add sauce sparingly if needed. 

And lastly, service was pretty spotty. As great at the drinks were, they arrived pretty late. Our server never came back to check on us until we were done eating. My brother was hoping to get more BBQ sauce.

Overall decent experience"}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming one of my favourites. Particularly their drinks. Although, I'm not sure the potions for the food quite match the $$. If you're unsure start with the Late Night Menu. At $5 for a selection of snacks you can't go wrong. Or check out their other specials throughout the week."}
{"text":"The good of Carbon Bar:

1. The decor. It's very modern and chic. The ceilings are HIGH. Big fan of the high end feel.
2. The food! We ordered the meat plate. It's literally a huge plate of meat. Delicious and I believe it's what most people go for.
3. The vibe. It's a very young crowd, mostly business people, but there is a bit of everyone in there each night.

The bad of Carbon Bar:

1. The prices. Although it's not the most expensive resto on the block (here's looking at you George), I do find the prices are a bit much.
2. The service. While we didn't have bad service by any means, our waitress was just OK. She wasn't overly friendly or attentive. However, the service at the door is impeccable (coat check, seating service).

Overall I would recommend going to Carbon Bar for a special occasion, trying a huge plate of meat and just enjoying the atmosphere.

Bon apetite!"}
{"text":"Came here this past weekend for drink for my friends birthday. 
We were all delightfully surprised to say the least. 

We were a group of about 10 people. The birthday boy had called in advance to make a reservation and he was told that it wasn't necessary for drinks and that we could just show up and we would get a nice small area to the side. That we did! 

They offer free coat check as you walk in so you don't have to carry your bulky winter jackets into the restaurant. 

As you walk in there are two sides. The dining portion to the left and the bar section the right. Both areas seemed like you could order from the full menu. 

The decor was dark and very modern. A lot of clean lines and high ceilings which make it a very open space. 

The service here was great from start to finish. From the person who received us to the bartender who ordered our initial drinks, to the waiter who served us when we sat near the bar.

Washrooms were spacious and clean and offered comfort. 

The crowd was great, not too crowded where you cannot hear yourself, noise level was perfect for a conversation. 

Overall, excellent service. 

I would definitely come here again to try the food menu."}
{"text":"Wow what a cool spot!

Just after walking in there is an awesome ambiance with the high ceilings and modern decor.  Service is very friendly.  And I heard that Electric Circus used to have some events here (for those of you who can remember what that was all about!)

It was a Thursday evening and we were a group of 8.  We opted for sharesies!  So ordered a few appetizers and platters. 

The KFC (Korean fried cauliflower) was recommended as the best item so we had 2 and it was pretty darn good!! Would definately try them again.  Also got the Creole Croquettes which are pulled pork, sweet potato and beef battered and fried with a nice dijon sauce for dipping.  Also really good, they were so soft and creamy inside while crispy on the outside.

Finally the mains! A couple of fishmonger platters and the big meat platter (can't recall the name) for 5.  This was more than enough for everyone as we struggled to consume the final morsels.  I'm not a seafood guy but tried the salmon,  and apparently the oysters and mussels were amazing! Maybe next time... lol. Then there was soft and juicy beef brisket, fall off the bone pork ribs, and buttermilk fried chicken!! A meat lovers delight.  Everything was very good.

Drinks were good as well but that's fairly standard.. so all in all I would say this is a gem of a spot.  Not cheap but a good indulgence, mmm.  I do recommend."}
{"text":"Was here to celebrate a birthday and had such a great time. The food was amazing! Definitely try the platter where you get fried chicken, brisket etc. Their burger is also very tasty-still not as amazing as Parts & Labor though! The Chimichurri Steak is just OK...the Stockyards is a much better option if you're looking to try this. Servers were just a bit difficult to work with...we had brought a cake and candles in and were aware of the slicing fee, however we had to remind them we brought one in, and our candles didn't come on our cake! Lol 
Besides that I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a few drinks for happy hot and was very pleased with the menu and the drinks! It was a little pricier than we were hoping for but the gin and tonic I had was great! The service was very pleasant too. When we sat down we were given two complimentary empanadas with a really good guac and sour cream to go with them.   The gin and tonic was $8 and they had $5 wine and bud light specials. Happy hour goes from 5-7!"}
{"text":"Dinner

Overall: 3.5/5

Service: 4.5/5 super friendly and warm

Ambience: 4/5 plenty of space for all, no elbow to elbow dining

Corkage: Yes 30$ a bottle

Food: Brisket was great, and so was a desert dish. Rest was forgettable ( e.g. ribs, octopus) to good.

Repeat: no"}
{"text":"Remarkable decor and style. Bar area is also fantastically designed and quite cool.  Unfortunately, the food greatly disappointed. 

Drinks:

Heart of Gold - too rich but overall fairly smooth (3.5/5)

Appetizers/Sides:

Chicken Skins - interesting and somewhat tastyl hard to dip into the dipping sauce given the consistency of the skins (3/5);

Kale Caesar - quite nice if a tad bland (3.5/5);

Hot Mess - nice idea, but execution was not great (curds were melted rather than curdy/rubbery) (3/5)

Main:

Pulled Pork Ssam - I was very excited about this but came away disappointed.  The pork was very tender and fairly juicy, but really lacked flavouring.  The mixins also underwhelmed:  the pickled cabbage lacked a real bite, and the other accompaniments added no flavour to what was already a plate that lacked in flavour (2.5/5)

Dessert:

Banana Toffee Cream Pie - very tasty and nice chunks of banana in it. It was also topped with dark chocolate which would have been nice to have known about.  Like everything else on the menu, it sounded better than it tasted; still, this was an impressive dessert (4/5)

Service:

Very attentive if a bit overbearing (4/5)"}
{"text":"Nice place on Queen street to grab a few drinks with friends in the evening (or day if needed)

Food: They had these really good beach angle oysters (Diana's Seafood doesn't carry them) and we had their hamachi poke (meh), KFC - Korean Fried Cauliflower (deep fried cauliflower with korean sauce - meh), burnt ends were good BUT their ribs were amazing. Fall off the bone soft, tender perfectly seasoned ribs.

Drink: They serve two types of old fashioned - the regular one and the smoked one. I tried both but prefer the regular one (smoked one is really smoky if that makes sense)

Atmosphere: Lovely place to hang out, comfortable seats, not too noisy so you can still hear your friends.

Service: Really friendly bunch of people and helpful when deciding on food/drinks 

Would come back for more ribs!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience. From making the reservation to the moment we left- great service from the entire carbon bar staff. I made a reso a month in advance for 8 people, and had to make it 9 just a few days before my reservation. Carbon bar usually has a deposit for groups of 9 but they made the exception for me & also patiently answered the multiple questions I had via phone. They also gave me a heads up a couple of days before the dinner that they needed the table back by 9pm, which is something I appreciate because I've had restos (high end) tell me when I walk through the door that I have 30 minutes to eat because of another reservation. Terrible. It was a surprise party for my boyfriend, they of course allowed me to bring some decor & open gifts there. The food was AMAZING, definitely recommend the brisket and burger. I would stray away from the seafood platter, I'm hesitant to justify the price because you don't get that much and it's 35$ per person. However everything else was amazing and my entire party was more than satisfied. Also, the team service of carbon bar excelled my expectations especially because I feel like not a lot of restos put emphasis on team service/hospitality. As a person in the industry myself- I know good service. And carbon bar gave me just that. Would definitely recommend and can't wait to bring more people here."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour from 4-6 and got a free snack and $5 5oz glass of wine (normally $8) and we sat at the bar. Also got the free bar snack from yelp and chose yuca fries. Both the fries and the free snack were delicious! Great happy hour spot, highly recommended. Also gorgeous decor."}
{"text":"the food here was delicious! I was disappointed with the service as I told the server I was a vegetarian and I still got served a dish with beef."}
{"text":"Something you would expect on King West but got at Queen & Church.  High ceilings, great artwork, totally funky.  The food was incredible and the service the same.  Would not hestitate for one second to go back - possibly my new 'go to' place.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a great meal at carbon bar. Service was excellent and the space and vibe make for a great night out. Particularly enjoyed the kfc and brisket. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We were seated fairly quickly. A beautiful
Atmosphere and dining area. Our server took forever to get our drink orders, and even longer to have it delivered.

We had the pit master platter. Meat was dry and overcooked. BBQ sauce was just all right. My boyfriend also ordered a meal with hen eggs that looked interesting, but the meat was also dry. Maybe the chefs back there weren't watching their meat and just overcoming everything. Our server didn't come back to check on us so we couldn't tell her about it. We are half of everything cos we were so hungry. But it definitely was not worth the money spent.

Would come back here for drinks but not for food. Bar B Q is much better for quality and pricing"}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered the bbq pork belly appetizer, the pit platter for 2 people, and a side of collard greens.  The bbq pork belly appetizer was fantastic as the pork belly was cooked beautifully and the crackling added a really nice touch to the dish.  But the serving size was so tiny to the point where I balked at how much it cost us ($15).  

The pit platter was nice.  It came with fried chicken, beef brisket, and pork side ribs along with dill pickles and fries.  The fries were fantastically crispy while the dill pickles were fresh and crunchy.  The highlight of the meal was the beef brisket as it was maybe the most tender beef brisket I had ever tried.  The ribs were fantastic too as they were beautifully meaty and tender.  The fried chicken on the other hand was very forgettable.  The collard greens were fine but the amount of butter they added to the dish was overkill to the point where I found it a challenge to eat after a few bites.

While the food for the most part was fine, I didn't think it was worth the price that we had paid (with tax and tip, it cost us well over $100).  But if you have money to burn, then I'd probably recommend it."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service.

Check the menu before you go because can be challenging for picky eaters. 

Make sure to make reservations.

Nothing bad to say about this place"}
{"text":"I went with a group of about 9 people yesterday for my birthday. This restaurant is impressive from the moment you walk in until the end. 

The ambience is funky, clean and classy. The seating was spacious and comfortable.

The service was perfect. We had Jae (I believe that was his name), who couldn't do enough for us. I felt bad as some of my guests had a few too many and may have bothered him a bit...he was a great sport and accommodated us in every way possible. 

The food was absolutely delicious!!! Flavour, quality and selection were all amazing. I personally had the ribs ...they were fall off the bone perfection. Others shared the combination platter which was huge and they enjoyed it. I also recommend the cauliflower bites (spicy Korean style)...they tasted like spicy chicken bites. 

Overall, I would definitely return and recommend The Carbon Bar to friends and family. It's the perfect space to go with a group."}
{"text":"I'm gonna get straight to it. I came over to the great north from Chicago to visit my friends and they brought me here for brunch.

I had the the Brisket Benny and I honestly mean it when I say this - it was one of the best individual entrees of food I have ever had. It was perfection. Soft where needed, crunchy when needed. Meat well seasoned - eggs perfect. A MUST have."}
{"text":"Amazing for carnivores ... delicious!!!!
Will definitely come back and next time I'll be sure to come empty stomach because the portions are large. 

Shared the platter for four people and we had leftovers. 


Great interior design and energy. 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for a few cocktail drinks around 10PM on a Saturday. We had a big group and called ahead to make sure it was okay.

The staff here provided us with complimentary coat check and got us a table in the bar area. We had several people attending to us and a manager come up just to make sure everything was fine. The service is just spectacular.

The decor is another highlight of this bar. Everything from the brick walls to the giant round balls of light hanging from the ceiling make Carbon Bar unique. Washrooms were well renovated and spacious and had several of us talking about them.

Drinks here are delicious but a tad pricier than a regular Toronto cocktail. I'll have to come back for dinner soon."}
{"text":"in from SF and sat at the bar to eat and drink... great burger, excellent manhattan, and great bar service."}
{"text":"We spent Easter brunch there and even though we were more than 20 minutes late for our reservation, they couldn't have been more accommodating! When we apologized, they replied with, it's Sunday, no apology needed! The service was exceptional and the food was amazing. They were out of bacon so the server suggested I try the pulled pork with my pancakes. At first, I wasn't sure, but it was heaven! If you are considering going, do it!"}
{"text":"If you like meat, this is the place for you! Had a boys night out on Saturday night. We ordered the meat platter and extra sides to share. The food was delicious but heavy in protein. You need extra side dishes to break up the monotony of meat. It can get boring after a few bites. They have a good solid beer and wine menu. Not extensive, but there's something on it for everyone. The bar area is always busy, great place to hang out after dinner for a nightcap."}
{"text":"If I could use one word to describe this place, it would be YUM.

Being greeted at the door with our coats being put into a coat check, it was immediately inviting.

Once you step into the restaurant it's self, it's very alive, vibrant. There's a bustle around the joint and you can't help but feel pretty cool for being a part of it. It's spacious with high ceilings and you don't feel like you are sitting on each other's laps

alright, now the food, We had the Chicken skins to start... I could have eaten a bucket of just that.. it was ridiculous. Cheese Croquettes, Sea Scallops oh my. They were both ridiculously good.

The main course we had was the Pit Master Platter. It was best platter of meat a girl could ask for. We completed it with the hot mess, fries and collard greens. Yum yum.

Last but not least, we had the banana toffee cream pie which I can only describe as the best thing that's ever been on a spoon. 

Overall, well done Carbon Bar. I cannot wait for my next meal."}
{"text":"Food was really good, but kinda pricy. Had a great time with my friends at the restaurant. Great service!"}
{"text":"This place is ah-may-ZING!!! 

A must come at least once! The food here is great,
The servers, Surprisingly even better!"}
{"text":"I don't usually care too much about the decor but this place with its 30 ft ceilings defnly impressed me.  BBQ platter was delicious as well as ceviche & fried smelt. Cheddar ice cream sandwich was unique.

Only qualm is the dinner was quite $$$$. But we'll  be back once we've saved up enough."}
{"text":"Ideal place to enjoy BBQ cuisine.
Service is really good, the menu is offering many options. Food is amazing. Don't hesitate to ask for recommendations!
Definitely a must!"}
{"text":"We came here for winterlicious and were very impressed! Firstly the portions for a set menu were very generous and the quality was excellent. We didn't feel rushed like we have at other winterlicious restaurants.

I had the tacos to start which were very good, followed by the ribs and brisket which was the absolute star - tender and delicious! Finally the brownie was warm and rich and the perfect end to an excellent dinner.

My only complaint was that we ordered a side of chips and I didn't see much value for the $7 price!

Otherwise phenomenal, great vibe, good prices and lovely staff!"}
{"text":"I went to the carbon bar on a Saturday night at 8 pm with a friend. We had a reservation but the place wasn't full.

We both loved the high ceilings and how spacious it is. The noise level was not too high. The music was just loud enough to talk over without having to shout.

The service started out slow but quickened as the night progressed. 

We had:
Mexican street corn - 3/5. I liked that it was coated with corn nuts , but I would have liked a bit more spice. Also the corn was slightly over done.

Ribs 5/5 omg these were delicious! They practically fell off the bone and had a delicious smokey flavour.  There were 6 ribs with coleslaw and pickle in the order. We each had an order to ourself. We would have loved to try out a side but this was enough food for the 2 of us.

There was a pecan pie that looked amazing but we were too full for desert! 

I can't wait to return and have the seafood platter and some oysters. 

I recommend the carbon bar for large groups as you might get more out of it if you share."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I was blown away by a restaurant and Carbon Bar did just that.
 Thank you!!!  The food was awesome , fresh and really well made. The service from the hostess , to our server to the bus boys. This was really one of the best dinning service I have ever recieved in quite a while. Ample Parking near this restaurant , you can park on the side or there is a parking lot literally across the street for $7.00 for 2 hours. The ambience and decor was trendy yet sexy perfect for date night , dinner with friends or meeting Bae's parents."}
{"text":"Great and creative drinks, wonderful food (specially the meat - we ordered the master pit plater) and superb service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very fun and vibrant spot with tasty food and attentive service. We arrived about a half hour before our reservation (make one) and sat at the bar. Delicious and unique cocktails - especially the black margaritas!!we ordered the BBQ pork croquettes and they were also yummy. We asked if we could sit in the bar area if a table came up. The host, perhaps manager, was very attentive and kept us posted about when our table would be ready. It was going to be a little after out original reservation, and he surprised us with two more snacks: the chicken skins and popcorn (both good). Little gestures like that really impress me! 
There were four of us and we started with the Carbon Platter of seafood. It was perfect and included lobster, crab legs, clams and oysters. Even though we could have easily stopped there, we ordered the Pit Master Platter too. The waitress suggested we order for 3 instead of 4 since we were already filling up - great suggestion. They serve the sauces in the side which we liked. We took the leftovers home, even ordering the platter for 2 would have been plenty. We saw others order the desserts and they looked wonderful. 
This seems to be an awesome spot for groups of any size and their platters contribute to a relaxed and fun ambiance. It's not loud but it is \"active\" - not a romantic choice but fun date night: yes. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations coming here as this is a spawn from Nota Bene.  Recently opened, the restaurant is still relatively quiet.  I stopped off here on a Tuesday evening and we were essentially the only people in the dining room at 6pm (it was about half full by the time we left).  The restaurant is massive on the inside - the ceilings have to be 30ft high.  Ambiance has a modern but classy open-concept feel to it and there is a large bar by the entrance.

We settled on the pitmaster after a recommendation from our pleasant waitress and the collard greens and pork & beans as sides.  The pitmaster is a sharing plate for two people that has their in-house smoked ribs, brisket, pulled pork and sausage with two sauces.  Highly recommended.  The best part of this plate is the ribs which taste like they came right off a camp fire.  I could easily eat a whole rack of these.  The other meats were tender and well smoked.  The sauces were tangy, but did not take the smoked taste away.  I was surprisingly stuffed after this.  The two sides were good, but nothing special.  I'd say they need to add a bit more selection here (the other selections were fries or coleslaw - pretty bland).  They also have a decent liqour and wine selection, which was no surprise given the Nota Bene roots.  I tried the feature smokin manhattan.  This was a nice spin on the traditional manhattan with dark gourmet maraschino cherry and a smokey flavour which went well with the food.

The appetizers look great, but I had to make it a relatively quick dinner as we had a game to catch.  Service was top notch - friendly and helpful.  It's a bit off the beaten path (a stones throw away from moss park), but I'd definitely return here."}
{"text":"We love the food, the service, and the environment.our host was really nice and she answered all of our questions. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very high ceiling! Very spacious.

Staff was nice. Consider the number of people we came (12ppl), it was impressive how they were able to handle our request, our order and most importantly, separate bills!

The food was pretty good. I ordered the ribs and it was delicious. The ribs simply fall out of the bone nicely. Also, for drink I highly recommend their pit-fire old fashioned. You will definitely able to experience the pit-fire taste. 

The ambience is quite nice. They dim down the restaurant and had top 40 music. The music wasn't too loud that it overpowers our voice. There is also a section of the restaurant with a bar. You can just go there and watch sports (there are three TVs)."}
{"text":"came on a Monday at 530. The hostess took our coats so we didnt have to sit with them (free coatcheck) The venue is really nice, good for any occasion. Food was a bit pricy but well worth it. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich which was the special and it was good! all the desserts are great too. Good selection of drinks, and they noe have a lunch menu and a lot of specials. Will def go back."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!  I love a good bbq and I'm so glad it's here at Carbon Bar. We had the pit master platter for the five of us, plus apps to share. The BBQ sauce was oh the side which is the way that I like it, rather than completely slathered over the meat.

The atmosphere is classy, loud and can be intimate if you got seated at one of their circular booths. Even though the place is huge, the semi-enclosed feel of the booth is quite conducive to group conversation. It's quite the juxtaposition - a 'nicer' city BBQ place."}
{"text":"The mushroom and grits were kind of disgusting... decent at first bite but then you have these gross after-burps for hours!! the service is great, very attentive but the food is lack lustre."}
{"text":"Food:

Got the seafood & meat platter to share between 2. Imo it wasn't as good, you get very little for what you are paying. 

Venue:

Nice place to hang out over a few drinks."}
{"text":"They were out of pork tacos, so they subbed for brisket. It was dry, so I'd recommend the burnt ends instead. Ceviche was delicious, fresh, and cold. Steak tartare was standard. Mac and cheese was good for a few bites, good fit sharing between 4-5 people. Roasted cauliflower and KFC were really good veg dishes as well."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday last fall but just came across my pictures of the food recently and remembered how much I liked the place.

In terms of atmosphere it's a bit on the classier side. There's a coat check and most people are dressed very well put together (i.e. no jeans and t-shirts). It's a bit dimmer but the inside decor is very nice. The service was pretty great. We were checked on fairly often and food and bills all came fast.

But the food is the real star of this place. We got the Pit Master Platter to share which was a pretty great way to get to try a lot of the items on the menu. This platter comes with pork ribs, beef brisket, buttermilk fried chicken, coleslaw, pickles, fries & chipotle mayo. The chicken was tender and incredibly flavorful, I'd go back just for that. The ribs were saucy and perfect. The only miss for me was the beef brisket which I found a bit chewy. We also ordered a bunch of the snacks and \"fixin's\" including the K.F.C (Korean Fried Cauliflower), the cornbread (which was amazing), the TCB slaw and the mac & cheese. Because it was a birthday celebration we got some icecream too which was pretty decent."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food, service, and ambiance at The Carbon Bar. We decided to go with The Carbon Bar Experience, which is basically a $65/person tasting menu served family style. Everything was really good, but my favourite bites were their Korean fried cauliflower and pecan tart. It was plenty of food and obviously heavy on the meat. If you're a meat or bbq lover, I highly recommend getting The Carbon Bar Experience."}
{"text":"Great food and service - decor is odd, not sure if they're trying to be a high end BBQ place or sports bar"}
{"text":"This place is the best for ambiance, service and deliciously lip smacking good food.  Get the brisket, KFC, Mac and cheese, corn bread and the Petite Sirah!!! They also have corkage.  Bar staff is so nice and it is always an adventure happening when I go here.  And the best news is that they are now open for brunch!!?!?  So excited and happy!!!"}
{"text":"I've been pacing past the Carbon Bar daily since I started a new job just east of Jarvis, so was totally tickled when a friend suggested it for a post work beverage. Being a Friday, this turned into three eight oz. glasses of wine a piece - but independent of that, I left feeling decent enough about the place. 

Caveat, I sat at the bar - but the rest of the place looks absolutely lush. It's sexy. That's kind of the best word for it. Big (BIG) booths would likely need to be reserved for dinner at this point in time looked incredibly comfy and I'm looking forward to returning for supper in the near future.

The bartenders were attentive and top notch, pleasant and genuinely complimentary and excited about the restaurant itself. The hosts were very friendly when I entered and checked not only my parka - but my positively massive gym bag, which I appreciated very much. 

Important to know: it's owned by the guy that owns Nota Bene - which might just be my favourite restaurant in Toronto - so be prepared for potentially modest portions that, however, will likely taste amazing. The service definitely feels just as considered, so I'd be willing to bet this place will have staying power."}
{"text":"Went to the Carbon Bar for brunch today and the food was fantastic! I had the smoked brisket benny and it was delicious.  Eggs were perfectly poached,  the hollandaise sauce was really good, the brisket was really tender,  the cabbage slaw complimented the flavours, and that biscuit it was all on was soooooo good. My husband had the bacon cheeseburger and that was a hit too. The beef patty and all the fixings made for a great burger. The fries were crispy and flavourful. Will definitely go back for dinner next time."}
{"text":"Everything we tried was amazing, which included: meat platter, chicken skins, banana toffee pie, and cheddar ice cream sandwich! One of the best meals I've had in my life!"}
{"text":"Getting to know Toronto in two days was not hard at all... We were excited for the food scene. We definitely Yelped this place and we were not disappointed. It had tall ceilings with interesting light fixtures and very nice staff. We were seated immediately for dinner by the window  and bar side. For their drink originals we order a refreshing Wild Tennessee Mule and Pit Master Platter that offered pork ribs, beef brisket, buttermilk fried chicken, pickles, fried & chipotle mayo with sides of BBQ sauce. I don't believe we were given our slaw. We were told to eat the brisket first, pork ribs and than the chicken last!! Everything was on point with service and the melt in your mouth brisket and fall apart pork ribs. We were in BBQ Heaven. My only one thing my husband and I would add was that it was lacking flavor or spices to the rub. So glad we checked this spot out!! Melissa was our server and she was so sweet and gave us suggestion to different places in the city!!"}
{"text":"The Carbon Bar (TCB), is the newest venture from the same owners as Nota Bene.  Quality food is what these two restaurant have in common;  Nota Bene serves up haute cuisine and TCB serves up \"haute\"  Southern cuisine with a more casual and fun vibe.

The restaurant is located at Queen + Church; it has housed Electric Circus and was also once a Disney rehearsal studio.  Remnants from its predecessors take form of a neon light beaming the word Electric and some Donald Duck figurines as well as sound boards, which serve as wall décor where the washrooms are located.  

The overall look and feel of the place is that of a vintage diner, with burgundy colored booth seats that fill the open space.  The open kitchen draws much attention as does the bar which are at opposite extremes of the restaurant.  If you raise your head slightly, you'll see an elevated platform/balcony that is reminiscent of where the banker sits à la \"Deal or No Deal\" - that's where the 30-seater private dining area is.  Plenty of privacy.


Executive chef David Lee is seen mentoring his staff hands-on while the abundance of serving staff trickle in and out of the kitchen like a colony of ants.

IMG_2101 (480x640)The wine list by the glass is regrettably short, but solid.  Wine by the bottle comes in three tier pricing ($39, $59 and $79).  There's a good mix of import versus domestic.  There are also currently 8 beers on tap.    We opt for the cocktail list and decide on two Carbon originals (nice juxtaposition of words here) - the Deal Closer ($14), a tequila-infused concoction with campari, cardamom and ginger beer  and the Risk and Reward ($14), a mix of spiced rum, Aperol + Amaro Montenegro.


We opt for the Crisp Chicken Skins ($6) for the same reason why I love chicken wings - the fat is in the skin which = flavor!  These dehydrated crisps unfortunately do not have the same allure and are pretty bland on their own.  Thank God for the sweet chili vinegar?  Not so much - it too does not provide the flavor boost I so desperately wanted either.

Redemption is found in this Cabrito Papusa ($13), tender goat meat stuffed in a masa tortilla,
with tomatillo salsa + guajillo date jus.  The masa tortilla knocked it out of the park as it was crispy and light (almost reminiscent of the texture of a deep-fried taro dumpling you get at dim sum).  One of my favorite dishes of the night.

The kitchen then sends out the Hamachi ($14) on the house, a tartare with clementine, pear, kombucha vinegar and little Peruvian red peppers (Gandules) which add a splash of color to brighten up the whole dish.  The sweetness from the fruits and peppers are a great contrast, both texturally and flavor-wise.

For mains we opt for the Pork Ribs ($18) - the simplest test of whether or not you need to try anything else from the pit.  The pink smoke ring seems promising, and the texture is spot on (albeit being greasy).  Flavor-wise however, the ribs are lacking and the overly tangy sauce doesn't come to the rescue.

From the à la carte sides we order the signature TCB Slaw ($6) topped with corn nuts which was genius!  Not overly dressed and very refreshing.  We also order the \"Hot Mess\" ($11), a sweet potato topped with cheese curds, crema, chopped brisket and pickled jalapeno - the rather bland crema overwhelms most of the flavor and my mind starts wandering to thoughts of a loaded baked potato.

The kitchen again, sends out another dish, this time, a sample of the Goat Ribs ($18), which are usually only available on Fridays.  The goat ribs just look intimidating, garnering fears of meat sweats to ensue but no worries, but it's just the sheer size of the bones that carry on the illusion.  Once you bite into it, it kind of makes you wish that the illusion was fake as it is extremely tender and juicy and for me, even better than the pork ribs.

We then feast on the Oak Fired Octopus ($21), a gumbo unlike any other.  While most gumbos I've encountered are a brownish bowl often imperceptible and slimy, you can see  the chunks of lobster sausage, and hominy corn.  And the okra isn't slimy at all.  Definitely a winner.

We muster up the stomach space for dessert and decide to forego the ice-cream themed goodies for the Banana Toffee Cream Pie ($12) which feeds 2.  I love bananas, but this pie just fell short of expectations.  The cream to banana ratio was largely skewed and if there was any toffee in the pie it was drowned out in the bubble bath of cream that covered the pie.  It should've been more aptly labelled - cream pie.

Not comparing apples to oranges, I enjoyed TCB much better than Nota Bene.  I can just let down my hair and have fun here and the menu is much more exciting!"}
{"text":"Don't let the sketchy neighbourhood fool you. Inside is a very funky and cool space. I had the burnt ends and a tomato and goat cheese salad.  My dinner partner had the hangar steak and we shared a corn bread. The burnt ends were crispy on the outside and moist in the middle.  They used heirloom tomatoes in the salad and they were to die for.  The corn bread was warm and fresh and outstanding.  The hangar steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and so flavourful.  The kimchi potatoes were a perfect side. My first 5 star rating.  I will be back. Soon!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday with a friend for brunch and had a couple of things to share. We are both super indecisive people, so we took it upon ourselves to look at the menu beforehand to speed up the process, which usually takes over 15 minutes and servers coming to check on us multiple times haha. 

- Brisket: expected a huge platter for $25, but smaller than expected. That said, it was very filling (meat is heavy), and the brisket was melt-in-your-mouth soft, no dryness whatsoever! The sauces that accompanied the brisket were also quite unique - some espresso flavour that had an interesting taste.
- Hueveros Ranchos: this was a skillet of spicy pork, black bean, fried egg, and taco shells. I think this dish was pretty normal, nothing too standout (not like the brisket!). It also came with some Pico de gallo, which was good - I normally don't like tomatoes, but I liked these.

Carbon Bar was definitely a great BBQ-centric brunch to start off the Sunday food adventures!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it never disappoints. Great food with friendly staff. Great place to hangout with some good and drinks. I would say.. one of the best old fashions I've had in the city is right here at Carbon Bar. I would highly recommend the platter if you have a party of three or more, along with one or two apps."}
{"text":"Loved the spot
Good venue and experience
Great drinks, cocktails
We went few months back so dont rem the food tbh
But deftly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Decided to visit for date night based on other Yelp reviews and glad we did! Place was bustling for a Thursday night. We didn't have a reservation but they managed to seat us after a 20 minute wait during prime dinner time. They text you when your table is ready so you're free to go explore other nearby shops. I love places that do that!

Ordered K.F.C. (FYI If it's your first check in you can redeem a free bar snack with purchase of drink) and Hamachi Ceviche to start. KFC definitely lives up to the hype on yelp! Crispy and packed full of that sweet/Sour korean sauce flavor. My boyfriend dislikes cauliflower but he had no issues munching on it.

The Hamachi Ceviche was beautifully presented. The tastes of lime, avocado, and oil all worked really well and fish tasted fresh.

We ordered the Pit Master platter to share for 2 and it was so much meat! Standouts were the buttermilk fried chicken and the brisket. Neither of us were huge fans of the ribs.  They weren't terrible but didn't shine like the rest. I found the meat to be on the saltier side. 

Too full for dessert but the menu options looked quite tempting. Perhaps on a future visit I'll save room so I can try the dessert

Service was exceptional. Changed our plates and utensils after appetizers and wiped the table. Came by regularly to refill water."}
{"text":"The Carbon Bar is a Southern-inspired restaurant. The venue of the restaurant is gorgeous. The dining room is modern, simple, industrial and yet upscale - it is very well designed. The service is attentive.

I came here for brunch and it was a treat. I started with sampling some pastries. The pastries were fresh and absolutely delicious.  A great way to start the meal.

For a main, I ordered the Chicken 'N' Waffles. This is one of my favourite dishes for brunch. Carbon Bar shines with this dish of culinary art.  The waffle was light and fluffy and pairs well with the savoury buttermilk fried chicken. The citrus crema has notes of chili, honey, and garlic, and really makes this dish a favourite.

I would highly recommend Carbon Bar. While the prices are on the higher end, it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Came in with a girl friend, the hosts looked at us and dismissed us, telling us it would be at least a half hour wait for a table for two. We asked if we could wait by the bar and they discouraged us, saying the bar was first come, first served and there wasn't any room. When we walked in, we saw at least eight open tables in the dining room and bar, only one of which had a reserved sign on it. There was plenty of room to stand at the bar but we left without spending any money because of the crappy attitude of the staff."}
{"text":"My initial experience at the Carbon Bar left me a little disappointed, however, reviews left me wanting to give it another shot. Again,I was disappointed.

Call and make a reservation or you will wait. The hostess was very snobby. I felt very rushed when I asked questions about the food, and she had a tone that was short and just rude.. 
**Tip - don't become a hostess if you don't want to answer phones / deal with people.**

Moving on to the arrival...  The decor is way cool, it's a dark hallway, leading up to a hostess stand... The girls were chit chatting and one let out a friendly hello when I finally got to the front. The other one with bangs was just so rude. I'm assuming this is who I spoke with while booking the reservation.
\"Reservation? NAME...???\" and then she bossed the other girls around and told them where to take me. I was finally glad to just get in and not have to deal with the terrible teenager they put at the front.

The atmosphere is busy and fun, the bar area is great for grabbing drinks while you wait for the rest of your group (happened first time) but I was glad we were all together and could just sit down and eat. 

When walking through the restaurant you can smell awesome food from the open kitchen at the end of the room and fun music is always playing, a bit loud but by the end of it all, you kind of get used to it.
Our server was quick, and super friendly. We had water on our table almost right away, and she, again, was just so nice! She answered all of our questions with patience, allowed us to take time with drinks and chit chatting, we never felt rushed to order, and she was never gone for too long, but didn't hover over us... A perfect server - definitely has experience!!

Unfortunately the tables are all really close together, trying to cram everyone in because they are pretty busy most of the time, but I knocked elbows with the guy beside me more than a few times... THAT close. 

Food wasn't anything to go crazy over which is unfortunate considering all of the hype. Not a lot of meat, verrryy small portions. It's all very pricy. I'm not a major foodie, but I know this wasn't all it was cracked up to be.
I had a good night, but I think that was mostly the drinks (very good, I must say) and atmosphere.
Overall, a drab and taxing experience. 

It sucks about the awful customer service at the front (if managers are reading this, seriously, handle that), but that really did it for me. The food was not exciting enough to expand on in this review. Wasn't terrible, just not exciting and we left hungry...
I'd give our server 5 stars and 5 to the bartender for making awesome drinks, but everything else was just blah.

Not recommending, not going back."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience here this past weekend. I was here with my BFF for my birthday dinner, I've never been here before so it was my first time and I knew that The Carbon Bar specializes in bbq food.

We first started off with the seafood platter $59 (sorry, I don't remember what the actually name was called) but it came with a few clams, mussels, oysters, smoked salmon, shrimp and some type of fish. The seafood platter was delicious, so I'd recommend that. Our main was the Pit Master Platter $30 each person (it is priced per person), and it came with beef brisket, fried chicken and ribs. IMO, I think this was the star of our dinner lol. The meat on the ribs were cooked perfectly that it just slid of the bone. Everything on that platter was absolutely delicious. 

Aside from that, we had an fantastic server! Her name was Leah, she was our server and our bartender. My bff ordered a drink and turned out she didn't quite like it and Leah was more than happy to make her another drink. Also, at the end of our meal, Leah gave us free shots after hearing that it was my birthday! Super sweet of her and she even drew little balloons on my takeout bag! She also mentioned it was her birthday next week too, so if you're reading this Leah..thank you soo much and I hope you have a wonderful birthday!

Overall, great service and great food..the reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it is overpriced. But this would be a great place to come to for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night at 8 pm and the place was packed, so we ended up sitting at the bar and ordering dinner there. 

Very cool ambiance, high ceilings and nice decor. The vibe here is great for date night or a night out with the girls.

We started off with the frog legs, which had a Cajun twist to them and were perfectly fried and salted, with the perfect slaw to balance the taste. We also ordered the platter with beef brisket, ribs, and fried chicken - MAKE SURE YOU ORDER THIS, you won't regret it.

Service was very friendly and helpful. Drinks are good and the bartenders were interactive and were extremely patient in figuring out what 'my' kind of drink was."}
{"text":"Their menu can be kind of limited depending on when you go but every item is a specialty. It's expensive but for the once and a while lunch it's a good choice."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at The Carbon Bar! We had the Summerlicious menu and I enjoyed my meal and my friends enjoyed theirs. The service was impeccable! I always drink a lot during the day and throughout dinner when I go out, and my water glass was always refilled for me before I could even reach for the carafe. The servers were also super friendly and nice! I recommended this place to other friends and I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"My partner summed it up perfectly: 

Barbecue for girls.

Do you want a small-ish plate of adequate barbecue in a lovely setting? Do you want to over pay for the experience? 

Look no further than Carbon - a restaurant where you can save your daily food calories for drinking."}
{"text":"These are the best ribs I've had in Toronto.   Why order anything else?  Well... because the beef brisket is even better. 

Welcoming service and fantastic bar environment.   Erin took great care of me. 

Eclectic cocktail list, well prepared."}
{"text":"The Carbon Bar is quite a trendy place to go for dinner and drinks. It is very spacious and can even accommodate large groups of people, as they have a private room in the back that overlooks the entire restaurant! I went with a large group of friends so I was able to try quite a bit of their menu.

To start, we had the Shishito peppers, tuna tartare, and frog legs. All had their unique flavours and wouldn't say I was disappointed with any. We then had a salad which was average. It's a salad...For the main, we had the Pit Master Platter. I was pleasantly surprised how juicy the fried chicken was. The beef brisket and pork ribs were both good as the meat fell right off the ribs. To finish the night off, we had the Banana Toffee cream pie which was sweet but not too sweet. I enjoyed it even though I'm not too big of a fan of banana.

Overall, this place is had great service and good food. It is a bit on the pricier side considering the type of food it is, but its worth it if you don't want to be disappointed with anything.

{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with one of my friends to catch up over some good food. The atmosphere was pretty awesome, I loved the high ceilings and the mosaic portraits on the walls. It was full of people but not too loud, which is always nice. We ordered the pit master platter (wonderful choice for meat lovers), corn bread, and the coleslaw. It was actually a lot of food and we struggled to finish everything! The brisket and ribs were my ultimate favourite - both were super tender and very tasty. The corn bread was different from what I'm used to (in a good way), definitely worth a try. The coleslaw was nothing special compared to everything else. We had a wonderful server that was very attentive and knowledgable. He even suggested for us to eat the brisket first because it gets a little chewy when it cools down (very good advice). If you're planning on coming on a weekend night, make sure you make reservations!"}
{"text":"We had a great time here last night! Friendly staff. Beautiful restaurant. Excellent service. 
We ordered the beat salad, KFC, the meat platter, Mac & cheese and the corn bread. 
Best beat salad I've ever had. Not what I expected. Their KFC blew my cauliflower wings out of the water. Best I've had. Meat platter was delicious. My favourite was the chicken. Loved the pickles too. Mac and cheese was excellent. Corn bread was good. I'm not a corn bread fan but I did have a piece and enjoyed it. 
I had the black margarita. It was strong. I liked it but one glass was enough for me. My boyfriend had the old fashioned. It was strong for me, but he loved it. My friend had the sangria and she raved about it. 
We all split a slice of cheesecake. It was so creamy and delicious. 
The bathrooms were really nice and clean. I honestly can't think of anything bad about this place. 
We will return."}
{"text":"Ate here a month ago while a friend visited from NYC. Thought we would go some place 'cool' on a Tuesday. Lol. The place had as much vibe for a Tuesday as you're gonna get. And it's a decent space. At first glance was tempted by lots on the menu. But then realised that's because it seemed the menu items all had the same main ingredients. Yes I get its a smokey bbq place. But why should almost everything be flavoured the same. By the time I left I was over it.  I'd say go for the try.  But I don't have a reason to go back.  The food was .. Average .. Our server was awesome. She would deserve two of the three stars I've given."}
{"text":"WOW! 

I went here on a Monday and was pleasantly surprised to find out that every Monday is 50% off bourbon and whiskey.  They had great drink suggestions, and were incredibly polite. 

Our server, who was A+, recommended the Pit Master Platter.  We added some mac and cheese, grits, and coleslaw.  Everything was cooked to perfection, and the presentation was fantastic.  

A great environment, and such a cool building.  They've really done a great job here. 

I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the KFC for starters and it was yummy!  Ordered the ribs which were just ok nothing extraordinary about them...however tried the beef brisket that a friend ordered and it was great should have ordered that! Restaurant decor was gorgeous and drinks were tasty."}
{"text":"So I booked this place to hold a retirement party, based on a recommendation of a coworker. I was very happy when they said they could accommodate 30 people on a Thursday night as several other places turned me down.
They put us in what is called the Green Room, a private room that had a balcony overlooking the restaurant. Although at first appearance, it seemed very small, it worked.We did a standing cocktail party and had all dishes off their canape menu.
Some of the dishes passed around: KFC(Korean Fried Cauliflower)....wholly YUM!!!! This was then followed by something called hamachi poke(something like Asian seasoned tuna on a stick...yum), popcorn chicken(they were huge, not the little morsels you're used to getting at Kentucky Fried Chicken). We also had deep fried mac and cheese balls...very tasty. I don't even eat mac and cheese  but after one bite I was hooked. My fave thing of the night was the ribs and the fresh oysters. My guests thoroughly enjoyed the infamous brisket. 
Overall, the food was great. Very flavorful, very tasty and filling.

Dessert was Chocolate Bourbon Skulls. Chocolate designed as skulls filled with bourbon cream. So yummy!!!!!

We had our own personal servers: Steve and Jay....amazing!!!! They were so accommodating and helpful...and very attentive!!!

Will definitely be going back there."}
{"text":"I arrived in Toronto late so I needed to find a place open after 10:00 that was relatively close to my hotel. The Carbon Bar fit the bill and had good reviews to boot. This place boasts themselves to be a BBQ place..errr...maybe I'm spoiled by the awesome BBQ places in Michigan but BBQ it is not at CB. 

I had a seat at the bar. I was initially ignored by the male bartender. Finally the female came over and gave me a menu. She was really nice and attentive. I got the pit fired BC salmon and a glass of red wine.

The food arrived after not long. The salmon was very tender but the flavor was rather non-existent. The \"asparagus\" was basically shavings with some lettuce mixed in. Lastly and the worst, was the \"fingerling potatoes\". Actually, there was one potato and it had clearly been cooked and cooled, then microwaved for my dinner. Potatoes don't taste right after they've been reheated and this was certainly the case. When you're charging $25 an entree, it should be well executed. 

I was still starving after eating my tiny piece of salmon, one potato and shaved asparagus so I got the candy bar. It's a higher price than what is listed on the website and while it was delicious, it was literally one bite. I could have eaten another additional meal after this meal, that's how little it filled me. I did consider the brisket but it seems as though they have no sauce they serve it with, at least that was my understanding. You have to have some house made sauces if you are going to serve brisket. 

Basically, this place is fine as a bar but as a restaurant, probably not the best food for the price."}
{"text":"Slightly off the beaten path from the downtown core but totally worth it. From the outside you would not expect the big, modern room inside. I ordered the oysters (very fresh!), K.F.C. (Korean Fried Cauliflower which is a must order) and beef brisket (melt in mouth). Great casual dining atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"Located just east of the Eaton Centre, this is a great spot for drinks, delicious meats, with a trendy, casual vibe & dress code that still holds a slight hint of semi-upscale. Prices are definitely higher than average, but you're paying for the location and the atmosphere as well. There's a good amount of seating, so this would be a nice place for a group dinner, and it's sophisticated enough to also be a good choice to take a date. Overall, this restaurant has lots to offer!

We were a group of 3 girls visiting on a weekday evening, and it was very busy - it's a nice, reliable spot to drop by after work for both drinks and/or food. We ordered the \"Pit Master Platter\" ($30 per person), and it was a pretty decently-sized platter full of flies, pork ribs, beef brisket, buttermilk fried chicken, and coleslaw. The meats were incredibly tender, tasty and full of flavour. The size of the platter was just enough for 3 hungry girls. 

Service was super friendly, they checked up on us often, and the ambiance was comforting but special. A very well-rounded restaurant that excels in more than just the food department - so if you're ever in the area, it's a good choice to drop by!"}
{"text":"Overpriced restaurant with not a lot of options in the menu. The octopus was okay but would not go back."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of dining at Carbon Bar last night. We were warmly greeted at the door and gathered in the bar to await our seating at the chefs table. The decor is magical with a strange mixture of Vegas meets NYC. Vintage looking signage and old school red booths and the lighting is perfect -- not too dark and not too bright. There was a great energy and it felt like everyone was truly enjoying themselves. We were seated right on time and the wait staff was with us immediately to take drink orders. We had the set menu which is a collection of the best they have to offer served family style. There was a wide offering ranging from frogs legs to brisket and everything was well timed and cooked to perfection. The portions were healthy and the price was great at $59 a person. The staff were friendly and attentive but not overly attentive and the chefs in the kitchen even checked in on us to see how we enjoyed our meal. A few friends experienced the bourbon cart and the server seemed highly knowledgeable about the offerings. It was a delightful evening and I highly recommend this place. Final note -- amazing washrooms!"}
{"text":"I expected the meats to be outstanding but I thought it was just alright.

Here's what we ordered for 3 people - 
Pit Master Platter (2 person order) - Beef Brisket was tasty and juicy, the ribs were not fall off the bone though, fried chicken was alright. 
Yuca Fries - Interesting Fries but small in portion
Duck Taco - tasted and looked a little plasticy.
Shrimp & Grits - it's deep fried which they should have indicated on the menu with minimal shrimp
Wild Shrimp Ceviche - Refreshing, good alternative when you have a meaty dinner
The Queen's Guard - drink was good! But it smelt like a wet dog.

Cost - approx. $70/pp. A little pricey in my opinion. I thought this place was catered towards the suits and their clients."}
{"text":"First, this place has been open for almost a year and this is my first time visiting so my bad there! The place is huge! The old \"City TV\" building is beautifully transformed into a 2-3 storey open concept airy lofty nicely appointed old world restaurant with plenty of room between tables so that you don't have to whisper. There is a bar area that is quite removed from the dining space. There is, I think, a private room that looks over the dining room. I must go back to see that space. It was off limits for a private party Monday evening. The service is perfect. Friendly and professional. Our server Liz was on point knowledgable and loves her job. Ask for liz's section when you go. She's the best. The crispy fish tacos were a huge hit. The tomato salsa was beautiful. Melt in your mouth mightly battered and the perfect size for two bites each. We ordered ribs chicken and brisket combo platter. The meats were kinda overcooked and didn't have the flavour i expected. We had to ask for more bbq sauce to whet my mouth and add flavour. The maple sorbet was Devine and perfect to finish off the meal. I will go again and try the non-slab o meat dishes. The one thing that stuck out was that 90% of the patrons were men. There was one table of women only but otherwise tables and tables of men. For that reason it feels like a steakhouse. The menu is weighted as such as well and the decor is masculine and feels like it could be an old school gentlemans club but there is something on the menu for everyone.  Give it a go but dont order the meat three ways. It's too much."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious. I recommend getting the hamachi poke appetizer, it was an unexpected dish with pear and hamachi but very delicious. The bao was very mediocre compared to other places. I enjoyed their fried chicken the most on the menu, extremely tender! The carrot cake for dessert was a bit dry. Overall, I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the place, the service, and the presentation of the food."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing atmosphere! Sat at the chefs table. Group of 6 ppl and half had pit platter and other half had fishmonger platter. Both very good. KFC app is probably the best and the prices are very reasonable. We were there on a Tuesday and it was packed. This was the second time there and will be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but the food wasn't very good. Ate here twice with a group and most of my meat was very dry.  This place is very overrated and the dishes didn't fit the prices."}
{"text":"Winterlicious win. 
Came for the $38 dinner and got what I'd consider a 4 star experience by Winterlicious standards.

First off, I want to say that this places interior has been wonderfully styled. The oldschool booths but modern styling, contrasting industrial concrete vs wood accenting and well designed lighting, and even though the place is so big it didn't sound crazy loud.
The audio nerd in me especially loved the mixing board collage outside the bathrooms with the male and female phono jacks for bathroom signs. 

Food wise, I went with the Pork Tacos, Smoked Brisket & St. Louis Pork Ribs, and then the Cheesecake. Everything was quite good. The brisket was super tender, the ribs cooked well with tasty sauces to apply, and the cheesecake had blueberry compote on top of the somewhat \"more cake-like than cream cheese-like\" cheesecake. 
My date had the seafood salad, which was the only thing that missed the mark on our visit,  and the blackened sea bass which received full marks. 

Beer menu isn't the best but did have one craft beer on draught, a tasty ESB by Collingwood. Otherwise it was mostly Inbev and big brand options (Goose Island. Stella, Mill Street) aside from some other bottles of varying originality. 

All in all, I'm glad I came and would recommend it for anyone looking for high quality barbecue. The price will be a bit more than a lot of other bbq joints, but the added niceness of the place and high quality service levels make it easy to see where your money is going."}
{"text":"I've heard of this place for a while and saw its stand by the union station food fest - didn't have stomach room then but made a mental note to definitely go here. and one day we did..

checking in with yelp gets you an appetizer (LIGIT!), and we got korean fried cauliflower. it was just ok, kind too sweet for me but kind of interesting to try. 

but wow! the meat bbq platter was so much food and sooo good! 

well, first we thought we'd try the summerlicious menu, but who can say no to a massive platter of ribs, fried chicken and brisket. everything was cooked to perfection, melting in your mouth kind of deliciousness. multiple food-gasms later, we realized how much a pig we were. I had to take my last piece of chicken home along with some fries... they were equally yum the day after for lunch. 

all in all, fabulous food. will come back, will try the seafood platter next time."}
{"text":"* Bar Only Review*
Really cool bar + restaurant just off the downtown core of Queen Street East. A combination of industrial warehouse and vintage rock n' roll charm. While we didn't eat there, I will make a few dining comments: the smell of barbeque at dinnertime is intoxicating. To the left is the massive dining room, perfect for groups. To the right is the massive bar, styled beautifully with well-crafted drinks. This place is PERFECT for groups - the menu caters to family-style and there are several options for chef's table versus paying $30 pp to get massive amounts of pit bbq. Looked like a great place to start out a stag night. 

As for the bar, I went with the Waiting for the Sun: Woodford Reserve bourbon, Montenegro, blood orange shrub, strawberry, vanilla, lime. Totally delicious! I love Woodford Reserve...but this combo was very refreshing. Maybe a tad on the sweet side. Guys, as a warning, this drink is pink. Yeah.

Carbon Bar -- the perfect place to start out the night. Convivial atmosphere, skilled interior design, great drinks."}
{"text":"I've been meaning try this restaurant for the longest time and glad we finally did. We were throwing a friend a surprise party and the staff were very cooperative and accommodating to us. The waitress Ashley was very helpful to use the entire night from start to finish. We ordered the \"KFC\" which is Korean Fried Cauliflower, a common staple here. It was quite good and I loved the batter used to make it this way. The entire table ordered their signature dish which was the Meat Platter filled with Beef Brisket, Ribs and Fried Chicken. It was so good and really love the juicy parts of the brisket. It came out to $30/person but well worth the price to try their awesome meat. Our waitress Ashley was super nice and friendly as our host for that night. Great ambience and dining experience. Highly recommend it to others and meat lovers alike."}
{"text":"Wanted to try some BBQ Smoke house cooking, we came across the carbon bar. Very impressive from the greeting at the door till the seating at the table. 
Crispy pork Belly and the Korean Fried Cauliflower were a hit, felt the presentation needed a bit of work. The flavours were good. 
We ordered the platter for two with the ribs, Fried chicken and brisket complimented by the home made fries. Found the brisket slightly dry, chicken flavorful and the ribs were cooked to perfection. Enjoyed the smoke flavour as it was just strong enough to enhance the proteins but not drown them. 
And got the sweet part of the evening we had Banoffee Pie:
sweet bourbon filling, banana brulee, Chantilly cream, hazelnut, caramel. What a creative work from their pastry team. It is a must."}
{"text":"Food was great but everything is overpriced. The service was below avantage for the prices of this restaurant. The restaurant is beautiful and definitely a nice spot for after-work gatherings for offices in the area. It's quite loud however.

We had the  Pit Master Platter ($30/person) which was delicious all around. The ribs were mouth watering and everything else didn't disappoint. 

The food was really good but I'm still a bigger fan of Barque Smokehouse in terms of food and service."}
{"text":"Food was good but a bit overpriced. Did not expect that big of a bill. Anyways, there was a good and lively vibe as well. Our server was amazing. He was on point with everything. Try the cauliflower, octopus, and the brisket!"}
{"text":"A little taken back by how expensive this place was for what I thought was going to be a hip, low key BBQ place. The vibe is a bit more stylish.

We got the sampler that came with ribs, brisket, chicken, fries, and pickles. It was very good!

The Korean BBQ Cauliflower (KFC on the menu) was great and recommend it. 

Not entirely sure if i will go back before trying other BBQ places in Toronto. The price and upscale atmosphere isn't quite what I look for when grabbing BBQ."}
{"text":"Most memorable feature: Not worth

Should've been in the $28 summerlicious bracket instead.  The summerlicious menu seems to be an awkward mish-mash of the regular menu which led to confused taste buds and a deep sense of regret in our wallets.    Also, when the waiter checked-in with us, we offered our honest opinion and said the food could have been better.  Rather than replying, acknowledging, or validating our opinion, there was a lengthy period of silence and then the waiter just walked away.  Was he trying to walk away from the truth? Did we revive him from autopilot mode? Desserts did not redeem this $38 meal (not including tip and tax).  Sorry.

Dishes ordered: 
Bay scallop poke, blackend atlantic salmon, rocky road sundae, cheesecake (this wasn't listed on the official summerlicious website)"}
{"text":"Meh. Nothing egregious, but nothing noteworthy either. For $200+, I'd like noteworthy. 

Fried green toms were plated beautifully, perhaps the best executed dish we had, but still just meh. 

Brisket burger was over cooked. Significantly. We were the told that since the beef was ground in-house, we could have it cooked to temp. Excellent. We ordered rare. Medium-well arrived. 

Grilled octopus was having a bit of an identity crisis. Red peppers, green olives, squid ink, fingerlings, eggplant and a leaf of some sort. Pretty plate. Pretty ill-composed flavour profile. 

Service was...cursory. Drink order. Food order. More drinks? Then nothing. No dessert offer. No coffee offer. No, \"how was everything?\". Just, get-'em-in-get-'em-out. A robot could have done a better job. At least you can program a robot to offer dessert. 

Spacious seating. Decent Manhattan. Everything a la carte. Even the bread. Waste $ elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is just OK for me. 

The good: the room was beautiful and I liked the details a lot. The service was great, no complaints. 

The food:  drinks were good but pricey. 

Apps were enjoyable. Creole croquettes and Koren fried cauliflower. 

The main was nicely presented. We did the bbq platter.  Honestly, I really dislike fatty meat and found the brisket too fatty to enjoy. I did enjoy the burnt ends. The ribs were OK. The cornbread was overcooked and absent of jalapeño flavour. Coleslaw was really good and probably the best thing I ate (which is sad).  

The fried chicken was the largest disappointment. It had way too much breading, which was completely without flavour. Carbon bar should be ashamed about this. Truly. I like to get KFC (as in, Kentucky fried chicken) every so often and it's way better. Which is not what I expect when visiting a place like carbon bar. 

I appreciated the sauce selection that came with the platter. They were all very tasty. 

I might go back but prob wouldn't order the same thing."}
{"text":"Very good cocktails, strong whiskey selection, and beautiful building. Especially love the high ceilings and the preservation of the building's history (ask about it!) Did not have any food, although menu options looked pretty delicious."}
{"text":"Great meat and apps. Try the KFC bites!! I'll say there are some good ol' boy pitmasters who would roll their eyes at the ambiance (leather booths, mod chairs, disco balls, managers in blazers) but the food is for real.  Don't order the collards unless the kitchen decides to actually cook them and not just throw some butter on them. Maybe I'm the only person who likes collards and orders them...??"}

Came here for summerlicious as my friends were interested in what they have going on. 

I got the tomato salad, the brisket and ribs, and the sundae.

The salad was good, they used a variety of heirloom tomatoes including my favorites (kumatos). The cheese was almost like the cream from burrata, although a little saltier. I tried the scallop poke as well, it was also pretty decent. Both are things I definitely wouldn't associate with a bbq restaurant.

The ribs were cooked properly, but the flavours were not very appealing, the dry rub was lacking in flavour and the BBQ sauce they had was way too tart. The brisket was extremely fatty and cooked poorly. It was as if someone boiled it and seared it lightly, the sauce was once again too sour. The coleslaw and pickle were alright, nothing standout.

The rocky road sundae was pretty good, I liked the toasted marshmallows and the brittle they added.

I had their smoked old-fashioned. It was a decent cocktail. It was a little strong on the palate at first and I didn't really get the smokiness, but as the ice melted, it really mellowed out and the emptiness was more pronounced.

Service was friendly and no complaints from me.

Prices are 32/person for the sampler platter and ~20-30/person for their regular entrees. At 38/person for summerlicious (appy, entree, and dessert) it's not too bad.

Decor is grunge industrial and the dim lighting helps with the look. The kitchen is open, so you can see everything that they do.

After having BBQ three times this week, I'm a little disappointed. This place isn't bad, but the BBQ needs work."}
{"text":"Omg soooo good! Their menu isn't huge but we tried many items and were delish.
I'm vegetarian so I really enjoyed the kfc (Korean fried cauliflower) 
The Korean chilies 
Kale salad 
And I know we ate more things but I can't remember. Everything was delightful as well as the service and the drinks, they have a $10 tobacco infused Manhattan which was really good. 
We are coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I ordered the pit master platter. The pit master platter consists of pork ribs, beef brisket, buttermilk fried chicken and fries. Perfect for sharing! My favourite is the buttermilk fried chicken. The platter also comes with 3 different sauces. One for the pork ribs, one for the beef brisket and one for the fries. The bbq sauce was so good! I wish they packed the sauces with our leftovers. We also got the slaw to go with the platter, which was a great recommendation from the server. You definitely need to get some sort of veggie dish to break down all that meat. If you're a wine lover, the Decoy Cabernet Sauvignon goes really well with it - it's not too heavy and tastes pretty smooth. 

I really liked the atmosphere - perfect for a date or just a catch up with a friend. They have a DJ at around 10 P.M. Not sure if they have a DJ every night, I came on a Saturday.

The service was pretty good. You can get service from any waiter/waitress, they won't pass you along to the original server. Although the service was a bit slow when trying to ask for the bill.. it was quite busy and they didn't rush us to get out even though we were on our last glass of wine for quite awhile."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere / look and feel of the Carbon. The food is a strong 3 star but the high ceiling and upscale decor + professional staff makes it a 4 :) Extremely busy on weekends so I prefer weekdays, and even then it's still busy."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday - January 3rd.  
I was immediately struck by the space. It was large and well appointed with very high ceilings and exposed brick, beautiful seating and lighting. It also comes with an interesting history that is reflected in the decor. 
I really can't say enough about this space - perhaps my favourite in Toronto.
I only wish the fare matched its surroundings. For me, southern barbecue - grits, collard greens and smoked ribs -  seemed out of place in such a grand setting.
The barbecue, while not the best in the city, was still quite good. The prices, however, were the highest I've encountered for the amount served. The Pit Master platter for 3 people came in at $90 dollars for one large plate of various meats from the smoker. Tasty, but we didn't feel great about the value we were getting. 
The pleasant waitress also informed us that the plates were intended to be shared. 
We ordered the cornish hen and blackened sea bass, both of which looked like a regular dinner plate for one person and were quite awkward to share. 
Because I love the atmosphere, I would return here for drinks and appetizers at the bar, but I'll make reservations elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends for drinks and dessert on a Saturday night last Summer,  we had so much fun! 

Carbon Bar offers a great atmosphere with cool decor,  a fun playlist, roomy booths, good food and cocktails, and friendly staff. I've been meaning to go back,  hope I'll get a chance soon."}
{"text":"Carbon bar

My experience with this restaurant was 3-3.5 star. Decided on this place for a birthday celebration due to the good reviews. Even a friend said they loved this place so I had good expectations it would be a nice dining experience. Disappointed, just found it average. 

Made reservations online and mentioned it was for a birthday occasion. However, this was not even acknowledged by any of the staff during my group's entire dining experience. I don't expect free food or anything but not even a \"hope you have a nice time celebrating tonight\" by the server. Nothing. 

Service - service was polite enough, but again if a group books for a special occasion it would be nice to have an acknowledgment. There was also a 2-2.5 hour max per table rule so I did note that while the server reminded us they did not kick us out right after we passed a bit over that time. Our group did appreciate that consideration. 

However, this restaurant is marked as upscale and more after work environment so perhaps I had higher expectations on customer service. Disappointed cause I've had better, more personable service at inexpensive restaurants. 

Food - Food at first glance was good. I ordered the brisket and mac and cheese dish. Pricey for portion. But I was full after ordering these two dishes. Brisket was nice but like I wasnt wowed. Mac and cheese was good and spicy but I think I got sick from it. Meal did not settle well after. So something in my meal was off. 

Overall, would I go back? Maybe with coworkers or when your company foots the bill. For special occasions? Nope."}
{"text":"Had reservations for 10pm. Table was not ready waited 15mins. Bartender had no personality and was rude. Once seated placed our order, waitress comes back to let us know that they were out of the ribs. Later a preppy waiter in a jacket comes back and tells us that they are out of ALL BBQ. 
Music was loud with a cheap sound system, horrid music. 
My wife had been here before with a friend and had a good time. Last night was just a total miss at this place. I will not go back again."}
{"text":"I went with my boyfriend last night. It was my first time but he had been before with a friend.

The food was pretty good. However my experience here was greatly affected by our server. I unfortunately did not get her name. We waited around 5 mins to have someone give us menus after we were brought to our table. Our server came and started talking not to the both of us, but just to my boyfriend, completely disacknowledging my presence. She then comments about my boyfriend being damp (because it was raining outside) and touches his chest (not shoulders) two times. She came back again taking another drink order and touched him again, did not follow up if our food was okay and didnt check if we needed anything at all. I wanted to tell her to stop touching my boyfriend but I didn't want to make the experience any more unpleasant than it already was. Personally I thought this was an inappropriate way to behave in front of customers you are serving and to make them feel uncomfortable. The people working are supposed to be serving you and making sure your experience at the bar/restaurant is as pleasing as possible not disappointing. It was my first time here and my impressions of this place is forever tainted.



Making reservation: 
I was done work at 9:45 pm which is a bit late for dinner but we wanted to eat nonetheless. I called around 7pm to make a reservation and the lady I talked to on the phone said it was no need and we can just walk in. My boyfriend called again around 9pm and they took a reservation for 2 people at 10:15.

We got there around 10 pm and we were seated in the bar area. It was raining out and the place seemed a little busier than we thought it would be. The space was a little crammed for our order which I guess was understandable since we were not in the dining section.

We ordered:
Mexican Streetcorn
The Brisket
Duck Tacos
Fish platter
A bunch of cocktails: Black Mamba Margarita and Manhattan
Basque Cheescake for dessert

My boyfriend really like the brisket appetizer and we both enjoyed the fish platter and basque cheescake. The black mamba margarita is also pretty good.

Overall rating for the food: 3.7/5 stars

The place itself is aesthetically pleasing. High ceiling, spherical lamps extending from the ceiling, burgundy leather couches.

Would I recommend this place to a friend? Probably, if they dont mind their significant other groped in front of them."}
{"text":"There are multiple pros and cons to this restaurant. In the end though, the food is delicious and that should be what matters most!

The vibe:
-The space that the restaurant occupies is incredible. Huge ceilings, beautiful light fixtures and accent pieces, it's a really trendy vibe with plenty of room for bigger groups. Unfortunately, the vibe of much of the crowd was very corporate, understandable given its location, but they're not on my top 5 lists of crowds. The service was attentive, maybe even somewhat obtrusively so. I won't fault them for that though.

The drinks:
-An intriguing cocktail menu, I ordered the Smokin' Manhattan which had tobacco-infused Rye (basically steeped with a cigar), lovely velvety texture and cigar-like smokiness made it worth the $14. The beer menu was decent but lacking in the stouts or porters I would prefer in the Winter weather. 

The food:
-Started the meal with the Fried Chicken Skins, which was a nice greasy nibble before starting an actual meal. Not sized as an appetizer but delicious nonetheless. I ordered the Octopus/Lobster gumbo and split a Hot Mess with a friend who ordered the Jerk Cornish Hen. Overall, the gumbo had good flavour, and while it was a small portion, there was ample octopus and lobster found within it. The Jerk Hen was nice though I prefer my Jamaican seasoning on the spicier side. The star of the meal was the Hot Mess, a diabolical combination of sweet potato, brisket, sour cream, and cheese curds. Delicious and the brisket had a great smoky flavour that made me wish that I had given the smokepit a shot (I've avoided going full-BBQ since a recent trip to Texas made everything pale in comparison). Ended the meal with a Cheddar Cheese ice cream sandwich. Quite peculiar, it was a cheddar cheese blended ice cream within two wafers topped with parmesan-like cheese. The smell was pretty intensely savoury but the taste was great. I think I liked it? 

My overall impression:
-A trendy, pricey BBQ spot in a neighbourhood that caters to a corporate crowd. The food makes up for any pejorative aspects of those words. The portions are small and that is somewhat against the whole concept of Southern comfort food but it was nice not feeling completely filled to the brim for once. Overall a 3.5/5 but I'll give it a 4 because it's worth a shot!"}
{"text":"Here on a business meeting.  Being from the southern US I was a little skeptical about this Places' BBQ and pecan pie, but I am the first to admit when I am wrong and I sure was wrong! We started with the croquettes which were good, but the real star of the meal was the fried cauliflower mmmm! It had a little bit of heat to it, but the flavor was excellent.  Had the lettuce wraps with BBQ and kimchi - it was delicious! I enjoyed building my own wraps and thought this was a healthier alternative to BBQ on a bun.  We finished the meal off with pecan pie and the bourbon whipped cream - that stuff was strong and tasty! I really enjoyed it and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best upscale BBQ joints I've been too in Toronto. An awesome modern restaurant with a BBQ joint twist. It's a great place to meet up with friends after work to get some good old fashion BBQ food and some good beers. They do have a cocktails list however the drinks left me disappointed. Don't get me wrong they were good cocktails but I've had better.

My group decided to get the BBQ Pit Master Platter which included brisket, smoked ribs and a deboned buttermilk fried chicken. Be warned for $30 per person you only end up getting 4 pieces of brisket, 3 ribs and 1 fried chicken but if you've never been its a good way to taste the menu. 

That being said if you don't want to do the platter, I can not stress this enough GET THE BRISKET. A glorious beef brisket smoked for 8 hours filled with smokey flavors and the meat was just falling apart with a pull of the fork.

I'll definitely be back again but if you're looking for good eats and good vibes this places tops my list of restaurants."}
{"text":"Having wanted to check this place out for ages my friends and I finally had a chance a few days ago.  If you go here with the expectation that it's not cheap and portions are a bit small then you will be fine, and it's the reason I am giving it 4 Stars because I knew this going in and was ok with it.  

First up - for the portion sizes the food is pricey.  My friend had the scallops with lentils.  It was good but you got 3 scallops in a bowl of lentils.  Now I'm a small person and can't eat a lot at one sitting...but even that was small for me.  I believe it was $28.

I had the burnt end beef brisket with lettuce wrap.  I found the meat to be way too salty for my liking - and I like salt!  My other friend had the steak with polenta I believe and the steak was done well.  I had a nibble of hers and enjoyed it.   If you check in on Yelp you get a free bar snack and our server recommended the deep friend cauliflower in korean bbq sauce.  Ummmm...hello heaven...these bite size morsels of goodness were the highlight of the evening.  I could have eaten a whole bowl of them myself.  Smothered in sauce but with a crispness outside and the softness of the cauliflower inside, these are a big hit.  

Their cocktail drink selection is minimal but really interesting - I had the Louisville to Lisbon and it was delicious.  With hints of lime and a kick of cayenne it was a great juxtaposition of flavours.  It's $14 and while pricey I enjoyed it.

Their beer menu and wine menu is more extensive and they have a lot of beers I had not heard of (not too unusual as I'm not into beer) but the list seemed interesting.

This place is deceptively small looking from the outside - it can hold a big group and would be great for private events as the space it really well laid out.  It looks like it could turn into a club after hours.  The service is really amazing - starting from the hostess who takes your coat to all the servers who kept checking in on us and recommended dishes when we weren't sure.  This is more of a lively and fun atmosphere so if you want a quiet place to talk or an intimate first date restaurant I would avoid this place until at least your 3rd date.   Super high ceilings with dark wood and exposed brick and beautiful lighting gives this places an upscale 50s Mad Men's kinda vibe.  

Located conveniently on Queen St E this place will definitely be a staple in the area - it's cool and fun and just a great place to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"A very good burger in the 25 dollar range, I'd skip the sauce next time.  Great fries! Very attractive interior, spacious, clean, well lit.
Staff was friendly and washrooms clean."}
{"text":"Food: It's mostly good, but not amazing. The ribs and brisket were good. The fried chicken was too salty and a little bland. The star of the night was the shrimp tostada. It was delicious. 

Drinks: The Old Fashioned is boozy and good. The Manhattan is a miss. 

Service: Not great. Our server didn't check in on us after the mains came and forgot my drink. 

Atmosphere: This place has a King West vibe if you're into that."}
{"text":"Was taken out last night to celebrate a project completion...had the sampler platter and some beers. Super yummy! And exemplary service all around."}
{"text":"Saw this place on instagram a lot through some blogger channels so I was intrigued by it because of the nice decor and chicken and waffles!!

First I have to say that their service was great. She was attentive with our water and always asked how we were doing.

Anyways, moving onto the food - their chicken and waffles were probably one of the best I've had!! It's so crunchy but not oily and didn't even taste heavy at all! Their waffles are a little crispier than usual but I didn't mind it.

The Benedict wasn't bad either but the pancakes were HORRIBLE! I don't recommend the pancakes to anyone. 

I would only be back for the fresh juice and chicken and waffles. Everything else isn't really worth it."}
{"text":"We went to the carbon bar for my birthday dinner this year and had a great night. The staff was friendly providing the service that you would expect from a nice restaurant without being pretentious.  
We started our meal with a sampling of the starters.  My favourite was the Shishito Peppers.  They have a great spice and go great with the sauce.  
For our main we had the Pit Master Platter.  It was great. The fried chicken was excellent.  It was juicy and flavourful.  The brisket and ribs were tender and juicy.  I also really liked the pickles.  Some of the reviews have mentioned being unhappy with the portion size of the platter.  I can only assume that this is because it was so big.  It easily served the 6 of us and left us full.  
One of the highlights was the Banana Toffee Cream Pie and the Dulce de Leche ice cream. It was sublime."}
{"text":"Came here after a event on a Wednesday night.

We sat at the bar.  The place was not too busy.  The bartender came serve us immediately with two glasses of water.  This made us feel very welcoming.  It was the very first time my own experience that a bar serves water to customers without us asking for it.  We both appreciated it.  I wanted a light beer.  The bartender recommended Steam Whistle on tap.  It was good.

We ordered a crispy chicken skin.  It was made like chips and a good pairing with beer.  Of course, it was sort of greasy and unhealthy lol.  The kettle corn had a taste of spicy and sour because of the lime flavor.  A good bar snack too.

One last thing I have to compliment this place is that there are hooks installed under the bar table.  It is such a good addition for ladies hanging our handbags!"}
{"text":"The food was insane!

We got the cauliflower- insanely good! 5 stars 
The pork belly appetizer- good but won't blow your mind.  3 stars.
The bavette steak was incredible. So juicy and so good. 5 stars for sure 
Finally we got the Peacan pie for dessert - 3 stars. Good but not insane. You can taste the scorched parts where they used a torch. 

Atmosphere and ambiance was great. 4 stars overall."}
{"text":"What a great spot for a night out! Well, more like a great spot to spend two hours. I've been here a couple of times now and I just love it. The ambiance and decor make the place feel like a really cool, fun place to spend your evening. Sadly, they do push you to leave when you get close to the two hour mark. 

The food is really good but some of the items are not really what I would consider to be worthy of their price tag. For example, on my first visit, I ordered the duck tacos. While delicious, definitely not worth $17 for two tacos. Add a third, and I'd say that's more appropriate. Or, shave a few dollars off. Either way, too pricey for what you get and I'd never order them again. The bay scallop poke was just ok, in fact, completely forgettable. From the description on the menu, I expected more flavour but it was kind of bland. 

However, on my next visit, I had the Pit Master platter, and it was really good, and obviously very popular as I saw many of them being delivered to nearby tables. Three of us ordered this and then two of us had the Fishmonger platter, along with a few sides - corn bread and collard greens. The greens were greasy and the corn bread was dry, but they both had good flavour. The fries that came with the platter were sad and limp - we didn't bother with them. I really enjoyed everything on the BBQ platter - especially the chicken. It was so tender and juicy on the inside and beautifully crispy on the outside. I never order chicken in a restaurant because I feel it's something I can cook well enough at home. But this chicken, I'm sure I couldn't do better if I tried. 

I didn't bother with any of the sauces on the meat, as I prefer to taste the flavours of the meat itself. Loved how tender the brisket was, especially with the crusty edges. Yum! I usually prefer my ribs to be more \"falling off the bone\" tender, but I can appreciate different styles as well. These ribs had a bit more pull to them, but they were still really good. 

The Fishmonger platter was also quite impressive - the daikon and wakame salad was my least favourite, but everything else was great, especially the clams - I don't eat them often so they were a nice treat. Would've been better if there were a couple more oysters, too. Love raw oysters! 

The 5th person at our table had the octopus and said it was very tender and flavorful. I might get that next time, as I absolutely love grilled octopus. 

The service was really spot on, as well. I had a drink I really enjoyed on my first visit, but wasn't on the menu last time. When I asked, the bartender was happy to make it for me. Their bourbon drinks are incredible and really pack a punch - I just wish I could make them at home! This is definitely a place I want to go back to."}
{"text":"The drinks are the highlight of this place but the Texas style BBQ is really good as well. Trendy place, busy, and you probably need to reserve before but I liked and I am certainly coming back"}
{"text":"I came here with some girl friends for dinner last night.  

I love the high ceilings and the decor, including the original Electric Circus sign.  We were here on a Wednesday night, so I was quite pleased that the music was at a reasonable volume so that you could actually have a conversation!!  

The staff was overly friendly.  From the hostess, to the server, to the bus boy.  

Now to the best part, the food!  We ordered a the pit master platter for 2 which came with 2 big chicken breasts, 6 ribs, 3 pickle slices, 3 big pieces of brisket and a cup of fries + 3 sauces. We also ordered some coleslaw and cornbread to cut the grease and also the mac and cheese.  I have absolutely nothing bad to say about any of the food.  It filled us up and there was some to take home.   The meats were so juicy and full of flavour; I didn't even use the sauces.  The mac and cheese was delicious and cheesy, with big chunks of ribs.  

The prices were very reasonable for the amount of food you get.

I'd love to come back here on the weekend.  I heard it gets more loungey."}
{"text":"The food was below average. There is nothing special about this place. I expect to find a restaurant like this in a mall. Moxies gone BBQ. 
You are also forced (ok, encouraged) for an 18% minimum tip regardless of party size #robbery"}
{"text":"I've been to The Carbon Bar many times. I love the high ceilings and vibe. I am usually there for drinks (love the black mamba margarita) and the Korean Fried Cauliflower is the best in the city. 

This city loves it's brunch and The Carbon Bar recently joined the Brunch Wagon. I went there a few weeks ago and was throughly impressed. My friend and I had no problems getting a table, we sat down and obviously ordered some caffeine. The coffee is nothing special, tastes like a regular drip coffee. 

We then proceeded to order; Huevos El Carbon, Smoked Brisket Benny, Smashed & Fried Potatoes, and the Buttermilk Pancakes. 

The server told us they ran out of the Brisket for the Benny but they could add Pulled Pork, I had zero problems with that as I prefer Pulled Pork over Brisket. 

About 20 minutes later and all of our food arrived. WOW. It was a LOT of food. We were excited to dig in. 

I took one bite of my Pulled Pork Benny and fell in love. This had to be the best Eggs Benny I had ever had. It reminded me of a pulled pork sandwich, it had pickles, slaw and chili. The biscuit was a great southern touch. I wish they would add it as a permanent item on the menu. 

The Huevos was okay, it came with warm tortillas, black beans, two eggs sunny, Manchego cheese, chorizo, guacamole, and charred pico de gallo. I personally didn't feel like it was anything special. 

The Smashed & Fried Potatoes were amazing. It had kimchi and fried onions. The potatoes were cooked then smashed on a griddle so it had a nice crispy yet chewy edge. 

Finally dessert, The pancakes were pretty good. We obviously had to add the smoked bacon. The pancakes were a bit dense, and I wish they added the blueberry sauce to each layer, overall it was good. 

I would definitely recommend this place for some good southern brunch. It's the ultimate comfort food. 

Keep Eating,

{"text":"Some friends and I came here last night for Winterlicious and although the food was mostly good, the overall experience left me feeling a little bit disappointed. Partly because it took quite a long time to both order and receive food.

Appetizer:
The main source of my disappointment was the hamachi poke; the fish did not taste fresh, the seasoning was bland and too heavy on the sesame, and I found the flavour pairing of the fish with the pear more jarring than complementary. Since it was this specific dish on the menu that drew me to this restaurant, I was more than a little underwhelmed. However, I did hear my friends say good things about the pork bao (namely that it was much larger than Momofuku's), so all is not lost!

Main course:
I enjoyed the South Atlantic snapper much more (maybe more so after the disappointing appetizer) but I found myself liking the pieces of eggplant in the curry more than the actual fish - to be fair, the curry was very good. The other main course that was ordered was the fried chicken & ribs, and that seemed to be a hit - large portions and great sauce pairings.

Dessert:
I ordered the apple & cranberry crisp (my favourite part of the meal) and my friends got the carrot cake. Both were very yummy - not much else to be said.

Overall, the latter half of the meal did a decent job of making up for a rocky start, but because I had such high expectations going in (and perhaps ordered the wrong dishes), I can't justifiably rate my experience above a 3/5."}
{"text":"Inside this sexy, massive loft space with ballroom ceilings I found myself eating crispy chicken skins dipped in sweet chili vinegar. And guess what: I enjoyed each absurdly crunchy, grease-filled bite.

The shishito peppers with a side of eggplant dip is a must.

Also amazing: the make-your-own lettuce wraps with brisket beef \"burnt ends\", coleslaw and pickles.

Cocktails are exceptional...try the Jalisco Sour.

I'll be back...and next time I'll save room for the bubblegum/strawberry ice cream on a waffle cone with pop rocks!"}

\"Oh. My. God. It's Carbon Bar!\" 
If you don't get that reference, you need to binge watch Friends ASAP. Friends aside, the food is STELLAR. I would rank this as one of the top restaurants I've been to in Toronto. The brisket is melt in your mouth tender and delicious. The fried chicken is unfair to other fried chicken in the world. The duck tacos... I don't have words for them. Just order them. They have a full, complex flavour but somehow manage to taste like home. To be clear, my home has never included ducks but it's the feeling I'm trying to get at. 

Price: expensive, but worth every penny. 

I can't say enough about this restaurant. Go here. Take your friends here. Take a date here. Hell, go by yourself. Just go."}
{"text":"Service and food were both great. The cauliflower is amazing, and the portions are large, I was stuffed by the end of the night. The atmosphere is really good, and it's a cool place. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very tasty beef smoky brisket !
Attentive service! They knew we have to leave soon so they brought all of our orders very fast.
Beautiful inner decorations too!"}
{"text":"We came here for a set menu holiday lunch in late December - the space is really spacious and beautiful with high ceilings and dim lighting. The food here is top notch if you're into American style BBQ, and the set menu was great. The menu was as follows:

Appetizers: 
- Blistered Shishitos. These are really good, not spicy at all and add a fun 'who is going to get the 1 in 10 hot pepper??' zazz
- K.F.C. (Korean fried cauliflower). These went FAST from the table, really crisp and delicious with a spicy sauce that tingled the lips just enough.
- Wedge Caesar Salad. Nothing to write home about, but the bacon was good.
- Buttermilk fried frogs legs. Yikes! I'm not a fan of frog but one coworker ate about 5 of these and seemed to enjoy them, and the batter was fantastic. 

Mains:

- Pitmaster platter. This was GREAT - it comes with ribs, beef brisket and buttermilk fried chicken and burnt ends. The brisket was INCREDIBLE, it melts in your mouth and leaves you full and sleepy. The burnt ends and fried chicken also disappeared super quickly, and the ribs were great although they do come un-sauced, which is something to keep in mind.

Dessert:

- Death by chocolate cake. This is RICH and a little slice does you a long way. The tuile on the cake is cute and tasty.

For a cocktail I had the 'no rest for the wicked' because I love earl grey - this was lovely sipped over a long meal, and also came with a shortbread cookie to play on the tea theme.

Overall, I would suggest this place for large groups with a good budget and hungry bellies - you won't be disspointed."}
{"text":"I feel back giving this place a bad review given the many amazing reviews here and it may be my personal taste but the food here is incredibly heavy - the beef brisket was good however, it was too fatty!"}
{"text":"Came in tonight for drinks and bites at the bar. Have been here before for dinner but service at the bar tonight was amazing. Attentive, but not intrusive. They went out of their way to bring another bar still over for us (these are super heavy!) and made sure we had a great time. 

The complimentary pork tacos were so good -clearly made with their smoked pork and a really nice smoky green salsa. The oysters (half price on Tuesdays!) were also delicious and they brought us a dozen even though we only ordered 6. When we pointed out that we received more than we ordered, they said the extras were on the house. We also had the charred salmon pops - a great bar snack! 

Flawless experience, buzzing scene, beautiful room, great food. We'll be back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Pretty date place and yummy BBQ! Make sure you get a reso or else you will be at the bar.... Mmm BBQ & beers!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite barbeque places in Toronto. The trendy vibe and reservation dearth is misleading: this is good, old fashioned BBQ. The platter is the way to go, and don't miss the excellent and unique chicken skins. Best of all, sauce on the side means you can enjoy the meat sans accoutrements."}
{"text":"Well I came here for a staff dinner. 

It's situated on Queen St so parking can be an issue at times. 

The atmosphere is different but nice. 

Let's get straight to the food. 
The platters that were brought out were pre selected for us. 
Although they tried to do a variety of items, it was all primarily an abundance of meat. 
Ribs, roast beef, fried chicken, steak... I almost felt like we were at a Brazilian restaurant. 
The other thing I noticed was that the other selection of items all contained dairy. Dairy dairy dairy..... 
Although they tried accommodating my dairy sensitivities, I still felt that the alternative should of been a healthier choice. There was only one vegetable plate and it was small. 
I would definitely suggest more vegetables or some sort of carb to compliment all the meat. Maybe some sweet potatoes, baked potatoes, Jasmin rice, asparagus, salads etc. Something more than just platters of meat. 

The next day everyone wanted to sleep in because of how heavy the meal was. 

I feel that this place is better for drinks and appetizers.

I would suggest that the staff step it up a notch with some sort of uniform or maybe all black but not their own t-shirts and jeans I feel that lacked professionalism, even if is meant to be an individual concept. 
They were however, working hard. 

Would I come back here? Maybe, but only if I'm in the area with friends and don't mind all the meat."}
{"text":"Another yummy brunch at the Carbon Bar. I'm so glad it's just around the corner. The space is amazing and the service is friendly. But it's the food that will have you salivating for more. I enjoyed the brisket, but would recommend a side of fries to kick it up a notch. Of course you can't go wrong with the Chicken n Waffles or the Cheeseburger. It's much less crowded at Brunch so you won't have to wait for a table. But if you like a fun place to go for dinner, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight with a friend and it was great. Very cool atmosphere and the food and service were also excellent. We opted for the pit master platter and each item was just as good as the next. Brisket, ribs and fried chicken. Washed down with a beer from their very decent selection. 

The server deserves a special mention as she was excellent. 

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went there twice this month (not my choice)

Food - Very good, quality ingredients were used somewhat creatively and slightly over-priced
Wine - priced higher than the Ritz Carlton for lower quality wine - we returned the first set of glasses because they tasted pretty bad... mine was quite acidic... simply unacceptable when you pay that price.
Cocktails - bartenders look like (male) models (that's a plus for some) BUT the skillset, unfortunately, doesn't match their looks. I prefer substance over style for my cocktails - Aloette is a current favourite of mine in that regard. Come to think of it, food at aloette is also much better, more creative and less expensive. 
Decor and crowd/abiance - decent for downtown, great for downtown east, which has less venues competing.

I would give a 2.5 but rounded up because of friendly service. Would be a 4 with better drinks and if it didn't feel like a bit of a rip-off."}
{"text":"Went for summerlicious with the family. The vegetarian option for entree was different on the menu on site from that advertised on the summerlicious website. However, the chef accommodated me and created an entirely vegan menu within summerlicious pricing just for me.
Great food, fantastic service and highly recommended. The rest of the fam ordered off the set summerlicious menu and we had every item covered. Each item was so flavourful and perfectly cooked. What a fantastic place!"}
{"text":"Oh gosh the pit master platter lived up to the hype and pictures. The meat was some of the best bbq I had in a long time. I loved the buttery melt in your melt beef brisket. The ribs were fall of the bone. I loved how the sauce was on the side. I dont like saucy ribs! The fries were crispy and the fried chicken (boneless) was leagues better than KFC. 

Its $30 a person. A bit pricey IMO but worth it as a treat. Drinks were on the pricey side but to be expected I guess.

Service was on point. The atmosphere is hard to describe. Its dimly lit. The staff wear adidas sneakers. Our server was quick and efficient. 

Tips on the POS machine start at 18%. I know you can manually input a lower amount but I hate restos that put 18% as the base amount. I have to take a star off for that. 

4 stars ****"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place because of all the great reviews and online articles, and I have to admit I was pretty disappointed with the food. The atmosphere and service were really great, but I thought the food was nothing special and overpriced.

There were 4 of us and we had:
Chicken Skins
Beef Croquettes
TCB Burger
Pit Master Platter for 2

The chicken skins were interesting but I didn't really like them, they were really oily. The beer croquettes were ok but I wouldn't get them again. I had the burger, and while it was good, it was SO heavy. I finished half of it and couldn't touch the rest. It was really greasy. The  guys seemed to like the Pit Master platter, but both of them agreed the food was just OK. Maybe if you are a southern comfort food lover you would love this place, but it wasn't for us.

All in all it was a cool atmosphere, but we won't be back or recommend. Maybe a better place to go just for the bar."}
{"text":"Yet another night at The Carbon Bar, and it just leaves me wanting to come back that much more. One word to describe this place is perfect (in my opinion). From the service to the food, everything was superb. I tried the duck tacos for the first time and oh my god... insane. I recommend giving these a try! If I could rate this place more than 5 stars I would."}
{"text":"I had seen a video of The Carbon Bar's Brisket Cheese Burger online, so I knew I'd be sitting down for a meal at some point.

That point came one Saturday evening around 5:30 and the place was surprisingly crowded. We didn't have a reservation but we told we could have a table for an hour. Fair enough.

We elected to start with the Hush Puppies (with jalapeno ranch sauce). I've had a lot of hush puppies during my travels in the United States and it pains me to say that these are far from authentic. I mean, they're fine, but they're just so dry and tasteless compared to the real deal. That sauce is quite tasty, though.

The Brisket Cheese Burger (\"brioche bun, sliced beef brisket, American cheese, charred & pickled chili peppers, burnt onion aioli, fries\") was next and my heart sank when I realized that it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while. The fries were piping hot, which leads me to believe that the burger had been made many minutes earlier and just sat there until the fries had been prepared.

Anyway, that aside, it's a very good burger. The meat is juicy and the various toppings are quite tasty, but that brisket... Even in the midst of all those condiments, I could tell that the brisket was super tender and crazy smoky. Smoky brisket in Toronto?? I hardly thought it possible!

We closed out the meal with a plate of their Burnt Basque Cheesecake (with blueberry compote). It's an interesting dish, to be sure. It's basically not sweet at all, and actually doesn't taste much like a traditional cheesecake. But it's good. I don't know if I'd ever order it again, though.

The mediocre appetizer, far-from-fresh main, and passable dessert forces me to give The Carbon Bar three stars. I could've forgiven the underwhelming starter and dessert had the burger been delivered fresh, is the bottom line here."}
{"text":"Me and my partner had a day off together on a weekday so we went for some drinks. There were many empty seats at that time (4:30) so we were easily seated. It's nothing too fancy but not too casual either. The workers are amazing and friendly and will be happy to give you recommendations.

We ordered 4 drinks - the Manhattan, rose buds, santeria, and the pit fire old fashion. 

I have been to specialty bars before with higher quality cocktails but I would say for the pricing, the taste of the drinks were very decent and pleasant. Their original drinks are quite strong if you are into that and for the sweeter drinks, you can request the sweetness level. 

They were kind enough to give us a complimentary dish on the house which was very kind of them. It was spring rolls with fish sauce type. 

Would definitely come back to try out their foods. The spring roll was a bit of a tease!"}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere, with a fun trendy vibe in their high ceiling dining room.  Bring an appetite for some BBQ... with a selection of various fish dishes as well.  

Recommend the oysters... and the cheddar ice cream sandwich. 

Pass on the black mamba margarita."}
{"text":"Visited for my 13th anniversary. Had reservations set for 5 pm exactly when they open back up on Sundays. Loved the ambiance of the restaurant not so much the neighborhood, a little sketchy.

We ordered the barbeque pork belly for the appetizer, was very good. Ordered the Pitt master platter for two. The meat on the platter was tender, very greasy, and needed just a pinch of salt. The dips were good and so were the fries. My husband wasn't very happy that the chicken pieces were chicken thighs - he doesn't like thighs unless they are in a stew. I thought they were good but wasn't fond of the buttermilk batter. We didn't order dessert because I was stuffed but the waitress was so sweet she brought us skull chocolates. The other staff was very friendly but gave us almost too much attention outside of our waitress.

Overall, I enjoyed the restaurant and would come again when visiting Toronto again."}
{"text":"This place is lively with a great atmosphere. 
It is an amazing place to hang with a group of people and the decor is very modern with industrial like vibes.
The service is good as the waiters are friendly and helpful.
Their beef brisket is a must try and I believe it's probably the best beef brisket I've ever had in my life. It literally melts in your mouth! 
The food is fresh and of great quality. 
Highly recommended, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"I live so close by, and never have a chance to try until today.  Wow, what a surprise, I wasn't able to tell how grand the place looks from outside.  Such a nice ambience with great staff working here.  Great options on alcoholic drinks, as well as their food menu.  This time, we were just sharing their snack/appetizer items (ceviche, Mac & cheese, duck taco, steak skewers etc) between 4 of us & they were delicious.  I am definitely going back to try their main entrée. 
Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"The BBQ ribs are absolutely delicious -- smoky, meaty, fall-off-the-bone. Served with a side of collard greens and a nice pint of draught beer, it may be one of the best restaurant meals I've had in Toronto in some time.

Worth mentioning is the pro service. Our server was friendly, described the menu in detail, and took the extra step of folding my napkin when I was away from the table. Definitely want to return to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here.  I had the $65 chef's tasting menu.  I ended up eating a handful of salad, a couple fried crispy items, 1 rib (that's right..1 rib), 1 slice of brisket, 1 piece of fried chicken, 1 piece of fried chicken skin (disgusting), 1 mouthful of banana pie, and 1 mouthful of an ice cream sandwich.  

To top it off, it all tasted really mediocre.  I will NEVER GO BACK HERE.  What a ripoff.  

They like to plate everything on big plates so when it comes to your table, it looks like a substantial amount of food.  Of course, when you actually divide it up among everyone, you each get a tiny morsel.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant you want to go to for date night! Romantic and inviting atmosphere with amazing service and food. Had the fish monger platter with some apps and they were delicious. The servers and hostesses were very friendly. I recommend getting the korean fried cauliflower and the mac and cheese! Also took
the blueberry cheese cake to go and when I tried it at home it probably was the best cheese cake I've had in my life :-)"}
{"text":"The food was really good, a surprising gem that was not expected in the church and queen area. The restaurant was also very spacious, and the decor created a very cool vibe. 
We ordered the pit master platter ($34/person, minimum 2 person order) and the jalapeño corn bread. From the pictures the platter looks small, however it is a healthy amount of food especially with a side and/or drinks. We finished every last bite. 
Even with all the positives, I would still consider it overpriced, and would only go back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. Food was OK - nothing special. Did find a hair in my food which I usually don't fuss with as long as they make it up to us. But all they did was replace it, nothing else."}
{"text":"Well, a Co worker of mine suggested the place so we went and after getting there I realized i was somewhat under dressed wearing jeans and a work t-shirt while everyone else was in more formal attire, such as khakis and button shirt. Hey I didn't care because we were treated just like everyone else by the staff. The staff was very friendly and answered any questions we had. The Co worker and I got the meat platter (do not remember the name of it but it was $34 CAD and was worth every penny. The brisket melted in your mouth, the meat fell right off the bone on the ribs, and the chicken was so tender. The bbq sauces were also very unique to place. We were seat ed d quickly and our food came out quickly. The atmosphere was very ambient and upbeat with classic rock playing loudly in the background. The decor was very modern and the booths were very comfortable. I wouldn't highly recommend this place especially for their bbq."}
{"text":"Venue is nice, high ceiling, modern but still artsy decor. Staff is very attentive, Lea and James are amazing. 

Variety of drinks and food is out of the ordinary. Just your usually thing with a kick! Tried the beef brisket croquettes and creole crab cake blt, good appetizers portion and very flavourful! 

Pricey but worth it. Definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"Had such a great overall experience.  From reception to drinks to food and even leaving.  Attention to detail and friendly service who are honest and steer you to some excellent menu choices.  
Starter of Korean cauliflower amazing. 

Had the pit master platter - excellent!  Brisket outstanding!  So much food and the way they wrap the leftovers to go and leave for you at the coat check a very nice touch.

Will definitely go back.

Make a reservation.  It's busy!"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant vibe and food quality. We shared the meat platter and Octopus a la plancha in black beans, amazing dish."}
{"text":"Went with a group of eight last night. Beautiful airy space and attentive service. Delicious food. I had heard the servings were small so I ordered the raw salad with the lobster. The raw salad was a good size and even the side of coleslaw with the lobster was substantial. I couldn't eat the fries that came with it. 

Also really enjoyed at our table were the Mac and cheese, brisket, seared tuna and beef tartare.

Great night out."}
{"text":"This place is really nice and a great step away from the busy hipster/905 crowd which took over the West Toronto scene.

The building is gorgeous, with a massive main room complete with what must be 40 ft ceilings. The interior is half finished, half raw. A nice combo.

We ate in the upper private room which comes with a balcony overlooking the main area and chalk walls to have fun with.

The food was also very good, we had a prix fixe so I don't know if the main menu is good.

Service was solid and we were a big group.

In any case, highly recommended for a try!

Wait"}
{"text":"We had 3 people, and we mainly came for the fried chicken since we heard good things about it.  However, you could only get it as part of the Pitmaster special.  We were not big eaters, so we got 2 orders of the Pitmaster special along with some additional sides.  We were glad we did.

The fried chicken was one of the best I have had in the city.  I like a crunch, thick batter, and it was just right.  The meat was juicy and seasoned just right.  The highlight of the meal, surprisingly, was the brisket.  Normally I am not a brisket fan, but that was one good brisket!  Ribs were okay, and the sides were decent.  They also have a good selection of beer. Service was good.  Atmosphere was good.

The only thing that prevents me from coming here every week would be the price point ($30 pp for the Pitmaster special), which for just BBQ is pretty high."}
{"text":"Sweet looking restaurant with tasty barbeque food, makes Carbon is thumbs up on my books. Came here recently got Summerlicous and was very satisfied with the food and service.

Pulled pork cabbage wrap 4.5/5: This was unique, with a generous portion and pretty darn tasty

Ribs and chicken 5/5: I found this pretty darn good. The ribs were tasty and soft. The chicken was fried to the max while the chicken breast inside was still moist. The sauces on the side were great as well. Generous portion

Atlantic Salmon 3.5/5: salmon was mediocre for me but the vegetables were actually cooked very well. I don't think I've ever had a eggplant with more bbq smoke flavour before.

Desserts 3.5/5: both our desserts were food but nothing standout

The restaurant itself is comfortable and great to sit in."}
{"text":"Ever since it opened, I've wanted to try this place as it looked like it had a good menu and good vibes but I came for the food and it was a bit disappointing and overpriced. The good part was that I got to try the K.F.C. for free with a beverage purchase by checking in. The K.F.C. was nicely flavoured and a great concept but it could have been crispier, a lot crispier. We tried the Pit Master Platter. The pork ribs were a bit dry. The beef brisket was the best part of the platter. The buttermilk fried chicken lacked flavor and was quite dull. And unfortunately for me, I wasn't a fan of the sauces provided with the platter. My bf had the Berkshire Pulled Pork and the idea was quite nice but the portions were quite small and the pulled pork was very dry. And lastly, we were seated near the kitchen and I noticed that most of the kitchen staff there had a beard, I would have preferred if they wore some sort of beard hair net to be safe."}
{"text":"I've been to The Carbon Bar before in the past, but it had recently opened at the time and there were some 'kinks' to work out, so I hadn't reviewed it. I recently dined here for a business dinner though, and have based my review on this dining experience.

My colleague and I started with cocktails for the evening, which included the Smokin' Manhattan and the Pit Fired Old Fashioned. My cocktail was the Manhattan, which did in fact have a nice smokey flavour to it. They didn't specify the alcohol content, but I'd estimate probably 1.5oz for my drink, as it wasn't particularly strong.

We shared the shisito peppers which were nicely flavoured and seasoned, although quite oily overall. 

As my main, I ordered the rock fish and coconut sauce and I was pleasantly surprised at how flavourful it was. It was accompanied by roasted squash, pineapple, eggplant and jicama which were a nice compliment to the meal.

My colleague ordered the brisket burger and fries, and he was incredibly impressed! The server sold it to him as an 'insane' burger, and that it was!!!

The ambience is quite unique overall - I love the smokey smell of barbeque, and the unique fixtures and decor. Everything fits so well together!!

They have a private dining area that my colleague told me about, which is situated above the kitchen area. He could not comment on the number of individuals it would accommodate, but mentioned that he had no issues in setting up a projector screen. The noise level was tolerable and not an issue for his meeting.

Overall, I was very impressed my second time here. The menu is diverse, and the service is great. I wish I could've stayed for dessert! Next time I will try the seafood platter!"}
{"text":"Great selection of bar snacks.  We loved the KFC, (korean fried cauliflower), and yam fries.  Split between the three of us... Looking for a warm snack but not a meal.  House red was $8 but not so special, but cheap enough so not complaining.
Interesting staff set-up... Seems like they have a ton of coverage, staff everywhere, but not readily available either. (4 behind the bar but only one who's really tending to everyone). But we were in no hurry.  Just seems highly inefficient.  
Good spot to meet up for a drink on the quiet side of town."}
{"text":"I know what I like here and I never stray from it.  The raw salad is one of the best in the city.  Pork ribs are tender, juicy and delicious.  The beef brisket is fatty and so very flavourful.  The mini chocolate bar is perfect to finish.  Great service!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to dine here today. The kitchen was slammed being Mother's Day brunch, but I don't think it was any busier than a typical weekend for them, which is why I was so surprised by the food. It was really and truly just ok. I actually sent my Brisket Benny back and ate my daughter's leftover pancakes. Though made from quality ingredients and plated beautifully, it was so dry I could barely swallow it. The brisket was tough, biscuit dry and poached eggs overcooked so the yolk didn't ooze over the other ingredients as you expect them to do in a benny. My daughter's pancakes were good, though slightly overcooked. My husband had chicken and waffles and said it was just ok.

What was great about this place was the service. I don't think you will find a more efficient run team and we were made to feel so welcome and cared for from the moment we entered until we walked out the door.  The Manager was visible on the floor and really did a great job making sure customers were satisfied.  

Another great thing is the atmosphere. Beautiful decor, great music and a real buzz in the air. Overall it was a great experience so we will go back and give the kitchen another shot. Maybe they were having an off day, but dry brisket makes me suspicious."}
{"text":"Made reservations well in advance, and received an excellent table, matched with great service. Had the BBQ platter for two, for three, with a couple of appetizers and side dishes.

It is a bit pricey, but the large portions and wonderful flavours make it feel worthwhile. Not a first date location as the room is loud and the food is messy making general conversation difficult. But lean in close, lick your fingers, and maybe your dates too ... a fun time for closer friends."}
{"text":"Had their brisket and it was incredible! So juicy. It was kind of expensive for two people, but both of us were full and definitely satisfied with our food. The waiters were nice and the environment is pretty cool as well. Such a nice place in a sketchy part of Toronto. I'd definitely go again, just for the brisket."}
{"text":"Delicious! The service, food, presentation yum!!!! It's a cool place, a little loud but we really
Enjoyed our meal! Drinks are expensive but done right!
Started with the Korean cauliflower yum! Then the Cesar salad is fresh, the bacon is a nice surprise and the dressing one of the best I've had! The fried green tomato salad was a little too much fried food for me but the flavors were on point! The red eye steak comes sliced and perfectly cooked on a butternut squash slice of roasted deliciousness with farro and a sunchoke purée wow! The brisket burger - skip the fries and go with the coleslaw take a bite with all the flavors then ditch the bun- the burger is that good! Had the rocky road sundae but honestly I was done after the burger - so good and
Lauren our server was attentive - had great suggestions and made our meal really enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Food is 3/5. 
Atmosphere: 4/5

Carbon bar is beautiful with its high ceilings and retro discotheque style. It really sets the mood for a nice evening out. We ordered:
- duck tacos: duck was cooked perfectly and flavourful. A little saltier than I would have liked. 
- beef carpaccio: light, refreshing, with a bit of crunch. 
- beef brisket: nice smokey smell & taste. But on the drier side so I regret ordering this one. 
- side of fries: delicious but again overly salted. 
- skull chocolate dessert was neat. Small, dark chocolate with a bourbon ganache centre is a great way to end the meal. 

This place is a little pricey for what you get but the atmosphere makes up for it somewhat. That's why I'm giving it a 4/5 stars rather than 3. 

Service was great."}
{"text":"Food was great !! Most yelp pictures don't do the portions justice. Service was a little slow for it to be so empty but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here so me and my husband decided to try their winterlicious menu. As a starter both me and my husband chose the pork tacos. We were very surprised when the server brought the starter to our table as there were not one but two tacos on each plate! This is a very generous portion, especially for being just a starter! The tacos were filled with nicely charred, slow cooked pork and pickled cabbage with nice fresh salsa. It had a little bit of chili but not too much. It gave just enough kick. It tasted so delicious and is probably one of the better tacos I've had!!!
For the main I had the pork ribs and brisket while my husband had the seabass. The brisket was so well cooked: it was succulent, tender and nicely charred. The pork ribs fell off the bone as they were so extremely tender and just melted in your mouth! This came with a side of cole slaw and two types of bbq sauce. Personally I was happy that there were no potatoes or other heavy carbs, since as I mentioned, the starter was so big. I also tried my husbands seabass, which was nicely grilled and perfectly seasoned. So far perfect food experience!
For the dessert I went for the cheesecake and my husband chose the brownie. Both were delicious!! The brownie was served warm with cold whipped cream. Awesome combination! My cheesecake was served with blueberries and oh my was it good! 
If you're still trying to decide which restaurant to go for for winterlicious, I can definitely recommend the Carbon Bar! 5 stars out of 5 possible! To sum up the pros and cons

+ Friendly staff
+ Delicious food
+ Winterlicious menu is well worth the money
+ Generous portions (at least the winterlicious menu)

- They made us wait 20 min despite us having booked a table in advance
- Slightly loud place"}
{"text":"The food was 4 stars but because the service was absolutely perfect, I'm giving it 5 stars.  We were in a rush, so only ordered entrées, no desserts or appetizers.  The brisket cheeseburger was tasty but the bottom bun was soggy.  Fries were quite good. The octopus à la plancha was perfectly charred and didn't have that rubbery texture.  Our server was phenomenal. She made sure we always had water in our glasses, cleared any dirty dishes quickly from our table and checked on us just often enough.  Noise level in the restaurant was tolerable. I thought it would be noisy, but we were actually able to have a conversation and hear each other.

We would definitely go back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Probably best bbq in town. Food was really good, the wait staff were OK."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant for a long time, since my friends have all said it was a good restaurant. We came here last night for Winterlicious. We were seated right away in a nice spot. A server came by to pour two of our waters and left. She didn't come back until our third guest arrived. After he had his water poured, we didn't see the server come to our table for about 15 minutes. It was fine - we were all in deep conversation but just a little surprised that you wouldn't follow up for that long. I would at least check in to see if the table was ready etc. Didn't get that.

When she came back we asked her what she recommended for the appetizer. She seemed kind of confused and asked us what we wanted to know. Thought that was funny, we obviously want her recommendation on what's good. Anyways she said she liked the hamachi poke or the pork bao. Our group ordered both. Friend had the bao - pork was a little dry but the flavour was there. The hamachi poke - had a lot of sesame oil. It was good but the tuna just wasn't there for me. Not overly impressed.

Our main dish, friend ordered the snapper - he said was it was good. My other friend and I ordered the fried chicken and ribs. I thought this dish was nice looking and very full. The fries and chipotle mayo were delicious but I wasn't overly impressed with the ribs and fried chicken itself. I thought the fried chicken lacked flavour surprisingly hence why I gave this restaurant 3/5.

The desserts were great. We each tried the carrot cake, dulce de leche ice cream with caramel corn and apple crisp. The apple crisp was our favourite. It was nice and crisp and the  vanilla ice cream paired well with it. Can't go wrong with vanilla ice cream and apple pie :)

I'd like to give this restaurant another try since it seems like the average rating is pretty good but I'm not sure I will based on this experience. The ambiance is really nice which wants to pull me back. Maybe it was a one off because of Winterlicious, but I expected more."}
{"text":"FOOD: This joint specializes in their BBQ plate. The brisket was nice and moist but I found that the flavour was superficial. The fried chicken  tasted like a drier version of a massive fast food joint. The ribs were just ok. 

DRINKS: these were great! Nice and strong 

SERVICE : wonderful. The staff were attentive and courteous. 

This is a nice place to take a date. The setting is really cool.  The food is not bad but just not up to par with BBQ joints I've been to."}
{"text":"Burnt beef ends, and Mac and cheese. Some of my absolute favourites! Great vibe, great food."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on Friday night. The concept is take on southern cuisine. High ceilings and industrial chic give the dining room a larger than life feeling. The place was lively but not too loud although I personally felt that the tables were too close to each other. 

The cocktail menu is mostly focused on brown spirits. They are on the expensive end but I enjoyed my Alibi (tequila) drink.

Portions are modest in size but depending upon what you get you may get full pretty quickly. Unfortunately their side dishes were not too exciting to order. For the appetizer we shared the goat papusa with cucumber relish. This was one of our favorite dishes of the evening. 

For entrees, we shared the blackened sea bass and grits with mushroom. The sea bass had accompanying sauces that elevated the dish and the grits were very comforting. Unfortunately the fried egg was not runny which was a bummer :( 

For dessert we had the pumpkin pie ice cream. It was a very balanced dessert not too sweet which I prefer. The service was spot on for the most part including the front desk. 

We've been to Nota Bene before but never felt like going back again, I guess the food there was solid but did not wow us. We will definitely come back here with friends though."}
{"text":"Never really had bbq food before so I figured it would be a great place to go to for an anniversary. Gave the restaurant a call to make a reservation but was told it would not be possible as they were fully booked. However, was suggested to get there before 6pm for a seat. I obliged. 

Got there at 5:38pm and had a great start as there wasn't a lineup! Was quickly seated and server payed close attention. Started with the free KFC(Korean fried cauliflower). Mind was completely blown at how they made cauliflower taste like fried chicken!

Next came the pit master for 2, corn bread and collard greens. On the pit master there was 3 delicious meats to chow down to. First the brisket. Oh my god did it melt in your mouth. Extremely succulent. Ribs just fell right of the bone. Chicken thighs were battered to perfection and golden. Every bite just made me want more. The collard greens were standard. The cornbread was okay. 

Overall the food was delicious and they will see me again shortly. Staff was also friendly."}
{"text":"There isn't one bad thing i have to say about The Carbon Bar.  Coming from Brooklyn, NY, which has its fair share of BBQ joints, I have yet to find the best Brisket I've ever had........Until i found this place.  Its got that sugary, not overly salty, candy like bark that triggers the release of excess dopamine to the brain.  This is what i look for when it comes to BBQ.   We got the Pitmasters Platter which had Brisket, Ribs, Buttermilk Chicken Fries w/ Chipotle Mayo and pickles and it was beyond our expectations.  Really nice looking place too!  Its definitely trendy and gives off an upscale look."}
{"text":"Amazing! Whatever you order here will be awesome, also the staff is super nice! I don't even like BBQ and I wanted to eat my husbands entire meal by myself. He ordered the brisket and I had he salmon. Even thought the salmon was perfect, when we go back next time I'm definitely ordering either the ribs or the brisket. They use really high quality meat unlike most places that use low quality meat and cover them in BBQ sauce instead to hype it up."}
{"text":"Five Star-Funky! Touring around Toronto this summer we  met with friends for a birthday celebration at the Carbon Bar in the Queen/Jarvis area. 

Cool vibe from the moment you walk in. Warehouse size restaurant filled with attractive mostly-20-somethings all wearing black clothing head to toe. It fits with the Carbon atmosphere. Looks like a lot of staff on tonight, and it's only 6:00pm. 

They used to film a TV Dance series in this location, and one of our guests had actually been on that show. 

We heard that they used to film soft-porn on Toronto's TV 'Baby-Blue-Movie-Network' in the 70's here... some murals from that era remain.

Our table orders a round of the famous Carbon' drink 'the Black Mamba Margarita' - staff come to set this small glassed drink on fire at your table. When there are 8 of the drinks at the table it's quite an exhilarating-flaming-experience, yet a little bit scary too. We remind ourselves that 'these are professionals'! Our server tells us this is her first day, yikes.

We heard they have great fried oysters here, but I didn't see it on the menu. Oh yes our server tells us, let us prepare these for you. Scrumptious is an under-statement. The table orders a shared platter of seafood deliciousness, every bite unique, tender, perfect. We had the KFC - Korean Fried Cauliflower, and lots of meat in Pit Master Platter for the carnivores in attendance, everything perfect. Can't wait to return to Toronto for round 2 this Fall!"}
{"text":"The BBQ Mac n Cheese here is the best Mac n Cheese I've ever had. Seriously. Perfectly cooked noodles, a perfectly-paired cheese, and it's topped with BBQ'd brisket. I swear there was more cheese than noodle (i.e.: a good thing)."}
{"text":"Good but not great. I came here with four people and shared five appetizers 2 platters four desserts. Overall the food was okay but found the Bbq platter extremely overpriced for the portion that was given. $81 platter below.
 The four best things that saved the restaurant.
1: desserts are awesome
2: barbecue sauce and dipping sauces saved the meal.
3: service was very good
4: comfortable ambience"}
{"text":"Something in my salad tasted like vomit. The barbecue was pretty fatty meats. The waitress forgot the coffee with my dessert. The food that wasn't disgusting was just mediocre. Overpriced for sure. Atmosphere is cool. Waitstaff is friendly. But damn that place was not good. Oh and their credit card  machine went down and I had to pay. 160$ for two."}
{"text":"I had the 'octopus a la plancha' and the 'shrimp and grits'. The food was just okayish/good, but felt like we didn't really get what we paid for. 

Octopus a la plancha:
I felt like I could have spent my money on something better, the octopus meal was 26$ and the portion was pretty small. I dont think it was really worth getting, but the last time I had octopus, it was amazing so I thought I'd give that a try. The presentation was nice, the octopus tasted okay, soft and tender, I also thought there was quite a bit of black beans, but overall the taste was just okay.

Shrimp and grits:
I thought it was just okay. I thought the breading outside was kinda dry tasting which I'm guessing is because it was baked and my taste buds just weren't too fond of that. My friend and I both agreed, there was barely any shrimp in them, and we tasted mostly the grits. Again not really worth it as we were both really looking forward to the 'shrimp' part of it, it was a bit disappointing. We used the promo on yelp for the free snack.

These two menu items sounded appealing, but I believe the portioning could have been better for the price people pay. Compared to the pit platter, which is $30 people can get way more than the 26$ very small sized Octopus. I know they are more popular for the pit platter, so I hope to try that on my next visit, but I do hope they improve the 'Octopus a la plancha' and the 'Shrimp and grits'"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on Good Friday before meeting up with friends for a birthday party in the bar area to have drinks and dance. 

We walked down a wide and long entrance way with the hostesses at the end waiting to greet us. They offered to check our coats and took us to our table. Let me tell you, the decor, ambiance and lighting completely took me away. It's like being in a cool warehouse spot in NYC. The ceilings are approx 20 feet high and the space is large enough to not feeling like you are on top of other people. 

We ordered the Pit Master Platter and raw salad for dinner. For me the platter had more than enough meat to satisfy my hunger. My bf probably would have wanted more if he didn't snack before dinner. We have heard that portion sizes weren't that large....but those comments mostly have come from my male friends. The salad was a must since the Pit Master Platter is a Paleo lovers dream. We really enjoyed the flavors of the ribs, tenderness of the beef brisket and the crunchy exterioir of the fried chicken. I enjoyed my dinner thoroughly  Beware though, you will be burping up a storm once your meal digests...don't say I didn't warn you.

We ordered 4 cocktails: Smokin Manhattan (order if you like boozy drinks), Carbon Bar Julep (not too sweet and minty; a great intro to bourbon, my fav of the night), black mamba margarita (looks like you are drinking guiness w ice; very tasty), and The Deal closer (good but not my fav). 

After dinner we hung out in the bar area. They had a DJ playing old school 80's and 90's beats. Definitely a cool place to hang out, but don't try to strike up intimate conversation since you won't be able to hear much.

Overall, a cool place to hang out for the night!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for dinner and it was really good.  The korean fried cauliflower is a very good starter to share.  The BBQ choices are great and the fried chicken (usually a no-no) was very tasty.  The vegetarian dish and burger were both pronounced quite good.  No room for desert!  The service was excellent.  They've done a good job with an old building, nice decor."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out with a girlfriend after seeing so many recommendations from other Yelpers and food pics from friends! Made reservations online for two--easy to book. This place is easy to find, just east of St. Michael's hospital. Looks like there is tons of parking nearby (I walked from my apartment). When you walk in, immediately it's dimmed lights but the restaurant decor has modern style and the restaurant itself is huge, so you don't feel crammed in. Looking at the menu, there's a lot of items I want to try but since it's only the two of us, we decide on the appetizer KFC (Korean fried chicken) $9 and the Pit Master Platter $30 per person. This platter is the one I wanted to try the most since everybody has said this is amazing. I didn't have the highest expectations since I don't really care for ribs to begin with but still nice to try. 

I also ordered the Pit-Fired Old Fashioned--I love my old fashioned but this was supposed to taste and smell like smoke. No smoke whatsoever. If this drink was better, I'd give this place the entire 5 stars but this drink was so disappointing. All liquor. There was a single orange peel but really no real flavour. I could've just ordered a straight shot. 

The KFC was amazing. My friend, who doesn't normally like cauliflower, commented that because of how good it tasted, she forgot it was cauliflower and thought it was chicken! I'm Korean so I wondered about all the hype, but I have to admit, this was delicious! Somehow, they got the \"kimchi-chigae\" flavour into the crispy cauliflower. Spicy, savoury, red-pepper sauce, a bit sour and very hearty flavours. Next, the pit master platter was equally amazing. Like I said, I'm not a ribs fan but wow, the ribs were tender. The beef brisket was also perfectly cooked and tender. The buttermilk fried chicken was also very good. Each item, however, was underseasoned, so I suppose the chef wanted each item with the dip but each dip was really nothing special (chipotle mayo, bbq sauce, and one that tasted like a thick vinegarette). The fries could've been more crispy as well. All in all, exceeded my expectations for how well the meats were cooked. I'd definitely come back and try some of the other items, and bring more people next time!"}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ in an upscale setting. I really enjoyed the trendy vibe juxtaposed with informal, down-home BBQ. We worked our way around the menu and tried the brisket, the veal croquettes, shishitos, duck tacos and the fried cauliflower. Everything was great, but the brisket was something I won't be forgetting the near future. I don't even think I needed to chew it. Not to mention they mix a great Manhattan. Definitely going to make my way back to get my share of the pit master's platter."}
{"text":"Awesome. Went for a birthday and had the family style. It was very good. Snacks and apps were tasty and unique. The brisket wAs moist and not fatty. Ribs fell off the bone and fried chicken may have been the best...better than Momofuko. The cod was amazing and I have it a lot on the east coast and equally as good. Dessert was unique a cheddar ice cream bar and banana cream pie were excellent. 

The service was spot on. Attentive and knowledgeable both the food and wine. I will definitely be back and glad we have something this unique in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"VIBE
The space is very New York. But a word about the Electric Circus history because are you as confused as I am about it? From my knowledge: EC was a club held at the CB location before it was the show held at Much Music HQ so the ode is to the club not the show. I could be wrong but I don't think the show was ever held here. Also: does anyone else miss Monica Deol? Ah, the good ol' days. Anyways, I love the booths, I love the Electric sign and I love the high ceilings. It's a cool space and who knew about the location? One of those places you'd always walk by but would never know about (but now you do). Great for groups and of course, dates but it's always busy here on the weekends so pick a weekday my friends. It is a really nice downtown option and the Queen/Yonge/Church area needed this. PS Service was great! 

WE ATE/DRANK 
I'm not going to go into in-depth detail. My yelp comrades seem to have done so already. Here's what was a hit and a miss. 

HITS  (in no order) 
*means we LOVED it. 
*Cabrito Papusa - yes, yes yes! Loved the flavours in this. BUT the portions are tiny. Still...really great. 
Scallops - you get two scallops. Overpriced for what it is but cooked perfectly. 
*Banana Toffee Cream Pie - gat damn! BUT easy on the whipped cream, chef. 
*Hot Mess - a great name for a not so great looking side but oh so good. Great combination of flavours in the sweet potato, brisket and crema. I ate this UP! Again, very pricey for a side at $11 but I did love it and the portion size does it justice. 
**Octopus and Lobster Gumbo - AWW YEAH! The star dish of the night. The flavours, the texture, the lots of sauce on the plate, I wanted to lick the plate but reluctantly refrained. I won't say no to chorizo with the right sauce. Round of applause. 

IT COULD GO EITHER WAY 
Jerk Cornish Hen - Was well cooked and juicy but I think I would have liked to have more flavour from the mango and papaya salsa. I feel like this is something I could make at home so I'd try something else next time. 
The Carbon Chocolate Bar - it's a tiny portion size. Delicious but tiny so I'd split a more appropriate sized portion and skip this but if you want a quick chocolate fix and are stuffed from your meal, get it. 

MISSES 
The Margharita - I'm a fan of classics and I didn't like the sweetness the orange bitters brought to this version. Sorry. 
Hamachi - I remember it being a bit acidic. Dining companion felt it lacked flavour. So up to you. At least the appropriate portion size is there to share. This one was recommended by our waiter as well. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
The owners of Nota Bene always hit the right mark with great food and atmosphere. I like that this one is more casual and vibrant than Nota Bene but it is overpriced for the portions you're getting (if you didn't get the theme through my review). That said, for a splurge, hopefully, I've led you in the right direction for what I would choose here. It's more a upscale version of the down-home American BBQ experience."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and environment 
Good service 
Tapas style food. I like everything from app to dessert."}
{"text":"Pros: 
Take Reservations 
Beautiful interior
Yummy apps and mains (Beef brisket burger, KFC, Duck Tacos)

Cons:
Hella overpriced
Not much available in terms of dessert
Wait staff was attentive but messed up our bills at the end, paid more than we should have

Overall: would maybe go again, but only for special occasions. 3.5/5 cause the end soured the whole experience"}
{"text":"Great find! Had to search a bit fur it but worth it!  Friendly and knowledgable staff. Got in no problem On a Wednesday night. 
Had the quinoa salad and loved it. 
Would recommend!"}
{"text":"the decor is open and modern. the service is consistent and attentive, yet not smothering. though the portions were a little small, i enjoyed all the bbq/smoked offerings. i did not care for the seafood as much."}
{"text":"I've been here once before and I was so happy that I brought my parents in from Newmarket to try the food.  After talking about it for days I called in to make a reservation.  The lady I spoke to said that they were full but it was very likely we would get a spot when we walked in.  I asked are you sure because I live pretty far from Toronto she said no problem as the time we were coming in at, it would be open.  

I come in and ask for a table for 5, they tell me they are completely full and I would be put on a lengthy wait list but once they're ready they'd come get us.  I said how long it would be where the hostess responded more than an hour as we were waiting for someone to cancel....

I'm sorry you're fully booked with no tables available for walk in but you told me to walk in as it'd be likely is get a table because things change all the time but when I come it's over an hour because I'm waiting for people to cancel?!!

Why not be honest up front and tell me look we'd be waiting for cancellations it's possible people might but we never know, rather than telling me hey ya come on down we'll be free.  

I hate poor service more than poor food.  I always say you should be honest with your customers and I felt severely lied to by the hostess,  and sorry if there was a wait list why wouldn't you put me on it when I called in the first place??!!!

What a waste of my time and gas."}
{"text":"Big fan. It's sort of a weird mish mash of pretentious barbecue, comfort foods and sea food. Everything I had tasted great. The decor is terrific - seems like you've walked into a spruced up Mad Men set. Cavernous inside and unassuming facade. Great bartenders and excellent cocktails."}
{"text":"The Carbon bar has an open and contemporary decor. There is a nice bar area along with a sizable dining area. The neighborhood is a bit on the sketch side, but it didn't bother me too much.

We came here specifically for the Pit Master Platter, which is a BBQ platter with fried chicken, pork ribs and beef brisket. IT also comes with fries and coleslaw according to the menu, but we only got fries....it didn't bother me that much since I never liked coleslaw anyway, but for others this might be an issue.

Me and my friend was pretty impressed with the platter. For $30 a person, the portion size is definitely great and we were really full by the end. Both the brisket and pork ribs were very tender and flavourful, and the fried chicken (white meat) was deboned and had a very crunchy batter and it was great too.

How does it compare to other famous BBQ joints? Well for one, Carbon bar takes reservations, in contrast to places like Adamson's where you might have to line up for hours before you get anything. I personally actually like the brisket here better than Adamson's (I will probably get some hate mails for this!). I have not tried the ribs at Adamson's so I cannot comment on that.

I really wish The Carbon Bar had other BBQ items such as pulled pork or beef pastrami ribs so that it can be a full blown BBQ joint. Given that they also do other food items like seafood, tacos, brunch, etc, I know they will probably continue to keep a lean BBQ menu, which is a shame since they are doing a great job with the current items.

Overall, I am definitely a fan of this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very cool spot.  Already a favorite in the fabulous upcoming area of Cork Town.  With a focus on fantastic meat, Southern BBQ and Bourbon selection this place always has a cool crowd on any night of the week.  From a guy who did a stint in Memphis and has been all over the South, these guys do it right. I finally discovered their Brunch and Caesar bar this past Saturday, which did not disappoint."}
{"text":"It is great to have a BBQ/smokehouse right down in the core plus the ambience rocks. Fabulous place to go with a date or a group of friends. The service is spot on and the server was thoroughly knowledgeable about gluten and what I could eat on the menu (almost everything!)

They have an extensive drink menu - try the Julep. It's strong, smoky and served in the proper cup with lots of ice. 

We shared the brisket and the ribs along with collard greens and coleslaw. The brisket melts in your mouth (when our server saw us eating the ribs first he popped by and suggested that we eat the brisket first because it's best eaten warmer). The sauces and rubs were amazing and complimented the meat well. 

We finished it off with the salted caramel popcorn ice cream. Perfect Saturday night out!"}
{"text":"Man, the east side is questionable but The Carbon Bar was sweet. Go with the brisket-burger over the ribs. The shishito peppers and cauliflower were bomb... if you're looking for shelter from the whackos on the east side, head into Carbon Bar and bring your appetite - also nice bathrooms."}
{"text":"You have to go here!! 

This place is just about close to perfect in every way. The food, plus the excellent service, and awesome atmosphere makes this a 5 Star for me. 

I made reservations on open table and when I arrived, I was greeted and promptly brought to the table. They have a coat check at the front which is advisable if you're wearing a jacket as it'll probably smell like bbq (albeit delicious) for a while after you leave. The restaurant is over the top looking, it's like a cool mix of modern smokehouse but in a large warehouse-like building. It's classy but casual, good for any kind of occasion. I noticed some birthday dinners, dates and even some people stopping by for after-work drinks. It's really good for any occasion, even a casual dinner. 

We ordered almost everything off the menu. We started with some drinks, they have an extensive drink menu and some innovative cocktails. I had a cocktail, I can't remember the name but there was gin and some fruit in it, it was awesome. As I mentioned, we ordered a lot of food, some of the standouts were the Korean fried cauliflower, it was insanely delicious, the meat platter which comes with brisket, fried  chicken and ribs, I loved every type of meat, my favourite were the ribs. They were perfectly smoky and tender, as for sides, the pickles, Mac and cheese and buns were delicious, the fries were also great. We also ordered the s'mores sundae and the chocolate dessert for two. Both were rich but delicious, and beautifully presented. 

The service was great, our server was really good with helping us pick our dishes and recommending drinks. She was also very attentive and friendly. 

There was a ton of food. For four of us we ordered the platter for 4 and almost all of the sides. I would probably recommend ordering the platter for 2 or 3 for 4 people and the sides for sharing. It was way too much food with appetizers and desserts. We ended up taking home about 2 pounds of food. 

Price point isn't cheap, it's easy to rack up a nice bill here if you're enjoying all the sides and drinks and whatnot, and it's really tough not to want everything! Probably more of a place for special occasions than a casual meal, however they do have weekly specials like discounts on oysters and drinks depending on the day of the week. 

I will most definitely be back, either for a special occasion, to take advantage of a daily special, or to try the brunch which also looks amazing!!"}
{"text":"The Carbon Bar isn't typically the type of place our west-end centric party would be found at, but we were lured by the idea of trying something new and exciting to make the trek \"across town\". The truth is that no matter which direction you're coming from, the Queen East-just address is about as central as you can get and was only minutes away from the Queen subway station.

I'm not sure whether to blame it on the reservations (they are booked up far in advance, so who knew when we would be back?), their location (having lived outside of the core for a while now, the crowds and traffic can be a detractor), or most honestly - our gluttonous ways, we ordered way too much food. Don't be fooled by this following list into thinking that the portion sizes are minuscule because they are not. With that said, between the four of us, we tried every cocktail and somehow managed to polish off all of these fabulous dishes (minus a couple ribs and half of a pie):

-2 x crisp chicken skins - Basically, these would be Crispers if pork crackling were regular chips. 
-hamachi ceviche - delicate, appetizingly zingy
-raw salad featuring corn nuts and shaved coconut - Gorgeous and texturally tasty
-the Pit Master platter which included some of the juiciest BBQ turkey we have ever tasted and a heck of buttery slow cooked meats
-blackened sea bass with fried yuca sticks - So nicely cooked I cannot wait to come back and order one all to myself as a main.
-porcini n' grits - amazing flavour all around
-hot mess sweet potato fries topped with brisket - A mini gourmet poutine 
-2 x banana toffee cream pies - Tastebud meltingly delicious.

Considering the fact that my drinks of choice were a substantial Caesar and a salt-rimmed margarita featuring St.Germain, I think I got the nutritional intake of several days' worth of nourishment in that one meal. 

Don't miss the cluster of screens at the front bar area that shows curious and inspired short videos curated by CB's GM, Adam Teolis. Whether it's before or after your meal, grab up a seat at the bar and let the friendly bartenders make you something special to  sip while you take in the high ceilings, eclectic crowd, and fantastic acoustics."}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious. This place is hopping, even on a Wednesday where there has been a snowstorm. Got the pork belly in lettuce wrap, it tasted pretty good, the crackling however tasted like fish? Which is strange. Also tried the salmon - it taste kind of like a curry salmon, which is not my thing, but the salmon itself was good. Lemon sorbet with pear tart - it's more like a cake tha a tart, the the lemon sorbet tasted delicious. Overall, would come back to try their platter and the skull chocolate, and maybe their brunch??"}
{"text":"Ladies and Gentlemen, we have found a new favourite! This is the BBQ place I've been looking for all my life. Everything we ordered was amazing. Definitely try the KFC cauliflower thing as an app. Loved the ribs and make sure you order a side of fries because they are the best. Our cocktails were awesome too. The service was attentive and friendly and I enjoyed the spacious and funky decor. 
It isn't a cheap place but it definitely makes for a nice evening every once in a while. Already planning my next visit!"}
{"text":"I had such a great experience at The Carbon Bar!!

First of all, this restaurant is beautiful. I love the high ceilings and the vibe - it's dark, and noisy, and so much fun. It's the perfect place to go on a Friday or Saturday night with a group of friends for a late dinner and some drinks! 

Now let's talk FOOD! 

We started with the seafood platter which is beautiful and was perfect for our group of four. From there, we had the BBQ plate (because when in Rome), for three, plus the Mac & Cheese with Brisket (YUM!!!), and a few of the sides. The cornbread is moist and basically to die for, and the beets made even our beet-hating companion change his mind. 

I would say that I think the BBQ sauces they serve with the meat platter are almost unnecessary, I ended up completely avoiding them and absolutely loving my meal. 

To top it all off, the service was fantastic - we were celebrating an anniversary so sparkling was brought for everyone, and it stayed consistently great the whole not. Attentive, but not overbearing, you know? 

Really, go check this place out!"}
{"text":"went here as a late bday celebration for a friend. the atmosphere of this place is business casual/romantic. the dimly lit place really adds to this theme. i was told the bar turns into a dance floor on weekends -  didn't see this as we went on a weekday

the service was okay..nothing special

the food, however, was very tasety but small on portion sizes. my friend and i decided to share the bbq platter which came with: 2 pieces of fried chicken, 4 pieces of Pork ribs, beef brisket and fries - this also included 3 types of sauces and dill pickles. honestly everything on this plate was fantastic! the meat literally fell off the bones and so tender and juicy. i also had a chance to try my friend's mac and cheese which was so cheesy and creamy/rich. it had a nice crunch from the cheese.

what i didn't like was the drink that i got. i had requested for something fruity and was recommended the black mamba margarita - it definitly was not fruity but rather bitter"}
{"text":"The food is just way too overpriced for what it is.  We had a bunch of $8 snacks, the hot mess, the raw salad, and the lobster soup, all were small portions, but did fill my appetite.  The lobster soup was served cold, and just didn't have the flavours seeping out to justify a cold soup.  The deep-dried oysters were delicious, but whatever you do, don't order the deep fried chicken skins.  Each of them are the size of a large chip, but we were only served 3 of them (3!!!! for $8??) with some sauce like a sweet chilli thai. 

Nothing to rave home about.  

And the decor is nice, but reminiscent of a milestone's or earls."}
{"text":"Blown away. Very, very accommodating, willing to adjust portion sizes so you can try more of the menu. The food is delicious, grits are savoury, brisket melts in your mouth and the ribs were a nice dry rub version. Add sauce. Just 2 very minor quibbles, need a brush for the sauce spoons just aren't great and dipping ribs is wrong, and it would be nice to have a more unique sauce, maybe a white sauce?"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  It's been a long time since I could honestly say that about any place.  

I'm going to use Justine H.'s rating categories:

Food: 5
Service: 5 
Ambiance: 5
Overall: 5

I love the cool decor and vibe of this restaurant.  It feels like you are dining in an converted factory space with the crazy high ceilings.  

Our server, Sam, was awesome.  We sat upstairs at the table on the mini balcony overlooking the entire restaurant.  Despite the fact that we were upstairs, Sam was always at the table when we needed him.  All of his recommendations were also bang on.  I can't remember which of the 3 starters I enjoyed the most but it was probably the Hamachi, with the Crispy Chicken Skins (a must try - loved it without the sauce) and the Raw Salad (delish!) a close second and third.  The Hamachi, however, is simply outstanding and one of their signature dishes.  I can't wait to go back for this dish!  Mouth watering...

For the mains, we shared the jerk cornish hen and the blackened sea bass.  The cornish hen was good but was probably my least favorite of all of the things we tried.  The sea bass was amazing - I would highly recommend this dish.  

We saved room for the Banana Toffee Cream Pie - their signature dessert.  The two us could only finish half of it since it was very rich.  It was an outstanding way to end a fabulous meal.  

Next time, my girlfriend and I will go back with our men so we can all try and bbq dishes.  We are already planning our return trip."}
{"text":"3.5 stars .. solid service & nice atmosphere.  The flavours were just lacking... is it weird to give the best nod to the vegetable in a BBQ?  Also, Anthony S is right about the neighbourhood... do NOT keep walking east along Queen St at night.  Sketchy might be an understatement

My thoughts and consideration about BBQ come from a very passionate group of restaurateurs and pit masters I befriended a few years ago in Dallas.  It could be a regional thing but to them,  good 'Cue' stand on its own and doesn't need any of the soppin' sauces those northern Tenn folks do to hide their meats.  That sentence comes with heavy twang and a heavier dose of passion.

So I came to Carbon bar to sate my rib craving and I left a bit puzzled.  For starters, the restaurant made great use of the former Electric Circus space... it has an amazing tall ceiling that just gives a flare to the room.  The seating is quite comfortable and thank god their AC works (heat wave that day).  Two little drawbacks about their room.  One is their table arrangement.  It's comfortable and normally I wouldn't say anything but today was really apparent on how close the next table is to you.  I smelled the neighbouring table BO and it was not ... pleasant.  It was incredibly distracting and wanted me to vacate the restaurant ASAP.  The second thing was that we were constantly reminded we had another table coming right after us so we only had 2 hours for the table.  To be honest, the neighbouring table wanted me to leave after 30 minutes but the 3 reminders (phone, hostess, and then another wait staff) was a bit much.  I do get it that this is a business and tables turned = a successful night.  So go get that dollars Carbon... maybe not just beat me over the head with it.

So the really great waitress here helped us and suggested we get a snack of Korean Fried Cauliflower to compliment the Pit Master Platter for 2.  She thought it would be more than enough food.  She was right on both accounts.  The KFC was great and totally see why it is their number 1 snack that has been there since day 1 and that the Pit Master is definitely enough for 2 people.

Korean Fried Cauliflower (KFC) - Oh yes, this is the must do when you're here.  Light crispy battered cauliflower that is just hot from the fryer and they perfectly coated (not too much...  not too little) with a Korean influenced sauce... it felt like it was a combination of sweet, heat, and a touch of fermented sourness.  Im guessing a modified gochujang sauce. Loved this one 5/5. 

Pit Master Platter for 2 - It looks damn impressive but it just fell a bit flat on some things... mostly from flavour and serving temperature.  It comes with a lot nice things - brisket, ribs, deep fried chicken thigh (deboned), fries, pickles, with 3 sauces.  To summarize the flavour issue, I felt they were scared to season the meat to stand alone and rely more on the sauces that sit beside the meat.  

The best thing I felt were the ribs .. it wasn't dry, had a good tender chew (its actually not a good thing when it drops off the bone too easily), and had some flavour but it was moderately warm.  3.5/5

Brisket was very tender but it lacked flavour... we had to use the sauces for sure.  It also felt like it was served just slightly above room temperature.  3/5

Chicken was very moist and nicely fried up.  Great crisp edges on the crust and not oily.  It just missed seasoning in the crust... no salt or pepper to season it up.  This one was served hot so it was good to eat. 3.5/5

Fries were served unsalted (or super lightly salted) and cold.  This was a disappointment and though you could use the sriracha mayo to bring up the flavour, eating cold fries wasn't so good. 2/5

Overall, it could be a great bbq place if they upped their seasoning and rubs and served their food hot.  I think the service is good here and not a bad place to enjoy good food.   It could be a clear 4 star if they just tweaked those.  I'm heading to Stack and Barque to see how the rest of Toronto compares to my Dallas memories."}
{"text":"Most delicious meat!

Went to Carbon Bar last night with a group of 4. Book in advance - yes, reservations required even on a Monday or Tuesday evening. It's that popular.

Spacious interior with high vaulted ceilings, a great set up, most tables are wall-facing so you get one side or each table as comfy booth seating -  no awkwardly placed tables with people walking around you at all times.

Our hipster-ish waiter was super helpful and accommodating, didn't mind that we lingered waiting for our 4th guest (who was stuck in an elevator somewhere, apparently). Didn't rush us at all.

When we finally ordered, the food came ridiculously fast. Bonus as we were starving. Between 3 girls, we shared the meat platter for 2 ($58) and 3 sides - fries, the \"hot mess\" sweet potato and collard greens. This was the perfect amount of food to completely stuff all three of us girls.

The BBQ was ridiculous - pork ribs were good but the beef brisket really was out of control. Highly recommend. The platter also came with turkey, some kind of sausage and some pulled pork. Everything was good but the brisket was the standout for me.

We also sampled a few desserts, the raspberry compote and the cheddar cheese ice cream sandwich, which admittedly wasn't too cheesy but unique and delicious.

My only slight complaint here is the booze is very spendy. My friend had a $17 glass of white wine and that seemed to be an average price. 

Compared to other \"BBQ\" places it makes for an expensive dinner, but Carbon Bar has taken the traditional BBQ and made it a classier experience."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Good Friday and got a table for 4.  

This place is all about casual. Servers wear jeans and t-shirts, and even the sneakers are part of the uniform. I liked the fact that this approach is unglamorous. However the dining room is glamorous. They've got Electric sign on the wall (which was the former home of the Electric Circus Nightclub) and a Donald Duck figurine by the chef's table (which this place was used by Disney as a rehearsal studio).

We opt for the Pit Master, double order of KFC and Mac n Cheese. Brisket was tender and juicy. I didn't like their sauce that came with it. There might be MSG in the ingredient because I was drinking tonnes of water like a horse. Southern Chicken was crispy and juicy. Love it!!!  Not the best Ribs but passable, the meat should be fall off the bone. The KFC was super deelish! Spicy level was just about right. Mac n Cheese was super creamy and cheesy. The fries was a disappointment. Sorry but I find Harvey's fries trumps this place. 

Overall, we enjoyed our dinner here. Service is A+. They constantly come over to our table to pour water into our empty glass."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally came to check out Carbon Bar last night, and we're so happy we did!! It definitely wasn't over-hyped for us. 

The location is a bit odd - it's down Queen Street East, a bit off the main Yonge area. The hostesses were very friendly, and checked our coats for us. I really like that they take your coats, so you don't have to deal with all of the bundles at your seat. We made a reservation and were brought to our seat right away. I was a bit surprised that the restaurant seemed quite empty for a Friday night. There were still enough people to make for a good atmosphere though. 

The restaurant itself is gorgeous - it reminds me of a restaurant you would find in Vegas, and not a traditional BBQ restaurant. The ceiling are high, and the decor is dark. Our server was pretty nice, but could have been a bit more attentive while we were eating. 

To drink, my husband got a beer and I wanted to try a cocktail, so I got the 'Strait' Outta Hudson ($13), which I would recommend. It had blood orange in it, which was unique, and a bit sour/sweet. I thought it was decent value for the drink. 

To eat, we got the pit master platter ($30 per person), which comes with brisket, fried chicken, ribs and fries with chipotle mayo. There are also pickles and two types of BBQ sauces. Everything was delicious, and thinking about it is making me drool! The brisket was crispy on the outside, but was falling apart because it was so tender. I really liked the ribs too, but it was probably my least favourite out of the three options. The ribs were meaty and not overly fatty. The fried chicken really stole the show though. There was no bone in it, which I appreciate, because I feel like you get more meat! There was a good batter to meat ratio, it was so juicy and the batter was nicely seasoned. To die for! The fries were also quite good - fresh, hot and crispy! My one complaint with this is that the sauces were barely filled in the ramekins. We barely got any chipotle mayo for the fries and the two BBQ sauces. Because our server had not come over, I asked another server for more of the two sauces, and he only brought us one. We finished it off so fast. It really annoys me when there is delicious sauce to go with something, and they don't bring you any! There was so much meat on this platter and not nearly enough sauce. Next time, I'll ask for like five of each to start off with. 

We also got the korean fried cauliflower ($9), which was really excellent. You can't go without having that! I would love to say we had room for dessert, but that wasn't happening. I basically had to be rolled out. 

We will definitely be coming back here. While the prices are a bit steep, you get a lot of food for the price. It's pretty good value, and we left feeling nice and full."}
{"text":"So glad to give this place a visit... ...lovely food and outstanding service....don't make the same mistake of coming too late like we did....no luck on the bbq n the chix skins for us tonight. .

Everyone here just has a lot of fun and the place is a good size so it's not too noisy and you can hear what the other person is saying."}
{"text":"It's a perfect spot to entertain people who are visiting from out of town. Vegetarians steer clear though. I recommend getting the platter if you're with a group of people. Share the K.F.C. (Cauliflower) - that's a must. It somehow tricks you into thinking you're being healthy even though it's too good to be. Enjoy the good music, the dimmed lighting and the cocktails. I brought a boss from the south in who's a BBQ enthusiast and he said Carbon Bar was incredible. Enjoy! And don't forget your leftovers. It's waiting for you like your coat check would be and I often walk out forgetting it!"}
{"text":"Food-wise deserves a 4, but service deserves a 0. So, they get a two.

We came here for a birthday and had reserved a table of 14 for 830pm. Policy says 1) dont be late!, 2) need to put down $250 deposit to reserve the table, 3) Must order the family style sharing menu if we are sitting at the chef's table

We followed all the rules, and even arrived 15 minutes early. And then, were not seated until 9:15.... 45 minutes after our reservation time -____-

According to the hostess, there was a table of two who had eaten and paid, but were simply not leaving. So instead of the restaurant giving them a time they needed to leave by (as alllll restaurants do when they have a later seating - especially for 14 people!) or relocating them to another table, they made our table of 14 wait for 45+ minutes in their lobby. Ridiculous.

Our server joked \"hahah sorry for that longgggg wait\" and with no other apologies or compensation from the restaurant (c'mon, a cheap free app or smth would have redeemed them...), we irritably sat down (not at the chef's table though! another mixup!) and began the family sharing meal or aka \"the carbon bar experience\".

Pretty good food, but not much of an \"experience\". Courses took forever to come out, and 2 hours later, by the time the star of the night emerged --- the Carbon Bar's infamous meat platter --- everyone was stuffed. We were constantly waiting for the next course, waiting for service, waiting for water....wait wait wait

Finally after it all ended, and our server had left for the night, a new lady was clearing our table. Since old server said we would get a new server we assumed it was her. Asking \"can you get us the cheque please?\" she VERY RUDELY replied \"I am NOT your server\". 

But that's not the best part. Since courses took forever to come out, and since there were so many leftovers due to excessive-waiting-induced-fullness, we took home a ton of food (packed in the kitchen, by the server). But guess what?! When the bags were opened the next day at home, more than half the leftovers were not there! Icing on the cake!

The service and attitude at this place is definitely the WORST I have ever received in a Toronto restaurant. With the abundance of competition our there, there should be pretty embarrassed as they don't only fall short, but they have fallen allll the way to the bottom."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for winterlicious, another friend went and enjoyed the beef ribs. The seafood salad was tasty with a nice assortment of seafood.. The beef ribs were super good,  pretty much fall off the bone tender and it was a pretty generous portion.  We also got a couple of ribs on the house - not sure why, but I won't complain :) 

Dessert was a caramel corn ice cream.  Dulce de Leche ice cream drizzled with caramel and some side caramel-soaked popcorn. 

To top it all off,  Monday was 50% off most of their bourbons and ryes.  

Love the decor here, so lovely and rich. 

Would recommend, yes yes."}
{"text":"Impeccable service. Delicious Food. Fancy Decor. Higher than average price. 
That's how I would sum this place up.

The KFC was nicely fried and didn't feel oily at all. I personally thought it could've had a bit more sauce, but it was still full of flavour as is. The superstar is the meat platter- if you can overlook the high price, you will fall in love with the ribs! I'm usually not a huge fan of brisket, but it blew me away. Had nothing to complain about the fried chicken either. 

Obviously, you can get equally as good smoked meat elsewhere for cheaper but one would come here to impress or for a nice night out."}
{"text":"Nifty spot, friendly and attentive staff. Oh, and the food... interesting and creative. Wish I had the appetite to check out their whisky cart!"}
{"text":"Just, just go drink a Pit Fired Old Fashioned will you. Believe me, it is like none other, you have to take my word for it."}
{"text":"This review of The Carbon Bar is based on my \"Happy\" Hour experience when beers and bar snacks were all going for $5. So is this review bias? I guess kind of....

BBQ Dusted Crackling ($5) with Sweet chili vinegar
K.F.C. ($5) Korean fried cauliflower
Goose Island IPA ($5)
and Complimentary Snack 

Only offers at the bar area and Served Thursday through Saturday (11pm - 2am)

I love the bar area as it feels spacious and if you don't want to sit on a bar stools, there are small table for 2/4 on the side. Service was fast and efficient. 

I haven't try any BBQ items on the menu which the restaurant is famous for. I guess there will be a next time...."}
{"text":"READ THIS REVIEW. The ambiance was great 10/10, our waitress was great too 9/10, the food was decent but overpriced 7/10.
But i will only give 2 stars for the following reasons:
1. My gf ordered a martini and we were brought a $12 cocktail. When we told our server, they replaced the drink by simply pouring it into a martini glass and added a shot of vodka and charged an additional $8. So we were charged $20 for a mixed cocktail with an extra shot of vodka when we ordered a martini. When we asked about this, we were told we were getting a deal because martinis cost $21.
2. We ordered oysters with our dinner and when they came out, we were not told which oysters were from where. We decided to order another round and could not say which we preferred as we didn't which was which. So my gf tried to describe the taste of which she preferred. Our next order eventually was brought out by a different server who proceeded to explain \"the chef shucking oysters has 25 years experience and has never heard oysters described that way before, so try the oysters again and tell me which one tasted how you described them. They are either bland or (can't remember the other word he used) but never the term you used. I'll be back for your answer\". That server never did come back.
Wow...never experienced such arrogance before. I guess this place has already reached that level where the clientele are not the priority. I won't be paying a premium again to be treated like the establishment is doing me a favour when I dine there."}
{"text":"I had the BBQ share platter, it had brisket, ribs and fried chicken. The brisket was good, the ribs were OK and the fried chicken wasn't good at all. At $30 a person you're better off going to a real BBQ restaurant. Despite the food, the service is excellent."}
{"text":"The staff were accommodating and friendly. It was packed and there is a 45 minute wait. I had the short ribs which were dry rubbed and fell off the bone. Ditch the side sauce you don't need it. They were smoked properly. My friends had the tomahawk pork chops which they say were delicious. The three stars are for the wait not the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday close to 7pm with no problem on getting seating for a table of 2. The server was very helpful and recommended the items from the woodfire pit - Ribs and Brisket which were a big hit. I didn't know until later but if you check in and order a drink you also get a free snack. 

Brisket - The star of the show. Perfectly juicy with just the right amount of fat and came with a unique bbq sauce and mayo that tasted like there was ginger in it. 

Ribs - Were are also great. I appreciate it wasn't overly saucey and the meat just fell off the bone so eating it wasn't a messy ordeal at all. 

The sides we ordered were cornbread and mac and cheese which was all good but maybe a little too heavy with all the meats we ordered already. At the end, I'm bloated and even until the next day. But it was an enjoyable experience overall. This quite a trendy spot and I just have to compliment the washroom.. it had this spotted pebbled floor which was interesting and unique."}
{"text":"Got there 5 minutes before opening for brunch. Waited 20 minutes total. 
The lights were on but no in sight inside. No one answered the phone.

When you say you open at 10:30 AM...please actually open at 10:30 AM. For all I know they could have opened 30 minutes late. Seriously....was looking forward to it. Not cool."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and find the food very tasty love the barbecue also had amazing desserts. A little on the noisy and pricey side but a fun place to go."}
{"text":"Had a Valentine's Day date here and was very happy with with this choice. 

We had the prix fixe menu for Valentine's Day. Some of our 5 course meal consisted of shrimp ceviche on tostada, Caesar salad, beef brisket, ribs, turkey, deep fried cauliflower, scallops, chocolate truffles and cheesecake. It was a lovely meal. 

The service was excellent. Probably some of the best service I've ever received at a restaurant. Upon entry, the hostess was warm and inviting. We were seated quickly and asked for drinks promptly. The server was courteous, kind and diligent. 

The decor was quite delicate, in my opinion.    Nothing overpowering. It was a great setting for the 20s to 30s crowd. 

Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday and the service and food were fantastic. Food was great value for the price. It was family style and the platters were a hit for everyone. Table was great for 8 guests. Round table allowed everyone to socialize. Ambiance was great and large open concept. Drinks were unique but expensive and if you want to overindulge this wouldn't be the place."}
{"text":"Really awesome place if you like meat. We ordered the Master Pit Platter which gives you a selection of three meats for $34 person along with pickles and fries. It was a lot of food, but everything was done really well. A lot of attention was put into the service of the restaurant. Decor and atmosphere had a cool lounge vibe, although it's on the louder side. While a bit pricey, it's a nice place to go out and I look forward to visiting again. You definitely need reservations well in advance as they get very busy."}
{"text":"Hands down the best brisket I have had in the GTA ..so far!
(Adamson is next on the hit list)
Back to carbon bar...
Great ambiance, great service (although the get in get out feeling has to be toned down a bit)
The bourbon cart is awesome... if you enjoy brisket and bourbon.. You have to hit this place and be sure to get the \"burnt ends\". You are welcome!"}
{"text":"Bought to you by the same team behind Nota Ben, The Carbon Bar (@TheCarbonBar) definitely have big shoes to fill.With food bought to you by the same and only Chef David Lee, it's was very promising. We headed there last Saturday for the Birthday of fellow foodie Justine (@foodigatorJ) since the large space is perfect for hosting larger group.

Love the super high ceiling with the brick wall, the booths and the big round light fixture that was perfect for the space. Love the brightly lit room instead of the dark restaurants that I am rather bored of, it's just so much more lively... and really, I like to see what I am eating.

Love how they have bits and pieces in the decor which is nod to the space former self such as a Disney rehearsal space, City TV Broadcast studio and nightclub Electric Circus.

Collective Arts (@CollectiveBrew) ~ Rhyme & Reason $7
~ This extra pale ale was rather sweet malty flavor which is very easy to drink. Love how the brewery use all those different arts pieces as their label. This is their Label #1 by Halifax artist Rich Aucoin

Cannonball Wine Compny (@CannonballWines) ~ Sonoma 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon $20 for 8oz

Queso De Cabeza $13
~ fried suckling pork, pork & beans, hen's egg, pickled beets
~ Don't you love the idea of having breakfast/brunch for dinner (^_^)
~ This is a rather large app to have on your own, so I would recommend sharing this since it's rather filling.
~ Love the melt in your mouth fatty flavorful piece of fried suckling pig; let's just say everything on this plate was delicious even the 2 slices of brioche toast.

 Crisp Chicken Skin $6
~ sweet chilli vinegar
~ What can I say, it's crispy goodness, perfect with the vinaigrette which cut down the fattiness.
~ But I would have to say rather pricey for 2 small piece of chicken skin.

 Pit Master Platter (minimum 2 order) $29 per order
~ ribs, brisket, jalapeno sausage, pulled pork, turkey
~ This was a 2 serving plate and I find it rather expensive for $56 considering it didn't even came with a side.
~ The brisket was my favorite here, it was perfectly moist with just the right ratio of fat vs meat and not overly seasoned so you can taste the delicious meat flavor while controlling the amount of sauce which was on the side.
~  I find the ribs very salty (you can actually feel sprinkles of salt on top) while the pulled pork was rather bland. 
~ While I am not a big fan of turkey, these was rather moist. Second to the brisket was the sausage which was very delicious with the perfect casing.
~ Next time, I'll probably just order the beef brisket $18 and I am dying to come on a Friday to try their Goat Ribs $16 that everyone have been raving about.

 Porcini N' Grit $19
~ grits, sauteed porcini mushrooms, deep fried egg yolk, crisp kale, huitlacoche dust
~ Love everything about this, from the crispy kale, perfectly fried egg and the earthy porcini with the creamy flavorful grits. 
~ Ok I didn't know what huitlacoche was but after googling it, I don't think I want to know (it's corn smut/fungus)

I didn't try the following 2 dishes!!!

Blackened Sea Bass $22
~ yuca, chili, lime, coriander, tomatillo chutney

 Oak-Fried Octopus $21
~ okra, sausage, hominy corn & lobster gumbo
~ I was originally debating between this and the grits and this end up looking so good, have to order this next time.

 TCB Slaw $4
~ with Corn Nuts
~ Really like this, very different with the crushed corn nuts on top.

 Pumpkin Pie Ice Cream $9
~ rice pudding, barberries, wild blueberries, candied sunflower and pumpkin seeds, spiked eggnog
~ Not sure how to describe this, it's interesting. Definitely tasted like pumpkin pie.

Cheddar Ice Cream Sandwich $9
~ aged cheddar, wafers, maple syrup
~ Love it, the thin crispy wafers with the cheddar ice cream. 
~ Would have thought it would be cheesier but it wasn't but very well balance, not too sweet and perfect with the yummy maple syrup.

Love how they give you a card after packing your leftovers to be picked up at the door with your coat check. 

Verdict :
~ Amazing service, very attentive and friendly.
~ Some hit and misses but would love to come back to try more dishes especially the Goat Ribs.
~ My fave part was the decor with the high ceiling, brick walls & cool lighting."}
{"text":"Erin rocks the gastro libation pallet! A true Alchemist and scientist with her concoctions. The MOST friendly staff at the bar! We were the first to have the Buffalo chicken Sandwich Monday's. D E L I S H !!!!

Her Mamba is amazing and AARON  rocks the professionalism and bevies.

Love this place. Puts Los Angeles to shame

Will be back"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for dinner. Let me start by saying that the atmosphere is really relaxed and super friendly staff. The drinks were wonderful and the food was amazing, they even gave us an extra portion of ribs. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Amazing place for drinks and apps. Their old fashioned is spot on. However I came here for Valentine's Day and had one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life. The food was horrible and the service was aloof. Felt like I was in a school cafeteria, except one that costs $250 for two. Definitely do not come here for V day"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to finally try this place! Came here last night on a Friday night with a group of friends. Service is friendly, helpful, knowledgable, and attentive! They had plenty of new menu items and new drinks added just the day before. Servers were helpful and attentive when we asked about the menu multiple times. 

The menu is mostly southern style cuisine with southern style drinks. They accommodated our group of 3 really well: at first mentioned we could only have the table for an hour at 9pm, then they moved some stuff around and said we could stay for as long as we wanted.

Between the 3 of us, we shared:
Apps - K.F.C Korean style cauliflower, and antichuchos (4 bbq stick style meat tenders). The KFC was delicious, definitely recommend! It was saucy on the outside with a balance of flavours, and crispy on the outside. Small portions though, good to split with 2 people. If you have more than 2 people, than order more than 1 of each! The meat tenders were okay, a bit dry, could have benefitted from a dip or additional sauce.

Mains - brisket cheeseburger with fries ($24), split the ribs and a side of mac and cheese with a friend. The cheeseburger was a lot of meat, but tasted great! The ribs are pretty pricey to be $25 for only 3-5 individual ribs with a very small coleslaw. Thankfully, we got a side of mac and cheese ($13), which was creamy, saucy, breaded on the top, and a hint of spice! I wish that was a full menu item, definitely recommend. The ribs were good, a bit dry, wouldn't order them again. 

Also tried the Joker and Thief drink ($14) with gin and prosecco, it was really well balanced and delicious! 

For food to go, you get a number and you pick it up on your way out at the front desk. A bit different! Attached to the bag was a coupon for 40% off brunch if you come back, good up to 4 friends at the same table.

A nice atmosphere, and huge space on Queen St East, great for groups!

I'd definitely come back to try more of their menu + their tasting menu!"}
{"text":"The location is hard to get a reservation so make sure you give yourself a week or so notice. 

The food is great, and together with the service and decor were good and made the evening well worth it.

We had the burger, brisket and calamari. All didn't disappoint"}
{"text":"PROS: the vibe, the location and the service 
CONS: the BBQ doesn't live up to the expectation or reputation

Carbon bar is a good place to go for a date, or even a good place to have a birthday party, but if you really care about the juiciness of your BBQ meat, you will probably be slightly disappointed. 

WHAT TO ORDER: the fried chicken - surprisingly juicy and flavourful, way better than the other items on the pit master platter 

WHAT NOT TO ORDER: The cornbread - dry, nothing is remarkable except its presentation"}
{"text":"So for the first night on a recent trip to Toronto, I was trying to determine what to eat since many of the restaurants that I looked at online were serving various items that used ingredients that I had not taste for.

After leaving a local brew pub and walking back to my hotel figuring I would just eat in their dining room, I came across Carbon Bar.

Upon entering, I was greeted by an extremely friendly hostess who promptly seated me in the bar and my sever immediately came to see what I wanted to drink while I looked over the menu.

CB has a nice selection of drinks and for beer lovers, I found most of their craft beers were in bottles with a few American products which I decided to try the Flying Monkey Ale to start along with an order of their pork croquettes (excellent but the centers were still a little cold).

For my main coarse, I decided to try their BBQ beef brisket ...... holy smoke bomb going off in my mouth!!! This was like my own brisket I make at home in my wood smoker, flavorful, tender and moist. Served with a side of dill pickle chips and a nice tangy BBQ sauce that paired wonderfully with the brisket.

Besides the good and drinks, this is certainly a place to people watch since it was packed full of suits from the local offices hanging out after work.

Prices were a little high for the portions, but good BBQ is rarely cheap.

Definitely a place I recommend and will certainly visit again when I am in Toronto again."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place. Nice venue, great service despite it being huge, the ribs I got were pretty good. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! (I was sitting besides the door, so it's very cold!) but it's not important because I was coming here for FOOD! :)"}
{"text":"LOVED this place!  Thankfully we made reservations as it's quite a hopping spot in Toronto.  As soon as you walk in you smell the beautiful aroma of smoked  meat!  Their staff is uber friendly, bar has some great cocktails served in some cool glasses.  We started with the KFC (Korean Fried Cauliflower) based on some previous Yelpers reviews and boy were they right..great dish! I ordered the Fishmonger Platter that had a variety of raw fish with special sauces and it was excellent!! Definitely recommend it!  Lots of variety and great to share with another person.  Our table ordered a variety of platters.  Their brisket is top notch! As well as mac and cheese was so good that one of our parties at table ordered it again for dessert!  Their cheesecake doesn't get a lot of reviews however it is MUST order! So soft and good.  Can't wait to be back and try other items on their cool menu."}
{"text":"For a BBQ joint Carbon Bar oozes class and elegance. To start we ordered the K.F.C. (korean fried cauliflower), the beet salad and wild scallop ceviche. The K.F.C. was recommended by the waitress as a favorite amongst regulars and while it was enjoyable (the spice was rather mild) it didn't blow our minds. The beet salad was refreshing and beautifully presented while the scallop was so light and delicious with the addition of avocado and lime -- definitely a memorable two biter.

As mains, we got the Pit Master Platter which was definitely the way to go! The selection of perfectly cooked beef brisket, prime rib and fried chicken, all with their own accompanying sauce, along with very well seasoned fries was a huge hit with everyone. While the Burnt Basque Cheesecake was good, it was nothing extraordinary. 

Would definitely come back to try some of their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Went here about 2 weeks ago for my boyfriends birthday and it was one of the best culinary experiences I've had. The restaurant is spacious, elegant yet cool and the food is just too much to handle! For starters we had the goat tart, Hamachi, and the suckling pig. all were FANTASTIC! The wait staff were extremely friendly and helpful. the gentleman serving us helped us navigate through the menu (as some things are quite different). For dinner we had the beef brisket, hot mess French fries, and the octopus and lobster gumbo... again phenomenal. 

High recommended, will go back!"}
