{"text":"The food at Jalapeno Inferno Market Street is amazing! Our server Dee suggested a boss margarita that was the best I have ever tasted! The Manager came around a few times asking if everything was ok and always asked if she could get us anything...everyone here was super friendly and Dee was very knowledgeable and attentive. They have amazing chips that they bring out at the start of the meal that includes the amazing flour chips and very good salsa. We shared the Lobster Street tacos and Sonoran Grilled Chicken Quesadilla, everything was delicious and so full of flavor. For first-time guest, they bring out a Free tamale they have us was phenomenal! Wow! Everything was delicious!
This was our first time eating Jalepeno Inferno, but won't be the last!

{"text":"I really like it here. So surprised by all the bad reviews. I've come here frequently over the years and find the service to be consistently good and the food to be very good too. I tend to order the same things most of the time, but that's because I love them! The 'Boss' margarita is great. The chips and salsa are great. I have no complaints and am always happy to come here for dinner."}
{"text":"Three stars because the food is \" ok\" the service just \"ok\".  I'm walking from this location distance but I typically make the drive to the pinnacle peak/Scottsdale rd location for better food and service overall. Too bad because I was so excited to see them move so close to me!"}
{"text":"Last night was my 5th and last time here. Just like other reviews, it took a little over 20 minutes to get someone to come and take our order (we had to wave our waiter to come over). There was no apology, took our order, food came out (food was ok, nothing great) and then had to flag him down again to get the check (another 20 minutes after we finished eating).

There was never an offer to refill our drinks or a check-in to see if our dinner was ok.

Very surprising considering how many places there are to eat in the area. I guess that's why the place was only half filled at 6pm on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Food was blah. Service was slow. Server was snotty. Won't be back again. This was our first and last visit. Not even curious to try the other location that has better reviews. It's a shame too since the place is nice inside. Kind of small though. It didn't seem to seat a lot of people."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best Mexican Restaurant we have been to from all our travels from Boston to LA. The quality of the food is very high. The service fantastic. Our server Sara N. Was extremely helpful and very personable. We would definitely return and highly recommend this place to anyone who wants great quality food, plentiful portions and very importantly, a server who really cares and knows her menu and whose suggestions were honest and very helpful."}
{"text":"First time here and it was pretty good. We were seated outside and there was a lot of dripping from the misters, which was not great. The food was good but standard and our appetizer came out at the exact same time as our food so there was no room on the table. We ended up feeling a bit rushed."}
{"text":"Just took an out-of-town guest and couldn't have made a better choice!  Great food, indoor/outdoor dining, accommodating hostess and our waiter, Frank, went above and beyond giving flawless service.  Definitely my 'go to' place!"}
{"text":"Ani always makes the best margaritas! She is always attentive to the customer needs for refills! Always friendly! Best bartender!"}
{"text":"We've been fans of the original location for several years. About a month ago we ate at the new one off Puma. The outdoor dining was awesome. A friend was in from Chicago last weekend. We made reservations at Pima. When we got there They had no reservations in our name. They called the other location (not sure why, either you have a table or not). No reservations there, We didn't call there. They said, oh this happens a lot. We were stuck upstairs in a plain, cramped loft. Service was slow and the food not up to par. It was a disappointing and embarrassing evening, as our friend is a chef and we'd been raving about the place. Stick with the other location for a more enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great location and atmosphere, I had the Green Hatch Chili Verde Enchilada it came quickly, it was perfectly cooked, not too spicy just right."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the valley with authentic tasting Mexican cuisine. They have amazing chips that they bring out at the start of the meal that includes the amazing flour chips. I always end up getting either the tacos or the enchiladas which are both great but there is nothing on the menu that is bad. But the real reason I always seem to come back here is their Patron 91 margarita with their special batch tequila. I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  I think our waiter was also tending bar with another person and the service was very slow although we were able to flag down other servers to get what we needed.  Two things I thought distracted from the ambience was a live musician that played everything but music expected in a Mexican restaurant and a pseudo cowboy blowing up balloons for children more suitable to Chuckie Cheeses.  Lastly, there are so many restaurants in the D.C. Ranch area that parking on a Saturday evening is a bear requiring us to walk quite a distance between the car and restaurant.  We will likely go to the other jalapeño inferno next time."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 or 5 times. This time the service was very slow.  They did not bring water for 20 minutes stating the cups needed washing. What should have been an hour meek took at least two hours.  Food was just ok."}
{"text":"Love the food and service was great! I love the mix of corn and flour chips. Spinach enchiladas are amazing. The whole family really enjoyed everything. Our server was nice and pages attention to us, but also didn't smother us. Great dinner!"}
{"text":"I brought my family here for lunch the day after Christmas.   The food is always good, but the service was atrocious. Although polite, it took 1 hour to get lunch. The restaurant was barely 1/2 full, so no real excuse for such  lackadaisical service.  Nice kids, but need training.  I'm terribly disappointed."}
{"text":"The food at Jalapeno Inferno Market Street is amazing! Our server Kelly suggested a boss margarita that was the best ive ever tasted! Kelly also suggested the fajitas which my table chose. She was very knowledgeable and super friendly. We will be back because of her!"}
{"text":"WOW! I ordered tamales 10 days in advance for Xmas Eve. They were 15 minutes late in getting them to me, and the reason they gave was they were busy and only 1 person in the kitchen. 
They were hot, and when we ate them 1 hour later, they were tough. They were given to me out of the husk, which when I ordered them I was told they were in the husk.
We threw 1/3 of them out the next day, not good.
I called 3 days later to speak with a manager (no name given, just I'm one of the managers) and she said she was sorry, then gave me all the reasons why they are the best...How arrogant. Not worth the trip there again, plenty of better southwest/Mexican restaurants with better customer service."}
{"text":"Mixed experience for us on a Saturday night dinner....we were served water and chips quickly and then waited 10+ minutes for a waiter to show up to take our margarita orders (Ultima and Prickly Pear were both fantastic).  When the drinks arrived another 10 minutes later, we ordered our appetizers and main courses, which then quickly arrived literally 60 seconds apart.  The waitress knew it was an issue immediately - she said that she had placed them as two separate orders to allow time between courses.  So, the service was the worst we have had in a while.  The chicken & rice soup, guacamole, shrimp tacos and chicken burro were all pretty tasty.  The chips were tasteless, some were soft (flour?) and others were crisp (corn?) - or were some just fresh and others old?  I have rarely been to a Mexican restaurant with tasteless chips and canned tomatoes in the salsa.  Bottom line - after the memories have faded in a year, we might return for lunch sometime but never again for dinner as this isn't a place for date night due to poor service and family atmosphere.  Keep your expectations low and simple and all will likely be ok."}
{"text":"Ani is a gem in this restaurant!  She is the best bartender and waitress!  She will make your day!  Go see her!"}
{"text":"I thought it was great!!! The food was good and quick. If you're going for a snack and you're limited on time this is the place. We had excellent food and the bad yelps were incorrect it is awesome! I mean people may not like it like the people like it and if you give a bad review because of it because you want a bad rating on this place you are very mean. I truly encourage you to come! I would send pictures of the food but it was to awesome to show. In other words it was awesome. The waiters were nice and quick food was good. Overall 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Two stars only because of service was decent. All the food came out of either a can or bag. Highlight was the blood orange margherita. This place solidifies my opinion that food in Scottsdale sucks."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner experience...fundidos were incredible, and we finished with the girl scout cookie dessert!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hard to find quality Southwestern food which is light,flavorful and healthy.
The atmosphere is relaxed and staff friendly. And a visit is not complete without a \"Boss Margarita\". The way a quality Margarita should be made.

{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. Great selection of food and friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I took a large group here for our end of the year party and the service was incredible and the food came out perfect. My wife and I have enjoyed the food and atmosphere at the original location for a long time, and they have done just as well with their second location. Great food, drinks and service!"}
{"text":"Hatch green chili tacos are authentic and superb.  Great service here, their teamwork and smiles really shine through."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place just isn't very good. The service was really poor and the food was no better than average. We had the fajitas, they were overpriced, boring and the portions were quite small.  If you are looking for good Mexican food in this area, I would look for somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went during Happy Hour Friday night. Service was great! The manager was helping out the servers and talking to every table. She made the difference and you knew she loved her job and the patrons. Margaritas and appetizers were delicious and sitting outside on the patio in the warm AZ weather topped the experience off!"}
{"text":"Yum!  The chimi that ate Nogales is one of our favorites. Also the hatch chili street tacos."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar for lunch today. They offer street tacos at 1/2 price all day  if you dine at the bar. Ani was my bartender. She was great! Very pleasant and great service. Check this place out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Hits:  ambience, live music and food. Corn chowder and chicken street tacos were delicious.  So was the Dos Equis beer. 

Misses: rushed service (plates cleared when one diner was still eating), had to ask for basics like hot sauce and guacamole, and the bill was presented to us without us being asked if we wanted coffee or dessert.  Also, some employees (managers?) were dressed in (nice) street clothes so it was difficult to ask for service not knowing if the person we were asking was an employee or a fellow diner walking by."}
{"text":"went there last sunday. place was busy but not full.got served chips, salsa and water immediately. never got our drink or food order taken for the 30 minutes we were there. got up and told the manager but all he was interested in was what table we were seated at. the three of us walked out. scottsdale location is great but won't return to pima road location."}
{"text":"Came in last Saturday around 4 for a quick bite to eat. 
Nothing was fresh.  Food was put on a platter and put in the oven to warm up.  The plate was hot but that's about it.  The rice got over cooked and tacos were Luke warm.
Disappointing because the other Jalapeno's  up the road is really good."}
{"text":"My family and I are regulars at Jalapeno Inferno.  We live near Thompson Peak and Pima so the new location is SUPER convenient.
The location is amazing; great ambiance and staff.  My meal was below average.  I had a machaca beef chimi plate my first and only visit to this location.  Every meal (20+ visits) at the pinnacle peak location have been top notch.
I won't return to the Market Street location until I see additional positive reviews regarding the food.  My guess is it was a fluke but you know we have many choices!"}
{"text":"Not much flavor in their fajitas, add some more  spices and marinade to your carne and shrimp. 
Could of made it so much better at home."}
{"text":"I really don't like giving 1 star. We don't like the food I am very sorry. The Service is amazing."}
{"text":"UPDATE YOUR WEBSITE!  Their Website says Jalapeno Inferno is open from 11am - 10pm weekdays - went to the DC Ranch location at 9:15pm were told that the kitchen closes at 9:30pm pointed out that it was only 9:15pm were then told it closes at 9:00 pm.  Very unprofessional!"}
{"text":"I use to like this place (what was I thinking) but it has gone completely down hill. The service is absolutely atrocious FYI, even if it's completely dead. I asked for a somethings as simple as guacamole for a starter with no tomatoes. The waiter said the guacamole already had tomatoes in it. What?!! You mean to tell me your not making it fresh in the back? He replied that they made it earlier that morning (it was 4:30pm) and that it was in the fridge. Umm, gross! As a Mexican restaurant how lazy are you to not make your easiest staple, guacamole?! Food comes out literally 4 minutes after your ordering, no matter what it is, and on a scalding hot plate. Which means it's all microwaved. Grotesque! This place has lost my service."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot and love this place. Food is always great. Our bartender, Jack, FANTASTIC!  Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant, but the service has consistently been so poor lately that I cannot come here anymore. In fact, it is so bad that I made a Yelp account just to write this review. The servers are all kids that couldn't get into college and hate their jobs as servers. I ordered fajitas for takeout once. Get home to find I received no salsa and no tortillas. Tortillas are an important part of fajitas! I drive back and tell the hostess. She tells someone else that I need chips and salsa, and I say no, I need tortillas and salsa. When the manager finally brings it out, she acts like I am causing an inconvenience. No apology was given at any time. Waiters are inattentive, and the food does not make up for it. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My husband & I stopped  in for just a drink and a snack. The place is super comfortable. Our bartender Miranda was awesome.  She served us the Boss Margs - the best I've ever had North if the border.  We're looking forward to trying dinner next time."}
{"text":"We wanted to watch the football game that was on, but outside since it was a beautiful day. They had TVs outside but apparently none were working, so we sat inside. That was a mistake. It was freezing inside. It was a nice day out and chilly in the shade, so for it to be much more cold inside the building made it difficult to eat comfortably. The flour chips are delicious. Had a few complications with the margarita we wanted. The food is just your average Mexican spot which I was surprised because it's supposed to be an \"upscale\" Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Our food was dropped coming up the stairs, only the fajita meat survived, so they brought that all by itself to the table.  About 15 minutes later everything else came.  They didn't seem to understand why we asked for fresh meat.  Really bad experience all around.  Disappointing since we had heard a lot of good things about the DC Ranch location...at least they compd the fajitas."}
{"text":"Live the coconut margys here! Guac is great too 
Bright & cheery, great salsa! Fun place to take our big family!"}
{"text":"A great place for a good meal.  Staff is always friendly, service is always fast and best yet the food is good.  Great drink menu and one of the best margaritas in town.  My only negative is the constant bad experiences with take out, they are great when dining in but always seem to make errors when taking out."}
{"text":"I've only spent a one short visit to Jalapeño Inferno for a quick drink and an appetizer but my first impression and experience tells me I'll be back.  My buddy Jim and I stopped in after drinks at another nearby spot as neither of us had been here. We grabbed a spot at the bar and were warmly greeted by Dee ( or D? ) and another bartender whose name I'm sorry I didn't get. 

Chips and salsa came first. The salsa is freshly-made and very very good. The chips are equally tasty and and are a nice mix of the usual tortilla chips and some other style. Both perfectly complementary to the salsa.  I ordered the Acapulco Margarita and the \"Old Gringo\" Queso Crisp. The margarita was really pretty tasty, one of the better ones I've had recently. The crisp was good also, if not outstanding, but I'd still have it again. Jim tried the Green Chili Corn Chowder which he loved. I did try some, dipping some chips into the soup. Really good. 

The patio area looks to be a great spot to hang out and enjoy, and I think that'll be my next destination for drinks and people-watching. 

I'll update my review once I make a few more visits here, but I have to say, give Jalapeño Inferno a try. I think you'll agree that it should be on your list to check out."}
{"text":"I am loving the summer daily specials!! All their margaritas are half price on Mondays. I went last Monday and had great food and excellent service!  If you haven't been, you are missing out :)"}
{"text":"Like I said before - this place lacks everything... Ambiance is a zero, cleanliness is a zero, margaritas are a negative 1, food is inedible... The food for lunch is not fresh and it was confirmed by the owner- he said it's been working for 16 years... He confirmed it wasn't fresh.... Get your act together."}
{"text":"Great location in the middle of Market Street at DC Ranch. We have been to their other location so were excited about trying this one out. We got a table outside but were sitting underneath the misters and were soaked within minutes. No joke, I could wring my napkin out. If we go back we would definitely sit inside. We welcomed the chips and salsa when we sat down. My b/f got a $15 margarita that was absolutely terrible. Their special homemade sweet and sour mix is definitely not that special. I had the spinach enchiladas which were very good. The hostess was fun and bubbly and our server was efficient so two thumbs up on for service.

Overall we had a meh feeling about this place. Would we go back....sure if we were in the area. But we definitely wouldn't make the trip specifically for this place."}
{"text":"This place has excellent cheese enchiladas and the black beans are wonderful!!! The chips and salsa are delicious! This restaurant has the strongest margaritas in town! You must order The Boss Margarita!! It is not sweet at all and it is mostly tequila with fresh lime juice. It is very strong but this is how Margaritas should be,,,, it shouldn't be all sweet and sour mix.  This margarita is very similar to something you would get in Mexico. I wish they would add a yellow queso ( cheese dip) with no spinach."}
{"text":"This place doesn't seem busy on a Sunday and I understand why.
Got there.  6 patrons there near empty.  Then got seated.  Waited 10 minutes no approach by waitress.  She was at the bar watching a play off game.  My wife went and asked her for help and she rolled her eyes like we were irritating her.  So we decided to walk out and go to the much busier Market Street Kitchen.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Would have earned a better rating if it were not for the fact that they charge extra for black beans. It use to be a dollar, now it is two. Just roll it into the price of the entrees like other restaurants do instead of nickel and dining. ****************************************
They no longer charge extra for black beans."}
{"text":"Great find.  Hatch margarita was on point.  Home made salsa is legit.  Hatch chile verde was very tasty.  Will come back to try the other items on the menu"}
{"text":"Amazing Market Street Mixer!!! Great service!!! Tequila on Tap and the chips are crazy good!!!!!!! Melody always does a great job with making sure the food and drinks are up to par."}
{"text":"This is a great choice if you are in the DC Ranch area.

I came in with a large group for Happy Hour.
1/2 off appetizers is a great deal, and the Margaritas were delicious. Plus, unlimited tasty chips and salsa.

Service was good and most all the food our group had was great.

I truly hope they add blinds or something. The light coming in from outside was pretty annoying. Based on my first experience, that's my only complaint.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was the only outstanding thing.  The service was inattentive, I was handed a dirty menu and waited for 10 minutes before the server arrived.  I showed her the menu, but didn't get an apology.  The cheese crisp was good, but my fajitas were stingy with the sides.  Many more places to eat for Mexican, after eating here twice and can't say I would go back again."}
{"text":"So I love love Mexican food. I was told this place was good from a friend and so I looked it up on yelp. I love coming to the market place, so I was really hoping it was good.
Wow! Everything was delicious!! So full of flavor!
 Street tacos were great, chips and salsa were great,
Free tamale they have us was phenomenal!, rice was full of delicious flavor, and the \"fat burning Cole slaw\" was awesome... I ate my husband's to make sure I burned more fat"}
{"text":"It's in a fun area with lots of shopping and restaurants. The food is delicious and so are the drinks. They have a patio that mostly overlooks the parking lot or the shopping center, but it's still a nice place to sit outside for a meal or drink. Not always the most prompt service, but if you're not in a hurry, it's perfect."}
{"text":"The food is \"just OK\".....So Americanized, no real Mexican flavor. Everything I ate needed more spice. OK, so I know we are all Gringos up here in Scottsdale, but really?
Give us some authentic Mexican food and you will stay in business for years to come!
The chips need to be served heated, the Guac needs to be more fresh, and the Spinach Enchiladas?  Spinach my foot, almost solid cheese! Not healthy for you at all!
I love the idea that you are in Market Street now, but PLEASE get it together and bring some quality and flavor to your food!"}
{"text":"We try to regularly support the restaurants in the DC Ranch Marketplace complex and have been to this Jalepeno Inferno a few times.  Each time it is the same situation: 

4-5 stars for the food as there are a few dishes we really enjoy.  
1 star for the service.  

Every time we go the place seems to be understaffed.  As is the norm, we had dinner tonight and it took 5 minutes or more to be acknowledged by a server.  After ordering it easily took 25 minutes plus to get our meal and the restaurant was only 1/3 full.  Then, it comes time to pay the bill and the server disappears again.  Finally got the check and she hightailed it away before I could give her my credit card.  I finally had to take my credit card and check to the hostess in an attempt to pay.  The hostess noticed the wait and apologized by saying \"I see the rest of your party left and you have been waiting a while to find your server.\"  Unfortunately the poor service is the norm for this place (as the other reviews seem to attest).  

This will be our last trip to Jalepeno Inferno."}
{"text":"Low end chain Mexican food, coupled with bad service and cold \"sizzling\" fajitas earns this place one star.  Salsa is usually the first indication if a Mexican restaurant is going to be any good - the salsa was very bland and it just went downhill from there. We should have known when we went in and the place was mostly empty but we were really craving Mexican.  A real shame because it is in a super location."}
{"text":"My husband and I always wanted to try this restaurant.  We decided to try it because its close to us and we felt like Mexican food! 
 Its across from the Living Room and Grimaldi's pizza.  
Our waiter was a young man. Friendly and helpful.  He took our drink ordered, he was also the bartender. We ordered a frozen  Acapulco margarita and it was delicious. He also brought some chips and salsa.  Which held us over til our order came out. Which was pretty quickly.  I ordered a 2 combination  plate with the green tamale and cheese enchilada.  My husband ordered the 2 taco ground beef plate.  The sauce on the cheese enchilada was delicious. My my green corn tamale was slightly sweet. But the beef inside the tamale and the sauce was a delicious combination. My husband also really liked his beef tacos. He finished every bite!
We loved everything! And will  be back soon.."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I can't believe it has so many bad reviews. There salsa is the best I've ever had! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place!!! Great ambience and service.  Good food. Will definitely come back. Inferno quinoa salad is great!!!!!"}
{"text":"High end Mexican food. Atmosphere and decor are great, the food is average though. Drinks are strong! Mexican Mule was delicious"}
{"text":"We arrived during happy hour, were greeted by one of the managers.  The table we wanted to sit at (no one else was in the restaurant) was dirty. The manager told us to sit wherever we wanted, tossed the menus on the adjacent table and walked off like a spoiled teenager whose phone had been taken away. The servers were nice and seemed overly accommodating, after I expressed my displeasure with the manager, however, the first impression was set. I'm sure the manager was having a rough day, but his attitude was quite off putting. This was our first visit and probably our last."}
{"text":"BEWARE of Laura the owner, or at least wear your boxing gloves!!
Went with my daughter and grandson for lunch this past Tuesday. Ordered the chimi with guacamole and cheese. Received a dry, almost burnt chimi with NOTHING on top of it! When I asked the waitress about it, she said it was inside the chimi (NEVER in all my years seen a chimichanga prepared that way). Sure enough, found a small glob of runny, hot guacamole inside my chimi YUK. Waitress offered to take it back and have cook prepare how I wanted it. Came back 1/4 the size, maybe 4 forkfuls of meat, just as dry and overcooked as the first but a much smaller version. I tried to eat it but the small amount of meat inside was tasteless and greasy. About this time, an older lady whisked past our table and in passing asked \"is everything fine?\" to which we didn't answer because she was already 3 tables past us when she finished her sentence(while I was trying to find the beef in my chimi). I sent my food back and just told the waitress I was done with it and not to worry. She was a sweetheart. Minutes later, this older lady (who I later found out is the owner Laura) was suddenly in front of out table reprimanding us for not telling HER we weren't happy with our food when she asked us earlier! When I tried to explain what I didn't like about the entree, she disputed everything and tried to make me feel stupid! She rolled her eyes and as she huffed away she said \"fine, I'll take care of it\" to which I said \"NO I'm not asking you to do that, I was trying to explain the problem with my food\"! She continued to argue with us and I finally told her she was being totally unprofessional and rude and we wanted our ticket. My daughter and I were STUNNED at her behavior and could hardly speak! Got bill and she originally charged me for the 1st chimi which was sent back AND the 2nd one!! I was willing to pay for ONE but not 2 awful meals when I was walking away from a restaurant HUNGRY!! She did take it off but shot stink eye our way until we left, NEVER to return again.
Little did she know my daughter and her husband have a very strong presence in Scottsdale so we knew the right people to contact. We were told she has a terrible reputation for \"behaving badly, almost crazy\" and she can't keep employees for that reason. 
Bottom line - the food sucks and the management sucks even worse than the food!
Save your money and enjoy one of the other million or so restaurants in the valley who appreciate your business!! Guess thats why there were only about 6 people in the place at the peak of lunch hour!"}
{"text":"I would rather email our experience to management, but there is no contact info on the website. My husband and I live around the corner and stop by for happy hour often. The last several times we've been disappointed. We recently brought guests. They brought one bowl of chips for 6 people and 20 minutes later I had to ask for someone to wait on us. We were there again this week and we had the same issue. It took forever to give a drink order and forever to get our check. It's like they totally forget about us. It's odd because it's 4:30 and only a few people are there. We rotate going to happy hour at all the restaurants. I think Inferno is off the list for a while."}
{"text":"Love the romantic atmosphere. The food and margaritas were phenomenal and came with a reasonable price tag. I will come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Happy hour deals are AMAZING. Nachos and guacamole are to die for. Margaritas are delicious as well!!! 5 dollar margs on happy hour. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We decided to try it while on vacation. It's a nice place, and maybe it was just a slow night because we went on a weekday, but pretty dead. The service was a bit \"relaxed\", not really slow.  The food was good, but nothing special. The sampler appetizer was a nice assortment, plenty for all. We were satisfied, but I doubt we will return. It may be livelier and tastier during a ballgame or happy hour, but we just didn't feel it."}
{"text":"Good food 
Service is slow
Drinks are good
I'm always overheated in there 
A fun easy spot to visit"}
{"text":"Not sure if the \"Inferno\" refers to the spicy food or the heat of the food.  I came in late and sat at the bar and ordered the Baja Fish tacos.  The bartender warned me that the plate was hot to touch, and the food was also super hot.  Had too wait a few minutes to avoid burning my mouth.  Wonder if it was popped in the microwave.  Anyway, it was a solid fish taco, I felt full after the first one, but had no trouble with the second.
I always ask for a local brewed beer if one is on tap and I chose a Sleepy Dog Chihuahua Pilsner and was satisfied with the taste.  Sleepy Dog has a brew pub in Tempe that I will have to check out.  The bartender was friendly and atmosphere was nice for a strip mall in this arid, upscale, gated community-land.  Prices seemed a touch high as well."}
{"text":"Second try for this restaurant, same result, staffing is insufficient so Patrons suffer with long waits for service.  I was almost tempted to draw my own beer but instead got up and a walked across the street to the Living Room.  Cold beer in hand from an establishment with adequate staff to serve.  Save yourself the aggrevation of trying to flag down a server."}
{"text":"BEWARE OF THE BOTTOMLESS TACOS. It sounds like a good deal but if you finish the first 2 tacos and are in fact ready for more.. good luck chasing your waiter down. A couple of my friends managed to get an order for more tacos in but the second round took an additional 20 minutes to come out and you're only allowed to order 1 taco at a time after the first round?? That is pretty bogus. So basically if you want to get your money's worth (4 tacos) then it turns into a 60 minute ordeal. 
However they do have $5 margaritas and the food is overall very tasty! 
Our server was often difficult to track down but she often seemed in the weeds and overwhelmed.. poor staffing on the managements fault. Like hello, it's taco Tuesday?!
I definitely recommend, just order as much as you can upfront and AVOID the bottomless tacos"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! The food was delicious but from the hostess to the bus boys to the waitress and to the manager, it was horrible. We waited for 20 minutes before ever being offered a drink and that was only after we demanded a manager. The food took very long to ever come. The bus boys do not have any clue how to remove a empty plate or fill a water glass. And the manager took care of our immediate upsetness but never came back to check if it continues to go well or continue to be bad. And at the end when I told her it was horrible she basically rolled her eyes and said Oh. We will never return"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, but their general manager lacks people skills and the ability to provide quality customer service. I go to this restaurant every week.  Today my sister and I decided that we were craving guacamole and chips. Upon entering I saw that they had a text deal that said $10 off any one purchase. We ordered the guacamole and chips and an ice tea which brought the total to a little over $13. When we tried to redeem the offer, the waiter went to the general manager to ask him help to and put it in the computer and the manager said that it was not enough to use. The waiter asked him what the rules were and the general manager said, \"I don't know, but it's not enough!\" The general manager then proceeded to argue with me even though the flyer specifically said $10 off any one purchase. He then Told me that it was off any one entrée and I showed him the flyer which did not have any details. He proceeded to explain to me that it's not good business practice and that he wants people to come in and order multiple meals to get the $10 off to bring in business. I have been a patron of this establishment for several years and I will not be going back after my experience today. The way that I was spoken to and the words that he used like \"coming in for free food\" and the patronizing, definitely made it so that I will not come back! Very poor customer service. Customers bring in business, it's probably a good idea to make them feel comfortable while dining at the establishment. Several years of business ends today."}
{"text":"The food here has been very tasty, but the service is hit and miss. I have had nice servers every time, but for some reason, the last 3 times I've been there, I ask for something and they don't bring it until I'm done eating and then they charge me for my 'extra' thing. It's not about the cost either. ..In business, the customer always needs to be happy, or customer doesn't return with more customers  #buyingpower I #votewithmywallet"}
{"text":"Treat employees like crap, don't empower them. Food isn't bad but definitely not worth the tag. Be prepared to be treated by typical stuck up scottsdale kids."}
{"text":"The conversation at the table right now is all 7 of us asking if we should leave or not. We waited at the host stand for 20 minutes waiting to even be acknowledged. Finally we got sat at a table outside in the corner with no heaters. So we took the initiative to move to a different table. We waited 15 minutes to get menus and it took one of us to go back up the host stand to get menus. 10 minutes after that someone brought us water and chips. Still don't know who our server is but. So far the 45 minutes of this experience had been horrible. Who knows how the food even is... if we ever get acknowledged"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the other location on Scottsdale Rd. A friend from out of town wanted to meet up, and I suggested Jalapeño Inferno, but this one was closer to his hotel. The service was slow, the food wasn't as good - actually, it was down right different, which you wouldn't expect from location to locations - and the drinks (top shelf margaritas) were inconsistent (one was sour one barely had tequila, one was sweet, and one was good. I was disappointed. So was my friend, and i feel like I let him down. I am not sure when this location opened, but they haven't got it together yet. Too bad . . . I love the DC Ranch area. It's just not up to par with the original location."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff and amazing food! Great presentation on the plates. Lunch portions are perfect and I love all the spicy options they have! Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"First time here. Food was great Kelly was an awesome server. The Twisted sangria/ margarita is refreshing and delicious."}
{"text":"If there was a negative star that would be most appropriate.  The salsa is bland, enchilada sauce looks and tastes like floured gravy, the rice and beans seemed to taste as if it were boxed food and the service is extremely poor.  We sat at the table for almost 15 minutes without even a greeting from wait staff and it wasn't busy.  Once again, we left dissatisfied and still hungry and went across the way to the Livingroom.  Don't stop here if you want a good meal."}
{"text":"Waitress was great although everyone seemed overwhelmed ...maybe Bc it's fairly new to open 
The guacamole was excellent other than that everything we ordered was completely over salted :( our family of 6 couldn't finish anything they ordered Bc of all the salt .... Even the chicken and rice soup 
Wouldn't return :( thankfully we had a gift card so we only had to pay 80 dollars for food no one ate"}
{"text":"The food was good. Large portions. Jen, the manager, was awesome. She was attentive and personable- can't get better service then that! I recommend going."}
{"text":"Living near Austin would make you think that we have a lock on Tex-Mex. Nope. If you want the real McCoy, head west much further. This was hands down one of my favorite tex-mex meals and I enjoyed every bite. My only downer was that I wasn't hungry enough to finish it all and didn't have a refrigerator to take the left-overs to.

I started with a Corona and their standard chips and salsa. Wow. Right there it was off to a fantastic start. I was outside on a beautiful day in the shade so this warmed me right up. The chips are a mix of different types and all well appreciated.

I ordered their famous green chili tamales for an appetizer. If it had come with beans, that could have been a meal! The masa was just fantastic. I really truly enjoyed that dish alone.

I asked for a mix of their tacos. I agreed to pay the highest price and instead of getting three of the same, I got a mix. It was worth the variety. From least to most favorite: the mahi-mahi was very good but run of the mill. The green hatch chili pulled pork was just fantastic. I could see going for three of those. The locally made Chorizo was my favorite. Wow, they nailed that.

It also came with a standard rice side. Tasted good, but I had so much I just sampled it. It also came with a wonderfully flavored jacima (sp?) cole slaw. Oooooo. That was good.

Waitress was super busy, but also super good. 

All in all, a wonderful time for me."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot and it's a really nice location. My favorite things I've gotten on the menu, which also happen to be healthy options are the bbq chicken salad and the green chili pork bowl. Both really yummy and highly recommended. My boyfriend wasn't as big of a fan of the salad as I was though. The salsa is okay...I wish it was better because i'm a huge salsa person...but I liked the chips! I'd recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place. 

Came here with the family for a birthday earlier so we could get out for Saturday night (4pm reservation).

We order our food at 5, the place is pretty empty and staff is just standing around BSing, because obv not much to do. I get it. 

They couldn't get the order right, which is ridiculous because we were the only orders to focus on. 

I ordered a burrito with steak, I got chicken. My father ordered his dinner with red sauce, they gave him the wrong meat with green sauce. 

The manager came out and confirmed the problems. He said, \"we're dealing with some things in the back. \" We asked, \"like what?\"  He says, \"getting ready for Saturday night.\"

Really? I guess we aren't important enough to pay attention to. I'll take my business elsewhere because if you don't give a damn, I certainly don't need to give you and your crappy servers any money."}
{"text":"The location on market street is an awesome venue. The service was great and the food is even better. This is my third time dining here and surely I will become a regular! I suggest the chimichanga  any way they make it!"}
{"text":"Very overrated- was looking for authentic Mexican food while on vacation and sorry that we chose this one. Food was tasteless and very overpriced for the product we received. Boss Margarita was the only highlight of the meal."}
{"text":"I really like the location here at D C. Ranch. The bar is super warm and inviting at the patio location is good.

The food that we,had here was very good. I opted for the Green Chili Corn Chowder. It was very flavorful and the presentation rocks! There is a splash of spicy chorizo that really makes the dish.

Being not far from the Phoenix Open makes this the optimal place to grab a bite before, during or after the open. 

The eye candy here is very pleasing (really, it is a dish on the menu). Anyway, this area is about what you drive. Busy sit on the patio and watch the stream of pretentious drive by. It's a joke. 

However, the location is great and both the staff and food are excellent. I do recommend giving it a try. You will not my be disappointed. It is quite the spot to be seen in the valley. A who's not you know...lol.

{"text":"I went here to try and find a good local Mexican restaurant and boy did I hit the jackpot. The food here was amazing. I started with some queso from the appetizers and it was phenomenal. I then ordered a steak Courtney's burrito that was recommended by the waiter Connor and it was spectacular. Connor did a great job serving us and we had some good conversations about current events here in Scottsdale. I look forward to making numerous trips back here!"}
{"text":"Came here with everyone and their grandmother to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. Props to my friend for booking a 6pm reservation well in advance. This location is in D.C. Ranch, and it was easiest to find parking behind the restaurant in the Safeway parking lot. As I walked up, there was a cute photo booth set up, and a table with a quick bar that served margaritas for the happy hour crowd. Our party made it a point to get there a little earlier to be seated to take advantage of ordering drinks at happy hour prices. We also ordered queso, and guacamole for the entire table to share. Both the queso and guac with chips were very tasty. I ordered the Strawberry Coladarita, and although it looked amazing, it tasted more like a smoothie to me, with very little alcohol :( I ordered a two combo plate of a cheese enchilada and a beef enchilada- they got my order wrong and initially brought out two beef enchiladas first. After I corrected them, they brought out my correct order 5 minutes later. The red enchilada sauce unfortunately tasted very much like what you'd get straight out of a can. My friend who ordered the mahi street tacos requested to have her tacos heated up again because she mentioned they were cold. Another friend who ordered the shrimp tacos raved about her plate- there was a generous amount of shrimp in the tortillas. The atmosphere is very relaxed and casual and great for a small crowd. There was an acoustic musician who sang live, although his music choices were interesting for Cinco de Mayo (would have thought they would have played mariachi music to be more festive)  There is also outdoor seating under misters along the patio. Our waitress was nice, but she was very overwhelmed waiting on several other tables aside from ours. Though this isn't the most amazing Mexican food I've ever eaten, this place is worth coming back if you wanted to hang out with friends,"}
{"text":"If you find yourself at Market Street DC Ranch, this is definitely a restaurant worth checking out. If the name didn't already give it away, this is a Mexican food restaurant with a great patio, delicious food and a heck of a happy hour. 

With clouds lingering in the sky and a cool crisp breeze on the first day of March, we sat on the patio and enjoyed a meal here. The margaritas looked amazing but those will have to wait until after Baby D makes their debut, however I did notice that they also have a skinny cocktail and skinny food section which looked appealing for the future. 

However, this review is about the non calorie-counting options on the menu. Believe it or not, this restaurant won best tamales in Phoenix back in '08 so I had to give them a try. If you like tamales, you'll love these. They also had a sweet flavor to them and tasted like a combination between dinner and dessert. Whatever they put in there, they did an excellent job. We started off with the mini fundidos which were topped with amazing jalapeno cream cheese. These were really good and I would definitely come back and order them as a meal (and maybe add a cup of soup). My husband ordered the massive nachos and I have to say, I stole a couple bites and loved them. They are huge and can easily be shared. Everything here is pretty large in portions, so it would be a great restaurant to order a couple items and enjoy it family style. 

I look forward to coming back for Happy Hour soon!"}
{"text":"We have had dinner at this location several times.  The food is good and so is the service.  The location is very nice also.  The Mexican food is good and I normally order the shredded beef tacos.  Be careful with the hot sauce, (not the regular) but the hot as it is hot.  Recommend this restaurant as well as the other Jalapenos location."}
{"text":"This review is very frustrating to write because the food is good, especially the skillet chicken.  What isn't good, however, is the situation with the chips and salsa.  For whatever reason, this restaurant decides to mix flour crisps and corn chips in the bowl on the table, while providing a gluten free menu.  I didn't know there was flour mixed into the corn chip bowl until it was too late.  This is very risky, and they should have a sign to notify diners of this before they start eating the chips.  Management - Please either separate the corn and flour chips, or warn diners when the bowl is placed on the table.  I do not appreciate getting sick from unknowingly eating gluten."}
{"text":"Not sure if this place is \"jinxed\" but the last two restaurants to occupy this location on went out of business. Having tried their other location at Pinnacle Peak and Scottsdale, we thought we knew what to expect. However, I must say we were disappointed. While the ambience was nice and the wait staff was friendly, the food was a miss. It was similar to eating at a Mexican restaurant in the Midwest. The food was bland and just lacked any sizzle.
Best to stick to the other location."}
{"text":"One of our Favorite restaurants! The fried flour chips that come are absolutely amazing. My boyfriend & i almost go there just for the chips!! The sweet tamale's (appetizer) are the best tamale's i've ever had. I get the Chimichanga that ate nogales - so good! the chicken isn't dry at all and it's a great size for the price. Love it here! The patio is cute too. :)"}
{"text":"We have been to this establishment multiple times in the last couple of years and it was always good service and good food. However, this last time was very disappointing. We were there Friday night, it wasn't very busy (pretty surprising) but it became clear why. Our server was very unfriendly, never smiled and really did the bare minimum in serving our table. The food was very mediocre to all 3 of us. 

I'm not sure what's going on with this restaurant but it has noticeably gone downhill and we won't be going back anytime soon. It's sad because it's such a great location and close to home. 
Adios Jalapeno!"}
{"text":"We always have a great time when we come to Jalapeño Inferno! Perfect for day drinking and food. We always sit at the bar and get great service but their patio looks really comfortable. The chips and salsa are house made and it shows - they are like crack. Solid, inexpensive wine list and the margaritas - especially when made by Ani - are definitely some of the best we've enjoyed. Melody always comes and checks to make sure everything is good and keeps us company. She has such a good feel for her guests. Always feel welcome when we come here."}
{"text":"This is our favorite southwestern restaurant in the area! Terrific service, beautiful patio, and delicious food!"}
{"text":"We have long been customers at the original location but, since DC Ranch is closer, decided to give it a try.  Let me first say that I would consistently give Jalapeno Inferno five stars - it's one of our favorites, along with our entire family down to our grandkids.  So maybe our expectations were too high in thinking service and food would be as good at the new spot.  But sadly, this was not the case.  
While the restaurant itself is nicer in appearance, apparently that's where the good news ends.
I ordered two enchiladas but requested flour vs. corn tortilla.  Our waitress said everything is pre-made so they would not make a change.  I told her I do this all the time at the other location and she just shrugged and said to choose something different.  No offer to check with the kitchen and no apology.  And let me add the place was barely half full so that was no excuse.  Seriously?  Even Taco Bell will allow tweaks upon request!
So I ordered something else and was disappointed that it was barely warm when served.  She never asked if our food was good and we finally had to flag down another server just to get more salsa.  We both only ate about half our meals and instead of askiing if all was ok she just set down our check.  
The meal was so disappointing and honestly, we won't go back.  In fact it will probably be a while before we go to the first one again, just because maybe they have pre-made meals now too and lost their customer service attitude.  
Bottom line - if you want Pre-made Mexican food served with attitude, don't spend the money at Jalapeno Inferno."}
{"text":"This second incarnation is terrific.  We love the original, but the new place has an open, bright atmosphere that is comfortable and inviting.  The food is the same great quality as the original, and the service is great and the location is very convenient for those of us in North Scottsdale.  You just can't beat a Boss after work.  If you don't know what that means, come by for Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"A good spot for lunch or dinner. Super friendly staff. Chips and salsa are good. Tasty margaritas.  They offer a nice outside seating area. Lots of menu options. My husband loves their fish tacos."}
{"text":"I just stopped for lunch and just got some appetizers.  The service was good, but no recommendations for their specialties from the staff. The drinks, just had some water and soda, come in a plastic cup, which gets nasty after a while, as food gets stuck in the corners.  Chips and salsa were good, but there are two types of chips, crispy and soft(chips are meant to be crispy not soft).  The food was ok, but it was the guacamole that caused this 2 star review.  When it's a Mexican cuisine, you would think all their Mexican dishes would be meeting expectations.  The guacamole looked like it was sitting out for a while or it was made of old avocados as it had a couple dark spots, but I thought I'd try it.  That's when I made a mistake as I should of followed my instinct.  The taste was just like the the look, tasted somewhat spoiled or again, the taste of guacamole sitting out for a long time/old avocado.  The lettuce garnish was garbage, looked old and cheap.  I don't care for the garnish, but even a big mac has better lettuce.  The price was very reasonable, but still won't going to come back to this place any time soon."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for a casual lunch. Refried beans are great.  Service seems a bit slow even with empty seats in the restaurant.  Great potential to really create something cool though...love the atmosphere and architecture!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Amazing food and even better service. The location is great too, indoor and outdoor seating. Kelly is such a great bartender, she makes you feel really welcome. If you're in the area and in the mood for great Mexican food, stop in to jalapeño. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food place in Arizona. 5 Star meets Mexican food. Starting with the chips, flour and corn options leave you wanting more and possibly getting too full for dinner but don't do that!! I know it's hard to do a cheese crisp wrong but there's is so right! Pollo fundido is a gift from heaven. The semi spicy cream cheese sauce paired with the fried goodness and fajita chicken (not shredded!) makes for an amazing meal. Of course the rice and beans are fantastic. If you want a little bit of everything try the appetizer sampler, it comes with adorable little baby fundidos and other classics including a corn tamale. Which btw the tamales at this place are no joke. Was lucky enough to come on frozen Friday which meant $5 frozen drinks all night. Classic frozen marg was great. Can it get any better? Yes, yes it can. Fried ice cream! We held the chocolate because we are already sweet enough.


Response to reply: yes may be posted wherever!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were really excited to check this place and unfortunately, it was a big disappointment. My order came out wrong and the server never even stopped by to apologize or even acknowledge it. He let the food runner apologize. I ordered a club soda and had to ask the hostess to get it bc our server never came to the table so I couldn't even remind him he forgot. My husband would have ordered more drinks but yet again...no server around to ask. The food was nothing special either. Pretty disappointing experience. I think we would give it another shot of the service hadn't been so bad...but I think we'll try somewhere new next time."}
{"text":"Awesome experience tonight! My wife and I got to sit right down and had a very attentive server Cameron who was on top of getting us everything we needed. The deep fried ice cream was amazing too! We will definitely be back to enjoy some more delicious Mexican food."}
{"text":"Decided to try out the Market Street location and was. It did not disappoint. I love the portion sizes here they are fantastic. My wife and I decided to order the fajita for two order and it was more than enough food for the both of us. We had our 9 month old with us and they offered a high chair and when his toy fell on the ground they even offered to pick it up and clean it off for us. The manager Marsha from Indiana was very detail oriented and friendly. This location was very family friendly and great service. No complaints they definitely k ow what they are doing!"}
{"text":"I will admit it right off, they had me at the name. I neither ate nor saw any jalapeños on this visit and none of the food we ate was hot enough to qualify as spicy, not even close to an inferno. What we did eat was good but disappointing Mexican food. My daughter called it bland. I felt that the food was well balanced but far from exciting. The service was excellent. Our waitperson was on top of our every request. I ordered \"green\" taco salad with ground beef and chipotle-ranch dressing. I put a little dressing on the salad but it was completely unnecessary. I am sure that there is someone who can wax poetically about how the spices in the meat blended with the rest of the ingredients to make the perfect taco salad. In my opinion, it would have been better with some jalapeños and spicy salsa. I stole enough of my daughter's fish taco to appreciate how well the fish had been prepared. In short, Jalapeño Inferno did not live up to its name."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and happy hour.  Margaritas are very tasty and love the chips & salsa.  We like to sit in the bar area, plenty of seating and great service!"}
{"text":"The CAST IRON \"SKILLET\" CHICKEN should be sold as a dip, not an entree, I was expecting large pieces of chicken covered in sauce and what I received was a cheese broth with little pieces of diced chicken in it.  I had to eat it as a dip with chips. Although I will say the sauce was very good."}
{"text":"It isn't easy to blow it but sadly this place gets nothing right except the stunning patio!
Salsa has zero taste.
Though descriptions of the salads are enticing, portions and ingredients are minuscule.
Tacos are bland and again, lacking basic over stuffed ingredients to make them fun and filling.
The rice and bean sides are dry and tasteless reminiscent of leftovers from a week ago...
When dinning out for Mexican you want to feel like you are splurging on comfort food...cheesy, goey, yummy...you get none of that here."}
{"text":"Back again. Loved it as always. Didn't have food this time, just drinks, but the staff, especially Ani was fantastic!. I love going to a place that just makes you feel at home. A place that you want to invite your friends to. So come on down, maybe I will be here, and if I'm not, at least know you will have a great time :)"}
{"text":"Drove up to this little place the other night. Coming from Tempe it was a bit of a drive though mostly freeway. If you're not familiar with D.C. ranch give yourself some extra time to find the place. Parking was fairly close and the time of day we visited (5:00 on a weekday) the place wasn't crowded. The menu has many eye catching options for all the courses. I opted for the lobster street tacos ($16) as well as we started with a sampler platter. The service, while appearing to be accommodating, was actually rather lackluster with much room for improvement. Refills of water never happened and we had to remind our (various) wait staff of forgotten items. On the plus side, Monday is half price Margaritas of which the options are plenty. Seating is indoor, outdoor or upstairs."}
{"text":"A friend and I had eaten dinner here recently and thought the food was delicious. I had ordered the Chili Relleno and added ground beef. this dish was absolutely scrumptious. The breading on the Chili pepper was just right. Not soggy or too crispy. The pepper was cooked just right. I ordered the house margarita. two of them because they were well made. They weren't too tart or sour. I recommend happy hour for the best bang for your money."}
{"text":"We have been to the old Jalapeno's regularly and it was always good. Since we live so close to the new one on Market street we thought we'd give it a try.  We went on \"Taco Tuesday\"  ordered tacos and then the waiter came back and told us there was no taco Tuesday at this location.  So we ordered our food, the guacamole was great, the tacos were horrible, dry with little filling.  My chicken con queso was all onions and peppers with tiny little specs of chicken, the beans tasted like they came straight from a can, the rice, what there was of it was dry and tasteless, we will not be back.  The service was fine we had a nice young man and he was accommodating and  upset we were so unhappy with our meal.  They really should stick with basics rather than trying to be upscale, the prices were high for what they served.  No Bueno on this one."}
{"text":"Oh, how I wanted to like this place!  Per the people who took me, the food is just not up to par with their other location.  

This place has a great first floor design in a beautiful shopping center.  Great first impression, but we had 8 people and they took us upstairs to what we thought looked like a cafeteria.  It was loud and hot, with no circulation.  We picked up our table and moved closer the the railing at the mezzanine, but it still was not great.  I'd recommend if you go, get reservations and stipulate you are on the first floor.  We did have reservations.  I will grant they don't have lots of room on the first floor due to the booth design, but we felt like we were an afterthought up on the second floor.  For groups, over 6, I'd go elsewhere. 

The service was very friendly.  We just got a bit lonesome up in the mezzanine and had to request more drinks and water several times.  A forgotten drink order was delivered just before we left, with apologies and a \"don't worry about paying for this one\", gets them good reviews as they had a great attitude.  

Bait and switch bummer!!  Then we were excited to see they had an \"All Frozen Drinks $5 special\" on Friday night.  At the front we were told all margaritas were $5.  Great, we thought...... but no, after we ordered we found out the margaritas were $11-$12, and only on the well margaritas. The $12 margarita \"The Boss\" was definately not worth it!

The chips are made with flour tortillas.  Per my teenage niece, they were over cooked and not nearly as good as the other location.  She indicated \"the other ones are great, they kinda explode in your mouth, but not these.\"  

Their caso dip was very good.  I would recommend.  Salsa was just ok.  

Food reviews were mixed.  

Mine was not worth the $ and I would not recommend.  I ordered a tequilla lime shrimp plate for $22.  I got 5 shrimp that were pretty good, but nothing special over a spoon full of over cooked tasteless veggies.  The whole wheat tortilla that came with it was terrible and turned to a mushy paste in my mouth when eaten.  The black beans were pretty good.  The corn pasty, over spicy, mushy, maybe mayonnaise-ey salad think was not good.  

There are so many other good places around, I would check them out."}
{"text":"Came here on Halloween with a large group. We enjoyed our visit and would definitely come again! The deep fried chips are amazing and worth making a special request for. I ordered the Courtney Burrito; the flavor was good, but the \"hot\" was just a little too hot and needed more spice."}
{"text":"Took my mom to Jalapeños Inferno for Taco Tuesday and we had a really nice meal. It was a beautiful day outside which allowed us to enjoy the spacious patio, the service was friendly and attentive and the bottomless tacos were delicious. My mom really enjoys the chips and salsa which are unique and delicious. We look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"one and done.  We waited 20 minutes for someone to come over to take our drink order.  Finally, the host came over, apologized and brought us our drinks on the house, which was very nice.  We ordered steak fajitas, and the meat was overcooked and there were mostly onions and very little veggies.  Disappointing because we were looking forward to good Mexican food and we love going to Market Street.  I need great, authentic Mexican food in Scottsdale area...any suggestions?"}
{"text":"Living in texas, it has been hard for me to find a decent mexican place here in Arizona. The food is good, no complaints. Love the flour chips! My issue is the service has been so bad the past 4 times we have came. We come back because we love the food but don't come here if you have plans after because you could be stuck here waiting for a long time. I just wish they would be better staffed because the waiters seem overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Service is awful. Been going to N Scottsdale location for 20 years (is that possible?). Pima has acceptable food but the waitress was just somewhere else. Drink delivery, attention to happy hour timing, refills, silverware, delivery of check. Kept the cash tip for $15 tab paid with a $20 bill. When pointed out, she brought back a $5 bill as change... just clueless. Too many other amazing restaurants at DC ranch to put up with that."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and service.  Chicken Courtney and Mexican mule are a good pairing.  Ask for Miranda - she provided great service!"}
{"text":"Great looking venue!! Just horrible customer service and service.  We didn't know who was our waiter almost the entire time.  Forgot our waters and silverware all the way up to the point of our food coming out.  Horrible"}
{"text":"I love Jalapeno Inferno and I've always visited for work-related lunches. I love that they have corn AND flour tortillas chips. The flour chips are so interesting and yummy. Their salsa is also good.

Lunch specials are a good price for the amount of food you get. We've also ordered catering from this location and it was fantastic. Ready for pickup on time and the mini chimis and mini burritos etc. were all fresh and tasty.

The only thing I don't particularly care for is their queso. They do not have a traditional (yellow) type queso - they only have a white one that has spinach and some other ingredients. I've ordered it once and wasn't a fan. It's very thick (not a runny queso) and I felt it was bland!"}
{"text":"Very average Mexican food. Glasses and utensils wrre, in some cases, dirty. We sat outside and asked for the heater but didn't get it... It sat there unused. Someone else asked for it and also didn't get it...but then another party asked for it and got it! The manager came by asked how everything was and got an earful but appeared to ignore it. Food was not offensive but nothing special either."}
{"text":"I came here for a work meeting/lunch a few Friday's ago. There were a total of six of us. The inside was barren, only one other table occupied. This was good because we had to push same tables together so all of us could sit together near the back.

I ordered the lunch fajitas and did a split of the steak and shrimp. My meal came with three flour tortillas, rice, beans, guacamole, sour cream, and lettuce/tomatoes. The skillet contained red and green bell peppers, onions, and steak/shrimp.  The portion size was good but the presentation and taste were lacking. The guacamole, beans, and rice lacked flavor. 

One co-worker ordered the soup (green chili corn chowder), another ordered Courtney's Burrito, and a third ordered enchiladas. I can't remember what the other two ordered. However, everyone's meal except for one arrived at the same time. When our co-workers meal finally arrived, the server apologized saying they burnt it the first time and had to remake it. 

Overall, I don't think I'll be back. I've been wanting to try Jalapeno Inferno since they opened up and I'm glad I can cross it off my list. Unfortunately, I wasn't very impressed with the food. The only upside was that the wait staff was very friendly, helpful, and quick."}
{"text":"Like others have said, service stinks. It wasn't crowded and there seemed to be enough staff. Water never refilled. Took forever to order and to get food. Staff was very nice. I'm a vegetarian and they discussed the various options with me. They recommended the spinach enchiladas so I ordered then. Way too salty. The sauce had a nice spicy kick, which I love, but the food was meh. They brought me black beans and veggies instead of rice since the rice has chicken stock. Lots of food, and it was hot. It was just not good. They didn't even ask if I wanted a box. They just took the plate away. That's okay because I sure didn't want the leftovers."}
{"text":"Food is usually very good and the staff is very attentive.  I love their ginger beer too.  We've come with very large parties and they do a fab job at getting our food out fast and hot."}
{"text":"Overpriced and kind of strange environment, I like more traditional mexican food."}
{"text":"Love the shrimp tacos and at the bar you can get street tacos for half off!  While at the bar ask Kelly to make you her special skinny margarita.  Kelly is a  rock star behind the bar."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant! I live in Chicago so this will definitely be on my \"have to go there first\" when I come in town in the future. I had the Mahi Mahi tacos and had a tough time deciding between a few different dishes. You cannot go wrong with the Mahi Mahi tacos though! Great margaritas. Fair pricing. My husband had the lobster tacos and he really enjoyed those as well. The only downside was we didn't know you could ask for corn tortilla chips only as we don't eat flour products and so we skipped out on a lot of chips and salsa (maybe that's a good thing lol) next time I'll ask for only corn tortilla chips!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour food!! I like that Corona is only $3.00.  Good location.  Sarah the manager with the really pretty eyes is absolutely awesome.  She is very professional and an excellent communicator."}
{"text":"Loved the patio seating! The corn tamales are incredible! My husband had the steak burrito and it was huge and had a ton of delicious steak! The guacamole was somewhat flavorless, but overall dinner was delicious and the service was very good! Recommend making reservations. We did and were happy we did so, it was very busy."}
{"text":"Instant messaged and the owner replied almost immediately, WOW gotta love owner run restaurants!
Heading there today for happy hour..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley and I would come here just for their chips and salsa! Normally I eat at the Scottsdale Road location, however have eaten at this location a few times recently. At this location, the service is usually pretty efficient and the food is delicious. I usually order fajitas or the Black and Bleu salad- would highly recommend either!"}
{"text":"My family of 10 made reservations on a busy Friday night. They saved a table of 8 instead of 10 so we were cramped together, because it was a busy night they couldn't move us. We sat next to the door and it was cold outside, we had to ask a couple of times before they finally kept the door shut. 

Overall the food was good but the service was lacking. Also my tacos were cold. The restaurant itself seems really small and cramped. Unfortunately, we didn't have a good experience."}
{"text":"Best Lobster Tacos I've ever had! The margaritas were tasty too! Enjoyed our server, he was friendly, attentive, and enjoyable. We used the check-in offer for 10% off the food items, which is always awesome to get a discount."}
{"text":"Very good, lunch special (pick two or three) got two chicken enchiladas. Meaty, hot & flavorful. Chips n salsa included,  ask for the hot salsa.  Nice seating area & great service."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in my dining in experience tonight. I love the Jalapeños on Pinnacle Peak but this location was such a disappointment. Terrible all around service and food. Nothing like the Pinnacle Peak location."}
{"text":"Not satisfied at all. Went for taco Tuesday and had the unlimited tacos for 9.99. The meat in the tacos was unseasoned and bland, the lettuce was wilted and there was no salsa or flavor on the taco at all. Probably the worst part was the hard taco shell that actually tasted like cigarettes. I am not exaggerating at all when I say that taco bell is easily 10 times tastier. Also when we asked for sour cream to try to put some amount of flavor into the blandest taco in North America they brought it, didn't say anything then were subsequently charged 2 dollars each for it at the end of the meal. I will say however service was good and so was chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Excellent Cadillac margarita! Their infamous / award winning green chile tamale was very good especially served with a side of a splash of their habanero green sauce mixed in with their savory salsa verde was simple perfection!"}
{"text":"I was there last Tuesday evening.  The green chile enchiladas and black beans were delicious.  However, the rice was terrible.  It was not soft but very crunchy. I think it was served from the bottom of the cooking pot."}
{"text":"I am really picky about Mexican food. Idk when the last time I had a really good authentic Mexican burrito. My burrito I ordered was on point. Tasted amazing!! I had a bean, cheese & grilled chicken burrito enchilada style with a side of rice and beans. It was sooo good, and the rice was delicious as well! I will definitely come back here next time I'm in the mood for Mexican!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food and service. Our waiter went above and beyond to make sure the food was as ordered and tasty. 

Next to us was sitting a very rude customer, he was dropping the f bomb left and right, being extremely demanding and yet, the waitress was extremely polite dealing with a customer who was extremely obnoxious. 

Go check them out, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Just moved to DC Ranch and figured my wife and I would give this a try. 

Service was great, Food came out fast

But.... Food was just average if not below. Shrimp tacos were probably the worst I've ever had which is surprising coming from a place like this where I expected more. Bland, very bland.
Tried the nachos and chorizo tacos as well in our group, also, just very average. Nothing impressive with this place. 

If you want over priced average tacos, come here."}
{"text":"I was there this past Sunday night for dinner with my in laws (from New Mexico). Not super impressed with the food. First of all if you have the word \"inferno\" and \"jalapeno\" in your name, you better at least have some food that is hot or at least mild in the spicy department. We got the obligatory chips and salsa (bland) so I asked for the hot stuff and it was bland as well ZERO KICK. Once the meal came (BTW service was good) the food was very bland as well. Carne Asada was very dry and fairly cold.  Chile Relleno was decent, beans and rice were so-so. All of this is ok except when you realize how much your paying for average at best mexican food. My in-laws were equally unimpressed. I gotta say A+ for atmoshere and setting (outdoor seating area looked great). Service was decent but overall not a great value for actually eating. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good drinks and service. Something for everyone. A definite crowd pleaser for those wanting Mexican food"}
{"text":"Wait staff were great that's the only good thing
Food was awful
Inferno Margarita was sugary syrup
Overall was not great
Don't waste the calories"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night. A bit of a wait which was expected. What we did not expect was that they were serving FREE mini sample margaritas while we waited. Best idea ever. Food was great, atmosphere is great, The Boss margarita got me drunk. Love it."}
{"text":"Ahhh, where do I begin?! We were really excited to try this place and the menu looked great.....but....major disappointment!!! Will never go back, and I discourage anyone from falling into the same trap we did....cute interior, seemingly great menu, etc. (We were there on a Saturday at noon, less than 8 tables of people.) 

Short version: bad service, TERRIBLE food, overpriced, and lack of customer service. 

Long version:  
Our waitress was less than attentive from the get go, to the point where after 10 minutes of waiting, my bf got up and started to walk to the bar to order our drinks before she finally met him halfway and took the order. When she came back to take our food order I asked what she recommended, since it was our first time there. She RAVED about the tequila lime shrimp tacos, so we ordered those and a 'build your own burro' with shredded chicken, green peppers, cheese, guacamole and jalapeños on the side. Since it came with rice and beans, we asked if they could be on the inside of the burrito instead of the outside, she said, \"Of course! No problem!\" Also confirmed with her that the burrito did NOT come enchilada style, granted the menu did not say it did, but we wanted to make sure, she said, \"No it doesn't! It comes 'naked'.\" So when our food came out, the burrito was completely smothered with sauce and melted cheese and it was surrounded by a pile of rice and beans. So we sent that back because my bf hates a burrito you can't pick up with your hands. Meanwhile we started on the shrimp tacos. They were literally soaking wet and dripping with grease! No exaggeration, bc I have no problem with indulging in greasy Mexican food, but this was borderline inedible. Not to mention they were filled with what looked like canned, baby shrimp (4-6 per taco), a sprinkle of melted cheese, and a tiny scoop of pico de gallo. All wrapped in a soggy, greasy, oversized tortilla. (Really pissed that I didn't think to take a picture, because trust me your jaw would drop! Trust me!)

When the manager came back with the burrito, it now had no sauce on it, BUT it was covered in melted cheese and sitting in the refried beans. At this point my bf was starving so he made a comment that it still wasn't \"naked\" but took it anyway. He scraped off the cheese and attempted to pick it up and take a bite. It was soaking wet and fell apart, so he ultimately ate it with a fork. What an ordeal! Meanwhile, I had made a comment to the manager while he was there about the puddle of grease the shrimp tacos were swimming in and asked if that was 'normal', he was pretty much tongue-tied, so I ordered the fish tacos instead and just said whatever, in my head. We kept the shrimp tacos and my bf said we would still pay for them. The manager didn't say anything and left. It was another 15-20 minutes before the fish tacos finally came out. At this point my boyfriend was finished with his meal, of course, so I ate alone while he patiently waited. Fish tacos were good, but nothing amazing.

Time to ask for the check....it was $75, for lunch!!! We had two margaritas, shrimp tacos, fish tacos, and a chicken burrito, that's it!!! The burrito supposedly comes with choice of meat, and two add-ins, with rice and beans on the side. She charged us a $7.50 UP-charge on top of the $10 burrito that only had 1 extra add-in (shredded chicken, guacamole, green peppers and cheese were the only ingredients, as mentioned above). The side of jalapeños were another $2 charge. So the burrito that they had to re-make and yet STILL wasn't as requested ended up costing us almost $20!!!! The super-greasy, barely-full, baby shrimp tacos were $14 and I think the two fish tacos were $12 or $13. Anyway, were weren't expecting to have anything comped, by any means, but how does a restaurant charge nearly $20 for a chicken burrito, that was not made to the customer's requests??? Really and truly??!! 

Moral of the story, if you like to be ripped off while slurping down grease then this is the place for you!!!"}
{"text":"Food and service  are always excellent.  I always sit at the bar with bartender Kelly.  She is outgoing and friendly and drinks are always made right."}
{"text":"Not too impressed. Was here with a large party of around 25. The chips on the table were a mix of corn chips & flour chips. Did not care for the flour. Our server was not super friendly and rarely smiled but she sure kept the alcohol flowing! I think our group had 7 rounds of shots. She pushed the house brand tequila, which most didn't care for but shots were HUGE. I was the DD and had to ask for water 4 times before I walked downstairs & got it myself. Guacamole had lettuce in bottom of bowl so it wasn't as full as it looked. The quest was tasty. The 'hot sauce' was firey but not much actual flavor. I would not return."}
{"text":"Straight to the point. Our first time here. The hostesses seemed annoyed to seat us. The waitress was not attentive, she seemed sad or hated her job. 
We waited 20 minutes for our margaritas, and they were disgusting!  We ordered \"The Boss\" margarita which is highlighted on their menu. They either don't know how to make it, or it is in fact disgusting. We sent them back and ordered beer and wine. The chips and salsa came out, and the salsa tasted like a can of diced tomatoes. You have to ask for the spicy salsa which is actually decent. 
The food was ok, but nothing impressive for the Market Street North Scottsdale area. I'm not sure how they are still in business. As we left, the hostess gave me a wave and dirty look that said to me she hated her job and didn't care about us. Never coming back. Why can't there be a good Mexican restaurant in the area??..
Annoying.."}
{"text":"Thank you! We had a wonderful meal. We sat in the bar area and the Service, food and drinks were awesome. Our server was Paige. The restaurant was clean and inviting. We may have found a new hang out."}
{"text":"Food was good, Jamie the waitress was great ask for her. Prickly pear margarita was really good, and ask to have hatch sauce added to your burro if you like it hot.
This location is different than the other ones so try both, but this location is a little bit healthier in a little bit lighter."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant!  We were pleasantly surprised to say the least.  I usually can't polish off a 2 taco plate with rice and beans but man this one disappeared very quickly!  My wife had the cheese enchilada and green chile corn tamales...she loved it too.  The big surprise was the margarita!  It was excellentay!  Very delicious and packed a punch!  Its nice to see a restaurant that doesn't try to screw you on the drinks.  Service was also very good.  We stopped by again and the food, service is excellent!  This definitely my new favorite Mexican restaurant.  Highly recommended.  Dont screw up and miss out!"}
{"text":"My husband went to the other location a few weeks prior and he wanted to take me to the place. The fresh made chips were good, the appetizer sampler was very good. The chicken enchilada, no matter what the server says is spicy hot. I ended up picking out the chicken and not eating the tortilla and spicy green sauce. I don't know if it was this place, but I did end up getting good poising later that night/the next day. This was the only place my husband and I did not eat the same thing at. This will not be on my list to return to for a Mexican food restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by so many low reviews! We ordered Jalepeno Inferno from DoorDash last night and we were very pleased with our food. We had the lobster & shrimp fajitas, chicken chile bowl, jicama coleslaw, chips and guacamole, steak fajitas, and a mahi mahi dish. For dessert we enjoyed the flan, which was amazing! This was our first time eating Jalepeno Inferno, but won't be the last! Was great to have company over and enjoy this food for about $100 for all of us. Will order again :)"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever! Has a very comforting environment and the best bar tenders and servers! Miranda is always so nice and attentive to our services, she makes the BEST margaritas!! Would recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"Great Margarita, the food was a bit disappointing.  I had seen Jalapeno Inferno on Check Please Arizona.  I asked the waitress about the dishes the group ordered for the program and she did not know.  That in itself was ok however I was surprised that she did not know.  The guacamole we ordered did not have much of a flavor, the black beans were very salty and the rice was very very dry. I drove from Maricopa to dine at Jalapeno's and I am sorry to say it did not meet my expectations.  I doubt that the server could have done anything about the beans, rice, and guacamole."}
{"text":"We tend to have our girls get together here for happy hour and we love it. First it is located in a fun upbeat location which is DC ranch. They have fantastic happy hour margaritas and the best selection of appetizer and service is always excellent. Can't forget the best part they have amazing all you can eat the best chips and salsa. We shall be back."}
{"text":"Food is okay, but service seemed really off on Black Friday. Glasses and silverware were dirty and sticky, even after attempts to replace them. Owner came by and completely ignored comments didn't bother to say sorry about any of it. Related requests to turn on the heater outside fell on deaf ears. Wine came in a hot hot carafe. Just really disappointing on the service front. Won't be going back - there are way too many options in this area to bother."}
{"text":"Went here for a girls night out , it was a cute fun atmosphere . The starters looked delicious we started out ordering a sampler platter of a variety of stuff this is a Must !!! That was my favorite part  of the meal .the chips and salsa are very tasty as well . For an entree my girlfriend and I split an order of fajitas I personally did not care for them at all but was pretty much full from the app and chips any how . We had a few strawberry Margaritas yum it was cool and refreshing . And then we finished  our meal off with the fried ice cream it was so good . I am excited to come back and try this place again the service was great and the owner came out and asked how everything was she was very sweet I think she was the owner anyhow ?  It's the small things that make your dining experience memorable and keep people
Coming back again and this place defiantly is doing something right :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! 
Best Lunch Specials in town! Chips are always made fresh and the salsa is great! The staff is very friendly the manager Veronica is great!"}
{"text":"Very nice large salads and Erica was an exceptional server. Great recommendations and never had an empty glass. Very nice looking place and the chips and salsa are the best ever, very different from other places. We actually took some to go. The bus boy was also very tentative . Can't wait to go back for dinner"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the entire staff is so warm and welcoming. I love the steak burrito and having a few dos Equis at the bar! Ani the bartender is always so friendly and on top of everything. I go in for the food but mostly the people!!!! The manager Mel always stops by and says hello and welcome back. It's nice to go to a place and consistently feel special. Go check it out!!!!"}
{"text":"We typically go to the Pinnacle Peak location and tried this location for the first time. The food was as good or better than the other location. I was happy to see lean options on the menu. Frank was very accommodating as our server. The milieu here in DC Ranch is a step up from other local restaurants."}
{"text":"walked in at 4pm ...First in people in...just 2 of us. Staff looked annoyed..Ordered cerviche.
there was no fish in this large goblet except for 5 mini shrimp out of can. My better half did not want me to say anything. I said nicely..there is no shrimp in this shrimp cerviche? Server looked at me..no looked thru me and walked away. Said stuff to a couple of other staff. never asked if we wanted something else. after 20 minutes came back with a little ramekin...no smaller and said here sorry you did not get cerviche.
ok...live in neighborhood...this is not good..expectations WERE LOW GOING IN...
Check out last 6 month review and go to anywhere else"}
{"text":"I checked in here for lunch today. I usually do not use that function because I have a baby and a special needs 3-year-old so just to go out to eat at all is a pretty big undertaking.  Instead, I typically do my reviews afterwards from my desktop computer at home.  This time, our older child was not with us so I thought I'd try \"checking in\" for a change.  Much to my surprise, a 10% off offer just for checking in appeared on my phone!  CooL! When I showed it to the server,  I asked if I needed to let him know about it before ordering or at the conclusion of our meal he stated,  \"We can do it now. No problem.\"  

He was very attentive, brought our drinks promptly, and even brought refills before our drinks were half empty. The food was served pretty quickly and was good. 

When the bill came, the 10% had not been taken off.  Another gentleman came to accept payment.   Therefore, I had to explain the. Whole Yelp thing over again to him which was kind of annoying. Also took a very long time for someone to come take my payment.  We had been ready to leave for a while and needed to go pick up our other son. 

Great service should not stop once the meal is served."}
{"text":"I got the tamale appetizer which was good and extremely filling! Would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"I used to love this place because of the salsa and solid quality of food.  However, the quality of food has drastically gotten worse over the past year, at least at the market street location.  I can get better mexican food for way cheaper, this used to not be the case."}
{"text":"Jalapeno Inferno is good for what it is which is a place that sells good but basic Mexican food in a nice setting in the Marketplace in DC Ranch.  The atmosphere, especially, the outdoor seating is very nice.  The food is solid Mexican-American staples - tacos, burritos, etc.  

The service was good and the wait staff was friendly and anticipated our needs.  Nice job on that.

The only down side to this place is the lack of plain iced tea.  I really do not understand the trend of only serving iced tea that has crappy added flavors (is citrus an adult flavor or is it a category of fruit?  honestly, citrus is a kook aid flavor).  Please get some regular iced tea.  Not everyone wants tea that has a flavor sprayed on it at the factory."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to a great Mexican dinner. I was very disappointed! There were many open tables yet it took a long time to get service. Our waiter took our drink order then we had to wave down a bartender to take our food order. When our food order arrived it was so salty we couldn't eat it all. Not sure where management was but probably took the weekend off! Maybe they'll get better but can't recommend them now!!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit here. While I thoroughly enjoyed the chips and salsa, perhaps some of the best I've had recently, the chicken in my fajita was downright gross. It was crunchy, think already prepared frozen chicken cooked fast. Our meals came out literally 5 minutes from ordering so this conjecture is likely. The sautéed onions and veggies in the fajitas were good. My friend ordered the steak fajitas and the meat was much better. I ended up exchanging for steak and my meal improved drastically. The last time I came I ordered the seafood enchiladas. They were not tasty; soggy and the white sauce was bland. The service was great, our waiter was attentive and fast. The ambiance is good, this would be a fun place to go to for happy hour. The patio looked like a great place to people watch!"}
