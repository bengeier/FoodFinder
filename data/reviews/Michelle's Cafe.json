{"text":"The food was above average for me. We stopped in early afternoon and the place was pretty empty.  The service was a little slow considering there were only two tables occupied in the whole place.   A decent selection on the menu. I had the hot turkey sandwich which was pretty good. My wife had a wrap that she considered average. My son had a bacon cheeseburger which he enjoyed. The burger was not a frozen and re-heated patty much to our delight.    If we are ever in the area we would definitely consider stopping in again."}
{"text":"Love this diner! Much nicer than you might expect from a little farm town like Lagrange. Everyone there is always friendly and helpful, and prices are quite reasonable. Best chicken paprikash I've ever had! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is astoundingly mediocre with prices that realistically probably need to be cut by about 20%. If you're really in a jam and must absolutely indulge in a reheated Cisco entree, there's worse places to pay a visit to."}
{"text":"Always a good meal at reasonable prices.  It is well worth the 25 mile drive for us to make to get a meal at Michelle's and the pies are out of this world."}
{"text":"Some people think it's a great place .four dollars for two French toast is highway robbery."}
{"text":"Solid for breakfast.  Been a few times and more trips to come.  If driving through, stop in.  Service is good and friendly."}
