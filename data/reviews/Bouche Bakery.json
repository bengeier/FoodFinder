{"text":"This is the perfect bakery for anyone who is or is not gluten-free!! The bakery treats don't have that gross cardboard taste that many gluten free things have. The rolls actually tasted better than any rolls I've had, gluten and gluten free included. We talked to the owner for a good 20 min and she was so nice... she let us try a roll free of charge and that sold us. The rolls were delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I visited I had the cinnamon roll and a personal pizza. I usually like thin and crispy pizza but it tasted delicious even if it was a little too doughy. The cinnamon rolls here are so gooey, soft and just darn delicious that I'm going to need one of them every week or two. My non-gluten free sister-in-law was just going to \"taste\" the caramel cupcake that I brought for her but she ate the whole thing it was so good.  I want to try everything! With a side of cinnamon roll."}
{"text":"Amazing! The flavors are unbelievable.  This gluten free tastes better than the finest bakeries.  Good job, ladies well done and the shop is adorable. Definitely a treasure"}
{"text":"My sister came in from Nashville, she has celiac's and has been longing for baked goods. We were so excited we nearly bought them out. EVERY SINGLE BITE was AMAZING!  I don't even have to give up gluten and I am going back. This is such an amazing place and if you don't go, you are missing out on one of the greatest gems in Lakewood!!"}
{"text":"My best friend is Gluten free. Each week we meet up, craft, drink tea, and eat sweets. Today I surprised her with Gf butter cakes and brownies from Bouche Bakery!! They were amazing! I almost didn't even let her take the leftovers. They were perfectly moist and equally flavorful. My one year old that usually hates chocolate gobbled up half a brownie! What a great addition to Lakewood! If you are GF, enjoy sweets, or just like to keep your business local, this place is definitely worth checking out. 

They also do bulk orders, but the demand for their sweets is so high I was told that they had to turn people away at Thanksgiving due to surplus! That's great news coming from such a new bakery! Get your Christmas orders in fast as I was warned they are already filling up!!"}
{"text":"Great ladies that run this. Affordable and delicious baked goods. The pepperoni roll is to die for. I miss the chocolate roll though."}
{"text":"A must try! The staff was extremely helpful and their baked goods are like nothing I have found in the Cleveland area. Top recommendations go the jalape√±o bread and the caramel pear cheesecake. This wonderful family owned bakery is the perfect replacement to the processed alternatives lining grocery stores."}
{"text":"Bouche Bakery is a completely gluten-free bakery which my wife and I so appreciate.  It is very tastefully decorated inside and the daughter is very friendly - the mom, not so much.  Prices are high which is to be expected for GF items.  We have found about 50% of the items to be amazing and the other half to be so-so.  If you suffer from a gluten sensitivity, I highly recommend checking this place out.  If you don't have a gluten issue, don't expect these items to rival items in a regular bakery.  Having to bake without regular flour is incredibly challenging to say the least."}
{"text":"A gluten free person's Mecca. 

It's been a while since I've been here. I went  today and had forgotten how great their selection is. Best part, it's all gluten free! That led me to an interesting conundrum... difficulty choosing what I wanted. As a gluten free person you don't usually have a lot of options, so this was a welcomed challenge.

I went with the pepperoni roll and a cinnamon roll. The pepperoni roll slice was a great portion for the price and it was crazy good. It's a little heavy on the cheese, so be forewarned. I didn't mind though. The cinnamon roll was still warm and had a great consistency and flavor. It's been ages since I've had the real thing, so needless to say it was a little bit of heaven. 

The cupcakes I've had before and they aren't my favorite. The ones I had were a bit dry and more muffin like than cupcake like. Still good though. Just not my jam. Ive also had their dinner rolls and potato bread and will be repeating that this Thanksgiving. They are not crumbly and dry like a lot of gf bread. They are spot on and are probably the best I've had. 

Check their hours before going. They've changed a bit since last time. 

Overall, it's worth a stop if you're in Lakewood and it's worth a drive for every holiday to get gf rolls! Great stuff."}
{"text":"I had to check this GF bakery out! I bought several things: a lime bar, a devil's-food pastry with strawberry and cream topping, and a pear cheesecake. All delicious! I was given a vanilla cupcake on the house because it was the last one--best GF cupcake I've ever had! I will be back!"}
{"text":"We found this gem of a bakery on Detroit Ave - if you're GF and miss pastries, cupcakes, etc then give Bouche's a try. We had lemon squares, butter rum cakes and English muffins - all truly outstanding. This bakery is on the top of our list of GF locations for sure."}
