{"text":"Rascal House has never been a favorite of mine. The pan pizza is very similar in taste to that of Pizza Hut, so if that's what you like, you may be among the few who enjoy Rascal House. Unfortunately I can't speak on any of the other foods they offer, although I have heard that it's not as bad as the pizza.

If you're looking for good pizza, Little Italy is just 1/4 mile up Mayfield! Check out Mama Santa's or Valentino's."}
{"text":"I can confirm that they are open late and you can get a slice of pizza for around $2.50"}
{"text":"The food there is very inconsistent and usually is cold..

They microwave the wings in styrofoam containers, you are not suppose to put styrofoam in the microwave.

The workers there are god awful and rude. Worst customer service ever!!"}
{"text":"Wish I had read reviews before ordering. I'm in town for a few days and had a craving. Just had a pizza delivered - the guy on the phone sounded like I was bothering him, and he told it would take 30 minutes. An hour later I called to follow up and was told \"it should literally be there any minute.\" Another 20 minutes and it showed up. The driver was apologetic and indicated the place was really busy.

Needless to say it was cold. I'm not exaggerating. It was cooler than room temp. The salad is just iceberg lettuce with a few trinkets thrown in. 

Won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I ordered from the Rascal House Pizza in Maple Heights & what I like about it they have a variety of food you can order from than most pizza joints. I haven't had their pizza @ this Rascal House, but the one downtown's pizza is pretty good. The reason I gave them only 3 stars is I ordered a gyro from there & they were stingy with the meat. The meat makes the gyro & you can't be stingy with it. I would order from them again, but not the gyro."}
{"text":"Only chicken wings attract me and the French fries sometimes taste good but sometimes taste really nasty...."}
{"text":"Great pizza,  expensive prices! When dining there, please take advantage of the coupons mailed out. If you don't have a coupon, it can be one of the most overpriced pizzas you'll ever eat. Nevertheless , I love it when I am not watching my carb intake."}
{"text":"Even after copious amounts of alcohol Rascal House Pizza doesn't make the cut. And that's saying something."}
{"text":"To be fair, I've only tried the pizza here... The pizza reminds me of the pizza I used to get at the cafeteria in elementary school. 
Save your calories for something else... or try something else on the menu"}
{"text":"I can't give a rating of any kind yet.I would like to try.but there are no prices listed.Anyone know anything about them?"}
{"text":"I would agree that you can't eat this pizza the next day, and I've honestly only ever had the pizza fresh while intoxicated. Basically, it's just nice that this place is close, but now that La Pizzeria is only a few steps further, I probably won't ever have Rascal House again.

Once, we tried to have it delivered (it was cold out and we were feeling lazy). We live on Mayfield in Little Italy, and it still took over an hour and a half to get our pizza. 

BUT, saving grace: delicious french fries! Who woulda guessed?!
If Rascal House were a french fry only restaurant they'd have at least 3 or 4 stars!"}
{"text":"College campus pizza place the pizza has a lot to be said about the food is a lot to be said about the prices are ridiculous find better pizza better prices around the area"}
{"text":"Rascal House has many locations in Cleveland Metro area and I have been to two of them. Most of them are located in the area where they expect people to be looking for cheap food after drinks or college kids. 

I have never sat down here to eat. Take out was on time when I got there, they dont make your life miserable by asking a lot of questions on the phone when you are placing an order!! That is a nice thing. 

Pizza is not good quality. I had too much grease on my plate after I was done eating. Their tomato sauce is like old Dominos pizza sauce. Cheese tastes like from a supermarket. Eventhough they claim to have 100% natural ingredients, I doubt that claim. It is a cheap options only if you have coupons, otherwise Pizzabogo is the place to go or order. 

I can understand if you have to eat here, but if this is your favorite location than I will strongly recommend that you try something else."}
{"text":"The only thing thats good here is the wings.  Its a little over priced though.  Pizza is not all that great.  The only reason why I came here is because it was opened until 2:00 AM for some late night studying."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmmmm we order from here probably more than we should that's all I have to say!!"}
{"text":"This pizza can be decent, but you have to eat it right away.  I've never seen pizza with a shorter half-life than this one.  Even picking this up and carrying it to your office or classroom will keep the pizza out for too long.  The most you can do is finish up a salad while this pizza waits on the plate next to you, just begging to be eaten.  Don't resist, just eat the slice and its overly-sweet tomato sauce up while you have it.  It sure as heck ain't getting any better."}
{"text":"Decent pizza and chicken tenders for the price. Pretty good sandwhiches and fries when hot.
Service is nice and quick even during the busier times. I would say for the money you cant go wrong considering other options in the area.

Overall a standard greasy comfort food place."}
{"text":"Pizza is Pizza! 

Location is great since it's near campus for college kids even though little Italy is only around the corner. They offer a variety of options besides pizza (pasta, wings, salads, etc.). This place has all of your late night cravings. I had to review this place since it had such low reviews. This specific rascals has great service and great quality pizza. I have yet to be disappointed! 

There is another location on CSU's campus, which I personally prefer since it's closer. BUT if I am in university circle and craving for pizza, this be the spot. 

Rascal's never disappoints!"}
{"text":"This place is not as bad as everyone keeps saying. It's a standard, open-late, greasy pizza place near a college campus. The end. We stumbled in here after the last call at ABC and had a pizza. It was exactly what my beer-laden stomach needed."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin with Rascal House...

Pizza joint by day, animal feeding ground by night. If you happened to pass by Rascal on a weekend between 12-2am you will notice the massive crowds of drunk Case students trying to get some extremely greasy food after a party. Don't be fooled though, this is in no way implies that the food quality is decent. Merely a convenience food.

I have been here more times than I can count and one thing stays constant: the pizza clearly descended from heaven when you are drunk. When you are sober, I believe it rose from sewers (metaphorically speaking, of course). The moral of the story is: Never be caught entering rascal during the day, or while sober.

Don't hesitate to try the Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza if you aren't afraid to have your life changed for the better (must be intoxicated)!"}
{"text":"Well glad I didn't read the reviews before deciding to get pizza here!  Someone recommended the pizza as it was 2 doors down from our hotel.  We wanted to take it back to the hotel since NO ONE was in the dining room.  We asked if they could make a pizza 1/2 and 1/2 since we couldn't decide on toppings.  We got a medium meat lovers 1/2  & veggie supreme 1/2.  It took about 15 minutes for them to bake it.  First sign we were in for a treat was the box was HEAVY!!!!   I have never seen so many toppings on a pizza!  Mine was \"raining bacon\" as I was eating.  My sisters had so many tomatoes and artichoke hearts it was hard to take a bite!    Absolutely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Gave it away for free :-/ wish they'd focus on quality rather than quantity and speed. Would make it much better. Worth closing earlier and having higher quality than staying up late and serving bad quality pizza"}
{"text":"I think there is a conspiracy going on against Rascal House.

Okay, so it's not *artisinal* pizza and maybe it's a little *greasy* but COME ON it's darn good! Maybe I'm just a sentimental CSU alum, but I have so many great late-night memories here.

Though it's a heart attack on a plate, I truly love their meat lovers pizza. I've never experienced pizza that was anything less than fresh and delish at Rascal House."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fast and friendly service! The coupons are also great and it is very convenient for me."}
{"text":"As others have pointed out, the pizza is just average at best, and greasy. Don't get me wrong, I love greasy pizza, but this is not a good greasy pizza. Lettuce in the salad was browned, though that could be a supplier issue. This close to Little Italy just head there."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery one day hungover and needing greasy food nearby that delivered. Wasn't in the mood for pizza so I ordered chicken tenders and French fries. 

Although their delivery service is on point (even tip ahead of time, no cash required), the food was left to be desired. The fries were soggy. I ended up broiling them in my oven for a few minutes to make them much better! 

Chicken tender breading wasn't crispy and thats a huge no-no for me. Overall, I've learned my lesson in ordering these items from a pizza place. Don't do it."}
{"text":"Rascal house has a love/hate relationship based on many reviews you will read. I do like it, its okay and good enough to stop by once in awhile.

I've had it about 5 times or so, I would say its a traditional style crust with a fair amount of flavor in the whole pie. Its not as bad as some say, but it won't blow you away either.

I always had good memories here because in cause its the place I went to after my summer baseball team upset the cocky, arrogant #1 seeded team 10-7. :) Oh Yeah"}

{"text":"Ordered $30 worth of food at 12:28am, it's now 2:27am and no food. They said it would be delivered in an hour or less.. Two calls to find out where my food is. And it's still on it's way. G-maps said it's a 15 minute walk from the Double Tree hotel where I'm staying. Should have walked I guess. Still hungry and not happy. At least I can get some free cookies from the hotel."}
{"text":"Please Dear God skip this place if you're looking for a place to eat pizza. Showed up 10 mins before they closed and had the manager yell at us and tell us that they \"close whenever we want.\" Please avoid this place at all cost if you know what's good for you."}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza.  Thick crust.  Pan pizza at Pizza hut is better.  With little italy closeby and even wolfgang puck inside Seidman cancer center theres is much better pizza in the area."}
{"text":"I got pizza and fries. Didn't like the fries. Pizza was okay. The pizza at UH hospital is way better.. 
Rascals has a wide range of options (pizza, pasta, wings). I heard their chicken sandwhich is good but all in all, I wouldn't recommend this place unless it's late at night and it's open. Their late hours are their only advantage."}
{"text":"I was there at 830am. The sign out front said breakfast 7 to 1030. The door was locked. Why?  People inside. But not open"}
{"text":"I'm really not sure how Rascal House remains in business. Everyone I know thinks it's basically the worst pizza in the city, and I completely agree with that assessment. The pizza is too greasy, has some weird sweet flavour, and becomes inedible by the time you walk your take away box out the door.

All of this might be at least moderately forgivable were the aforementioned largely inedible pizza offered up at dirt cheap prices. But no! It's actually *expensive* -- as in $18 for a large pepperoni expensive. I've had far, far better pizza for $1 a slice in NYC, and Rascal House makes the Costco Food Court look downright gourmet.

Delivery is so slow as to be useless. Workers are unfriendly. Restaurant is of questionable cleanliness.

Stay away."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza here to be delivered to a local hotel that we stayed at over Christmas. Was happy with the pizza - i had the white pizza with garlic and olive oil, and we also had a pepperoni. Very tasty and perfect after a long drive. They also included a 6 pack of coke! That's awesome! I wish more places did that!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever had at a pizza place. She told me to order elsewhere and hung up on me in the middle of my order. The pizza and wings are the best I've ever had though, so I called back. If you don't mind being persistent, then it is worth it. Also, super inconvenient that you have to have your card on you when the delivery driver shows up."}
{"text":"The worst pizza in Cleveland, and quite possibly the world.  Gooey, half-baked dough with sauce straight out of a can.  The cheese solidifies nicely on top.  Is it even mozzarella?"}
{"text":"This is our go to pizza place and thankfully it's right down the street. This review doesn't apply to other rascal house locations in my opinion. We don't eat pork so the beef pepperoni option makes us very happy. This location also makes really good wings! Keep it up , we are frequent customers."}
{"text":"I've gotten Rascal House pizza a few times, mainly for large group events. It's not the highest quality pizza but it's the best comfort food possible, especially after a few drinks! There's tons of cheese, cooked just right and the crust is great. It's a little greasy but that's what makes it so delicious. I would definitely recommend for large or small gatherings. I honestly think it's better than Dominos/Pizza Hut/Papa Johns. I put it on the same level as Pizza Bogo, which is to say, pretty good."}
{"text":"The best pizza!  I wasn't really hungry and I still couldn't stop eating it.  When we're in Ohio it's gotta be Rascals"}
{"text":"Woh... Where to start?
If you are arriving to the hotel after 9 this is the only place open.
Eat before getting into this neighborhood.
The wings were absolutely not fresh... In the south we call them cold.
They did not microwave them long enough.
The pizza lost its wow factor under the heat lamp.
The bottled water was pretty good."}
{"text":"You're better off ordering two personal pizzas to get full because they are hot and fresh. The slices are gross and taste old."}
{"text":"I called for delivery, it took two hours for it to get to me, which was across the street at the hospital. The food was cold, and it had an odd smell as if it was old. Looking at the receipt it had wrong name,& wrong phone # for me, which is why it took so long to get to me."}
{"text":"Awful food and even worse service. Management is rude and the delivery people only care about a tip, not customer service. Please don't waste your money and find another pizza place."}
