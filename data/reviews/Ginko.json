{"text":"Incredible service and recommendations on what to order. Cool vibe and delicious food. A small place so make sure to make a reservation. We got lucky and sat at the bar."}
{"text":"Ginko is quickly becoming one of my favorite happy-hour spots in the 'mont. The restaurant serves the best sushi I've had in Cleveland, and has a very cool, fun vibe. If you want to try the sushi, but save some money, definitely go for happy hour - 4:30-6:30 M-F. Tuna and salmon rolls are $5, beer and cocktails are half off, and a carafe of sake is just $4.  My only complaint, as other reviewers have noted, is that most of the seating is along a curved bar. While this is fine if you're just 2 or 3, sitting against the bar is not ideal for more than a few people - something to keep in mind if you go with a larger group."}
{"text":"We had a really bad experience here. On average this is a 3 star Japanese restaurant, the one star is for the bad uni and the chef's attitude. It's definitely overpriced. They only have sushi and no other dishes, and the ingredients are not as fresh as they should be. And they charge 6 dollars for valet parking.  The worst thing is about the uni. My boyfriend and I are both uni lovers, but at this place its really bad. It's EXTREMELY BITTER, which means that it's not fresh. We talked to the chef but he was very arrogant.   In brief, bad food, bad service, high price. Don't go there."}
{"text":"Food was tasty but expensive and we ended up with diarrhea. Definitively will not come back."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant I have been to in Ohio (after 2.5 years of living here).  All of our years in Chicago and we didn't have better sushi / Japanese than Ginko.  NY and SF perhaps, but not in the Midwest.  As others point out, the sushi is extremely fresh, beautifully prepared, and creative.  I've had other fantastic non-sushi dishes like tuna collar (absolutely fantastic) and the mackeral (flesh served as sushi then bones deep fried (wonderful) that make this place really interesting.  Drinks are great, service is awesome.  I always get a \"box\" or two of recommended sake, and have never been disappointed.  This place simply has high standards."}
{"text":"Ginko is simply the best sushi I've had anywhere in Ohio.   You start your experience by descending down a set of stairs to a large door. Once you go inside, you're greeted with a chic space that feels more like an exclusive club rather than a public restaurant. The focal point of the room is the horseshoe shaped sushi bar, behind which the immaculate slices of fish are prepared. Surrounding the bar are tables at which parties can sit and talk while enjoying their sushi.   Now for the fish.   I ordered both the sake and maguro nigiri and they were both delicious! I could tell that the fish was as fresh as possible, and it was sliced perfectly. The salmon rolls I ordered were great too, albeit a tad small for the price. Speaking of which, Ginko is expensive. My order of 5 pieces nigiri and a salmon roll was nearly $40, but this can be expected from any good sushi restaurant. Overall, this fearlessly unique sushi bar is worth a look for anybody in the Tremont area, whether an experienced sushi lover or a novice!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, very small and good for a date. The sushi was great but I think it was a little overpriced. I think I would only come backfired happy hour! I has the gingko roll and thought it was just ok, my boyfriend had the spicy tuna and it was much better."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Cleveland. Very fresh and very authentic for a Japanese sushi experience. Manager is nice, but service is awful slow. I used to eat here once, often twice a week when traveling weekly for a project. I had to stop coming because the service was so slow it took up too large of a chunk of my night. To some degree, I think this was due to preparing quality food, but too often I would see the waitress just chatting up guests and forget that other people were in the restaurant. On occasion, I have been served the wrong roll (salmon instead of the toro which I was still charged for), didn't receive my appetizers until almost done with sushi, and then never received my drink I ordered. The phone doesn't work in the evening so you can't order to-go either (even ordering in person at the restaurant for to-go takes a long time - might as well eat there if you're putting in the time to wait).   But alas...despite all the unfortunate experiences I've had there, I still think this place deserves 4 stars. It's so fresh and delicious. Definitely the best fish you'll find in all of Ohio. I seriously debate Ginko or elsewhere for dinner whenever I'm in town for work. Unfortunately, Ginko keeps losing the battle. Although after writing this review and reminiscing about all the tasty memories I have there, I may just suck it up and make my way back."}
{"text":"I feel ten points cooler just walking in there.  Music, decor, Mothra versus Godzilla on the tv, I'm in my true geekdom glory. And they have some of the best sushi in the CLE-amazingly fresh and oh so good! My complaint? Not enough seating on a busy night.  But I guess that's a good problem to have..."}
{"text":"You don't need to be a die-hard fan of sushi to appreciate this place. There is probably no other basement space better utilized in the multitude of restaurants in our fair city. Ginko transports you away to Tokyo, and seems to do so in a genuine way. Not that I would know for sure, seeing as I've never been east of NIagara Falls, but I digress.  The staff was especially friendly and patient in answering our flurry of questions, so don't hesitate to ask. The shrimp tempura, miso soup, and Spicy tuna that I tried were all the best that I'd ever had of these familiar names seen on any menu featuring east Asian cuisine in the United States. Next time I will need to branch out more. There is an endless variety of raw seafood in sushi form on the menu.   Ginko is a great place to stop with friends, and maybe a nice change of pace for something new in Tremont. After all the times you've undoubtedly passed it without realizing, you will not regret stopping into this special hideout."}
{"text":"Ginko, the sister sushi restaurant of Dante, has never disappointed me. I can't think of any other sushi bars that can even compete with Ginko. It's been months since I had last been there--I forgot how great it is. When my boyfriend and I arrived, the place was PACKED. We had never seen it so crowded. It was a full house. I'm glad to see it is doing well.  Starting with cocktails.. You're only choice is the shiso martini. Literally the only choice. It's a bit sweet. It's a bit minty. It's all delicious. It's one of the best cocktails I have ever had.  Stay away from the cherry slinger. I repeat: stay away from the cherry slinger.  On to appetizers.. I would recommend the spicy scallop chips (a scallop and tobiko mixture served on top of pringles with avocado) and a tartar (served with a quail egg).  Stay away from the maine lobster I repeat: stay away from the maine lobster.  They had the otoro on special that night, which is the highest grade of underbelly tuna. It was absolutely divine. It was like butter--melted right in your mouth.  The only roll you absolutely must order here is the jumbo shrimp tempura. It is the best roll I have ever had. It's a giant deep fried roll of goodness. Bonus points for the presentation. The rolls are wrapped in pink, green, or yellow soy paper.   Only negatives of the night? We ordered the royal crap roll and instead received the soft shell crab roll. Also, they serve traditional mochi instead of mochi ice cream. I didn't totally enjoy either, but it was cool to try traditional mochi.  Other positives? Server was friendly and knowledgeable; service was quick and efficient."}
{"text":"I was reluctant at first because I expected it to be too classy but boy was I wrong. I love sushi and this place is the spot to get it on the West Side. The bar is always open as long as there's a seat but table dining is limited and reservation only. It's a cool little place that is a nice change from the usual. They make a bomb-ass shrimp tempura. Go here at least once and you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is magnificent, the staff is amazing and the atmosphere is delightful! Everything I've ever had was delicious!"}
{"text":"Ginko is sushi heaven!  The sushi is always fresh and delicious and the menu offers truly creative dishes - Hello Spicy Scallops on a Pringle, I'm looking at you!  Sooo good.  Go for happy hour and arrive early.  If you are lucky enough to grab a seat at the bar you can watch as the sushi and cocktails are made, you're sure to be enticed by a few things you see leave the kitchen.  The staff is always super attentive, friendly and quick to make conversation.  We will be back again.  And again.  An again!"}
{"text":"Not much imagination in the food. Sub par. Miso soup was delicious though. Probably not going back. It was really crowded together. Plenty of seating but no room to do anything but sit. The guy sitting behind me actually leaned his back against mine! Staff was very nice though."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now (once with my boyfriend as we live in the area, and once with my mother who came from out of town.) Both times the sushi was fresh and delicious, and the service was attentive and friendly. My mom is already looking forward to coming back next time she's here. Great place to go if you at all appreciate sushi!"}
{"text":"The Last review that I wrote about Ginko was how its like when it was couple years ago.  I just went back again but things aren't as good as it used to be. And I am quite disappointed.   First of all, The chef has changed. I felt that the new lady chef isn't so friendly. She looks stressed and somewhat unhappy. She doesn't even smile or say hi or thank you to customer. Thats like the first bad impression to start.   Second, I order omakase...(normally previous chef would talk to me and explain what kind of fish , etc. ) this time, the restaurant is still busy and the service is slow. So the server explained briefly in the first2 dishes. The quality and taste are still good though.   Third, I have wait for a very long time like an hour until i get my first dish of the omakase course. The whole course take about 2hours.   Overall, This time i feels like it doesnt worth the expensive price any more. With this high price, I expect to recieve a better service. I am sad to say that I probably won't go back again.  I would rather go to shinano or shuhei."}
{"text":"This place is small. I kept hearing that from people who had been there but I thought, \"It can't be that small.\" But when they wouldn't take a reservation for four people because the two tables they have that can fit that many were booked all night, I started to believe it. We went early enough (5:15ish) to get four seats at the bar, and I'm glad we did. Not because it ever got packed, but because we had an amazing experience. The person serving us was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. I'm no sushi expert. I rarely venture outside of the things I know I like. Our waiter explained numerous things on the menu that I had never heard of. He even got me to step out of my comfort zone and try something completely different than my usual. And I'm glad I did, it was great.  Beyond the service, the food was top notch. It can be pricey if you order a lot (+drinks), but it is well worth it. I had the shrimp tempura, which was huge and had pink tempura batter (just for fun, said the waiter), and the salmon roll, which were both delicious. I can't remember the name of the special he convinced me to get, but it was nigiri (which is that piece of fish sitting on top of a little ball of rice, if you didn't know - I didn't) made with tuna, and some home made steak sauce, and garlic chips. This thing blew my mind. Again, I'm a fairly picky eater, I know what I like. This was outside of my usual, but he sold me on it, and it was definitely worth it.  If you're looking for a real experience of going out to dinner, I can't recommend Ginko enough. Sit at the bar, let them tell you what the specials are, and just trust their recommendations. If you are a fan of sushi in any capacity, I'm sure they will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery via UberEATS. Food took forever for restaurant to prepare. Delivery time kept getting adjusted to later and later due to long food prep time. How long does it take to roll sushi? Definitely not over an hour. When finally ready was delivered quickly. Only to find half our order was missing! The food that did get delivered was sloppily prepared and tasteless. Very overpriced and overrated. 47 dollars for bland, sloppy sushi! Would give zero stars if I could. Do not waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is the best sushi in the greater Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Every time I have a taste for sushi, I make at trek here! The staff is very at tentative, willing to answer any questions, and are fun and lively! The ambiance is very sexy and I would definitely take a date here."}
{"text":"Great service. The sushi was absolutely average . The appetizer ( some kind of pepper) was horrible. The best part of the dinner was the see weed salad with octopus and the sake. We were disappointed."}
{"text":"Alrighty...  thanks to all the yelp hype about this place, we tried it tonihgt for an early dinner.  I have no idea how anyone can say this is a good place for sushi, let alone best in Cleveland.  First off....  I understand that prices change, but if you are going to include prices on an online menu, they should be accurate, or not at all.  (please note, we have not even gotten a lass of water yet)  ordered hot tea to drink...  expecting oolong, but was instead treated to a seaweed tea, if you enjoy sipping steaped wheat grass, you wil love it, however, if it is anyhting palatable you crave just dont bother.  Miso soup to start...  I thought it was rather good, but he did not, all he could taste were the green onions.   Ok, for the sushi....     ordered the Zappelin, shrimp tempora, una kay, and california.    Do not order the Zappelin if you do not like the heat!  (really liked the flavor, as well as the heat, but could not get past the awful rice!)   Infact, if you do not like to eat mush that is posing as sushi, don't bother ordering any rolls.  Hopefully someone just did something they shouldn't have with the rice cooker.  The fact remains, if you can't cook rice properly for a roll, then you should try your hand at something else!  You might ask why even give this place the two stars...  $2.50 sapporo and great service.  We will try you again Ginko, have a beer and a few peices of nigiri, but it will take a while to get past this awful meal.   To all you yelpers out there who think that Ginko is the best Japanese fare in town...  head a little south the Strongsville and give Tomo a shot!"}
{"text":"This is the very BEST sushi in Cleveland and in the top 10 anywhere!  The omekase is worth every cent!  A must eat if you're ever in the area'"}
{"text":"Best sushi and preparation in the Midwest.  Compares to the finest in NYC or San Fran.  The chef is from Osaka and serves a group with passion and flare."}
{"text":"Hands down the highest quality sushi in Cleveland. The freshest fish and some of the best cuts. I recommend letting the sushi chefs decide what you eat, let them be creative. The staff is friendly and knowledgable. Lunch on Friday is a great way to start the weekend."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out for lunch recently after hearing so many great things about it. I love the decor, it's perfect. It takes you sooo far away from Cleveland and really makes you think that you're somewhere else.   The sushi chef was really nice and informative. Asked us what kind of sushi we like and told us about some specials. Our server? Eh. I don't like being treated as if I've never eaten sushi before, if I hadn't, I'd tell you. I felt like he was trying to educate me on everything that I already knew, and that left a bad taste in my mouth. I've eaten sushi a million times, just because I've never had it there doesn't mean that my sushi palette isn't extended further than a California Roll.   I got some nigiri and a bento box to try out a few different flavors. The fish was good, but somehow, the best thing was the veggie tempura in my bento box and the ginger ice cream.  For the prices and the server attitude, I will pass."}
{"text":"I've got good news and bad news.   Good news: Ginko is a little bit better than a Conde Naste's 2015 Gold Awarded 3-Star Michelin rated Sushi restaurant with a 1-month waiting list in Tokyo Japan.   Bad news? I had to spend $230 dollars on dinner in Tokyo to figure that out.   - Jay Zarkovacki"}
{"text":"I don't remember the last time I've posted so this review will be poorly written and I didn't even bother to take proper pictures or get names of the food and our nice, well-informed servers for a proper, educated review. We LOVE sushi. We mostly enjoy sushi in California, but found a few places in Ohio that are good. We aren't foodies, but I think we have a sense of what is high quality. I judge the quality of sushi through three pieces: salmon roe (Ikura), mackerel (Saba) and sea urchin (Uni).  One complaint. The salmon roe was a little lacking. It was small, but good. The mackerel piece was about four inches long and the rice was small (awesome!). The ultimate test was the sea urchin. I've learned to only order sea urchin at really nice places. I've had sea urchin that tasted like eating from a tide pool. Was it too fresh?  I don't know, but it only tasted bad when it was a questionable restaurant. Only the good places had good sea urchin. Okay, everything else... The mixed drinks, the rolls, the tuna, etc. were great!  Eat here!"}
{"text":"If this is your first time arriving at Ginko's please note- the restaurant is located downstairs of a different restaurant. (It was confusing to me the first time I went). The atmosphere of Ginko's is wonderful. It is a small and cozy restaurant. The servers are so friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable of sushi.  Ginko's offers GREAT happy hour specials Monday-Friday. I am not sure of their lunch schedule or if they are open for lunch.  The sushi is wonderful! In fact, as I am writing this review thinking of the wonderful dinner I had- I am beginning to crave going back! I highly recommend this sushi restaurant if you like sushi.   The location is great too. Lots of bars in the area. So if you're with friends or on date night- there is plenty to do in the nearby area."}
{"text":"Ginko is by far the best restaurant in Cleveland.  We go once a week and it's not enough.  Even the \"plain\" rolls like california and spicy tuna are so fresh that they're on another level.  It's more expensive than most of the other places around, because it's a lot better quality."}
{"text":"Best sushi/sashimi in Cleveland. Unagi and Foie Gras is a gem! Small place guarantees a very intimate vibe and they rock a ton of great indie rock/electronic music to go with the mood and lighting."}
{"text":"I ordered sushi from here expecting fresh and great flavoring sushi on a hot day. I ordered the ginkgo roll and the salmon was definitely not fresh. It was mushy and chewy and left a bad after taste. My husband ordered the shrimp tempura roll and the flavor was bland and just unimpressive. I feel like there are not a lot of sushi places in the Cleveland area and was expecting this one to really make a great impression. Unfortunately my expectations were not met here."}
{"text":"Have since had better view as I've seen more of what Cleveland sushi restaurants offer."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin??? The employees here at Ginko go above and beyond to make your experience with them nothing short of the best. They're extremely knowledgeable when it comes to the menu and will help you in selecting the right items based on your pallet. Aside from the amazing service, Ginko is the most traditional Japanese cuisine I've ever had. I have to say it compares greatly to the famous Uchi (Austin, TX). Like Uchi, Ginko gets its fish delivered daily from the notorious Tsukiji fish market in Japan. They are the only sushi restaurant I've been to in Ohio that actually offer fatty tuna on their menu. I can't give this restaurant enough stars. Worth every penny!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Ginko and my experience was just as amazing as my first! My first visit was with a friend and we waited 30 minutes for a seat around the bar because we did not have reservations (it was during happy hour on a weekday). So, I tried to be better prepared for my second visit due to my boyfriend living out of state and really wanting him to try my fav sushi restaurant.  I tried to make reservations by calling Thursday evening for reservations on Friday night- we were offered reservations for 430p or 10pm (there are only about 4 tables) but was informed that the 24 seat bar was a first come first serve option.   Ginko is in the basement of Dante restaurant. You walk down steps, (which have a Harry Potter feel) and enter a small door. The vibe inside is amazing and the art is pretty cool to look at! We arrived at Ginko around 530p and were seated right away, at my surprise, at the bar. If you are on the right side of the bar (side closest to the entrance) you can watch your food being prepared. It was happy hour (430p-630p M-F) so we appreciated the half off cocktails and $5 spicy tuna and roll of the day. The Kyoto cocktail was amazing and so where the spicy tuna and roll of the day (tuna with avacodo)! We also ordered The Zeppelin ($13 for eight pieces) and Eye of the Tiger ($10 four pieces) which are more Americanized rolls- they were delicious too! The truffled miso soup ($6) was amazing! Our server, Quintin, was pleasant and extremely knowledgable helping us to order other items we were not familiar with, such as sake toro and matou dai ($6 each for a piece) (He also shared information about the restaurant and the owner flying fresh fish in daily.) Both of these were delicious, and one of these just melted in our mouth. Our enjoyable meal continued with desserts ($6 each). We shared the apple fritter and mochi, which came with a sesame, red bean, and orange piece served at room temperature (not ice cream, but I still liked it). Both of us really enjoyed the apple fritter.  As you might tell, the bill can be pricey, but I think the quality of food is worth it! My boyfriend wants to eat at Ginko the next time he is in town! So, we would both highly recommend this restaurant during happy hour or any time!"}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi I've had in Cleveland. We went for happy hour and got a spicy tuna roll and a tuna avocado roll, 5$/roll and it was ridiculously good !  Ambiance - small place, but decorated well. Probably not ideal for large  groups.  Tip- definitely try it out during happy hour"}
{"text":"Very friendly and informative staff. We were lucky to be served by the Manager who was excellent. I really enjoyed the toro as well as the salmon pieces. Can't wait to be back"}
{"text":"Stopped in on 11/11/11 (heavy metal day). I love the way they decorated this place. Hand made glass panels, a little river flowing under my plate, a weird raindrop mirrored ceiling, the exception being the Centipede video game in the corner of the room. It doesn't make any sense. If it was Missile Command then it would. It is a very small space, so be prepared to be wedged in.I ate a little bit of everything, and the only problem i had is the super fatty tuna was \"super stringy\" tuna. Prices were great for the size of the individual pieces. I got the spicy tuna roll and liked the crunchy texture, Panko or whatever it was.. not hot enough for me but nothing is. Speaking of which, the wasabi was interesting because it was a little crunchy also, and I liked it. The servers were good and friendly, they have draft Japanese beer, and a good selection of others, and also a good selection of Sake. Being the neanderthal I am, I got mine served warm. This is why my brother won't eat sushi with me...            Go and check it out, you won't be sorry you did, and it's got a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious, well-presented, relaxed atmosphere and phenomenal service!"}
{"text":"I don't write many two star reviews, but Ginko was... Not good.  At all.  I'm visiting from out of town, so I stopped in with a friend for a few rolls and cocktails.  The cocktails were nice, but the sushi was very very average (and below average for the price).  My friend and I agreed that it did not live up to the reviews.    Bummer, we were looking forward to a nice treat."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in Cleveland. The place is small, but that only adds to the exceptional service and Japan-like ambiance. If seating at the sushi bar, strike a conversation with the chefs. They have great recommendations many of which are not on the menu.  If you are trying to indulge be prepared to spend a pretty penny."}
{"text":"My review is only about Happy Hour experience. This is the best sushi I have had in Cleveland. I gave it 4 stars because the happy hour is really limited and I am all about good deals. However, their fine cocktails at $5 a piece are really worth it. Their shrimp tempura is delicious but too small for the price. Sometimes you just want a casual sushi roll with good quality at the right price point. Unfortunately this is too expensive to fit that need. However, I would go back for happy hour or a special night."}
{"text":"I've been taking a sushi tour of the city after relocating from CleHts to the Westside which made my original, go-to sushi joint (PacificEast for those wondering) less convenient. I'll admit, I've tried some pretty questionable places for the sake of the quest, so I was of course very excited to try Ginko after reading the reviews.   The Pros: The service was spot-on and I'll admit it was kind of a thrill to be waited on by a Joe Bastianich look-alike (seriously, total doppelganger).  I came in for Happy Hour and my drink was promptly, and stiffly, prepared. My order was taken in time to try their Happy Hour food specials ($5 rolls, 1/2-price cocktails, $3 edamame, etc). My food arrived only moments later from some pretty serious looking sushi chefs. The fish was obviously very high quality and very fresh. Everything I tried was delicious. The atmosphere genuinely feels like a hole-in-the-wall joint in NYC or something and I can see that it would be a really fun first date kind of place, but I didn't feel uncomfortable dining solo either.   The Cons: Perhaps I'm too Mid-West to fully appreciate NYC style sushi, but I just didn't feel the portions were adequate for the price. Sure, sure, I have a propensity to have bigger eyes than stomach when it comes to sushi, but I walked away hungry and disinclined to order more once the Happy Hour special ended due to the prices. Of course I understand one doesn't want the Blue Light Special when it comes to eating raw fish or anything, but I just wasn't entirely satisfied in comparison to some other places I have tried.   Overall, this is a solid place and I have nothing truly negative to say about it. But it won't become my \"go-to\" joint anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have eaten at ginkgo about a dozen times but only during happy hour. I like the fact that it is tucked away and underground. The staff is always efficient and friendly. The manager always makes sure to say hello. The environment is fun and modern but small so come early or make reservations.  I always order miso and edamame - both are simple and delightful! I will typically order a roll from the main menu and maybe a couple things from the happy hour depending what they have. The hamachi roll we ordered last time was \"off menu\" and super good! Maybe it was called Hamachi Oshi? I would have to say that overall everything is consistantly fresh and tasty.  I would like to see a small \"chef's special\" board with maybe a couple creative rolls that change daily. A sushi joint I used to frequent out of town always did this and was typically a big hit.  Ginkgo is a bit expensive but so is everything in Tremont. Parking is tight in this area but there is neighborhood parking all around within a couple of blocks if you don't mind walking, which I don't. There are a lot of cool shops and restaurants in the area that are definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ventured out on a cold December night in search of a great new sushi spot. Ginko comes highly rated so we decided to give it a try.   Reservations are highly recommended however they have 24 seats at the sushi bar. We walked in and were immediately sat at the sushi bar.(around 6:30pm) The 2 guys working were nice and they checked our coats for us.   Josh was preparing sushi in front of us and he was spectacular. An artist at work. I must have asked him 15 questions and he was so friendly. Thanks Josh you made our night.   We ordered drinks. Strange they made my wife feel awkward for ordering red wine. Something about they have to wake people if they can drink red wine and eat sushi? It was strange. Oh well. The food was really really good. I am disappointed I didn't try the fatty tuna. Next time.   Very nice spot for a date or an intimate setting."}
{"text":"This place has it all; great service, food & drink and conversation! It has taken me this long to check this establishment out and I am in love. I keep talking about my experience and excited to go back.  First off, the Host was very friendly and attentive. He went over the menu with us and took our drink order before our server came over. The sushi chef that we sat in front of was incredibly friendly and answered all of my ridiculous questions. He was so much fun to chat with during our meal. Service here is great and someone is always checking in to make sure you have everything you need.   I came here for happy hour and it is such a great deal. Happy Hour here is from 4:30-6:30 and includes $5 cocktails, 3-4 $5 rolls and a few other discounted food items. I think their Spicy Tuna roll is one of the best I have had and at $5 of course I ordered another one. I also tried the Truffle Miso which was stellar and had chunks of lobster meat in it. The Scallop Chips are a must order item! I have heard so much about these chips and they live up to the hype (my only gripe is that sharing them with another person is rough because you only get 5 not 6 ha ha). The drinks are fabulous as well. I ordered the Green Tea martini and and a Lychee drink. The martini was on the dryer side (which I enjoy) and the Lychee was a perfect balance, not too sweet but a perfect after meal drink. At $5 a piece (usually $10) the drink deal is a steal! Overall, I think the menu is fairly inexpensive compared to other Japanese restaurants in the area so if you can't make it to Happy Hour you won't break the bank."}
{"text":"OBSESSED!!!  I loved every part of Ginko. My husband and I love, love, love sashimi/sushi and had been struggling to find a restaurant in Cleveland like this. We actually got the recommendation from a server at Shinto's in Strongsville.   For drinks we had hot sake and Kirin and for appetizers:  the Ginko usuzukuri hamachi, edamame, and truffle miso soup. All were superb! Who would have thought to add truffle to miso?? I mean truffle on everything is delicious but wow! Must be the Italian influence. Next time I'd like to try the 3 styles of oysters and the tartar sub uni.  For dinner we had an assortment of sushi/shashimi: uni, taro, o-taro, spicy tuna, and ginko roll. All sooo good! The uni was so creamy and fresh, the taro and o-taro had the perfect marbling (my mouth is watering just thinking about it).   I highly, highly recommend Ginko. They also have shabu, shabu - another reason for me to go back...so perfect for this cold winter weather!  4 THUMBS UP!"}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best sushi I have ever had. Absolutely amazing. Best in Cleveland by far. Food is absolutely unreal. If you want sushi and are in Cleveland this is a must do. I recommend sitting at the bar for the full experience. Chef is amazing and the variety and sushi experience is unparalleled in the Cleveland area. Just a heads up that it is downstairs and a smaller spot. Ambiance is still nice and no issue if you are there for the sushi."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this is the only authentic sushi you can get in Cleveland. Definitely my favorite restaurant in the area. Everything is always so fresh, the staff is wonderful and will answer any questions you have as they prepare your meals. The atmosphere is awesome as well :) always my go to Birthday spot."}
{"text":"Ate here while visiting.  I completely agree with prior reviews which state Ginko can more than hold its own to some of the best sushi in NY & LA.  Perfect rice, fresh wasabi, delicious fish skillfully prepared and very knowledgeable attentive staff."}
{"text":"What can I say...I have eaten a lot of sushi in my life and this is by far the most authentic Japanese I have ever had. The place is super small and I usually have a hard time getting a reservation. I would recommend getting a first come first serve bar seat. Here, you can see the magic happen. They offer a chefs table. I'd like to try it someday. Worth the trip. FYI: it's expensive."}
{"text":"Best.Sushi.Experience.Ever everything is prepared in front and fresh.. A bit hard to find the entrance and small dinning room area but once you are inside get ready to enjoy the best sushi in Cleveland.!!"}
{"text":"Great for adventurous and not-so-adventurous sushi lovers.   Don't miss the spicy scallop chips (super creative with the Pringles), Spicy tuna roll, and any of the specialty rolls.  The highlight for me?  Um, the dessert with a perfectly scooped ball of mango sorbet sitting atop the most sinfully delicious type of chocolate pudding.  Good lord I think my eyes rolled back into my head upon first bite.  That is some damn good high quality swiss or Belgian style chocolate in that dessert!  Nice wine list featuring...yep, Conundrum by the glass.  Big win.    Why not 5 stars?  This is THE only sushi place I have ever been to that smells fishy when you walk in the door.  Granted, it is a small space with a relatively low ceiling but still...it threw me off a bit.  Love the circular seating arrangement around the sushi bar.  Service is great and the servers know their stuff.  Trust them to make selections for you if you have a difficult time deciding."}
{"text":"Small restaurant in the basement below Dante-- at first I was disappointed b/c I didn't have any cell phone service, but they have free wifi which is nice. I made reservations for happy hour (4:30-6:30) which was great! All their specialty cocktails & glasses of wine were half off and they had a few rolls that were $5 each. I tried the lychee cocktail and the kyoto #2 both of which were good (but strong!). The edamame ($3) was excellent and had the perfect amount of salt! For my entree I had the vegetable tempura roll ($5) which I thought was great- perfect blend of textures and flavors! They were busy during happy hour but the service was good and the food came out quickly. Food and drinks were great, had an excellent time!"}
{"text":"Yum. Easily the best sushi in downtown Cleveland, and I love how it's tucked away in Tremont. Unfortunately for Ginko, I moved to Cleveland from San Diego, where there were virtually 12 sushi restaurants within a mile from my house. While Ginko may have the best in downtown Cleveland, if you're a visitor who is used to sushi, you may not be impressed (but! you won't be unimpressed either! You'll be neutral.)  The decor is pretty good (especially the running-water bar!), but sometimes there is some WEIRD stuff playing on TV. I get that it's Japanese shows or animation, but I feel like it could be better tuned to the atmosphere.  Cocktails are great as well - definitely some unusual combinations.  It IS on the pricey side, for not all that much food compared to some other sushi places. But you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"For my daughters birthday, we sat at the chefs area. All I can say is it was amazing. We have one vegetarian and they were more than accommodating and creative. She was thrilled.   As for the rest of us, the sushi was over the top. Some standard fair such as maguro, but mostly creative and unique sushi and sashimi. All cuts were very well proportioned and we did not leave hungry nor disappointed.   The only thing I can say is I will do this again and soon. It was worth every dollar."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined at Ginko this past weekend. What an awesome experience. We were joined by a family that lived in Tokyo for three years, so they had a very high standard. We did a Sake tasting that was a great introduction. My wife had never tried Sushi and our server was super helpful in making suggestions. My wife is a very picky eater, but loved the California roll.  The family we dined with said it is the best Sushi they have had outside of Japan. Ginko can satisfy the most novice or the most experienced of Sushi eaters!"}
{"text":"Sushi is average. I don't like that the rice is not tightly rolled on my sushi, and I don't think the fish taste all that fresh. I have been here a few times too.  I do like their selection of sake, the times I do go there its because of the saki!"}
{"text":"I would give 3.5 stars and my wife would probably give 5, so four is about right.   Nice place located in a basement and isn't unlike some of the places I visited in Japan, size being the biggest departure. No internet service, that can be a good thing.  Menu was large with plenty of options. We had two appetizers; one was a sashimi mackerel that was fried after the meat was gone and the other was a giant Clam in ginger sauce served in the shell. Do not remember the names but both were good. Also had two sushi rolls and both were tasty, if not the best I've had.   Martini was ok and the beer prices at happy hour were great. Even with the affordable drinks, bill was nearly one hundred USD.  One thing was their Wagyu beef on the menu is Australian. Not a big deal but the chef seemed to think all Wagyu is from Oz. umm, no it is not. Most here in the States is, but I will not pay 100 for six ounces if it isn't from Kobe."}
{"text":"Absolutely the friendliest staff! Great knowledge and service here. Shared a round of yellowtail, spicy tuna, scallops, and The Zeppelin.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Came here about a week ago.  They were very friendly and accommodating I drank: a Bondson. Very light and yummy I ate: Chef's selection. Fresh & delicious, but I couldn't finish it all :(  If you're in Ohio and you want good sushi, this is THE place to go."}
{"text":"I've been here twice... both times indulging in the unadvertised happy hour of 4:30 - 6:30 M-F (ask for the Happy Hour menu!)  Beers/wine/cocktails are all half price.  I was underwhelmed by the cocktail I had, but happened to love the Japanese beer - who knew?    I'm not a sushi queen by any mean... but their happy hour sushi was well priced ($5/roll of 4-6 pieces) - and I have enjoyed the rolls.  Their happy hour menu includes miso soup & edamame... as well as spicy tuna roll, vegetable tempura roll, roll of the day, and something else that I know I've had - and can't remember.  I LOVE the tempura roll!  Definitely a great happy hour spot in Tremont!  Can I just take a minute to mention that the staff is fabulous?  They were perfect in timing, kind - but not overbearing.  Great with suggestions, and making us feel welcome.  Finally - the decor is completely unusual.  The restaurant is subterranean, but the place still feels bright (thanks to the vivid use of color in a completely sophisticated tokyo style way).  The restaurant is on the small side... but it's definitely a fun, unique little spot!"}
{"text":"I've had a variety of sushi across the country, and Ginko compares very favorably to the average sushi restaurant.  Sure, it is rather pricy, but the sushi is top quality and is melt-in-your-mouth good.  We went for a late dinner on Friday night, having made reservations several days before, only a later reservation was available. I recommend making a reservation, particularly if you have a group of over 3 and/or want a table (of which they only have a handful).  One qualm regarding the restaurant environment, as other reviewers have noted, is that you are struck by the smell of fish as you walk in, which usually isn't a great sign.  I suspect this is due to the restaurant's basement location.  Also as others have noted, cell reception is very spotty here.  For dinner we started with the truffle miso soup. The mushrooms, edamame and lobster were great touches and made the soup incredibly flavorful and a great start to the meal.  We ordered a variety of rolls (see pictures), and our favorites were as follows:  1. Eye of the tiger roll - Incredibly awesome scallop with perfect sauce accompaniment.  2. Uni roll - very fresh and creamy.  Good ratio of uni to rice and perfect bite size for this delicious treat. 3. Soft shell crab roll - perfectly fried crab, very pleasing crunch.  Sometimes this roll can be cumbersome to eat if not fried correctly, and this was definitely not the case here. 4. Spicy tuna roll - an old standby for many a sushi lover, this did not disappoint. good amount of spicy sauce, not overbearing at all which is sometimes the case at other places.  the house-brewed soy sauce was great as well.  The taste is much milder than the usual bottles at most sushi restaurants, so it does not overpower the taste of the sushi as easily.  The Japanese candies available next to the tables were a nice touch and a great end to the meal.    Overall, a great experience and fantastic option for sushi lovers in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great saki selection and fresh tasty sushi & sashimi. Fresh fish is delivered daily from Asia & Hawaii"}
{"text":"After helping out at Yelp Cleveland's smashing Burstday Bash* hostess with the mostess Cara L asked if I liked sushi.  2 thoughts went thru my head: 1) Do I like sushi? I guess she hasn't noticed that 75% of my reviews are of sushi restaurants.  2) If I had known we were going to go for sushi I wouldn't have eaten so many cupcakes at the burstday bash!   Fortunately, I can always make room for sushi.  Cara called ahead to make sure this new sushi restaurant was able to serve us at this late dining hour (almost 11pm). They obliged and there were 5 seats at the sushi bar waiting for us when we got there.  The staff here is super friendly and ridiculously fast.  We placed our orders and were eating within minutes.  We started with a scallop appetizer that was served on a pringle chip. Um, yum.  And I also ordered some hot sake to warm me up on this ridiculously cold night.  Speaking of warming me up the truffle lobster miso soup also did the trick and may have well been the yummiest miso soup I've ever had. Truffle oil and lobster makes everything better!  For my sushi fix I went with a soft shell crab roll and a piece of tobiko.  It totally hit the spot and I managed to finish it all even though I was pretty full from all those cupcakes.   I'm typically looking for a good sushi spot when I visit new cities and I think I've found one in Cleveland!  * http://www.yelp.com/biz/yelp-cles-first-burstday-party-cleveland"}
{"text":"A 5-star review indicates a restaurant is \"As good as it gets!\" and I think Ginko qualifies -- A sushi restaurant in Cleveland can't get any better than this.  Start with the decor as you walk down a flight from street level below Dante's and enter a small room dominated by the sushi bar. The funky colored tiles, padded bar seat and Japanese TV shows or movies playing on the TV monitor. There also used to be an old Centipede arcade game but it was on its last legs (get it?) and when we showed up Thursday it was gone.  Then there's the drink menu -- full of sakes, beers and an interesting range of cocktails. For instance, I had a drink in which midori was the main ingredient -- something you aren't going to see at a BW3.  And then comes the sushi -- the menu has a great range of fresh fish that are perfectly cut by Chef Taishi Noma and his team with the appropriate dab of wasabi, Japanese relish, etc. But here's what puts Ginko over the top for a fish lover like me -- they always have a long list of fish specials not on the menu (or any other menu around here). On Thursday, I was able to try Grouper as sushi for the first time.  Alas, I can't make this a weekly trip as there is a price to be paid for top-notch chefs and top-notch ingredients. Jeannene and I had a total of 12 pieces of nigiri sushi and two cocktails and the price to be paid that night came to $86 before tip."}
{"text":"Ginko, I love you and even though I adore you, I am SO happy you aren't open everyday for lunch because lets be honest, it would be dangerous.   I recently opened a new business in Tremont & find myself grabbing something new for lunch a couple times a week. Ginko was my Friday open and I do believe a new tradition has been started.   I tried the spicy tuna roll & jumpo shrimp tempura roll, both delicious and SO fresh. I really cannot wait to try more items from the menu over time.   I told my husband about this place but really didn't think I was getting across how awesome it was until he picked up dinner for me one night there and came how raving just how cool it was.  Well done Ginko, you found yourself a regular."}
{"text":"I've been to Ginko three times, each time hoping it would be better than the last, but I think it's time to stop fooling myself. Having just moved to Tremont from Boston, my boyfriend and I were Really, really hoping this place would fill the void in Cleveland for great sushi, but all 3 times were pretty much one big letdown. The fish tasted fresh enough, but the roll flavors/combinations just were not that tasty. The sushi chefs were friendly, but our servers were kind of rude and not at all attentive each time. Plus, the rolls are pretty expensive given what you're getting. As much as I hate to say it, you're probably still better off going to Sushi Rock."}
{"text":"Absolute best Sushi I have ever had. I'm not from Cleveland, but in my travels up and down the East coast and in the Midwest, this is by far one of the best sushi bars I have been to. The ambiance was perfect for the basement bar, and the service was absolutely amazing. They were attentive to my every need and made me comfortable in my wait for the sushi. I will definitely revisit this place on my travels through Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Best sushi in cleveland and on par with top sushi joints in NYC or San Francisco. Small. Sushi bar is first come first serve. Reservations taken for chef's bar area and the only two booths/tables in the place."}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEATS. The \"Eye of the tiger\" was AMAZING. Everything was very nice and fresh, but their \"ginko\" roll was a bit bland."}
{"text":"Never in my life have I experienced such authentic sushi! I had sushi in several continents (not in Japan though) and this was an absolutely great experience. The fish was so fresh and they even put wasabi inside the roll, just like they (supposedly) do in Japan! I was very impressed with Ginko."}
{"text":"great food?very worthful. But the place is little small. But the food is fresh. I really like the beef?taste so good."}
{"text":"This is a moderately tough call - I'd give it a 4 in most cities, but Ginko is the first authentic Japanese Sushi place in CLE to which I'd bring friends...    With chefs from Osaka and Kyoto (I don't know where these two chaps trained) and two waitresses that are also nihon-jin, it hits a mite bit more authenticity than many of the other venues that purport to be shinnihon ryouri.  The vibe is a version of Tokyo hip... the colours are a tiny bit... melodramatic, but in a Dante meet Japanese Urban, this is pretty on-the-money.  With DragonBall playing in the background, and a young lady with fetching blue eyes, greeting, \"Irashaemase!\"  It brings something very new that Cleveland has been sorely lacking.  Seating for 30, energy, authenticity, and the freshest sushi I've had in CLE?  Recipe for success.  Rice consistency and flavour were spot on as well as the cutting of the fish itself.  While it wasn't the freshest I've ever had, the fish preparation was excellent.  Dante... Good job.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a gem.  You descend down into the basement, through a fancy door, then into a dark, intimate, snazzy little room that looks like it seats no more than 30 people.  The kind of hidden hole in the wall that you might expect find in the back alley of a Tokyo suburb.   Knowledgable and attentive staff... silky, expertly-cut nigiri that tastes like it was just pulled from the ocean... tightly-rolled maki and impressive looking \"pressed\" sushi squares...all of this is pulled off with an unpretentious confidence and willingness to guide you through the experience.  Hard place not to love."}
{"text":"Review update: 5 stars. This time, I'm commenting on the omakase. It was so memorable and delicious - totally refined flavors and presentation. Definitely worth coming here for special occasions and special meals!   I ordered the omakase 6-course tasting, and my beau ordered the otsukuri omakase (chef's selection of otsukuri). Note: I am just learning the difference between otsukuri and sashimi. Sashimi seems to be a rougher/tougher cut, and otsukuri is a bit more refined and prepared.  The otsukuri omakase selection was amazing. Many of the selections were straight from Japan. They were also prepared well. For example, sometimes uni (sea urchin) can have an ocean-y smell and flavor. This one was so tender, soft, and free of excess flavor. The shrimp was quite amazing - soft and flavorful. The waitress saved both of our shrimp heads and deep fried them, eaten with a flavorful green tea salt.  Onto the omakase 6-course tasting. It's like the chef knew me - picked all my favorite Japanese dishes (ankimo, uni, hotate). There are two appetizers, one otsukuri, one nigiri, miso soup, and dessert.  The first appetizer had my favorite dish - ankimo, or monkfish liver pate. The way they prepared it was ichiban, with some bitterness from the sauce, some spicy (from the ginger), and savory from the jelly and pate. I would come back again and order this off menu. There were two other selections in my appetizer too - one salty roe dish and one vegetable dish with Japanese sticky yam.  The second and third courses were also good - cooked fish (similar to hamachi) over asparagus, and a selection of otsukuri. The shrimp was really great.   The fourth and fifth - miso soup and nigiri. The nigiri selection was one of my favorite -- I think the best one was the hotate scallop and uni (will order this off menu again), the seared salmon belly with miso paste, chef's creation, the eel, and the otoro. The egg sushi was great as a dessert but just ok.   Dessert - we picked the tempura apple with toasted sesame. The toasted sesame had good flavor. The apple itself had a bit of an absurd/creative presentation - it was coated in pink sugar. It was good, but not super outstanding. I may go for the chocolate + mango sorbet next.   We paired everything with a carafe of warm sake.  Overall, it was so good! I am appreciating the underground subway-stop like atmosphere with modern decor. I really like that vibe. Service was very attentive, friendly, yet still cool.  Also, note female Japanese sushi chef. progressive! All the chefs - excellent job.  As a comment on my previous post - we'll be coming back for more specialties, rather than regular rolls. As we were leaving, we saw the chef preparing some more off menu dishes that we want to try. We can't wait to come back and taste the mackerel dish (aji)!"}
{"text":"Found this place after trying to look for Dante's Happy Hour Sushi Menu. The bartender at Dante informed us that they longer provide that and there is a entirely different restaurant downstairs.  We went down and would not have noticed it if we werent told of the place since it has a speakeasy-ish feel. The entire restaurant seats 40 people max and its mostly a sushi bar, where you can see the chef at his best.  It was definitely the best vibe for a sushi place in Cleveland so far (compared to like a Sushi Rock) and it is definitely a bit pricey, but the offerings for the sushi and sashimi (otsukiri as they call it) is definitely top tier. We went with the Ginko and Zeppelin rolls along with toro (fatty tuna). All of them were deilicious and at that point, the bartender informed us that their specialty was actually ootoro, a special cut of tuna thats even fattier than fatty tuna. We decided to give it a try and actually this was the reason they don't get 5 stars from me. The sashimi cut was nice, but the center tasted frozen and kind of solid. We proceeded to get uni (sea urchin) and sake (salmon) which were both wonderful. Also, I believe the wasabi is fresh and homemade as the horseradish flavor was very clear.  All in all, it was a very good experience, but it could've been a great one. If you're into nigiri/sashimi and not just rolls then this is definitely a place to try for you. I just wouldn't suggest the ootoro."}
{"text":"I don't think I need to elaborate on how delicious their sushi is because a lot of yelpers already nailed it down to a T. But I will mention their outstanding service, attention to detail and their fabulous desserts! If you come here for dinner, don't turn down ordering dessert, even if you are super full. It's well worth it. This little delicacy was some sort of chocolate mousse and it was fanfreakintastic. Right across from Ginko is Dante's newest diggs called Coda- a sweet little venue/bar/restaurant. Love it all!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with my boyfriend. We made a reservation on open table however when we got there they couldn't find our reservation. When we told them we reserved online the host said that is the open table for the location in Ontario, Canada and that it happens all the time. So definitely make sure to call to reserve a table! They did manage to seat us at a booth in the corner which was awkward and small but regardless we were happy to be sat. We started with edamame and the oyster app which has 6 oysters 3 different ways, definitely delicious but not as fresh tasting as I would have liked.  We split 3 rolls and I picked out 3 different pieces of nigri- yellowtail, snapper and fatty tuna..the server suggested the extra fatty tuna so I said okay. Wow, the extra fatty tuna was amazing, so creamy and melt in your mouth texture..best piece of fish I've ever had, I had to order another one. We also shared two bottles of cold sake which our server helped us pick out, one filtered(clear, more like a vodka) and the other unfiltered(sweeter and cloudy) both very good. Overall very delicious sushi and very good service!"}
{"text":"Excellent, very fresh specialty sushi rolls!  Ginko roll and tempura shrimp were what we tried and fabulous!"}
{"text":"Happy hour = $5 rolls, cheap edamame and miso, $2 sake.   Service = Attentive, classy.  One of the servers makes regulars feel like they own the place.  Welcoming.   Atmosphere = Slick-lookin' place.  Small and cozy (only a problem if you arrive too late).  The focal point is the prep area behind the bar where dishes are prepared in full view.  This is the real thing.  Quality fish.  Supposedly all ingredients are flown in from Japan (I have no reason to doubt this).  Happy hour will not break the bank.  Try the desserts."}
{"text":"Great Cleveland Sushi! Awesome specialty rolls. Try the Zepplin and the shrimp tempura! Traditional miso soup (drink it, no spoon needed!), tasty happy hour and friendly wait staff. Small place, so make a reservation ahead of time."}
{"text":"Dear Ginko, I love you. Sincerely, Steph.   But really guys- the love letters aside, this place is the bomb if your hungry for some authentic sushi meats.   This restaurant is located in the basement of Dante. Just to the right of Dante there's a small sign and a magical staircase that basically leads to Japan. Read Ginko.   You walk into this place and it bursts color. (What does that even mean? I can't think of how else to describe) The focal point is the u-shaped sushi bar that probably holds about 30 people. Anime is playing on the tv. There's a tray of Japanese candies at the back. \"Where am I right now?!?!\"   So then Quentin, the manager, will give you the low down on drinks and specials. This guy knows what he's talking about! Listen to him! He's always recommending the most amazing nigiri, chef's specialty, etc. Best part is that he will let you know how to eat it. \"Don't put soy sauce on that.\" \"Eat the head of the fish; it's the best part\" etc. My personal opinion- the fatty tuna is always a win.   If you're looking for less adventurous fare, their sushi rolls are amazing. Try the foie and eel roll... It's like butter. Also, I know it sounds cliche, but their shrimp tempura is one of my favorite foods on the planet. It's rolled up with asparagus! Weird, but oh so good.   My only complaint- no cell service, so I always forget to check in on Yelp. ;)   Ginko, I had to try so hard to find something negative to say about you!"}
{"text":"Finally! Cleveland gets a good sushi spot. Ginko is the perfect blend of cozy, sexy, electro, japanese, corner-of-nyc, goodness that could be contained in a restaurant. But this isn't just any restaurant. Its a basement restaurant beneath Dante.   The chefs at the counter are expert. The servers are more knowledgable than you could every hope for about the menu and drinks. The sushi itself. Well ... its spectacularly fresh, ridiculously prepared, and deathly delicious.   We will continue to attend and hope to rise to the status of loyal customer. I also would love to hang with them for another cosplay party! Yep! Cosplay in Cleveland. Who would've thought!"}
{"text":"Ginko is the sexiest little place to get sushi. Sexy surroundings, sexy staff, sexy drinks, and very sexy sushi.   Yes, it's small. WHO CARES?! Why would that even be a factor in your review?! (Some of you are just bat shit whack jobs.)   I was impressed with everything -- service, ambiance, presentation, and quality of food and drink.   Our server was wonderful. You couldn't get a thing past this guy. He knew the answer to everything. And let's face it, that's hard to come by.   Pricey? Yes, but honestly I don't see how it's much pricier than other Japanese restaurants. If you're not in the market for spending a days wages, check out their happy hour. Their signature cocktails are half off.   I suggest you sit at the bar. It's a much better experience and you can watch your lovely fishy entrees being put together.   I heart you, Ginko."}
{"text":"I may be being a little harsh on this place, and even though I am only giving it 3 stars, I will say I will definitely go back, just a few things that weren't my favorite about it.   First of all, the place is SMALL, and I cannot stress that enough.  In the middle is a bar where the sushi is made to order in front of you which probably has about 20 seats and then there are only 3 tables, so I highly suggest reservations.  I, of course, did not have one, but luckily we got sat in about 20 minutes.   A girlfriend and I went for dinner as we were looking to try somewhere new.  We went on a Saturday night around 8:00 PM and as I said our wait was about 20 min for the sushi bar so we headed up to Dante's for a drink which then we were able to bring downstairs when our table was ready.    We already had drinks so we sat down and started looking at the menu to decide what we want, we decided on shishito peppers as an appetizer and started talking about sushi as we knew we wanted to split a few rolls.  I would honestly say 10 minutes went by before a waitress looking woman was in front of me, and I said can we place an order with you? She said yeah of course, I'll be right back.  About 5 minutes later she came back to take our order... now as I mentioned it's small, so what was everyone doing that they couldn't even come and check on us, I am not sure?  We placed all of our order (afraid she wasn't coming back) - the peppers and then 4 sushi rolls we were splitting.    The food was definitely served promptly from that point, the peppers were delicious the perfect amount of spice, and promptly after our sushi came out on a big place and he described which roll was which.  It was extremely fresh, almost hard to eat because it was so fresh the rice didn't hold together that well, but that is definitely not a complalint I am making.  We had The Zeppelin, Eye of the Tiger (I did not try this one), asparagus roll, and soft shell crab.  All of it was delicious, I really loved the Zeppelin and the soft shell crab.  :)   But I'll go back to reasons why I just didn't love it.  As mentioned the service was slow, later on we were mostly done with our sushi as well as done with our drinks so I asked for a drink menu, which then took another 7ish minutes to get that to us.. I mean, it's a menu!  Then I was also really disappointed in their drink selection, only a handful of cocktails that were not that appetizing and no saki drinks which I thought was bizarre.    Overall, I'd go to eat, just don't expect this amazing experience.  I would say maybe get it to go honestly."}
{"text":"Ginko is another one of those joints where you feel a little bit more hip and cool just because you know about it and can find it.  Down a semi hidden exterior staircase you enter the basement of Dante in Cleveland's Tremont section and find an intimate little sushi bar.  As you enter two swinging half doors painted with Japanese characters, your view is dominated by a large horseshoe shaped sushi bar with the Master Itamae occupying the dominant spot immediately in front of the door, 3-4 Itamae furiously preparing dishes and several Wakiita scurrying about refilling ingredients.    There are probably less than 30 seats total in the entire space and we were lucky enough to secure the only two open seats in the space - at 9:35pm on a random Tuesday.  Our server, Michelle, did an amazing job guiding us through the menu and specials.  The great thing about Ginko is they have options you do not see at many sushi restaurants - foie Gras in sushi - sure.  Japanese snapper - why not.  Fatty tuna - absolutely.    I was almost embarrassed to order something as pedestrian as a Shrimp Tempura roll in the face of all this variety, but Michelle assured me I would not be making a mistake and she could not have been more right.  One of the biggest shrimp I have ever seen was sticking out of a lettuce roll with the perfect marriage of flavors.  My table mate enjoyed the foie gras - I am not a huge fan of foie gras, but feel like you should order because it is so unique.    Everything came out fresh, beautifully plated, and delicious.  My suggestion to you is to just put yourself in the hands of your server and be prepared to be wowed.  Check out Ginko, but don't get there too late. At 10:00, the Master Itamae said loudly \"No more\" and everyone in the restaurant - including the manager - knew exactly what that meant.  Like a good sushi bar should be, it is the sushi chef that calls the shots here."}
{"text":"Ginko has now become a reoccurring date night spot for us! The sushi is good and the ambience and service is always good when we decide to go. It's an extension of Dantes so how could it be anything less. If you want good sushi, and an intimate setting try here. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"We came late to the church of Ginko Sushi, but since conversation, have been among their most devoted disciples. This is truly the gold standard by which all other sushi in Cleveland must be measured. It is that good.   It would be foolish to recommend any specific dish, because NOTHING we've ever ordered has been anything less than flawless. From the budget base to the esoteric, everything is perfect. Our recommendation, go, close your eyes and point to anything on the menu. You'll love it. Then do it again until you're full. We're about 3/4 through the hymnal and haven't been disappointed yet. All praise Ginko."}
{"text":"Love the place! Definitely the most authentic Japanese food I have ever tried outside Asia. We tried the chef's 6 course tasting menu, and everything were amazing. Tips - Happy hour price is really good. Ask the server for the chef's daily special."}
{"text":"Everything I tried here was really good and interesting. I have been to a lot of sushi places and this place did have some pretty great sushi. I wouldn't say it's the BEST but I definitely enjoyed it. I liked the unique menu items as well. I would definitely recommend making a reservation or only coming with a small group of people as it's pretty small inside.  Some of those appetizers I could keep eating forever they were so good."}
{"text":"irashaimase!  The sushi void in Cleveland has been filled with Dante Boccuzzi's new venture, a very warm welcome to you indeed!  For what seems like months now we had been asking when Ginko would be opening every time we visited Dante....and sometimes randomly asking the valet boys on the street while doing a slow drive-by.  The long-awaited and much-anticipated arrival did not fail to disappoint on our first visit.  Opening night was last Thursday and we decided to arrive for an early dinner on Friday.  Wandered down the steps and took the door on the left (this will hopefully be signed soon) and were immediately greeted with a warm irashaimase by the entire staff, busy chefs included.  The atmosphere is very inviting...but not in the \"mood lighting, get comfortable and stay for a few hours\" kind of way....more like in the \"bright lights and cool swagger of Tokyo, sip your sake, eat your sushi, enjoy it, watch some Transformers in the background and be on your way to have fun for the rest of your night\" kind of way.  It's a small space, one horseshoe-shaped bar with space for 20 people or so, behind which the able sushi chefs prepare your dinner from beautiful cuts of fish that lay right in front of you.  If you want, you can just point to something and chef will make it for you.  The walls are brightly tiled with mosaic, a TV hangs unobtrusively from one wall (playing Transformers while we were there) and the videogame classic Millipede is tucked in a corner...I'll need to remember to bring quarters the next time I come.  Two high-top tables for two sit to the right of the entrance and there are two booths that can accomodate up to 6 people placed to the left.  We unfortunately did not make reservations...it was 5 PM and we thought we would be able to sneak in an early dinner before the evening rush.  We were seated at the last 3 non-reserved seats at the bar...unfortunately behind a very large pillar so I was unable to see the sushi chef action going on (I wanted my other diners to be able to see it for themselves so I took the \"seat of shame\").  Now, while the rest of this review will be glowing, this is my one big issue with Ginko.  I understand that it's opening weekend and you want to ensure a big turn-out and that's why practically every seat in the house was reserved, but we got there at 5 and were out by 6:15 at the latest and still none of the bar seat reservations had shown up.  There were 9 of us total in the restaurant and every other bar seat had \"reserved\" on it.  I'm fine with having the tables available for large group reservations, but to be able to reserve seats at a bar?  This was a little strange, and like I said, I don't know what time these reservations were for, but we were out of there before any of them had even shown up.  I can't imagine how many people they might haved turned away just because they said they were full.  There will be high turnover at the bar, just make it first-come-first-served Dante, please!!!  end rant.  Oshibori (steamed towels) for the hands prior to being served...very traditional and a nice touch.  For dinner, my companions started out with sake and they enjoyed it, my green tea was done in the traditional way and was very tasty.  Edamame, came out piping hot with big chunks of salt over them, delicious!  I ordered a smattering of nigiri and rolls for the table....  Spicy tuna roll - my absolute favorite, I order it everywhere I go and it is almost the standard by which I judge every sushi restaurant.  The combination of flavors in this version were perfect, simple and to the point, excellent.  Una Kyu - Eel and cucumber....lots of people think \"gross\" when they think of eel, but it is very pleasant to eat and pairs very well with the crunchy cucumber.  The Zeppelin - their specialty of the house....I didn't get a chance to ask chef what was in it, but it was fantastic, probably the best roll of the night.  Duck/foie - this was interesting, a little tough to eat in one bite (I couldn't get through the duck), but we wanted to try something a little different that Dante probably threw in the menu to spice it up!  Very nice flavor and texture combo...  Nigiri sushi - Toro (fatty tuna) was just melt-in-your-mouth perfect!!  You can tell the high quality of the fish Dante brings in by this cut alone...some of the best toro I've ever tasted.  Tarabagani (King Crab) was excellent as well...it's only a bit more than the Snow Crab, give it a try...  Doumo to the chefs, Taishi and Koji (who was so sweet, apologizing almost every 5 minutes for me being behind the pillar and constantly asking us if we needed anything else).  I can't wait to come again with a reservation for a table so I can try the Shabu Shabu...you can only order it at the tables since there isn't enough room at the bar for the production!  I highly urge everyone to come and try this little slice of Tokyo in Tremont, I'll be back regularly!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable flavors! We had the special of the night first, hand rolls, a few individuals and a few more rolls. The chefs were fun and eager to teach. Ended with great sake and awesome service! Can't wait to do it again!!!"}
{"text":"This is tied for first place in my \"Best Sushi in Northeast Ohio\" category. The miso soup is also first rate.  The only thing that keeps this place from the 5th star is the layout of the restaurant. It's small which means that it can fill up unexpectedly but, more importantly, there's nowhere to stand if you have to wait for a table. If it is unusually hot or cold outside, the entire restaurant will go to ambient outdoor temperature if somebody opens the door.  Unexpected bonuses: Happy hour pricing and Millipede arcade game still only 25 cents!  Unexpected downside: No cell phone coverage in the restaurant and no WiFi either. It would be nice to have WiFi to at least message a friend (if you're taking an order to them, wondering how much longer, etc.) You can pick up Dante's signal if you sit just right but one more router downstairs would be a big improvement."}
{"text":"This was pretty good sushi. The restaurant itself is in the basement, which gives it kind of a cool secluded feel, and is also pretty small, which makes it cozy. My friend and I sat at the sushi bar and watched the sushi chef prepare the yummy sushi. Being vegetarian, I got the garden vegetable roll and the vegetable tempura roll. Both were very tasty with very fresh vegetables. My friend had the miso truffle soup, which she said was amazing. She also had another dragon looking roll and an eel hand roll. She was quite satisfied and full after her meal. Our hostess and waitress were both very prompt and professional. The prices were pretty standard for sushi it looked like. The only negative thing I would say is that other than those two rolls, there were no other vegetarian options. There are also no other traditional japanese dishes (like yakisoba, udon or tempura) available other than sushi."}
{"text":"This place feels like a wonderful secret! My boyfriend and I ate here after walking around the farmers market- we probably walked in around 6pm that Tuesday. There were only a couple other people. Good service, delicious sushi, and the happy hour menu is pretty sweet too. If you're in Tremont and craving some sushi, find Dante's and then look to the right ;)"}
{"text":"I am ashamed for not initially giving this place a perfect rating.  I wish it was bigger but the intimate setting also feels authentic. Hands down best sushi in Cleveland. Their product is amazing and the chefs are no joke. Go here nowww... Just not for happy hour because that's when I like to go and you might snag my seat. ;)"}
{"text":"Ginko was such a treat! I was craving sushi and heard about this spot from a local friend. The  experience began when I walking downstairs to the basement level through a doorway and another set of swinging doors. The restaurant is smaller, covered in colorful glass wall art, dim lit and accented with Japanese anime in the backdrop. Everything is centered around an intimate sushi bar where you can sit around the chefs as they prepare your meal. Sit at the bar if you can! On to the food which was mouth watering. The best thing we had was the tuna tartar. You pour a quail egg atop and let it coat every bite. There's a ton of fresh lime, green onion throughout with beautiful sauces that include wasabi mousse and a few dots of smoky concentrated ponzu sauce. Everything together is wonderful. That was the absolute highlight of my meal. I also has the soft shell crab roll and the Zeppelin which were on the smaller side. The crab roll comes with 4 large pieces and the Zeppelin with 6. They were tasty but not as worthwhile as the tartar. This place is a treat! There aren't many sushi spots in the area so if you're craving it, come here!"}
{"text":"Had shabu-shabu here and it was delicious and authentic. Ginko reminds me of the little sushi bars that are everywhere in Tokyo--tucked away on the 17th floor of an office building, for example. I really love the scale and intimacy of this place, and the food was great."}
{"text":"Amazing preparation, acute attention to detail, and the best sushi I've ever had combined to make a truly amazing dinner experience"}
{"text":"There is little left to be said about Ginko that has not been said in the previous reviews.   Is the sushi great?  Hell yes.  Are the cocktails great?  Hell yes.  Is the decor great?  Hell yes.  Really; what else can I talk about?   The feeling you get when you dine there.  There's a subject.   When I go to Ginko I feel - important, exclusive I am nothing more than a simple Tennessee kid; who's father grew up helping raise hogs and mules on a farm.  I'm as country as you can get, but in Ginko, I'm a rock star, an executive, a celebrity...  That's how you feel in that ultra-chic environment.  I've been there numerous times (because I live in the neighborhood) and I've been elbow to elbow with professional athletes and famous musicians... and in Ginko, we're the same.   My god, I love it so.   Chef Taishi watches over his staff like a hawk.  When he picks up his knife and begins to prepare a dish, it's like watching Eric Clapton play guitar; completely effortless, and the result of the work is absolutely perfect;  not gawdy and overstated.   Quintin manages, makes drinks, takes orders and seems to be on a mission for flawless customer service.  He makes it all happen.  If any person on the staff has a weakness, Quintin is the person who picks up the slack (without you noticing).   When I'm in Ginko, I'm not in Cleveland Ohio.   Truly, when I'm there, I'm in Manhattan, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore... I'm in a not a restaurant, but in a secret club that only allows the most exclusive guests.   I've given 5 star reviews to a few places.  They deserved them,  But giving Ginko 5 stars isn't enough.  It's in a league all by itself.  5 gold stars?  7 stars?  I don't know, but it's easily the best place I've ever been."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've had. Extensive menu with original options & daily specials. Very limited space which gives it an exclusive feel- a reservation is a must unless you'd like to wait for 2 hours to sit at the sushi bar. Highly recommend the zeppelin roll, in addition the sashimi is very high quality. The tuna tartare was excellent, loved the quail egg it is served with."}
{"text":"I love this place the sushi is amazing the drinks are strong just how I like them lol. It's small very small like 30 people at a time but I like that must try"}
{"text":"Happy hour is amazing!  $5 spicy tuna roll.  $2.50 Sapporo.  Atmosphere is really fun.  Everyone sits at the sushi bar and watches the chefs make their creations.  Very small though, not a place for groups.  Perfect for dinner for two."}
{"text":"Ginko was the 3rd stop for 2012 CLE International Supper Club.  There were about 7 of us CLE yelpers.  Its quite well established from the many reviews that Ginko serves up the best sushi in CLE at the moment.  Until they are trumped, they definitely have the quality down pat.  The prices which are comparatively high,  are definitely worth the quality, care, and expert serving of sushi at Ginko.   I want to write of the experience of having sushi at Ginko.  If you have never tried sushi before or if you are a seasoned sushi fan,  Ginko has a seat for you.  The cozy little place in the lower level, oozes a sort of Japanese chic feel complete with Japanese action films playing on a small corner wall mounted TV.  The wrap around bar takes up most of the place with two 8 person tables set into one site ( available only upon reservation ).  The bar is not open seating, the hostess will seat you and there is a method to this madness - upon close observation you will notice customers in even numbers are seated at least two seats apart allowing for paired seating in between.  All of the preparations of sake mixed drinks, and sushi happen in plain sight in the middle of the large horseshoe shaped bar.  The neatly partitioned storage underneath provide order in the seaming chaos.    The sake ( non happy hour portion ) is served in a split bamboo flutes and a round cup made of bamboo, this I heard them call sake take.  This is meant to be enjoyed for a period of time during your visit here.  Some sake are served in a square box.  Both of these are meant to be traditional way of enjoying sake.  The mixed drinks are also infused with sake here.   The dizzying number of different sake served here vary from flavor and strength of course.  If experiencing the top-grade sushi is Ginko's first gift to its patrons, then experiencing great sake is it's second gift to us.  IMHO to truly experience what Ginko has to offer is to ask the chief Sushi Chef ( Implanted in Cleveland straight from Japan ) to decide for you and add state that your only requirement is that you have 'flavor explosion' with each piece.  Sit back get some sake and be amazed at the presentation of each creation, accompanied by the description of what you are having from the wait staff, and the tremendous taste explosions of each piece in your mouth.   This type of adventurous spirit is the best way to experience all that Ginko has to offer and lets you leave with happy memories and feeling the experience fully worth it.  I cannot leave out the well informed and very observant wait staff here.  I've been told each staff has to spend several hours with the Sushi Chef to try almost everything he serves and a detailed knowledge of the preparation is imparted upon them.  All of this was clearly evident in the detailed description accompanied each piece of sushi I had here during my visit.  Ginko at present is truly 'As good as it gets!' for Sushi in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi I've ever had in Cleveland. This place is tiny but has really cool atmosphere. Service was also great and prompt.  I had Otoro sashimi and their ginko roll, which had salmon, hamachi, tuna, avocado along with other stuff I can't remember, and it was wrapped in daikon, which by the was amazing!! I'm happy I finally tried this place out, and definitely adding it to my go-to sushi place in Cleveland! Knocking a star off for a lack of parking lot, (but it's in Tremont so maybe it is expected) plus $6 valet service. Otherwise, you should def check this place out if you love sushi!"}
{"text":"Had heard great things about this new Dante establishment (we have enjoyed  Dante upstairs on several occasions) so we called for reservations for my birthday and were told \"We do not take reservations, but if you come by 6:30 on a Tuesday, you should have no problem getting a table.\" We arrived at 6:15 and noticed 2-3 open tables and a completely open bar. The hostess asked if we had reservations, and we explained that we were told they do not take reservations. She looked in a reservation book and indicated that they had reservations for all of the remaining unoccupied tables, but we could sit at the bar. We reminded her that we were told they do NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS, but she insisted there were reservations for the open tables. Being a special day, we did not want to sit at the bar, so we thanked her and walked a block down the street to Lago and had a wonderful meal (see related review.) Dante can do whatever he wants to do, as he is a well respected local chef, but you cannot tell people you do not take reservations, and then have a book with reservations for all of the unoccupied tables...it just does not work that way! Luckily, there are several excellent options within walking distance, so unless you establish consistent policies at Ginko, you might just be the best thing that ever happened to the competition!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere and inspired sushi. Fresh mindful and delicious. I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Great intimate place to get sushi in Tremont! I would probably give 3 stars for the food, but the service was great and the atmosphere perfect for a sushi place. It's in the basement of Dante, so we were a little confused when trying to find the place. You have to walk down a stairwell to the right of Dante.   We arrived in time for happy hour, so we decided to try one special roll (Ginko roll) and 3 Happy Hour rolls (Spicy tuna, salmon, and the special of the day roll, shrimp salad).  The special rolls are pretty expensive, and the one we got was pretty small. Nothing about it really stood out as being any better than any other sushi I've had. The happy hour rolls were $5 each and they were good but didn't have much in them. I was mostly tasting rice.   We also ordered the oyster appetizer. It was $12 for 6 oysters with special toppings. It was very average. I did not really care for the fried oyster, as it could have been a fried piece of dough for what it tasted like - you just tasted the sauce. The other raw oysters, while they tasted fine, did not seem to be as fresh as they could have been. But I wasn't expecting the best oysters from a sushi place in Ohio anyway.   Service was great, very friendly people here. Parking was kind of a nightmare in Tremont, but we finally found a spot on the street a few blocks away.   I would come back, but wouldn't be in a big hurry to."}
{"text":"These guys are the BEST sushi chefs in Cleveland, no doubt. Beautiful food, beautifully presented and amazing flavors. Eye of the TIger is fantastic, as is the otoro, a rare find in Cleveland sushi restaurants. I've loved everything I've had at Ginko. The only drawbacks are the price and the difficulty getting reservations for smaller groups. Sitting at the bar is definitely not so bad, though--you get a great view of the talent."}
{"text":"Went there for shabu shabu. We had to reserve the table a week ahead for 4 people. The rating is so high so we expect the food to be at least average. The shabu shabu is ridiculous. The soup base is like a mixture of vinegar and alcohol. I am pretty sure that they did not wash the napa cabbage.. It took so long for the shabu shabu to be ready on a Tuesday night. We ordered one maki roll. It's ok. We ended up disappointed and hungry because the serving size is small."}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS!!!!! Ginko, you have given me the most amazing sushi experience ever!   After eating here, I uttered the statement \"this is the best sushi I have ever had\" to my boyfriend who had picked this fantastic place out! We went on a Saturday night without dinner reservations, so we had about a 20 minute wait. No matter! We were directed upstairs to Dante's where we had a drink while we waited. Beware, it's hard to find some prime time seats up there as well, but definitely a great option to hanging around awkwardly by the restaurant entrance.  I tried squid for the first time here (Nippon Roll), and sweet goodness, it was perfectly chewy and savoury! We also had the Led Zeppelin and the Gingko Roll. The Nippon and Led Zeppelin were definitely our favourites, they both had this delicious Burdock Root which added such a unique element of flavour into the roll. It was all just amazingly delicious. We were first timers trying the mochi for dessert and wow. I wish I could have a cow sized portion of mochi to myself, sweet, and 3 flavours to try :)   I wasn't a big fan of the seating arrangement here, it is a U-shape with seating around the sushi bar, with a couple of larger tables and a couple of smaller ones. It's not a very private space, but this is such a trivial detail considering how amazing the food was. I would definitely come here again, especially to try out the happy hour!"}
{"text":"I needed a moment of peace...dined solo. The food was excellently prepared...crispy, fresh, spicy, sweet...Loved it. I recommend the higher end plum wine. Best sushi in town!"}
{"text":"Oh my god, I can't help myself--Ginko is just so delicious!  What I need to do is stray a little from my usuals, but I got the exact same thing I had the last time. I mean, how could I not? It was all so effing good!  So, yes, truffle miso, spicy scallops on Pringles, the Eye of the Tiger, and spicy tuna.... yes, yes and more yes.   One new player in the Cara loves Ginko par-tay was the clementine ginger martini thing I had that was spicy deliciousness in a glass. Smooth, hints of cinnamon, the spicy, clean taste of the ginger and a pickled cumquat sitting at the bottom. Delicious and zero bite.   I'm not really sure why anyone wouldn't like this place, but whatever. More for the rest of us!"}
{"text":"Drooling on my key board thinking of eating some sushi. Ginko is the best sushi in the Cleveland area that i have experienced. i have been to many of sushi joints around the states and Ginko stacks up to some of the best i have had. Very delicious will be back for more. Next time I will eat my self in to a sushi coma."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Cleveland. Great atmosphere and the sushi was so fresh. The Zeppelin roll was delicious."}
{"text":"Never disappoints.   Sushi can be somewhat of an enigma at times.  We general stick to the few rolls we recognize and go about our business.  But what I discovered at Ginko, is is worth diving into their daily selection of specials.  The staff and manager are exceptionally patient with describing the variety and subtlety between the selections. I have always just ordered the chef selection,  and I have never been disappointed.  However,  I ventured the daily specials and it was quite the pleasant and memorable experience: baby squid,  a selection of mackerel, & fresh/raw octopus. The favorite bite of the meal was a mainstay on the menu: unagi and foie gras  (rich flavors and textures that complimented the other delicate dishes).  Worth the visit.  Worth having a conversation with the staff.   #bestsushi"}
{"text":"Ginko is perfect!   Been to japan more than once, and for sushi being made in Ohio, this is the best it's going to get.   The staff is polite and well-versed in what they serve; they are knowledgeable about what is being served and do their best t make sure you make the choice you want. They have a rad hostess there and she even remembered my name last time, which I thought was very nice.  I went during happy hour last time and got the Veggie Tempura roll, which is a personal favorite. I also had their extra fattty tuna, Saba, and snapper pieces and they were all superb. These chefs have love and respect for their work and the end results are the proof.  Tremont is not a zone I will normally go to (with the exception of Crust) but I will go to Ginko any day of the week."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've eaten in Cleveland. A bit expensive, but it's sushi. Make reservations because it can be difficult to get a seat."}
{"text":"Cowboy Bebop - Session 26 - The Real Folk Blues (Part 2):  \"It's all a . . . dream.\" \"Yeah.  Just a dream.\"  Late Saturday night dinner at Ginko.  They don't take reservations so we ended up biding about half an hour of our time at the bar at Dante's.  Thankfully, as there isn't much room to stand around and wait at Ginko, the hostess told us to leave our name with the hostess at Dante's, and she would call up when our seats would be ready.  The space is fairly cramped and a little claustrophobic with the low ceiling.  Our seats were at the large U-shaped sushi bar--fully expect to be occasionally bumping elbows with the diners to your left and right.  The intimate space, though, together with the vibrant color scheme and the fact that the chef preparing your food is a scant few feet in front of you, really creates a fun environment.  Taking it to another level, and particularly as there are no windows, you could easily suspend disbelief and imagine yourself coming out of Ginko onto the streets of New York, Tokyo, or even some post-cataclysmic anime dystopia.  We went for the big six course chef's tasting menu, and I came away very impressed, particularly because the courses were all pretty straightforward Japanese dishes and not some sort of fusion aimed at the American palate.  I didn't jot down everything I had, but some of the highlights were a beautifully cut cucumber \"salad\" of sorts, a miniature crab that you simply popped into your mouth like a bone cracker, the toro sashimi, and a stellar sushi course highlighted by the seared salmon (I even got to see the chef bust out the blowtorch as Masaharu Morimoto has done so many times on Iron Chef Japan).  The tasting menu included two different desserts that could be shared, which I thought was a nice touch:  The Harumaki (crispy fried banana with chocolate sauce) and, something I really enjoyed, a green tea creme brulee.  On the downside, except for the toro (which is always a joy to have) I was a little disappointed at the chef's selection for the sashimi course that day both in the fish featured and the size of the cuts put on the plate.  I also would have been more than happy to kick in the three extra bucks to upgrade the miso soup to the Truffled Miso Soup.  While I love sushi, I usually find myself satiating my fix at random eateries in the suburbs.  I have a feeling that may change:  I asked for Ginko's best shot and got it.  All that was left for me to do is stumble up the stairs to the street-level outside with a half-grin on my face, look up and point my finger to the night sky.  \"Bang.\""}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi restaurant in the Cleveland area! The staff is friendly and helpful, the atmosphere is fun and upbeat, and the food is phenomenal. I would recommend making reservations in advance since the place is small and popular."}
{"text":"Ginko, what is going on?  Things have taken a turn for the worse - because the last time I was there, you could not have provided us with a more disappointing experience, and sadly - didn't seem to care.    1) We made a reservation a week in advance for 8:30pm.  We arrived a little early to be told that we'd have to wait for the other party to finish up.  That's normal, and we were told to go upstairs to the Dante bar.   15 minute go by...  I return back downstairs to check in on the situation, and she goes - it'll just be a little while longer.   15 more minutes go by...  Check in again at 9pm.  She says again that the party still isn't ready to leave.  I ask if there is somewhere we could get apps or something while we stand and wait ... she says, \"not sure what you expect around here, but all these spots are reserved.\"  Um - yes, I realize they are reserved.  That's why I put in a reservation myself, so I could sit down and enjoy some dinner.  Yet - I'm not.   15 more minutes go by ... still nothing.   Finally at 9:30pm, we are told we can sit at our table.  At that point we'd been standing in a crowded bar being pushed around for a good hour, and they didn't even comp our drinks.   They did provided us with a bottle of Prosecco, which was kind - ok, i'll give you that - but I'd rather you have comp'd our many $14 glasses of wine upstairs that we had waiting for our table we had already reserved.    2) The sushi - was rolled terribly.  It was falling apart, and took them 1.5 hours to bring to us!  They were so backed up, we didn't even start eating until 11pm.  Reservation at 8:30, dinner at 11?  Me thinks not, please.  On top of that, one of the appetizers came out after the sushi  - it was all just a terrible fail of an evening.    I chose Ginko because I've had nothing but positive experiences, and wanted to show some out of town friends the great atmosphere and food.  It significantly failed us that evening, and the people working there didn't do a lot to try to make the experience any better.  I'm going to rethink returning to this place with a group - they just don't seem to be able to manage it - AT all."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, friendly waitstaff, good service & amazing sushi. A unique experience! Ps try the unagi"}
{"text":"blown away. best sushi i have ever had and i've had my fair share, believe me. i am dying to get back to cleveland just to dine here. the rice was perfect and the fish was generously portioned. the wasabi and soy are all handmade and are a culinary experience unto themselves....  LOVE this place...."}
{"text":"Advice first:  Make a reservation. This place is small and books up fast Don't expect to have a social dinner with more than 6-7 people. This is for small groups. The hot pot was like nails on a chalkboard for my siblings and me...not sure why. Expect to pay a lot for what you get - it's a truly unique experience. And be adventurous!   My husband and I come here often and always think of it for really special occasions (it was our last Cleveland meal before we got married). And for good reason - the staff is wonderful and it's always an experience. There are specials every night - we always order at least one - and NOTHING disappoints! Shiso Martinis, miso soups and the chocolate Purin with mango dessert are our only go-tos and all three are phenomenal. I recommend this place to people who love to try new things!"}
{"text":"This place is tiny and I never knew it existed. You have to go down some steps between buildings to find it. Apparently it was an old bank vault. We sat at the counter and the sushi we got was really tasty, although a bit pricey. I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"I come here a lot , it's one of the best I have had in cleveland , they head chef , you have to get to know him , he keeps to himself and only Opens up if you get to know him"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi and the staff is super friendly as well. What more can you ask for? Pretty small dining area, great for a date night!"}
{"text":"Irashaemase!! Happy hour is AMAZING to check out all the great cold sake tastes at $2 a bamboo cup. They all coincidentally have names of premium, superior, etc (so apparently they're all really good, lol) but at this price you can figure it out yourself! Their cocktails were amazing so we had to order all that passed us by. They also have sushi specials for happy hour of course that were good. Quintin the manager is an awesome guy- super friendly, attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"I'm going to skip the sushi review (if you've made it this far you should already know that the sushi is better than any you'll find in Cleveland) and go straight to dessert. The green tea cheesecake is a must order. Perfect texture to the cheesecake itself, with the strawberry sorbet on top adding just the right amount of tart and sweetness. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Ginko got me pregnant, literally! I left that night with a sushi baby in my belly created with food and later discovered  i had a real one in me after our night out! We came for our anniversary & once again were treated to the most amazing sushi i have ever had in Cleveland. This tiny hidden gem never ceases to impress. I wish i could eat here every day. EVERY DAY! Alas, i cannot afford that because although my tastes are rich, my wallet will not match, but i cannot wait to eat there again! We were even calling the pregnancy Ginko.... however, that did not last as the fates had other plans, but i will be back again when we are ready to make our next sushi inspired baby. I hope to be back regardless at some point soon."}
{"text":"Best sushi in CLE!!!! So fresh, do modern.... Small place but worth any wait! Love love love this place. If I want to get sushi, ginko is always first choice!"}
{"text":"It was a cold and rainy night.  For some reason, I wanted to start my review that way... it really was though!    I worked up an appetite at Thursday night's Cleveland Yelp Elite Event, so when Cara asked if I was up for a late night sushi fix, I didn't even think about it... my answer was YES!  She told me that Ginko was her fave spot for sushi and after our meal, I can totally understand why.  Fresh, inventive sushi rolls, a warm and friendly atmosphere, and an all around cool vibe...   Upon walking in, the staff welcomed us with a big \"Irashaimase!\"  (I love that!)  I opted for hot tea as I was a bit under the weather, but Cara had a gorgeous looking clementine martini.  Mr Cara (aka Jason) went with hot sake.  We ordered our food family style and everything was delicious!    We all started with bowls of truffle lobster miso soup.  I'd never had truffle oil or lobster in miso soup before, but I'm a fan of the combo!  Next up was an appetizer with spicy scallops and avocado on Pringles - yes Pringles potato chips.  A unique combo that definitely works!  Following that was a huge plate filled with sushi rolls: spicy tuna, california sunshine, shrimp tempura, and eye of the tiger.  We were so full after all of that, we had to turn down dessert.  Not sure when I'll be back to Cleveland, but when I am, I would not hesitate to return to Ginko.  I'm definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Cleveland.  Great presentation, fresh sushi, great service and atmosphere.  The basement restaurant gave a feel reminiscent of NYC. Two friends and I sat at the sushi bar. Although it was more difficult to chat with this set up, it was great to speak with the sushi chef and ask his recommendations. We shared many rolls between the three of us and were pleased with each. I plan to visit again soon. The only drawback I can see is the smaller size. I am not sure how well a larger party would be accommodated in the space."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great staff, awesome cocktails with tons of flavor, sushi is great, and the green tea cheese cake is off the chain!! Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"I had heard such great reviews for this place so i decided to check it out. Admittedly we went pretty close to closing but it shouldn't matter. This place is underground, in a very claustrophobic small area. The chefs and staff were nice. However, our server was rude and condescending for no reason. He treated us like he wanted to get us the hell out of there and it was extremely obvious. We're usually fast anyway so we ordered, ate and left before they even closed. The chefs were all nice, it was just our server personally.  The service aside, the food was incredibly overrated. Way over-priced. But it's got the name and if you're a sushi snob this works for you. $6 PER 1 nigiri. If that's your style go for it.   The coolest part of the restaurant was the bar which had rocks inside a glass counter. Total waste of money and time!"}
{"text":"I went here today with good expectation and new experience from other city. Atmosphere inside this restaurant was good and to me it feels like a cosy pub type inside in my opinion. When I looked at a menu and see the price of nigiri it was higher than average japanese restaurant so i asked the wait staff and see if they are using blue fin tuna instead of yellow fin tuna cause of price but she told me they use yellow fin tuna ( yellow fin tuna cost lower than blue fin tuna and restaurant they use yellow fin tuna price the tuna nigiri no more than $3 but here was $5 (As example if yellow fin tuna comes $14.95 per pound than blue fin tuna comes $18.95 per pound) and also sometimes supply companies gives blue fin tuna even when restaurant orders yellow fin tuna cause they sometimes they have over stock and needs that to be used so they hand over blue fin tuna to restaurant with the same price of yellow fin tuna). The guy who looks like either owner or manager I asked him whether Tuna roll or Salmon roll comes as hosomaki which is rice on inside and nori seaweed on outside but he doesn't know about it so i had to explain to him and he told me rice comes out outside but when we received both rolls, it came as rice on inside and it was no difference than any other place's tuna roll and salmon roll ( price is $7 for salmon roll and $8 for tuna roll which I think it's over priced). 3 Special rolls that we got taste good and I was happy beside their ginko roll which has tuna and salmon and yellowtail and avocado and cucumber and radish sprout rapped with raddish. The reason i didn't like about ginko roll was stuff that put inside for tuna was either co treated tuna (a lot cheaper than regualr fresh loin tuna) which is normally used for mixed stuff such as spicy tuna or they used fresh tuna but chopped into really small pieces. Salmon i am pretty sure they use scottish salmon which is best you can get normally from supply companies (alaskan salmon is normally available during summer season). Quality they have is good but not good as the price they charge you for. i spent over $160 just for food and i won't lie about i came out from restaurant with full stomach but somewhere in my mind i felt like i been cheated for what i paid. Lastly if you are either owner or manager of a Sushi Restaurant you should know basic stuff of Sushi."}
{"text":"Because of you people I now have a love for shrimp heads. Not much more to say,but shrimp brains are yummy and your freaky ass Japanese cartoon party was fun  as hell!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants I've been fortunate to go to. Brilliant presentation.  Quaint space below the fabulous Dantes. Fish is so dam fresh. Plenty to choose from on the menu with great Sake options. Sit at the Sushi bar if you do not have a RSVP, but come prepared to spend $$$. It's not cheap, it's not expensive,  but you see and want more because of how it's prepared. Chin chin..."}
{"text":"I was really surprised by the quality of fish here. Ambience was great, wait staff was very friendly and the food was just great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"When you come to Gingko don't come here for the americanized rolls. Put yourself in the chef's hands and do the omakase tasting menu. This place is really tiny and a great dining atmosphere when you are doing a menu type as such. With this place you can get down with how your food is being prepared in front of you and the chef gives you such a personal experience. The waitstaff were also very friendly and attentive. I am so sad that in my frequent travels to Cleveland I have not found this place sooner. It was such a good and tasty experience I now have it on my must dine list every single time I come to Cleveland. The quality of fish and ingredients is just superb. Although, I didn't taste any of this, the chef did a tasting for a group next to me of certified wagyu beef from Japan. Not your fake wagyu slider type meat you get at the run of the mill joint. I would say if others did not have a good food experience here, they haven't tried fine dining Japanese food or have never tried amazing quality fish. So I don't have the greatest of listening to heavy Japanese accents, but I will try my best to label my courses. The first appetizer course was of 3 small bites: marinted herring wrapped in seaweed and kampyo, then a tiny crab, and gochujang marinted cucumber salad with snail? clam? The second course was my favorite and would loooooooooove an entree sized portion of this. It was black cod marinated in a special marinade from the chef's hometown in Japan. Accompanied by shaved asparagus and daikon with a white miso sauce. In my opinion the cod itself was sooooo tasty it didn't even need the white miso sauce. The next course was a sashimi plate of the regular suspects: tuna salmon, mackeral, fluke, amaebi, red snapper and white tuna. And although they were the regular suspects, the quality of fish reminds a high caliber japanese restaurant in LA, that I've dined at. The 5th course was a nigiri the usually pricier stuff: otoro, hamachi, lighty torched scallop topped with uni, torched salmon, and unagi. I've never had a torched nigiri salmon in that fashion and it was such a great new experience. The texture was unbelievably silky texture despite it looking almost seared. They also came back with the fried head of the amaebi from the 4th course. There have been times where it is not fried well and I have a bite and I'm done, but it was fried very crispy, not burnt, with matcha salt. For the dessert course they said that I could choose or continue with chef's choice. I continued with chef's choice of course which was a green tea cheesecake, ginger shortbreak cookie with strawberry sorbet on top. The green tea cheesecake wasn't my favorite mostly because I like a very strong matcha flavor and this was very mild. Also the ratio from cheesecake to cookie was off (needed more cookie). I told them as such and they were actually kind of grateful for the feedback. Another reason I may not have liked it as much was because I was probably stuffed to the brim with the amount of food and having a heavy dessert was difficult. The strawberry sorbet on the other hand was on point and fresh and ended up just finishing that instead. Chef Noma, Helen, and Quitin....thank you so much for your great service, hospitality, and above all else amazing tasting japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"Sushi is happiness for me. And Ginko makes it ecstasy. We stumbled in on a Thursday evening, serendipitously in time for happy hour. I started with a drink called the Umami, which was a sake, vodka and kumquat concoction that lived up to its name: sweet, sour salty, just a hint of bitter. It was so delicious that I had to have two. Ferrett had a ginger beer that he pronounced the most interesting beer he's had in ages.   Then there was the sushi. Ferrett had tuna, crab and shrimp nigiri, all fresh and delicious. I had the house special, a panko-coated whitefish, and a salmon skin handroll. Everything was outstanding--some of the best I've had anywhere.  If you are like me, and sushi makes your day brighter, take the walk down the stairs to this lovely little restaurant."}
{"text":"very average place.  Cute little basement resto on the best street in tremont so A+ for location. But the rolls were sooooooooooooo average and SUPER small!  I had the Zeppelin: this was very good & fresh, but again, small. Def reccommend this  and i also had the spicy tuna roll which was meh.  The menu is very small and not much to choose from. I LOVE supporting local resto's especially in tremont but i won't be coming back to this one."}
{"text":"I've literally been coming here for YEARS, according to my original Yelp review. I can't say that about many restaurants. This is seriously my favorite and because I don't live in CLE anymore, I can't just have it any time I want. I can only have it when I'm in town visiting my in-laws. It's made me sad, but it makes me appreciate it that much more. I thought about giving it 4 stars this time around, but I just can't bring it down.   Why would I give it a star less? Simply because...we tried to stop in with my in-laws and nephew one afternoon at 4:30pm while we were in town (this is when they open), and the hostess dude was being a snot and not very welcoming to us. We wanted to sit at a table, but he didn't want to give it to us because they had a reservation set for 6pm, he said. Completely ridiculous, considering that would've allowed us 1.5 hours to eat our meal and leave, which we definitely would have done. His overall demeanor just wasn't up to par with the service I've typically received there. I'm really not sure who he thought he was, and I didn't get his name, but I don't think he should represent this place.   Regardless, we didn't get to eat there that night and returned on another (yep, that's how much I love it). The sushi is still excellent. I think after a while of being gone, I've decided the Eye of the Tiger is my ultimate favorite. In fact, we ordered TWO of these. And yeah, that ginger martini is still da bomb dot com. I had 2 of those as well, but don't mind me because I can't help myself!   Lastly, what I love about this particular sushi joint is that it is the overall an experience that you can't just get at any Japanese restaurant. You don't feel like you're in the middle of Cleveland, OH but in the middle of Japan somewhere. I wish Dante would open a place like this for me in Denver, CO (HINT)! I'd be a full-blown supporter."}
{"text":"For Cleveland, Ginko is good. However, i would not order the omikase tasting again and would warn others away from this. We ended up paying $275 for the two tastings, 2 drinks each and the tip.  We have paid more at Michelin starred restaurants so the price is not what was unappealing.  It was more that i felt bad paying it. I did not feel it was worth it, especially considering other places we have dined that are more of an \"experience\".  Would go back for happy hour and to order a la carte. Drinks were reasonably priced and creative. The off menu items we had were all very good. The best sushi was the salmon belly and the scallop.   I don't really have anything bad to say about Ginko-just the tasting itself. Sadly the price tag just did not translate and we would have been happier with ordering from the menu."}
{"text":"Pringles as an appetizer!?! Hello, creativity!  I've been here twice now with Miss Cleveland, Cara L herself, and it's hard not to feel like you're in some secret VIP sushi supper club when you visit.  Downstairs, in pretty much a basement, is an amazing little sushi joint with an incredible, intimate layout, but evenmoreso, incredibly inventive & delicious food. Well yeah, there's great sushi, but how does Truffled Miso Soup with little (surprising) chunks of crab, oysters or Spicy Scallop Chips (the Pringles appetizer) sound?! Well let me tell you, they taste even more delicious than their names might imply.  I expected average (smallish) pieces of sushi when I ordered the specialty Eye of the Tiger roll on my last visit. But oh no, instead, got 4 MASSIVE pieces that had to be consumed in two bites because I couldn't stuff it all into my mouth. Sidenote: do you know how hard it is to actually bite into a sushi roll/piece of without it falling apart. Insanity. The scallops on said sushi roll were amazing - and delightfully fresh to-booth. So good.  The staff is more than happy to chat with you about their history, which I more-than enjoyed (I just love that sort of stuff) and you must ask questions about the artifacts within (artwork, bar, etc.)  I wish you existed when I lived in Cleveland, Ginko!"}
{"text":"Sushi + Pringles = GENIUS  Sushi in OH may strike you as odd, but let me tell you that it's a lot of fun and offers some great sushi and a specialty dish that will make any American smile.  Their signature dish is Spicy Scallop Chips with tobiko, scallions served on top of a Pringles chip with a slice of avocado.  A delightful combination, the Pringle chip adds texture and salt to every bite and makes this truly unique.  I would come back to have this over and over and over again.    We also tried a Specialty roll, the exact one is escaping me at the moment.  It was beautifully presented and tasted fresh.  Another stand out for us was the drink menu.  I had the pleasure of enjoying the Sour Cherry Sling with cherry puree, Cointreau, and gin.  Even the BF pronounced this a well designed cocktail.  You don't see cherry cocktails that often so I was excited to give it a try.  I wonder if they'll ship one to Denver for me?  You know it always tastes better when someone else makes it.  It's not too sweet and has a real cherry flavor that's not too over powering and goes down silky smooth.   For those of you Denverites, Ginko is down some stairs and reminds me of Green Russell, with an ultra modern interior and more limited seating.  Mainly a bar seating area with a few two tops surrounding the area.  Think of it like a horse shoe with all the delectable dishes being made right in front of you.  You're surrounded by brightly colored tiled walls and feel as though you've been transported to another country.  Alas, when you head back up the stairs you're in Ohio and have just enjoyed some impressive sushi."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in the Cleveland area.  Very small space, but I've never had trouble getting a spot at the bar. Everything is good."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I am a sushi lover and was expecting something different. The quality of my sashimi platter was five-stars so I have zero issues on the food. It's fresh and wonderful, but very expensive for the setting, which is my complaint. Ginko is located under Dante, in a very tiny and terribly noisy basement, where there is barely space to fit in the bar or the few tables. This concept would be fine for a moderate price sushi experience, but it's a fail in a restaurant where you spend around $100 per person to have, I repeat, wonderful food... just in the wrong setting."}
{"text":"So my search for decent sushi hits a great joint in Ginko. Flawlessly cut pieces of fish served by itself or on a bed of freshly cooked sticky rice, the knife skills of the chiefs are delicious. What I mean is that they lavish their customers with prime cuts of phish to the tune of many dollars. It's well worth every penny. Over and over again. I must say, I've had many experiences with seafood and this was one of the best. The ambience is a mix of modern and crampy basement. Quarters are a little tight but the food and staff makes up for it. REALLY. I think I can stop looking for a sushi place cause I've found it. Next up, noodle house!"}
{"text":"There is something really special going on at Ginko. Beneath the foot traffic of the many nearby restaurants on Professor Avenue, some of the most inspiring and locally unique food is being prepared underground in a windowless cave.   Dante has outdone himself with the creation of Ginko; a Toyko inspired sushi bar created in the basement of Restaurant Dante. After descending down the steps and through an unmarked door, you are instantly transported into another world. I've never been to Tokyo, but I can imagine this is what it would feel like. Two Japanese born chefs who greet you as you walk in. The ambiance consists of glass mosaic tiled walls, modern accents, a glass bar top with a calming stream of running water underneath. On one end of the bar is an unobtrusive flat screen that was displaying a vintage cartoon version of Speed Racer and Transformers. The background music, subliminal Japanese hymns. The majority of this smallish restaurant is bar seating for roughly 30, with two high-tops capable of sitting 2 each and two booths with room for a party of 6 each.  Sitting at the bar is an all-encompassing event. The chefs speak to you, you get to admire their superior knife skills as well as browse the ultra fresh seafood and veg. Throughout my time here, I was simply in awe of the experience and ambiance that was created here.    As far as sushi goes, it doesn't get any better than this. Cleveland has long been lacking in the raw fish department. Mostly because of the lack of knowledgeable talent and a nearby ocean. Dante Boccuzzi has changed that with the creation of Ginko. I've been told the fish served here is caught in Hawaii, Japan, Sicily and New York and flown in on some instances, that day!   If you like fresh seafood in it's most raw form and can appreciate the great technique and artful preparations that go into this type of cuisine, trust your instincts and desires and get to Ginko!   *My only gripe: They take reservations for bar seating. I've never seen or heard of reserving a bar seat before. Perhaps this will change in the future, but I just don't get it. This isn't a place to linger for hours. You'd think they'd be able to turn more seats by not allowing reservations at the bar. I mean, isn't that the option of having bar seating in the first place? A quicker, more readily option than waiting for a traditional table? Get rid of the bar reservations and we're cool. Besides that, absolutely no complaints."}
{"text":"The sushi there is great! All the food is very fresh and good. A special trick - ask to try the bones! It's a speciality that I dont think is on the menu. It is an order of whitefish that comes out, you eat the fish off the bones, and then they take the skeleton/bones to the kitchen, deep fry them and bring them back out. It sounds gross and weird, but it is actually so good and quite the experience!"}
{"text":"After visiting Japan last year, many a folk asked if I had been to Ginko. I had not, and frankly, I found it really hard to believe there could a sushi restaurant worthy of fangirling in Cleveland. No offense meant to Cleveland, it's just not what you think of when you think of sushi. Pierogi, yes. Sushi, no. On my first visit, and every subsequent visit after, I was put in my place. Ginko really is that good. And since I don't have the fundage to visit Tokyo on a regular basis, it satisfies my sushi loving soul in between visits.  The itamae behind the sushi counter are highly skilled and have my utmost respect. I could just watch them make the sushi for hours. If it's your first visit, I highly recommend selecting the omakase and letting these skilled chefs craft your dinner with the freshest sushi of the day.  Recommendations include (well, everything, but especially) the Uni Ikura Kani (Sea Urchin, Salmon Roe, Crabmeat) and Kamo/Foie/Ume (Duck, Foie, salted plum), and of course, the otoro (usually only served with the omakase, I believe)."}
{"text":"Not trying to sound like a snob, but the other sushi restaurants don't hold a candle to Ginko and I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews, especially from people who live here.  If you want cream cheese in your sushi or huge ass rolls, go to one of the other \"sushi\" restaurants that cater to the basics.  Ginko is the closest thing we have to an authentic sushi restaurant. They even use real wasabi, not that gummy shit other restaurants serve. My personal favorites are Eye of the Tiger-for all you raw scallop lovers (ME!), Salmon Skin Roll, Fatty Tuna Roll (Sometimes these are only  $5!)l, Ika & Saba Sashimi and Ume-Kyu Roll.  I always go during happy hour and I have always had impeccable service.  Great....now I'm hungry talking about all this sushi-guess that means I'll be going to Ginko tonight =)"}
{"text":"Four of us had a reservation on 12/20/17 and we were sat immediately. The gentleman that sat us/served us was very friendly and took his time explaining the menu and recommending items for us. The drinks were awesome, the food was awesome, and the service was awesome! To top it off, it was my brother's birthday and he surprised him with delicious green tea cheesecake topped with some kind of berry sorbet--it was amazing."}
{"text":"We lived in Tokyo for 3 years so we are a bit particular about our Japanese food. Ginko hits the mark. Sushi was fresh and properly made. All sides were as they would be in Japan. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I genuinely want to love every place in Tremont, especially since I live in the neighborhood. To be fair, some places I do and some places I don't. I typically don't do sushi in the area because it's overpriced. I haven't seen a friend in awhile and had a craving so I gave ginkgo another try. I had it some time ago with girlfriends during happy hour and it was acceptable. Fairly priced (happy hour) and reasonably tasty. Disclaimer-I'm not an adventurous sushi eater. I keep it simple, shrimp tempura, spicy tuna and California rolls are pretty much the extent. All of which I had tonight. Granted I use a ton of soy and triple the amounts of ginger but I would still say the taste was subpar. I can't put my finger on it exactly, but something is just different. My friend (who is more adventurous) agreed. But the lack of stars is definitely the service. We sat at the bar, expecting to be tended to. Instead it seemed like we waited longer and had to ask for just about everything instead of being offered. Drinks, refills etc they all seemed to be a nuisance. The place is not big. It's a tiny corner of a basement, which I find enchanting (my friend did not). The point is they weren't busy. It's a tiny place that wasn't fully seated, but yet we felt bothersome. Maybe if we were regulars like the parties sat on either side of us, we would of been more welcomed. To top it off I spilled a drink as I pulled it from the ledge and it landed on my chopstick \"rest\". yes. A place to hold my chopsticks  Either way I was chatting and my vodka soda hit the counter, my friend and the floor. I apologized profusely. The nice waitress (who didn't serve us all night) grabbed towels. Meanwhile, the bartender stood at the end of the bar just watching. Cherry on top...he didn't offer to replace my drink. Look, I get it, it was my mistake (I wasn't drunk as it was only my third drink in a two hours time after eating) BUT he didn't offer to replace it. Bartending 101 (I've been one). I just couldn't bring myself to tip 20% after realizing he clearly felt entitled to it because the place is overpriced and 20% of a $60 sushi tab is pretty reasonable especially when we sat at a sushi bar and half the staff served us everything. AND He charged me for a drink I didn't drink-any of! Either way, my friend and I both agreed we couldn't go back. What for? Convenience-we can go to a dozen other restaurants for the high price or a dive for a better experience. If you've made it this far...you're a real one!! I just had to vent. Give it a try, I guess."}
{"text":"I had chef's tasting menu the other day.   One of the 6 courses came with miso soup.  When I asked how come I only had 5 courses, I was told miso soup is considered one of the 6 courses.  NO, IT'S NOT!  Miso soup is a free side dish in most Japanese restaurants.  I was deeply offended by this.   Please, if you don't have the 6th course, just change your chef tasting menu from 6 to 5 courses, you can't count miso soup as one of the chef tasting menu.   There was nothing special about it, it was just a bowl of plain and boring soup."}
{"text":"Fantastic place, ruined sushi for me from anywhere else. We sat at the chef's table (seats at the bar all the way to the right when you walk in) and we let him do his magic, totally worth it! The quality is outstanding and the presentation was beautiful.  Don't miss if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"The older I get, the more I realize that I might be a Basic Bro. I've been getting more adventurous with my beers as my disposable income level (every so slightly) goes up, but left to my own devices with restaurants, I always want to go to a place where I can get a burger or big-ass grilled cheese sandwich.   So when one of my friends had originally wanted to go to One of Those Burger Places for their birthday, I was psyched. I was not so psyched when I got a text message from his wife saying it was changed to some sushi place I had never heard of. \"Aw man,\" I thought to myself. \"I know my dude bro wants a beer and burger.\" But since I am at least smart enough to not argue with my friends' spouses, I acted like it was all cool, but still wanting inside, well, not sushi, even though I dig it from time to time.  Well, I was a regular nitwit, because she took us to this place, and I am extremely grateful that she did. This is definitely a higher-class sushi bar -- quite literally a bar, that you sit at and watch them make the sushi. The entire place is about as big as a Parma basement, which actually makes for a great ambiance. The beer/wine selection is good, but the real treat is the sushi. Nothing ever compares to fresh-made sushi. Occasionally you can get decent stuff pre-packaged at the supermarket, but this blows that shit out of the water.   My buddy basically got the \"everything\" platter -- I can't remember the actual name and I don't speak Japanese anyway. I was pretty much everything they offer, sashimi-style (without rice). It looked HEAVENLY. I had a couple plates of the \"regular\" sushi, and it was fantastic. The service was excellent, and, as I mentioned, the ambiance was great. I hope to come back one day -- perhaps on MY birthday."}
{"text":"The best sushi experience that you will ever have in CLE! Flawless presentation and product. Try the Otoro and Toro Steak. Make sure to get the seat right in front of Chef Taishi at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"Woah. Ginko is way cool. The decor was gorgeous. Really liked the clean tiles and the emphasis on the sushi preparation. Somewhat modest but with great attention to detail. The sushi was quite good but expensive. Standouts were the sweet shrimp nigiri and the sea urchin. The omakase, although it was prepared with care and skill, fell a little short. I felt the need to order more. I had trouble feeling satiated at Ginko. If money isn't an issue then by all means go to Ginko and drop $95.00 on yourself. If you're looking for decent sushi that won't break the bank check out Shuhei or Pacific East in Coventry. I still think Ginko is a great addition to Tremont. If the prices were adjusted I would have no problem giving Ginko 5 stars."}
{"text":"A CALM, COOL, AND COLLECTED ENDORSEMENT: If you love sushi and can't make toe-curling, hot bliss-unfurling, nirvana-inducing sushi yourself, go, for the love of god, go to Ginko.  Treat your tastebuds to a rave and a half.  Aaaaand, if you like having parties in your mouth on the cheap (half off a wide assortment!), go for happy hour: it'll be the happiest hour(s) you'll experience.  SO: if it's between the not-so-wee hours of 4:30-6:30pm, grab a lover, grab a buddy, grab an accomplice, RUN FOR IT.  Leave the kiddies behind.  You won't regret it.  Oh yeah, and the cocktails are pretty excellent.  And by pretty excellent, I mean sometimes MINDBLOWING MAGNIFIQUE (Shiso Martini).  Also, they have uni (sea urchin--delicious, creamy, pricey sea urchin).  And I usually hate cooked food in my sushi but the vegetable tempura roll is ungodly good.  That goes for the spicy tuna roll, which comes topped with crunchy goodness--probably panko.    All their sushi is fresh, crisp and flavorful.  If you resist the urge to wolf it down and manage to masticate your food into smaller portions, each and every individual crumb of sushi will unfailingly make sweet vigorous love to each and every individual tastebud in your mouth.  Kind of complicated, but you get my drift.    BUT IT CAN'T BE PERFECT BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T GIVE IT 4 STARS: Ginko's located essentially in Dante's basement, so probably not the greatest for claustrophobic folks.  But as far as windowless, bomb shelters-turned-cramped and dimly lit sushi bars go, the decor is decent.  There's a color TV perched in the corner and the bar's manned at all times by at least one slightly-scowling, highly knowledgeable Japanese sushi chef.  The bar counter is made up of glass panes over this elaborate \"waterfall\" installation--water running over polished earth-toned stones.  The waterfall trickle hasn't been so steady since its opening, so there's some stagnant-looking little pools under some of the panes, which we hypothesize might be responsible for the mildewy scent lingering in the air.  Nothing a little more forceful ventilation and vigilant water stream regulation can't fix.  Finally, a word on the sushi: irrefutably delicious, but could be even more obscenely delicious if they used the traditional sushi rice--short white grain, silky texture, Calrose, etc.  Currently they use the medium-long grain and it's slightly overcooked so a little sticky.  ROUNDUP: Despite minor drawbacks, Ginko still tops the CLE sushi scene and offers one of the best Happy Hour deals around."}
{"text":"As far as where to get the \"best sushi\" in Cleveland, so far I have to agree that Ginko's level of freshness and detail lives up to the title.  We had the otsukuri omakase (translating to random sliced raw fish, chef's selection), which was decent and worthwhile for those seeking sashimi with a twist. Their selection of fish is certainly unique, some of which are unlike any I've had. (May not be ideal for those less adventurous.) Notably, there are many varieties of textures and dashes of flavoring with pepper and other tastes to help enhance the sashimi itself, which spoke to the level of detail presented in Ginkos' dishes. Admittedly, some sashimi did not taste as good as others (some flavors did not appeal to our tastebuds and some textures were on the slimier side), so we likely will stick to more of what we know in the future.  To complement, we also ordered The Zeppelin and Ginko Roll. The Zeppelin contains wasabi inside, but is otherwise is comparable to a rainbow roll. Those eating rolls already with wasabi may find this option less unique. I loved the creativity of the Ginko and use of daikon to wrap the sushi. It very pretty visually and the taste of the sushi did not disappoint.  The ginger was light and sweet and matched well with the other experiences of flavor that night.  What Ginko lacked ultimately for us was the atmosphere and service. The high stool chairs and television running anime in the background makes for a trendy sort of feel, but took away from the restaurant, which otherwise has a more classy vibe. The stools were uncomfortable, and didn't add much to enhance our experience.  The service also left a bit to be desired; with the price point of the restaurant and quality of ingredients, it is disappointing that the service did not match up. Our waitress did not ask us whether it was the first time we had visited, nor walk us through the menu and explain to us the 3 options (Ginko Omakase Tasting, Otsukuri Omakase, and Ginko Nigiri) until prompted. This surprised me, given the quality of service its sister restaurant, Dante, offers.  Ginko is the place to go for quality sushi, but the price point with the level of service and atmosphere will keep us likely from returning often. (Happy Hour may fit the bill better.) For those seeking the quality fish that is otherwise challenging to locate, Ginko certainly has the \"bank\" of quality to fit what you are looking for."}
{"text":"Dante and I just must not have the same taste in food because this is my second average experience at one of his restaurants.  Stopped in this past Saturday for birthday dinner for a friend.  The restaurant was pretty empty at 7:00 pm so we were able to grab a 2 top away from the sushi bar.  Maybe our server was having a bad day, but from the start she didn't seem all that interested in dealing with us.  Sure, I'm a picky vegetarian who asks a lot of questions, but still.  For the price point, I expect a server to be willing to listen to me yammer for a minute or two.  My friend and I hadn't seen each other in awhile and the server seemed annoyed when we weren't immediately ready to order.  (maybe irritated enough to not refill our water glasses during the meal?)    We ordered the shishito peppers to start.  Minus the salmon skin.  They were ok, but not nearly as good as the ones I've had at The Greenhouse Tavern.  When our sushi arrived, I was a little underwhelmed.  I generally order a mountain of sushi and love to see how it's presented, but what we ordered was kind of plopped on a plate.  A clear glass plate that reminded me of something I'd bake a cake in.  But I was still hopeful about the sushi.    We ordered almost every kind of vegetable sushi - everything from asparagus to vegetable tempura.  And they were all kind of underwhelming.  I've had better vegetable sushi from the grocery store.  There were also a couple pieces that had random fish eggs on them which also wasn't cool to me as a vegetarian.    I do think the atmosphere is neat and funky in Ginko, but I can't say I'll be back.  Maybe the non vegetarian sushi is better?"}
{"text":"I always have a great experience here. It's truly the best sushi in town. There are only 3 tables, so if you want one, make reservations. The bar has lots of seating. It's a neat little place in the basement of DBA. The sushi is beautifully prepared and they make the sushi right in front of you at the bar. It's fun to watch the artistry. It can get expensive if you buy by the piece but there  are rolls for 10-15 dollars which are excellent. I recommend the lobster roll and the fatty tuna."}
{"text":"It was expensive but this place is one of the best japanese restaurant around!! My hubby took me for my birthday and they treated us like special even after being late for 30mins :) thank you so much for the great experience of having authentic japanese food, being away from Japan. We will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"It took us three years and rave reviews from a lot of our friends to convince us to come back here.  The six course chef's tasting menu is $79 per person.  It's six very small courses that are perfect for one person.  Considering the prices of everything else, it's the best deal, by far.  Sharing is welcome!  Basically, it's 2 tasting-sized appetizers, four nigiri, the otsukuri omakase (~ 10 pieces of sushi), miso soup, and a choice of dessert.  We ordered this with no wasabi.  The dishes were very creative, the sushi was fresh and expertly made.  Very much a place for special occasions.  Takes reservations, but the place is tiny and you need to reserve far in advance.  We were able to get a reservation for 5:30 pm calling a week in advance."}
{"text":"this is a great place to go for some damn good food. It's not cheap, so be prepared to splurge, just remember that it is worth it!! The sushi was amazing, and the spicy scallop chips are to die for. I definitely recommend branching out and trying something new! You can't go wrong here for sure."}
{"text":"The absolute best sushi in Cleveland. The atmosphere is sleek and romantic, and the food is simply incredible. Beautiful cuts of fish, fresh vegetables, lovely sake menu and wonderfully unique offers. The nigiri menu has some really surprising offers (try the whelk! On second thought, maybe not...) and it's all delicious.   The service is a bit slow, though. The waits between dishes were a bit long, so by the time our main rolls arrived, our \"take\" of sake was down to the dregs. Our waitress also didn't seem to be the most attentive, but I'll give her the benefit of it being a busy Saturday night.   I cannot wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing here! Must get nigiri while your here but the rolls are amazing too. Tight and slightly uncomfortable seating buts thats the only downfall, which is made up for by the extremely quick service and quality if food! This will be a must stop for us when ever we come to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I always come here for their happy hour: it's hard to beat $5 sushi and half off beer! Getting to enjoy this delicious and fresh sushi for such a good price and washing it down with some Asahi is a great way to spend a weeknight. My favorite was actually the vegetarian roll, I always order two of those. Definitely worth checking out, especially for their happy hour!"}
{"text":"Exceptional sushi, great atmosphere, on point menu. Slightly crowded but we were there for valentines day. Otherwise I say 4/5"}
{"text":"The most amazing sushi I've ever had. Better then the rest!  Highly recommended. Try the Spicy Tuna and the Ginko Roll! They don't put cream cheese in anything, but it doesn't need it. This is real sushi the freshest most wonderful I've ever had."}
{"text":"First and foremost, some of the freshest sushi I have ever had and I have eaten A LOT of sushi.   Last night was my first time trying Ginko based on my friend's recommendation. In case you haven't heard, the head chef reserves a handful of seats at the sushi bar in front of him where you essentially are served a tasting menu until you can't breathe. There happened to be two spots available at the bar, and after speaking with the manager we occupied those seats for the rest of the night :)  EVERYTHING the chef put in front of us was unbelievable. Just an excellent selection of sushi. We must of looked like complete morons giving the chef thumbs up every time he presented us with something new, but we didn't care. The food was outstanding and so was the sake selection. Again, this option is only available if you are sitting at the bar in front of the head chef.   Keep in mind that this place is all about the real sushi, if you're into the whole westernized maki dishes with fried shrimp and covered in wasabi mayo Ginko might not be what you're looking for.   The experience we had yesterday is known as the 'chef's table' and you will pay a hefty fee for it. Next time I am in the mood for sushi I will try the food of the regular menu just to see how good it is but after last night I have very high expectations!"}
{"text":"I can't remember the time I was so disappointed in a restaurant! I went with a girlfriend from work. Neither of us had ever been, but both wanted to try. We went one day after a long day of work. We both got out of work at 3:30. As we learned, Ginko doesn't open until 4:30. That should have been our first sign to turn and run. We went somewhere else in Tremont to get drinks and wait until they opened.   The restaurant is hidden, down a staircase, and its TINY. Just like the menu. We sat at a table, ordered some wine (it was happy hour, the only saving grace of this trip was each glass was half off) and looked at the menu. We each ordered two rolls. They were SO small. The soy sauce tasted like bbq sauce. We each ordered edamame as well. There were globs of salt rocks on the edamame and I've never had bad edamame before, until today. I also asked for a second glass of wine and they never brought it to me. Whatever, their loss. All of this for $30 bucks and I went home hungry. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I am giving Ginko a 4 based on my first visit.  I came in with a couple lady friends to have some sushi on a Thursday evening.  Ginko was not crowded, the overall atmosphere was pleasant and the quality of the Sashimi and Sushi was outstanding!  Second visit, was on a Friday and was very crowded and therefore, the service and also even the quality of the Sashimi was less than the first visit.  I will go back a third time to see if it still lives up to my 4 star expectations."}
{"text":"Sit at the bar and watch all the prep! We didn't have a reservation & were able to walk right in. The place is very small. We had 6 rolls and two drinks and a dessert and bill was around $80. Some of the rolls were over priced. The jumbo shrimp roll was the best sushi I have ever had. Ambiance is on point. We will be back"}
{"text":"Wow...for everyone on here that thinks this is the best sushi...you really need to get out more. Giant Eagle has better sushi than this place! First of all super chincy on the fish in the rolls and the servings. The selection is also very limited, Really disappointed. If you want some really fancy looking place and rolls, that is about all you will get here. If you're a serious sushi eater and are concerned with the quality of the fish and taste, than you better bypass or you will be disappointed. Not to mention I called to make a reservation, which I was told they were booked, but the sushi bar is first come first serve. When we arrived, there were about 10 stools open but we still had a 15 min. wait, oh yea and tables were open too."}
{"text":"Finally I feel brave enough to write this review. I say this because I wanted to love Ginko. Why? Because 1) sushi has been my favorite meal since I was youngster and 2) Ginko trees are my favorite and 3) everyone else talks to highly of it. Well, I was extremely underwhelmed by what I experienced.   Let me set the scene... I had already been to Fat Cats earlier in the day, and had a horrific meal there (yes, it's been reviewed). So, we arrived at Ginko for a 9:30pm meal. From what I can recall we ended up ordering a two rolls (negi hamachi and spicy tuna) and then otsukuri (hamachi, sake, and shiro maguro). My overall reaction to the meal was that yes, it was fresh and tasty but not mind blowing-ly so. It is just as good as Pacific East. In fact, I would say Pacific East is preferable since it is slightly cheaper, more substantial sizes, and more elbow room. In the end though... EH. I would go again, perhaps at a lunch time, but really I'm not going to rush back.   I will say that the setting was definitely quaint, which appeals to me typically. Most of the seating was at the bar, and then booth tables around the walls. But the bar seating doesn't work well if you're a woman with a large purse. So ladies, make sure you grab a crossbody before going here!"}
{"text":"SUMMARY: It's ok...  but didn't live up to the hype.    FULL STORY: Had heard about this place being good for sushi in CLE... after a recent visit, I can't say I agree.  It's a tight space -- a central, U-shaped bar with a couple of small tables around.  Would recommend reservations (open table).  I could see it working for a date. The host and servers were nice.    Our table tried lots of different menu options -- most weren't bad, but I was surprised when nothing stood out in particular as much more fresh or creative than other similar places.    Something in one of our rolls tasted stale -- kind of like it had been sitting in plastic too long. The eggplant is super sour and a huge, tough piece... not really pleasant to eat, even when you're expecting it to be pickled.  Overall it was an ok experience, but below what you'd expect for the price in Ohio.   Note: It's downstairs from street level... in a basement.  No cell signal, but they have wifi."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Everything I've ever ordered was perfectly delicious. The service here is five stars on it's own. The manager (I think) of this place is just a real gem--always remembers his customers, informative about the food and Japanese culture without an ounce of pretentiousness. This place holds up compared to my sushi experiences in San Francisco and Vancouver. It's pricey and I'm not made of money, but I've got zero hard feelings once the bill comes. It's worth the experience."}
{"text":"This is arguably the finest restaurant in Cleveland. The sushi is always fresh and beautiful. The service is fantastic. It's expensive, but justifiably so. I come here as often as I can. What a phenomenal restaurant."}
{"text":"I give Ginko a 4 star overall, the sushi itself should be 5 but the overall experience is 4. I love the décor and the sushi bar.  It transfer you to a real sushi place in one of the Asia city.  Warning: the place is really small, beside the sushi bar, there are only two booths and each could fit 4-5 peoples.   We have 5 peoples and we are celebrated someone's birthday; we reserve the booth and want to try their Shabu Shabu which only available in the booth.  Since we have 5 peoples and we order everything and share.  We try a lot of dishes: the six courses tasting menu, otsukur omaskase (chef selection sushi), ginko nigiri (9 pc sushi set dinner), shabu shabu, extra sushi, and appetizers.  The shabu shabu is the biggest disappointment of the night, luck we only order the angus beef for $25.  There is thin slices beef with some vegetable. No big deal, there is no noodle with it and the broth is just water, not much taste.  However, the sauces for dipping are very good.    The appetizers to recommend are the Oyster 3 ways and the Unagi/Foie Gras sushi.  The Oyster 3 ways come with 3 different sauces.  Their Unagi (BBQ Eel) cook perfectly and top with Foie Gras are a nice touch.    The sushi is to die, very fresh fishes and the sushi rice is excellent.  They have a large selection of fishes and roes, the sea urchin is especially fresh so did the sweet shrimps.  The nice touch is they deep fried the shrimp head as real Japanese sushi bar will do.   The sushi rice is very tasteful, it is not too sweet or sour, and you can taste the individual grain.     At the end we share the dessert:  Harumaki (fried banana); very good chocolate sauces for the crispy fried banana.  Next time we will try their sushi bar, and order their Omakase sushi (Chef Selection).  For Cleveland area, we are lucky to have such high quality sushi bar"}
{"text":"Hands down the most amazingly delicious spicy tuna roll I have ever experienced in my life."}
{"text":"One of the coolest environments I've seen in any restaurant, and especially cool for sushi. The sushi itself was excellent - masterfully prepared by Sushi Chefs right before our eyes. Delicious, obviously very fresh and beautifully presented. The place is very small, and tight, and, for my taste - a bit noisy, but the sushi is excellent, and it is a great little room!"}
{"text":"Truly exceptional sushi bar. Love the uni & scallop and the eel. They also have a good selection of sake. If you want a table, definitely reserve in advance. They have 2 big tables and 2 small for a party of 2. They also have 24 bar seats which are first come first serve."}
{"text":"This is some solid sushi nestled into a basement in Tremont.  After longing for the ridiculously fresh and amazingly cheap sushi offerings available 24 hours a day in NYC, I finally went out with friends to imbibe sake and place my hesitant toe in the unfamiliar waters of sushi in Cleveland.  First, we all were given the requisite warm little hand towels. (I love those warm little hand towels. It reminds me that eating is an experience, not just a need.)  One of us began with a few sashimi and was quite happy with them, judging by their startlingly fast disappearance from their plate. We continued with the edamame and ordered some classics like the Spicy Tuna roll and the Jumbo Shrimp Tempura roll.  Both rolls were delicious, fresh, and appropriately sized.  I enjoyed the Yellowtail and Scallion (Negi Hama) roll, which is simple but highlighted the freshness of the fish. Lastly, we savored the Fatty Tuna (Negi Toro) roll, the perennial favorite of one of my friends.  He was quite happy with it and had no complaints.  There was another delicious roll somewhere in here, but at this point the sake consumption had peaked.  Yest, we played it safe on our first visit, but Ginko proved that it's worthiness of a return visit for more adventurous offerings."}
{"text":"Let's not kid ourselves: I am a complete sushi novice.   At my brash suggestion, my sister treated to dinner during my first visit here.  7pm, Friday, I called to see if they could seat 4 of us within minutes, figuring that this wasn't likely. Surprisingly, they had 4 seats at the bar. Margaret, the cute as a button hostess, was welcoming.   For all 4 of us, it was our first time there, and Quintin, our server, gracefully answered all of our questions (yes, I didn't know how to eat a hand roll....) and was extremely attentive to us, without making us feel intimidated. Seated right in front of one of the sous-chef's workstations, we chatted briefly with one of them for a bit and he also offered his insights while working and was very knowledgeable about the daily specials off-menu.    Maki and hand rolls are between 4-15, depending on what it is.   Compared to sushi rock, my only other sushi experience, the rice here was more moist, and seemed to taste fresher. The Abolone, off menu, for $16, was a bit chewy, although it's been years since I last had it.    Their happy hour was also solid, with a 3 types of rolls for $5 each (each roll with 5-6 pieces) including a roll of the day that included mango and complimented whatever else that was on it well [fresh mango in March ? chalk one up for globalization there].   Their wine list is a tad small, about 4-5 bottles of each kind. Beer is relatively expensive ($8+) but it's all imported from Japan [Hitachino Nest and some other kind] and during happy hour, it's half off.   The flaming lips, radiohead quietly played in the background. Millipede arcade cabinet in the corner with the cheesy godzilla flicks from the 50s in the background.   Both visits were splendid treats  [don't know why yelp is saying I checked in 3x.] Quoting Paulius, carry on."}
{"text":"chop chop, little fish only the best at Ginko a major award!  This is just freakin' stellar.  I have eaten sushi all over the states, and I will honestly say this:    Ginko stands alone.  In Cleveland.  In Tremont.  In the Midwest.  Best.  Sushi.  Ever.  Flawless presentation, from the sushi rice, to the real wasabi, to the homemade soy sauce.  Exotic cuts of fish unheard of in these here parts until now, fantastic Sake list, and a menu that fully covers all of the bases, from a sushi novice, to the connoisseur.  Impeccable service as well.  The waiter had more knowledge of product then I have ever experienced.   The presentations were spectacular. Truly, art on a plate.  I will add that the portion sizes were on the larger size, but without being vulgar.  I could go on and on, but let me just finish with this:   Go here.  Eat here.  It does not get better, anywhere.  Carry on."}
{"text":"Recently moved here from Chicago, and after searching for sushi in this city we tried Ginko based on the suggestions of fellow Yelpers and others.  Sadly disappointed.    As i do with most new places, I order the baseline items for pure comparison - and as a first round we ordered a tuna role, yellowtail and scallion and one of their special roles.  What we got in return was rice rolled up in seaweed with a sliver (and i'm not exaggerating) of fish in each roll.  Sure, some will say we should've started off with the speciality rolls rather than the basic boring rolls.  However, we had enough rice to decide we didn't need to try anything else - 3 very small rolls, 2 beers and $55 later, we packed up and went to another nearby place for another drink and appetizer.  Subpar, very overpriced sushi.  Cleveland, you deserve better."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the Cleveland area! The BBQ eel and duck fat is OUT OF THIS WORLD! Happy hour is also great here! Will return soon!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say I was a little concerned when walking down the creepy stairway to this restaurant. The words \"where are you taking us...?\" were uttered more than once by my dinner companions. However, I had faith! From the raving reviews from my fellow yelper friends, I was convinced this place was going to be great! Correct on all accounts.  There was a wait of course, given the size of this establishment, but the wonderful hostess took down my name and phone number so we could go have a drink down the street while we waited. We ended up sitting at the sushi bar and it was quite a different experience. They gave us a warm towel to wipe our hands with when we sat down. It was obviously very funny to my friends at first but now, I expect a towel at the beginning of all my meals! I don't think my boyfriend approves of this time consuming activity before our dinners at home....anyway....  The food was fabulous and our waiter was very patient with us  explaining what everything on the menu was. The whole party enjoyed their food and I can say without hesitation that Ginko made it on our top sushi list!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sushi place I've been to. I went on a date with my boyfriend for Christmas; it was a hole in the wall place with a sketchy entrance. But the second we stepped in, it felt like we were in Tokyo. We got the 5-course Chef's special. Expensive as all get-go. 100% worth it. The most exquisite tastes I've experienced. Everyone was kind, understanding, and explained every single bite. Would recommend for special occasions."}
{"text":"So we went to this place for new year's based on multiple great reviews.  Made a reservation for 6pm, no issue.  However when we arrived, we were informed that it was a fixed menu, which honestly was pretty over priced. This was not told to us at the time of reservation.  We asked if we could just order off the regular menu since the place was pretty empty, answer was no.   Decided to stay anyways due to great reviews on food quality.  The fixed menu was not good, I would give it 0/10.  Poor choices all around for almost every course of 8.  They didn't even include a roll!  We had to order additional rolls beyond what we were served just to get something decent.   I will say the rolls we ordered were pretty good, but the overall experience was just really bad.  If I was a jerk I would call my credit card company to reverse the charge since it was just such a poor experience."}
{"text":"Good. Dark. Pricey.   We had it bad for some sushi one night and decided to check out the much - hyped Ginko beneath the restaurant Dante.  I really liked the atmosphere - very dark and lounge-ish. It's a small place with few tables but a decent sized bar to sit at - must do anyway since you obviously want to watch the talented sushi people ply their trade. Reservations are a good idea unless you plan on coming on a weeknight like we did.   I ordered a couple of rolls and Sean had the chef's choice sampler for his fish. Both quite good although nothing extremely unique or mind-altering. We also got the Blistered Shishito Peppers for an appetizer. They were pretty tasty but WAY too big a portion for two people. This one's definitely a 4-way share. We ended up only eating about 2/3rds of them because in the end, you're just sitting there eating mouthfuls of peppers.   I can't really add the 5th star because I have had better, more satisfying sushi meals in the past and because Ginko is definitely up on the pricier side but we will most likely be back sometime when we're in the mood for sushi."}
{"text":"My husband is a bit of a sushi snob because of his 4 years living in Japan and most of his complaints when we go out for sushi is about the rice: \"too gummy\", \"too sticky\", and the likes; however, when we checked out Ginko for happy hour we ended up rolling right into dinner and stayed 3 hours ordering and enjoying everything off the menu. My husband said this is hands down the most authentic and delicious sushi he has tasted in Cleveland! The food and drinks here are so good and we raved about it so much we actually got giftcards to Ginko from our friends as wedding gifts!! It's got a great vibe and ambiance."}
{"text":"according to stephen k's review (who swears he's not a sushi snob) this is terrible sushi and he knows because he's half japanese. But according to everyone else, myself included, this is definitely the best sushi in Cleveland.   i've never had a bad experience and I want to say i've been here about 7 times. the service is always on par and the fish is always of excellent quality/fresh and comparable to sushi of gari or blue ribbon in NYC. it is not cheap, but you are eating sushi. if you want cheap sushi, go to Otani.   my fiancé is fond of the omakase and I usually order nigiri a la carte and we always end up ordering another round. they also have one of the best wakame salads, that's not to be missed! Quin who works here goes above and beyond with hospitality and friendliness. he knows who's a regular here and always makes a point to say hello, which is something I find as a dying gesture. the cocktails are all super unique and creative and they don't skimp on the alcohol. my fiancé especially loves ginko having moved here from manhattan and not being able to find decent sushi in cleveland.  It's a hidden gem in Cleveland and always at the top of our list."}
{"text":"Not as good as the sushi at Sushi Sam's in San Mateo, CA but it is probably the best sushi place in Cleveland. I will need to adjust my rating for Sushi Rock and Ohashi after this. One thing I know is that this is the ONLY place in Cleveland that serves toro (fatty tuna) and someone please correct me if I'm wrong.   Great hostess and wait staff and they do provide coat checks. I started off with the truffle miso and it was probably the most flavorful miso soup I have had and was worth the $3 upcharge from the regular miso. Next was an order of spicy tuna cut roll and the negi toro (fatty tuna and scallion) cut roll. Both was delicious but the star was definitely the toro. I'm definitely going to hit this place up at happy hour and also get a drink or two in the next time around.  Only downside is that this place is tiny and I believe there are only two or three tables that can sit a group of four or more comfortably. Very intimate for a evening date and both are you are craving sushi."}
{"text":"We were recommended this place by a local friend so decided to venture out to the Tremont area to check it out. Having been to numerous sushi bars, I am always up for the next one. It took us a while to find the place since the entrance way is pretty much hidden, but the staircase and solid black doors had a nice appeal. Upon walking in, we were both stunned at the apperance, all of the blown glass attributes definitely made it pleasing to you eye. We were promtly greated and sat at a table. After that it took FOREVER to even get a drink, we got looked at many times but barely acknowledged. We ended up having to move to the bar to order our sushi. The amazing food and authenticity made up for the sub par service. The craftsmanship of the rolls and just straight up art was incredible. We've been known to always test a place out by the California roll, which I must say was rather good. We also had the signature, Ginko roll, which was huge! and the soft shell crab roll, which I wouldn't order again, if it's not tempura, I don't like fried food in my sushi. This place does not look like it is in Cleveland, we felt like we were out of town but the very modern atmosphere and was a nice break from the daily grind. We will definitely go back and hope that the servers have their act together because this place would be 5 stars otherwise!"}
{"text":"I can't believe the reviews this place gets.  If I could give it 0 stars I would.  The place looks great, it's beautiful inside- that's about all it has going for it unfortunately.  I went there with a friend, we ordered the spicy tuna roll ($7.00).  Spicy tuna is our staple to order and judge how much we like a place.  Worst Spicy Tuna Roll Ever.  It was all mayo, it had NO heat to it at all.  The filling was pink, not red, because of all the mayo.  The roll was also very overpriced, 7 bucks for a bunch of mayo, rice, and a whole lot of crunch topping, no Thank you.  The whole place is overpriced.  I've had sushi in NYC at a fancy place that wasn't nearly this expensive.  It really is shame I can't like this place.  I'd been looking forward to it opening forever.  Oh well."}
{"text":"A tad on the pricey side. I would have liked a fork!  Sushi was great. Atmosphere was awesome, very trendy. The hostess was awesome! So friendly, accommodating. The server was great. Definitely knew her stuff. Would I come back, hell yea!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I did not actually eat at Ginko.  My rating is based purely on my experience trying to eat there on a recent Saturday night.    I went to meet a friend for dinner at Ginko without reservations.  BIG mistake, HUGE.  Apparently, the half empty restaruant could not accomodate two more diners due to a plethera of reservations.  All of the tables were empty and half the bar was empty as well, but there was no room for us.    The hostess told us that it would be a 30 minute wait.  Okay, not that bad for a Saturday night.  She took my cell phone number and we went shopping at Banyon Tree across the street.  We gave up trying at Ginko when we returned 30 minutes later to find that there were still 5 people ahead of us for a table.  We left.    They called me an hour and 15 minutes later to offer us a table.    Moral of the story... don't try to eat at Ginko on Saturday night without a reservation."}
{"text":"Ginko should be on your radar if you are a Cleveland sushi lover. Walk down the dark stairs and enter the tiny but inviting restaurant complete with a modern but comfy feel.  We decided to come during happy hour because we wanted to try \"Cleveland's best sushi\" without burning a hole in our pocket. All cocktails are $5 during happy hour so take advantage of that and try something you wouldn't normally.  We  ordered the roll of the day (tuna avocado), salmon roll, spicy tuna roll, and veggie tempura. (All $5 4:30-6:30 during happy hour.) We also tried the shrimp tempura roll which was a standout. This was some of the freshest sushi i have ever had, with the spicy tuna and tuna avocado being my favorite.  All in all two of us drank and ate for a little over $50. Add this restaurant to your special occasion rotation!"}
{"text":"Went on a friend's recommendation and was blown away by the great appetizers, drinks and sushi. Crowded, small location in a basement, but it's a cool space!"}
{"text":"Tiny portions but huge prices. Other than that loved the  food, environment and service."}
{"text":"People who give this place anything more than two or three stars know absolutely nothing about sushi. The reason I gave this place a one star is because of their outrageous prices compared to their horrific sushi quality.  Yes, I am a half Japanese, Japanese speaking guy who has lived in Japan and has been to Tsukiji market many times (the Tokyo market with the best sushi in the world), and has been spoiled with good sushi while living in LA for the past 20 years.  But I am in no way a sushi snob, now that I'm living in Cleveland, my expectations were much lower. Even though the sushi bar boasts flying in tuna from Japan and New York, there's no way that this actually happens, unless that tuna is flown in a warm, humid container and the fish spoils on the way in.  I gave this place a try twice. I did the most expensive omakase first, then next time ordered individually to try to find ANYTHING that was good. Everything I ate was old, scaly, smelly, and chewy (and no I wasn't eating octopus). And the prices were so outrageous I decided I would never ever come back. I met a Cleveland local the second time who knew all of the chefs who was telling me this used to be his favorite sushi place, but that in the past year the quality had gone down the toilet. We both agreed you can get way more for your money if you go to pacific east and stick to ordering certain items (like tuna) as there are at least SOME decent selections there."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple friends and we got the 6 course meal, and it was amazing. Very fresh and delicious. I don't remember the names of all the dishes, there were a few hot dishes and nigiri/sashimi plates. I loved the dessert, I got the matcha cheesecake with strawberry sorbet, my friends got the chocolate mousse with black sesame ice cream."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed a recent meal here with the YELP international supper club.  The food are extremely interesting to me as I like Japanese but have not had Japanese food in a long time. They have unique kinds of Sake served cold which I had never had.  They were on the slightly sweet side and very good with hints of lemon and melon.  They are served in a wooden glass, which is square and squat.  It sits atop a plate and is poured by someone other than you and is poured to overflow the wooden glass and into the plate to demonstrate that life is overflowing with goodness and good things.  The service was really excellent.  The prices were fair but expensive and that is the only reason that I am giving a 4 vs a 5.  However, if you are out for a wonderful Japanese experience what to me had this teaching, more authentic aspect than many Japanese restaurants I have been to in the past, (although its been some years now) this would make a five star choice. Its chic, its small, and its fun.  I also observed parts of the group getting a type of unique kettle cooking I had never seen.  If you go, ask about this too. The selection of Japanese food, the cooking,(for those that were cooked)  the preparation and the presentations were all top shelf."}
{"text":"5+ stars, easily.   The service, food, and ambience is far superior to any sushi restaurant I've ever been to. And I have a suspicion that this will hold true for a long time... even when my trip to Tokyo finally comes around.   I'm quite familar with the in-state variety of fish usually served in Ohio restaurants...with that same variety usually present in most chain restaurants nationwide. You will find none of that nonsense here. I'm 98.5% sure I can't enjoy sushi ever again unless it's from Ginko or a restaurant of the same excellence.   Please try the 6 course meal. It was phenomenal.  I will definitely come back. No matter how far away I end up from Cleveland."}
{"text":"Yummy kinda pricy totally worth it sushi. This places sushi was good and did come with a little bit of a higher price tag. I did enjoy it and would go back for sure. Kind of hard to find as it's hidden next to Dante and you go down some steps to a door into a basement type area. Due to it being in this type of atmosphere although cool, space is limited. They have a few bigger tables for groups, a sushi bar and then small two person seats along the walls. Was sat at the small two person seats and the table is connected to the wall so you can't even create more room. I'm a small person and this was even too small for my liking. So if your like me and need some extra arm room when your throwing down sushi or well any type of food when you make a reservation which I would recommend ask for one of the bigger tables. Yummy fresh sushi I will check out again."}
{"text":"Finally. A real sushi place in Cleveland. So happy that it's finally here!  I give it 4.25-4.5 stars. Not necessarily a 5 quite yet- I wasn't super blown away, but it's definitely better and so much more fresh than other sushi that I've attempted to eat in Cleveland and around Cleveland. It's comparable to a good sushi place in other cities (thus, my non-5 star rating), but for Cleveland, I think this is definitely a great step in the right direction. (I remember there was a sushi place on the east side of CLE where the sushi was warm. And not the right color.. after that, I gave up hope..but then, BAM, here came Ginko).  My friend and I arrived around 7:30pm. It's right next to Dante and you have to walk down a set of stairs to a door where Ginko is. (Reminded me of a speakeasy lounge in Chicago... where I'm like...oh what? I'm going down these random stairs?)  It was a tad empty, but as the night when on (past 8pm), the place filled up fast. Koji was our sushi chef, as we sat at the bar, and he was incredibly cordial and informative about the sushi, the specials, and everything. Any question we had, he could answer- and was just a cool person to chat with.  The decor is full of warm colors- definitely gave it a warm fuzzy vibe in the midst of a sushi place. The restaurant itself is rather small- but hey, it IS in a basement of all things.  We ordered the unagi foie gras to start off. It was pretty good- I had really never had the combination together, so it was interesting..and the amount that came out was a lot more than I thought! I ordered some good brown rice green tea, and it was quite the perfect match. One of their specials of the night was their mackerel- a special cut from Japan, as Koji stated. We ordered the mackerel nigiri- and it was FRESH. Oh happiness.  For specialty rolls, we got the ginko roll and the nippon roll. The ginko roll was good- it had tuna, salmon, avocado, daikon, and other things, all wrapped up in a cucumber, with differing colors of tobiko on top- so that was quite pretty. And good. The nippon roll....was... a tad adventurous for us. haha. Burdock root? Koji gave us some to try- and we liked it. Ok, let's order the nippon roll- squid, shiso, plum, root... and... I think neither of us had really had raw squid. It was rather..different.   I think I need to go back and try the other items on the menu as well..(the food...plus the sake next time), but it's a definitely great place to bring out of town friends, as well as just a cool place to chill and get some good food. Bravo, Ginko- finally an authentic place in Cleveland. :)"}
{"text":"THIS IS THE UPSCALE VERSION OF TOKYO IN CLEVELAND! NO JOKE! if you can afford it, you should definitely try it!  The first floor is a bar room, and hidden in the downstairs is this magic space with all the sushis and sashimis. Being in cleveland, I don't get the opportunities to eat many fancy seafood (not like in westcoast your get your sea urchin and fatty tuna whenever you want), but they really have those fancy options in great condition and great taste available to you. Their sake selections were also pretty amazing. I don't know what else to say, JUST GO!"}
{"text":"The food is very beautiful to look at and the atmosphere reminds me of places in Tokyo. It's definitely authentic. The only issue is that it is pretty pricey, especially for Cleveland. Sashimi was $4 a piece."}
{"text":"Sushi was great, fresh and very nice when presented. Service was great. Very knowledgable of the menu. Gave great details to everything that was offered. Very impressed with all aspects of the restaurant. Sake hangover was not to pleasant but the 2 happy hour specials were great"}
{"text":"I would say Ginko is the Best restaurant  in Cleveland probably. Everything was delicious and the fish is just so fresh and tasty. Aji was a great starter. We ate the fresh meat and they fried the rest for us. Even the deep fried fish was so good with the salty green tea dip. And the Sushi was even better than a lot of the five star sushi restaurants that I have been to in New York. Chocolate Putin was a awesome dessert to end the dinner! I love this place!"}
{"text":"It has already been about two months since I came to Ginko. I have been tweeting too much. Yelp is no longer my only outlet of weirdness. I came for the happy hour by myself and was treated extremely well by the staff. Dante was down in the basement and seemed to be a really friendly guy. I always stick with basic sushi pieces and don't venture into shelled creatures or things like that. The atmosphere was great and the food was also. I enjoyed eating in the dark basement. I have been talking about this place ever since early June and I need to go back."}
{"text":"Not too sure what the hype is about.  Went for dinner with a friend.  The service was definitely deserving of 4 stars, but the food...not so much.  A 4-5 star place should have amazing food, service, ambiance, etc.  This place achieves a 4 on all levels except for food, which unfortunately for them is the most critical thing one looks for in a restaurant.    You basically get half the amount of food at twice the price of average Japanese restaurants.  Quality definitely trumps quantity, but with that said, the taste at this outwardly pleasant establishment is seriously lacking.  The food is very artistically crafted and pleasing to the eyes.  The waitress even serves your appetizers/entrees with an illustrative story behind each piece and demonstrates how the chef artfully creates a masterpiece.  It felt like I was in a Japanese garden listening to a Haiku.  However, the seats are a bit uncomfortable and the restaurant decor, while nice, is far from that of a zen garden.  And then with high expectations, I bite into an extremely mediocre piece of fish with rice and then some even more average tasting pieces of tempura.  I felt like I paid for a Cezanne, received a package of what looked like a Van Gogh, and opened up to see construction paper glued together by a 4 year-old.  No, you can't just decorate a plate, put colorful pieces of food together, slap on a story, charge more money and try and trick people into thinking it's good-tasting food.  I actually have real taste buds that can't be fooled.  This is not what good Japanese food tastes like."}
{"text":"Now I understand why there aren't many pictures of the interior...because it's difficult to imagine taking a photo of anything other than the stunning food.  And, also because Ginko is pretty tiny.    Highlights - Ginko Usuzukuri (Hamachi), Oysters 3 ways, Madai, and Sake Toro Aburi.    Next time I might have to order the Oysters 3 ways, 3 times.  If you like oysters, they're that good."}
{"text":"Little pricey but good quality fish. The fish tasted fresh and had a good texture. My only complaint is that there were not as many sushi roll options to choose from compared to other restaurants I have been to. The restaurant atmosphere was different and I liked the idea of sitting at a bar and being able to watch the chefs prepare our sushi. The bar table top had a piece of class and under it was rocks and random items, my boyfriend made the comment that it would be cool if there was a fish tank under the glass so customers would be able to see fish swimming under the glass while we ate. The sushi was unique and tasty overall. We will be returning."}
{"text":"I went to Ginko having not been in for about two years. Today I tried lunch, which only is on Fridays from 11:30.    The kitchen, which is majorly in view at a central raw bar, was fast enough making our sushi to order. The waitress we had was nice and quickly refilled waters several times.   I tried the Spicy Tuna Roll which was good as usual. The Zeppelin Speciality Roll was also tasty. My least favorite was the Soft Shell Crab Roll. The fried flavor from the crab overwhelmed the entire piece of sushi and all other flavors I thought.   I'm wouldn't call this my favorite sushi place in town, but I'd definitely go back. I like the decor and feel of this underground space."}
{"text":"Ginko is the best sushi in Cleveland - hands down.   My husband and I have gone to Ginko at least 30-40 times (no joke - we are addicts) in the last 2 years and have had a consistently amazing meal each and every single time. We also frequently get it as take out (we have an problem)  Ginko sushi is incredible. The fish is amazing and completely fresh. I have not had the luxury of trying the chefs specials but they look amazing. The Truffled Miso soup is unbelievable. They have an ever-changing appetizer menu but they are all excellent.   If you are out of work in time for happy hour - I highly recommend their spicy tuna and vegetable tempura rolls. Wine selection and cocktails are always excellent. Their staff are also incredible - especially Quentin who goes above and beyond everytime we are there (which is a lot) to make sure that we have nice experience. He is incredible and tries his best always to make sure that you have a great dinner.   GO! You will not regret it :)  L&R"}
{"text":"Unbelievable sushi. Service is amazing. We are so lucky to have a restaurant of this level in Cleveland. If you haven't been there, go!"}
{"text":"It's really not fair for me to rate sushi restaurants on the same 5-point scale... My 5* is reserved (see below) for the best of a category.  And although this place rocks, it's not the absolute best.  That being said, it's the absolute best for a reasonably priced restaurant that's in my city, that I can go to without saving and setting aside money just for the event.  I'm giving it a 4.5* that I cannot round to 5 just because I'm sticking to a consistent rating system.  But by every-day standard, this place is a solid 5*!  The bf brought me here for my birthday dinner, and we had the omakase (6-course meal).  We both really enjoyed the meal, and left sufficiently satiated. The problem with omakase at sushi places is that you often finish the courses and still feel hungry.  But here, we had a cute little appetizer dish, followed by a wonderful grilled black cod with miso paste (I'm assuming it's inspired by Nobu's black cod with miso -- different, not as good, but still delicious).  The next 2 courses were a sashimi platter, followed by a nigri platter -- both serving quality fresh cuts of fish, presented beautifully, and yummilicious!  And the last 2 courses were miso soup and a dessert.  Their green tea ice cream is made in house using match green tea -- which I love!!  But if you're used to the store-bought super sweet green tea, you'll find this to be much less sweet and a stronger green tea flavor.   If you call ahead quite a bit in advance, you can reserve a table.  We did, just because the bf hates waiting for restaurants.  But they have very few tables, most of the seating is at the bar -- and that's walk-in seating.  If you come during peak hours, you'll likely have to wait 60-90 mins for a seat without reservations. If you're planning on walking in, try going before 7pm or after 10pm to avoid the long wait.  But regardless of how you go, just go... it's delicious!  ----------------------------------- Explanation of my rating system - 5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back 4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category 3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either. 2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it. 1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"This place is under Dante. You walk down an almost hidden staircase and enter through old Japanese style swinging doors, I was all for it by now when I went. Its fairly small inside, but has a good vibe to it. I sat at the bar and you can watch your sushi being made. While sitting I noticed the bar has glass tops with a nature scene theme to it. Food comes out well prepped and im a firm believer, presentation is key to enjoying your meal.   I ordered a bottle of saki, it was dam good too. Happy hour prices are good, 4-6$ for rolls, theyll get you where you need to be. I like Asahi beer with sushi, they of course have it on the menu."}
{"text":"This is the BEST sushi in Cleveland. No where else compares with their high quality sushi and service. It might be small and in the basement of Dantes but it has such a cool atmosphere. If you come in and it is busy they recommend you to drink at the bar upstairs and they will come and get you when seats are available. It is so worth doing because Dantes has an excellent bartender named Paul.   Here are my recommendations on what you should get if you are a newbie:  Appetizers: Spicy Scallop Chips (made with pringles haha), Truffled Miso Soup & their specials are always good like their two part mackerel app  Sushi: Unagi and Foie Gras (mind blowing) & spicy tuna roll (the best you will ever have in the US)  If they have Otoro do yourself a favor and order it nigiri. Seriously melt in your mouth goodness.   If you have the money or wanna go all out get the otsukuri omakase or ginko nigiri platters. I did this once there and it was amazing. Wish I could afford to do it every time.  Dessert: Apple Tempura is really good!!  The sushi chefs are so much fun to watch. They are all really talented especially the sushi master there.  It might be pricey here but so worth it."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  Why not five?  Because I expect nothing less than perfection from Chef Dante. But next to Pacific East, this is my go-to place for sushi, and now that I live less than 3 blocks away, I really don't know what will keep me from the extraordinary Happy Hour and beyond, every day.  Even guilt-inducing thoughts of dwindling fish populations barely registers on my normally moral conscience, when it comes to uni atop a cooked scallop.  Just ask Chef Taishi about uni (sea urchin) and his face will beam with delight, and he will chirp happily about how Japanese mothers feed it to babies. If you've never had sea urchin, imagine truffled butter with a hint of sea breeze slowly disintegrating on your tongue.  Yeah, Japanese babies obviously have excellent taste.  This, and the red snapper, are your best bets here, but sit in front of Chef Taishi and ask his opinion.  He'll offer you the freshest and choicest cuts.    P.S. If you're a lucky girl and have $200 to spend on a meal or have a wonderful man who understands the worth of a $200 meal, try the chef's tasting menu.  If you do, throw in an extra $50 and get one of every martini (especially the Shiso Martini), and cram yourself into a table by the semi-arched, red-tiled walls.  This is probably as close as you'll get in CLE to the feel of an underground Tokyo sushi haven."}
{"text":"Even though I could only rank at 5 stars, Ginko definitely earned 6 stars. Had dinner with my mom last Saturday for Mother's Day.  Booked reservations a month before my Boston fly-back through Cleveland to visit my mom.  Ginko, Japanese for bank, is in the basement of a granite bank building. My Japanese mother was a bit leary as we walked down the long set of steps and into a very quaint and very lively social scene. Five table locations, two seating only two, in addition to the large semi-circle sushi bar. My mom was in awe of the hip and chatty patrons. We sat at a high-top bamboo table for two and each ordered the 5-course plus miso soup omakase chef tasting menu.  Each course was an excitingly visual and sensational surprise for the senses. Any one of the courses would have been enough to give Ginko 6 stars for food and service.  During one course, we enjoyed the tail of a raw prawn and took the chef's offer from our host, who was amazing during the whole experience, to return the heads for light batter and gentle fry - it was wonderful. We both ordered mochi for the final course - six total miniature delights of flavor including lychee, mango, peanut butter, and green tea. My mother's own review of the night - it was a beautiful dream that she will cherish and never forget! What more can I say?"}
{"text":"When a truly special occasion comes around and it's time to treat yo' self, Ginko should be on your shortlist of celebration spots! Or, if you're alone in Tremont at Happy Hour on a random Tuesday, Ginko should also be in your sights then! The Best Sushi in Cleveland is enough to make any day feel special.   Everything on the menu is a must-try, but here are some high notes that you should really try to hit on a first visit:   - Oshi Sushi - Unagi and Foie Gras: Crispy Eel, perfectly sweet and salty, over a thin layer of Foie Gras on a rectangular bed of perfect sumeshi, embedded with a fresh shisho leaf. 6 pieces. This dish is an overwhelming sensory delight that melts in your mouth. I get it each and every time I go!  - The Zeppelin: Akin to Ginko's version of a Rainbow Roll: classic and executed flawlessly.  - Spicy Scallop Chips: A totally unexpected, innovative dish that will cause you to exclaim with pleasure.  Ginko even elevates the most basic sushi bar fare: miso soup becomes Truffled Miso Soup with Lobster. The California Roll is stuffed with lump crab and tobiko.     I also recommend openly seeking recommendations from the staff and enthusiastically trying anything that they might suggest; it's a small staff and they are all steeped in sushi wisdom. The service here is always incredible!"}
{"text":"Only downside is the restaurant only seats 25 - 30 people. Otherwise it is the best Japanese restaurant that I have been to since Nobu in Malibu. Arrive early and be patient. It is well worth it. Try the daily specials."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I first went to Ginko recently. There are so many sushi restaurants around that to me; it had potential to be more of the same. Boy was I wrong. Ginko is incredible and I had some of the best sushi around. I am such a fan of the California Sunshine roll--anything with crab and avocado, please. And, I also loved the spicy tuna roll. Both were brimming with quality and freshness and flavor. I also had some softshell crab and essentially had to keep it away from my friends as they were devouring it so quickly. It was delicious. As always, love me some miso soup and seaweed salad and some hot saki. All very good as well. When we went, it was very crowded and the service was not up to speed--expected at such a crowded place and for delicious food.   The server was super on her game and the experience was fantastic. Ginko has a great vibe that is both big city but a bit offbeat as well. Dimly lit and very industrial is how I would describe it. If you want some truly delicious sushi, this is your place."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Ginko a few times now, and every time has been outstanding. First of all, we love the \"intimate\" atmosphere you get at Ginko...you just have to know to make a reservation ahead of time if you want a table. Second, the sushi rolls we've tried have never disappointed. Our favorites are the Ginko Roll, Zeppelin, and Spicy Scallop Chips (served on Pringles - so good!). Lastly, the service here is always excellent. We've celebrated a birthday here once, and we actually received a visit from Dante (the owner of this and other fine restaurants in northeast Ohio). I don't dole out 5 star reviews very easily, but I think this place deserves it!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the Unagi and Foie Gras.  I was not a sushi fan until I tried Ginko. Since I never liked sushi much, I was not familiar with how/what to order, but the waitress was very helpful.  The room is small, but it's neat watching the chefs prepare the food behind the bar."}
{"text":"Well this was a letdown. There's a lot of great Asian food in Cleveland. Sushi? Inexplicably, not so much. This place is widely hailed as the premier joint and I don't really understand why. It's priced like it features Morimoto's actual flesh, which would be completely fine...if it was good.  Unfortunately the rolls and nigiri are relatively flavorless and insipid.  The rice isn't well seasoned and doesn't stick together appropriately, rendering every bite a crumbly mess.  Crab stick in a $10 California roll advertised as snow crab? Don't insult me. Eggplant nigiri was profoundly weird. My girlfriend compared it to tenderized wetsuit. It had a squeaky canned olive texture and flavor that fairly matched. The spicy tuna roll was fine and the fatty tuna and scallion roll ($12!) was also a decent bite. Salmon nigiri was creamy, but fairly lacking in flavor. Also took a full hour for take-out. The best part of the meal was sadly the wonton soup that came from Minh Ahn in Gordon Square."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place you'd take a friend from out of town.   Cool, interesting, and tucked away in a great area of Tremont. When you walk in, it feels like you found something nobody else knows about (despite that obviously not being true).   I'm not a sushi connoisseur but my personal experience was great. Nice portions, cool atmosphere, and I'm pretty sure anime was on the TV screens. Cool date spot, as well."}
{"text":"Omekase was incredible! So fresh and great variety of fish I hadn't tried. The scallop chips are a little unconventional, but totally delicious!"}
{"text":"Having lived in Tokyo for 3 years I ate my fair share of Sushi and Sasha-mi. I must say the preparation is so authentic and the food fresh I haven't been to a place in Cleveland like it.. until now.  The decor is straight out of Japan and even it being located in a basement is so authentic. If I could buy a bottle of whiskey or Sake and keep it there with my name tag on it for my next visit I that would complete the scene. While the wait staff is good I find them a little off the mark by being a bit condescending. On 2 visits my dinner companion felt as if they were a visitor who never ate sushi.  They greeted me in Japanese and when I engaged in the language, of which I am fluent, they quickly were lost and I was corrected that  my pronunciation was wrong. Minor detail- the chef knew exactly what I wanted. On subsequent visits it got better but still when one is dropping 3-400 on dinner the waitresses should really be a bit more accommodating and attentive. Then again maybe she had a bad day. I cannot say enough for the presentation and preparation of the food and the selection of Sake. I am a big fan of Sake and they have a nice selection. This place will only get better and it is by far one of my favorite places to eat I Cleveland."}
{"text":"Chef tasting 6 course menu was excellent. Saki was also very good. Gave 4 stars since service was kinda slow. Brought wrong entree for one of my courses. 25 minutes to get dessert. But maybe they are going through some growing pains like when I went through my growth spurt in 7th grade. I was kinda slow and lurpy when I moved. So I forgive them this time. Plus I wasn't in a hurry."}
{"text":"Outstanding! The quality of the food was amazing. The presentation of the sushi was beautiful. Service was nice and ambiance was great. It is pricey but well worth it I would say. Deff going to come here again."}
{"text":"the was good and the service was slow, for a place that doesn't have to cook at all. we got are app after we finished our rolls. the spicy tuna was great. my only complaint is that its pricy and the service is kinda slow"}
{"text":"Once again wowed by ginko and the Dante experience.  Quentin and company accommodated our reservation of 9 with the best service.  It was like being a guest at a friend's house.  We were able to sample some of Coda's nightlife and cocktails next door before sitting down to a wonderful meal,  with great friends,  and a birthday dessert that made everyone smile.  Ginko is our favorite place for sushi,  and it's because of the food and friendliness."}
