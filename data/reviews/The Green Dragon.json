{"text":"Great pub in the Beach with extremely attentive owners (Bravo Pat for being such a great host!). Always busy with a great atmosphere. Super wings. Can't really think of a better pub in the east end. A+"}
{"text":"It's likely I came at the wrong time however having walked past there during a typical pub night, Friday and/or Saturday, waiters are very slow. In their defense it was one lady on staff at the time with about 30-40 people sitting around. 

I've tried pub food on Kingston road and it's all the same; pedestrian at best verging on bland. Go for the minor selection of beers, full bar, and free wifi. If its decent food you want with a draft go down the street to Gabbys."}
{"text":"This is a very fine pub.  My friend and I sat at the bar and we had great service.  The bartender was very pleasant and addressed our questions.  The wings were awesome.  We had both wet and dry jerk chicken wings and, although they were both good, the dry was better.  The decor is very nice.  This is a fine place!  Check it out."}
{"text":"Basic pub food. The nacho are just alright, they are known for their wings (we used to come here after work as a group), but in several occasions my colleagues have gotten sick! The staff is always friendly, but the place is just average. If you want to stop in, it should probably just be for beverages."}
{"text":"Good place. Weekends seem to have a band playing and everyone seemed to be having a great time. I haven't had the wings here but hear they are excellent. The burgers are very good."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bar on Kingston Road. There's definitely a regulars scene but hey I guess they know a good thing. The wings, oh my good the wings, a must have! Good food, good place, good vibes, fair prices."}
{"text":"Not much from the outside, looks a little like a run down pub.. Then you walk inside and it's lively, loud atmosphere, TVs around to watch sports, booths further back to sit and eat.. It's a small venue but it's cosy and friendly and the atmosphere is great! Food was great and staff are informal in the best way and then yet are so mannerly and professional at the same time.. If that makes sense.. It just felt like a homey spot. Thoroughly enjoyed it and will be coming back! 
Ps. The chicken is top notch."}
{"text":"I came in on Christmas Eve for some nachos and beer- my favourite Canadian beer, Steam Whistle!

Not only were the nachos good, so was the Poutine. I can't believe how popular it has become in Ontario these past few years in comparison to when I went to school!

Anyway... 

Great service at this non-Chinese bar and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"If you live in the Beach/upper Beach area, this is definitely your local and you know nearly everyone in there.  

This place has everything a good ole pub should have, clean tap lines, familiar faces, good food and bar tenders who are friendly and remember what you drink.  What more could you ask for?

The owner Patrick is a super nice guy who seems to genuinely care about everyone who walks in and ensuring they have a good time.  He even hosts an orphan Christmas dinner where he puts on a big feed and welcomes everyone in, especially those without family to share the holidays with.  

There are affordable daily specials and the bands on the weekend are actually good!  They are happy to have your kids in with you during the day and everyone from their 20's right through goes in, everyone is welcome. 

Make sure you get there early on weekends or you'll be in for standing room only!"}
{"text":"Very good wings. We come here every other Saturday (wing night 1/2 price). Big wings and sports on multiple TVs. 

Kids menu is very good. The burger and grilled cheese are better than any other kids menu you can find.  

Mix of regulars soccer fans and families on Saturdays. 

Staff is friendly, though it can get busy Agee 1:00.   

This is the best spot for wings in the beach by far and probably one of the best in Toronto."}
{"text":"Somewhat of my local watering hole...The owner Pat knows how to look after you and cares about good beer and getting his draft lines clean.

The service is good, everyone is really friendly, as far as food I have only had the wings...and they were good typical pub wings!"}
{"text":"Best Wings ever - fat and juicy. Reasonable prices, great beers on tap, good and friendly staff. In the entire time I've been coming here the food hasn't changed in quality. Everything on the menu is tasty. Well done."}
{"text":"Best jerk wings ever....period.  Go on a Saturday for half price wings and a dry-humoured bartendresse...order the \"wet jerk\" wings for a nice kick and unique flavour."}
{"text":"Easily the best burgers in Toronto.  Friendly little pub.  Does tend to get a bit busy when they have music but I highly recommend the food and drinks.  I have hosted cozy office party's here and have also ordered large amounts to take out to office.  Food always ready on time and they happily help load the car."}
{"text":"Game 7 of this years World Series brought me and my friends to this off the beaten path pub and local eatery. I was convinced that it was a Chinese restaurant at first due to the name, and was ready to dive head first into a plate of fried rice but upon primary inspection of the menu realized this would not be possible. I was not however, not disappointed in the options that were actually available. 

First thing, our server Jessica. The joint was not overflowing with patrons but was nonetheless quite busy. She was the only server, and on top of this was also in charge of busing all the tables. Without so much as a hiccup, Jessica served the entire floor without skipping a beat, and smiled the entire time. People were not left waiting wondering where their food was as might have been the case with a lesser server. 

Secondly, the food. The Green Dragon burger is a hidden gem. Half beef and half pork, and weighing in at what I'd estimate at 3/4 of a pound after cooking, this delicious burger is something that takes a small pub like this and turns it into a destination spot. I ordered mine smothered in mushrooms and bacon, along with cheddar cheese. It did not disappoint. Arriving no more than 10-15 minutes after ordering, the patty was cooked to perfection and the fries a nice crispy texture on the outside and soft on the inside. One bite sent me into a burger universe that I didn't soon return from. Beers were kept refreshed by the aforementioned Jessica, and the TV's were even switched to make sure that those wanting to watch baseball could do so, and others wanting to see the Raptors were able to without interruption. Other dishes ordered were the wings, and veggie sandwich, all which received praise as well. 

Go, and make sure to bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"A good place to hang out and we enjoyed watching the Olympics here. It's well lit inside and there are tons of TVs everywhere. They have a large bar area, as well as both tables and booths. The tables were actually more comfortable than the booths, as the table on the booth was kind of low to the ground and had a metal bar running through the center on the outside. This made it hard to find a comfortable leg position, but that's just a detail...

The trouble we found is that the food quality and service varied widely between the two visits we made. The first visit our experience was much more positive than during our second visit. I enjoyed the quesadillas that I had here quite a lot and they had good homemade apple pie from a nearby bakery. Legitimately, our server on our second visit was not super friendly, and our whole experience seemed to suffer."}
{"text":"Beauty March day, the Missus and I went for a stroll and stopped in at the Green Dragon for a pint.

No doubt this is a local's pub as everyone that stopped by knew most of the gang there.

Having worked in an Oshawa bar/restaurant for 12+ yrs, I understand that \"riff raff\" (as one reviewer described the regs) is generally a 1st impression. Most of the time, these people are the most normal, friendliest and down-to-earth bar crowd you can meet. We felt the love as a couple obvious regulars noticed I was peeking down the bar at a spring training Jays game that was on and he was quick to offer to get the game on a closer tv. He didn't work there but often these kind of regulars are the best ambassadors for your bar. 

Nice couple, chatted with us as we chilled by the front window. Got a chance to hear a brief history of the local pub scene and talk about the Dragon's menu. 

Speaking of Dragon's, not sure if it was sheer coincidence but the Dragon's Den tv show was playing on a few tvs around the bar. I'd like to think it was intentional and assumed if we had stayed longer, that tv would've shown nothing but dragon-related programming.

Menu was small but food reviews on various sites (and from the local dude) were glowing. A return in the near future."}
{"text":"I try to only post positive experiences online and this was definitely one. I'm not very fussy and I know a well managed place when I see one. This is a well-run joint and the wings held up to their reputation. 
We had Anastasia as our server and she's very attentive without being too in your face. My only issue would be that there needs to be a hoppier beer selection (total personal preference). Had a near perfect experience there. I want beer and wings from this place forever (get double trouble brewery on tap!)"}
{"text":"I really like this bar, really good food at good prices. Staff are really friendly and so are the regulars.

I really like the wings here, they're big and really good in comparison to other bars. I'm a fan of the nachos here too. The owners are really nice guys and the place is ran so well. Not sure where the Chinese category came from though! Lol"}
{"text":"Definitely get the wings! If you like spicy, go for the inferno. The staff is very friendly and they have amazing service."}
{"text":"The wings are the highlight of this place followed by their caesers and location. Only wish the draft beer was colder and the staff wasn't a hit or miss. 
Regardless, love this hole in the wall on Kingston rd and will continue to frequent it."}
