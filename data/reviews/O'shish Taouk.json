{"text":"Had 3 wonderful visits to this family run restaurant.  You are always greeted with a smile, and a warm welcome. The man behind the counter clearly takes pride in his work and he is incredibly kind.

The food is incredibly fresh and delicious. Not to mention the monthly deals he has are great. Best Shish Taouk on the south shore, his biggest issue is his location, it is a bit off the grid.

I highly recommend O'Shish Taouk to anyone looking for a great meal."}
{"text":"La nourriture est bonne, car les recettes sont faites faites maison par les propriétaires. Ces derniers sont très chaleureux, généreux et polis. J'ai été très bien accueilli, les portions sont généreuses. Je crois que c'est le meilleur shistaouk de la rive sud."}
{"text":"A nice little family-run Lebanese fast food place. Similar menu to places like Amir, Basha, Kebab, etc, but somehow fresher, cleaner, and friendlier than those chains. A good alternative to other fast food food choices in the area."}
