{"text":"This place is one of the best hidden gems in Toronto. I discovered it a couple of weeks ago and have been there 3 times since. I would have come everyday if it weren't for the saving money thing. The place is super cozy and the reception is warm and friendly. This cute little Polish diner makes you feel like you are at home in mom's kitchen while you sit and watch her make her fabulous perogies entirely from scratch. I always leave feeling like I've been welcomed and taken care of."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. Homemade authentic polish food in a casual old school setting. I always have the mixed lunch place so I get a bit of everything. Never disappoints. I'm almost worried it will become too trendy and I'll have to start waiting in line."}
{"text":"Best perogies in Leslieville! 

My husband goes to the Hastings Barber Shop for his haircuts and I always walk over with him just so I can go get some hand made perogies at the snack bar. My favourite ones are the mushroom and sauerkraut and the blueberry dessert perogies. So good!"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast lunch counter! Polish food. Amazing Perogies. Amazing. Great eggs and potato pancakes. Do yourself a favour and bring home one of their polish style donuts with the custard filling. Beats a Boston cream any day. Glad this place exists. It IS open after 10am. The owners are trying to change the hours in Yelp - apparently a vestige of the old business. Anyways - if you're in Leslieville, just go here. :)"}
{"text":"Most amazing and cheap place for great breakfast. Used to come here over 12 years ago when I was introduced to it as a TDSB student employee. The food has never left my mind. The western peameal omelette has been the same price and same great taste, even after 12 yrs of not tasting it! I was glad I was able to find this place again after forgetting it's location. Yeah, the place looks run down, but it's been around for 52 years with the humble and generous John leaving his doors open for the community. Hours are 6-10 am so get in before the doors shut. Rumour has it this may be his last year. Would be sad to see him go. $6 for a triple decker peameal and egg sandwich! Still blows my mind.  Hiiiiiighly recommended and I'm extremely critical of food joints."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Polish flavour with the new owners.  Interesting menu, and very homely Polish feel to it.  $6 BLT with cheese.  Panini style, not toasted.  They are accommodating with menu items.  I have to try the home-made strawberry perogies at some point."}
{"text":"This is one of those neighbourhood gems. That little place that flies under the radar from the outside - the place that most people don't now about. Unless they live nearby - and even then... I love these types of places. Small, friendly, family-run, filled with ingredients & recipes from their heritage, and completely unpretentious. Bonus: There are counter seats!

The service is friendly. The prices are more than reasonable. The food is yummy and comforting. Oh - and they give you a delicious Polish caramel/toffee candy with your bill :)

Heads-up: It's cash only! (Though there's an ATM on-site in case you forget.)

Food details: I ordered Tata's Lunch Plate - which includes a mix of pierogies, a Kielbasa sausage, a huge cabbage roll, coleslaw, and a pickle. A huge plate of food! I really enjoyed the pierogies and the Kielbasa sausage in particular. I'm not a big fan of Polish cabbage rolls - this was was tasty, but just not in my wheelhouse. Overall, a super filling and tasty lunch. Great value too. I think the lunch plate was $14-$15 only!"}
{"text":"Live near by and had a day off so I popped in to get some of the traditional pierogi to go.  growing up in a polish household, nothing to date comes remotely close to moms home made pierogi, well these not only came close they were exactly like moms, light, flavourful, perfect. Absolutely delicious.  Looking forward to trying some of their other Polish favourites."}
{"text":"I love this little Kitchi kitchen.  12 stools only. Formica counters.  Open kitchen. Big windows !!  Open wed-sun 8-3 for full eats. Open other days for coffee and snacks.  Had the Mama Tata full lunch plate.  Cabbage roll, 4 perogies, Kielbasa, coleslaw, pickle and under toasted rye. The best cabbage roll ever. Some spice in it I just can't get a handle on.  I did ask. But it's ancient Chinese secret.  My lunch companion had polish breakie. 2 eggs, polish sausage (tasted like a boiled hot dog) and potato pancakes. No drinks. They didn't have decaf so I skipped. But they do have a wonderful espresso, cappuccino maker. Only $2 for a latte.  Lunch was $22 taxes in plus $5 tip.

Only thing that I didn't like was a guy at stool near us talking politics ? To all of us. Boring. (And not their fault ).  

Will be back !! Pictures posted of two plates,  homemade goodness"}
{"text":"I kinda loved this place. The potato and cheese perogies are amazing. (that said, I've never had a bad perogy) The veggie cabbage rolls were huge and flavorful. My only complaint was the tomato sauce on top. Didn't really like the creamy tomato sauce, reminded me of my moms tomato soup. Yuck. But will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We ordered  the Polish Breakfast, Hungry Tata's lunch, sweet pierogies, and donuts.  So basically we tried almost everything they make.  AllI can say is WOW.  The best cabbage roll I have EVER eaten - by a long shot. The pierogies are so, so fresh.  And the people who own and run it are just lovely.  This place should be packed out - and probably will be soon enough.  I recommend getting over here before everybody else discovers this neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Only tried the ham and cheese sandwich. It was fine. Nothing special. It was panini pressed. But it was really just luncheon deli meat. They weren't serving their famous perogies or cabbage rolls on a Tuesday. 

Will have to return to try their other food!"}
{"text":"Very intimate and friendly.  David does the drinks.  Great tea!  Brilliant personality.  The lady who served me was from Poland as was the chef.  Both wonderful.
I had breakfast, two eggs polish sausage potato patties(homemade) and rye bread.  Fantastic.  I shall be going here very often!"}
{"text":"I went in while my boyfriend was getting his hair cut at the attached barber shop. The barista was super friendly and the vibe was really cool. The welcoming environment made me stay and sip my delicious $4 latte. Cash only with machine inside. Would definitely recommend the coffee."}
{"text":"Solid place. Polish food, well made. Surprisingly light. Light on the wallet too. Not exactly mind blowing, just a well made breakfast. More like a Polish Lady Marmalade, than a Maha's. Nothing funky or fusion here. But good coffee and great service. A 3.5 star place."}
{"text":"I must admit, I was a little disappointed, when, after reading Kat F's review, the owner asked me what I wanted.   Eggs and bacon, of course!   This place is a total throwback - the lunch counter conversation was all about how computers are taking over the world and how kids don't even know about typewriters.   I guess working on a laptop while waiting might have flagged me.  All in all, though, pretty welcoming and friendly.

Builders were popping in regularly for takeout fried egg sandwiches, so that's always an option if you're in a rush.

To the food - not the cheapest breakfast, but a good one.   Eggs cooked perfectly, a big helping of peameal, potatoes, and toast.   Coffee good, too.   I hope you like milk in your coffee, because you'll get it without asking.   

I wouldn't bring little-little kids here - all the seating is fixed stools with no back and no way to attach a high chair/booster without a visit to family services/ER in your future."}
{"text":"Yummy filling Polish style breakfasts. You can get eggs and sausage or bacon. Perogies and cabbage rolls or sandwiches. Fun and cozy atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"Everything about this place reminds me of my childhood. With every bite of the delicious food, memories of family and my great grandmothers cooking come flooding back. 

If you're looking for authentic polish food in the city, this is it!"}
{"text":"You cannot get more neighbourhood, more authentic or more delicious.  It's very hard to argue with the concept of Polish comfort food.   The perfect collection of all the right ingredients in all the right proportions.   And here's it's executed perfectly.  

A row of a dozen bar seats encircling a kitchen where every item you can see being prepared by hand.  Directly connected to the barbershop, so you can conceivably get your hair done and get your perogie fix during the exact same visit.   

Yum yum yum yum yum.

The lovely people who run the pace are the lovely people cooking your food.  

The kind of place that hipsters would love to try to create for themselves but are incapable of because they are missing the magic spirit orbs of authenticity.  This is the real deal."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and cozy space. The we had was amazing!!

Polish Breakfast (only $8) and it comes with two eggs, parowka (polish weenie), two potato pancakes, polish bread. It was really good and filling, especially the potato pancakes.

Hungry Tata's Lunch Plate comes with one cabbage roll, one kielbasa, four perogies, sauerkraut, pickle and polish bread. It screams comfort food and it's super delicious. You can taste the home made goodness!

We will be back for sure!! Welcome to the hood!!"}

{"text":"Come here for greasy, no frills, no banter diner breakfast. If you weren't reading this review you might never notice this place - it's on a side street in Leslieville and is barely perceivable on a neighbourhood stroll.

NOTES:
* As soon as you walk in and sit down, the owner starts making your breakfast. There is a menu, but no point in looking at it. Unless you state otherwise, you're getting two eggs (over easy), bacon, home fries and toast. So if you want to deviate from this, best get your words in within the 120 second timeframe between entering and sitting down on a barstool.

* This is a relic from the past - the decor hasn't been updated since it opened in 1946, and the owner/cook has maybe been working here just as long. There are about ten seats in the entire place and they're all at the counter, so this place is not good for groups. 

* Note the hours - 7am to 1pm (sometimes earlier) weekdays only.

* I don't need to tell you that it's cash only, but you won't need much of it. Our breakfasts were $6 each. The cash register looked like it was from the 19th century, and it probably actually was."}
{"text":"I had a Flat White while waiting to get a haircut next door (the barber shop belongs to the same owner). Excellent coffee!"}
{"text":"Be transported to a old school polish kitchen in Leslieville (ya, convenient!)
Get the big lunch, has your choice of 4 periogies, keibasa, a cabbage roll, slaw, you'll be stuffed trust me. 
Owners are delightful and seriously just want to stuff your face."}
