{"text":"Wow!!!

 Found our new take-out place!!  

We ordered three different things and they were all delicious.  Tangerine beef is sweet and  mildly spicy, but they will up the heat if you ask.  The house sauce on the Happy family is delicious with the right amount of seasonings.  Plenty of the different meats in the happy family.  Sesame chicken and the tangerine beef were both deep fried, and even with the sauces still had a nice crispy coating to them.  Their fried rice is very simple, no overpowering spices that clash with your meal.  

The food was carefully packed, and still really hot when I got it home.  

We ordered dinner, but they also have lunch specials for under $6 that come with fried rice, soup, entree and soda."}
{"text":"came back to this site after 3 years to post this.

here is their menu, separated into Dinner and Lunch Special sections:   https://www.beyondmenu.com/39603/allison-park/golden-star-allison-park-15101.aspx#main-menu

I'm not the most adventurous chinese food person.  I usually play it safe like a wuss and stick to general tso's chicken, and exploring the rest of the menu involves me spending 15 minutes on google and wikipedia trying to figure out what everything means.

The only other chinese place we frequented around here was Lin's Garden, so I'll have to compare it to that.

While Lin's is a nice big sitdown place with a bunch of neat kitchy knick knacks everywhere, this is more your standard little hole-in-the-wall place with the backlit menu pictures above the counter.  Lin's categorizes itself as a \"chinese\" place and this is a \"szechuan\" place.  not sure what that means, maybe it means something to you.

We ordered carry out, and got General Tso's Chicken, Bangkok Shrimp, Pad Thai, and Crab Rangoons.

Lin's is really americanized.  Real sugary and syrupy.  Golden Star in comparison is more rich and savory.  Everything we ordered tasted distinctly different, yet awesome.  The Bangkok Shrimp were cooked perfectly, perfect firmness, and full of shrimp flavor.  The sauces on everything were incredible.  I ordered a ton of food, and even when I was agonizingly full, it tasted so good that I compulsively kept shoveling like someone who just came from a bob marley concert.  and the crab rangoons, oh myg od.  I've had these at a lot of chinese places, but the way they balanced the filling in these was so good.  Lin's is nice if you need a place to sit down, but I really can't imagine getting their food again after eating this.  everything here is around a dollar more than at lin's, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Was really good Americanized Chinese food.  I had Singapore mai fun.  Fast and fresh, even late at night. The steamed dumplings were very good.  Would eat here again..."}
{"text":"The owners are super nice. Tonight I went in and their two adorable daughters were doing their homework at a table while sharing a bowl of Beef and Vegetables. They were very polite and I can't help but always root for a family owned business. 

That being said, the family charm is really just a bonus because this place is delicious. I really like their cheese wontons and the fried pork dumplings. Flavors are all on point. 

The only thing I didn't love was the sesame chicken. Chicken was great quality and fried perfectly, the sauce was just lacking. Next time I will get general tso's and I'm sure the heat will  be excellent with the chicken."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese place great owners food is delicious. I have been here more then a couple dozen times I can't go wrong with this place. If you want fresh delicious Chinese food you should definitely come here, there's a few tables on the inside I eat in and take out. See you next time"}
{"text":"Very good! Very fresh ingredients! Family authentic Chinese food! Take out only and best option. Few tables but would not recommend eating their. I had the beef w/garlic sauce (spicy)! Very fresh vegetables and great flavor! Finding all the Chinese restaurants I have tried in Hampton PA all good! Give this one a take out try!"}
{"text":"Chicken wings and the corn soup were great. The Guyanese style fried chicken on rice is unique and delicious. General Tso chicken is a staple and we weren't disappointed. Would definitely come again"}
{"text":"We were looking for a Chinese place to eat at night, and this place popped up in the map. We were taken into our seats promptly,and we ordered szechuan chicken with rice, vegetable soup, stir fried bokchoy, and fried chicken balls. Interestingly, we only got the szechuan chicken and rice. After we ate almost half of the dish, we inquired about the other missing dishes. It seems that order was not made. Well, after another 5 minutes or so we got our dishes. By the time it arrived, we were already full. The bokchoy was overcooked, and the chicken balls were subpar in taste. Not to mention, the vegetable soup had NO flavor. We felt that we were drinking hot water with a zing of salt.On the contrary, the szechuan chicken and rice was better in taste compared to all mentioned dishes above. Overall, service staff was unapologetic, rude, and ignorant; and the food was below our expectation. Is it worth it for a second try? Heck no. We will gladly spend our hard earned money on food that actually taste like food somewhere else. Golden Star management, get your menus and staffing people in order.  Otherwise, if this restaurant keeps serving people at this this rate, we have a good feeling that it's going to close down soon."}
{"text":"The food was very delicious and for an amazing price! We found out that one of the owners, Lucky, from the original famous Golden Star at Jane and Wilson has opened a new restaurant here! He was very nice and very accommodating as always. Eat the fried chicken wings for sure!! We kept reordering them. The beers are also very reasonably priced compared to other restaurants. Definitely a new family favourite."}
{"text":"This place is great for students on a late night, since it closes at 2:00 am. It has a TV and usually are showing sports or CP24, you can ask to change. We've watched the Raptors v. Rockets game here, it was fun plus free WiFi.

I wouldn't recommend the soup here, however their daily specials are amazing for the price $7. You'll find large portions and you'll be full by the time you finish, I know I did. My favourite was the Bombay dry chicken which I got with the chicken fried rice daily special and a drink, and I ended up paying $10. 

Don't expect much from this place, its not a fine dining place more of a late night (everything is closed) venture. I'd give this three stars only because of the food you get for the price, I'm not a hakka fan so Its difficult to rate the food."}
{"text":"Great owners! Very good business and customer service! The food is very good and we get delivery all the time! I highly recommend this great, clean and delicious food! My one and only complaint is that the chicken lo mein is very bland with little flavor. All other food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  We routinely get the wonton soup which is the best anywhere....simple with homemade wontons and flavorful broth.  Dumplings are homemade and best in the North.  Crab Rangoon is good as well.  Haven't had many entrees as my daughter is in love with wontons.  The family is great and the daughters are very polite and well behaved."}
