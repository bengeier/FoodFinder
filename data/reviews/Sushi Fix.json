{"text":"Came here again to try out the lunch specials.  The lunch specials are pretty awesome.  For around $10 you can get a whole plate of sashimi, and this time the fish tasted pretty fresh! 
They can get quite busy here, so the service was okay this time, but it was understandable.  I can see that they were understaffed at the time.  
If I'm ever craving sushi, I would come here for their lunch specials for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is really amazing. Both times I've been in the service as well as the sushi have been stellar. Their roll menu is extensive and unique while the sashimi and nigiri are melt-in-your-mouth delicious."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant three times in the last 2 months. The food is amazing-I always start with Monkey Brains :) and then order rolls like I have a bottomless stomach. My favorite is the Lion King roll. Of course, you can find good sushi many places but what makes this place special is the wait staff. I cannot recall the guy's name that waited on us the 2nd time-he can remember large orders without writing anything down. He has a serious face but is actually very funny. My table was giving me a hard time because I need a fork (chopstick challenged) and he was participating in the razzing (apparently stabbing the sushi with the chopstick is cheating). Hillary is the waitress that took care of us the other 2 visits and she is AMAZING! She doesn't miss a beat-great service-very attentive. On top of that, she has a bright, bubbly personality. She seems to truly enjoy the interaction with the customers. The last time I visited, it was my birthday and she drew a birthday \"card\" on one of the napkins. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We've been to this place a few times. The first time we brought along the 3yo sproglet. They were great with him. We ordered him the Chicken Karaage - an appetizer, but it was plenty big for him and he loved the sauces.

The Monkey Brain is not to be missed (we've ordered it both times and it's wonderful).

I'm a spicy tuna roll nut and I've ordered it with and without the tempura flake - I will pass on the flake in the future as it doesn't really add much to the roll.

We've also tried the Cardinals Roll, the Chimichanga and the Viva Las Vegas. All of them have been great. 

One of the reasons I like this place is their menu - so many sushi bars only have a selection paper to pick your rolls and don't actually tell you whats in them. Not only do they give you the list of ingredients in their menu, but they have a photo too. 

4.5 Stars

The only reason I'm dropping a .5 star is because their website is horrible, and can't be accessed by a mobile phone."}
{"text":"Used to go here a lot a few years back and just went back for the first time last night! Great service, friendly staff, and the food was fresh and delicious! Great little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi bars in town.  Ken, the owner is so friendly and his food is so good that we keep going back even though it is a 10+ mile drive.  The prices here are fabulous for a sushi restaurant, best prices in town.  Nice assortment of specials every night, and interesting items show up on the board all the time, he has a friend in the shipping business.  We've had some items here I've never had at a sushi restaurant, straight from Japan, very special indeed, rare shellfish and other delicacies.  Not a fancy place but nice inside, great prices, good sake selection, good service and wonderful food."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the west valley.  The smoked salmon and baked lobster rolls are insanely good."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times with friends of mine that love sushi, I do not, but I get a rice bowl and I can say that the food is good and my friends love their sushi but we went here today, Friday July 28th at around 1:30pm during our one hour lunch break from work, when we walked in there were only 2 tables with people at them and 1 guy sitting at the bar and there were 2 girls there working the floor. We were greeted, sat, given menus and placed our drink orders immediately. She brought our drinks out right away and then walked away, never asking if we had any questions or if we were ready to order.  My friends ordered water and I got iced tea...which I wish I would have ordered water because my tea tasted gross, like it was a week old, I took 2 drinks of it and had my friend taste it only to concur with me that it tasted bad, so I put it off to the side and figured I would just ask for water instead when our waitress returned, no big deal.  HOWEVER, 20 mins of waiting after our drinks were initially dropped off  and we had made our decision and our menus were shut and my iced tea was pushed off to the side and placed at the front edge of the table, we only watched the waitress walk past us numerous times and did not even bother to stop and apologize for the wait, she did not even acknowledge our existence, we got up and walked out so that we would not be late returning to work!  It doesn't end here, as were were walking out and already into the parking lot the waitress runs out and asks, \"Did you pay?\"  I couldn't believe it!! Did we pay?!?!  We told her, \"No! You didn't even take our order!\" and she just stood there staring at us so we say again \"You never even came back and took our order!\" and she then says \"Oh. well I'm sorry\"  WITH AN ATTITUDE.  First of all, do not give an attitude to a customer that walked out because you can't do your job correctly! It was a ridiculous situation and should have never happened in the first place, especially when you have hardly anyone in there and we were left unattended to and ignored.  I have been a server before and handled WAY more people and NEVER dropped the ball or ignored my customers. Unacceptable.  I will say that the other times we have been there they have a waitress with blonde hair ( I do not know her name) who has always been VERY good, attentive and made sure we were taken care of 100%!  She even went next door to fry's and bought a certain type of alcohol that they did not have in stock to make me a mixed drink that I requested even after I told her not to worry about it and I would order something else, now that is going above and beyond and providing exceptional customer service! She is great! I don't know if we will go back, but if we do we will make a point to call and ask if the blonde waitress is working that day before we even go!"}
{"text":"great happy hour menu there portions are perfect and taste great. love the casual atmosphere. And there guest service was amazing they made us laugh they were prompt. WE WILL definitely go again next time were back in town."}
{"text":"Traveling from out of town, great food great staff! Sushi was outstanding highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It's fresh alright. 

Great food, great service. Iris served us well. What more can I say?"}
{"text":"Fabulous fresh and consistent sushi. We have never had a less than wonderful meal here.We're addicted to their Tuna Salad and Climax Roll We are thrilled they're in our neighborhood, one filled with chain-restaurant-overload, and an oasis of fresh seafood (we come from a coastal town.)"}
{"text":"Love this place, always friendly and fresh.  We normally judge sushi base on how fresh the fish is, this was perfect.  Just wish the tables weren't so close together."}
{"text":"I love this place. The sushi is very good and tastes fresh. They use just enough eel sauce and tempura on their rolls and have probably the best Vegas roll in town.

The service is great and you typically don't have to wait for a table or to sit at the bar, even when they're busy. My only question is how do more people not know about this place!?

Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I've tried practically everything on this menu, and it's a solid restaurant. Nothing fancy, not too expensive, just good food.  However, the service is slow and the tap water is TERRIBLE. 

I particularly recommend:
the agadashi tofu
the tempura shrimp
the hamachi sashimi"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for sushi in Phoenix. High quality sashimi with great sushi chefs and servers. Bora is the best server their."}
{"text":"Some of the freshest Sushi I have had. Masa, the owner gets deliveries daily and you can taste it. I am more of a sashimi lover, but my wife is a fan of the rolls and his combinations are great. 

Not a place you would expect when going into a strip mall, but we are finding more and more restaurants that have great food in these strip mall locations. He is currently renovating and adding in teppanyaki which will add to the experience. Cannot beat the cost and love the fact its in the neighborhood. No more trips to Scottsdale for great sushi."}
{"text":"Can't beat their lunch and happy hour specials! Great sushi and great prices! Definitely one of my local favorites!"}
{"text":"This place has good sushi but not amazing. Granted I had to order all the rolls that were not raw because I'm prego, and I can't eat raw fish. So judging this place by happy hour cooked rolls. They were ok. The rice was not super sticky. It was softer. I think that's why I wasn't crazy about the rolls. But they prices are great and the happy hour last the entire night. I think I would go back and give it a try after the baby."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years. I can't go anywhere else for sushi. The service is incredible. I can't say enough about the sushi and it's fresh quality. The price is awesome and happy hour is even better! 

My favorites are the gyoza, nigiri, tootsie roll, first love roll and rainbow roll. Ask for their \"fresh wasabi.\""}
{"text":"My Hubby and I love this place! We have been going here together now 5yrs. It is always clean and the food is always fresh! Their lunch specials are pretty awesome too!"}
{"text":"Bought a Google Offer this past weekend, $20 for $40 worth of food.  Stopped to pick up lunch for me and a friend and wow, $40 went far!  And it was GOOD!!!  
We had sushi, rolls, tempura veggies, and the monkey brains.  Way too much food for two of us and it was all out of this world.  

I'm a huge sushi fan and the fish was sliced perfectly and so so fresh- like butter!  The rolls were great too, not too much rice and a perfect bite size.  

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Instead of going to Yen, for there happy hour that includes a California roll 5 ways, and the worst service in phoenix, head over to Fresh Wasabi... This place is hands down the best Sushi bar in the phoenix area. Amazing prices, amazing FRESH sushi, and even better service! The happy our and reverse happy our menus are pretty extensive compared to others in the area, (Ahem, Yen). Usually a menu with over 50 rolls to choose from is not a good sign, but from the variety I tried, not a single roll was bad! So seriously, if you like great sushi, for the best price, and appreciate fast service, go check this place out."}
{"text":"Decent. Nothing extraordinary. Prolly will go back some other time. Decent price, average taste. Recommendable."}
{"text":"Omg was this bomb.com definetly my number 1 spot from now on, Amber is so sweet and very helpful.."}
{"text":"Haven't tried very many sushi places in the valley, but this is definitely the best I've had. Great prices, delicious food and good atmosphere and employees. Will undoubtedly return and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Lots of Love goes into the making of this restaurant   The best Yellowtail we've had in years ! I ordered off my usual path and had some baked rolls , Fantastic! And twice as much roll as most other major restaurants ! Too bad for that , couldn't try the entrees  guess I'll be back"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I do not normally go to sushi restaurants (big surprise huh!) but my wife loves sushi and she always wants to go.  We decided to go over to Fresh Wasabi because it was next to the office and she wanted sushi.  We were greeted promptly by the chef and waitress and choose to sit at the sushi bar.  Not seeing anything on the menu that was vegetarian I asked the waitress for some options.   To my surprise she started giving me a ton of options that where not on the menu.  I ordered two rolls; (one vegetable tempura based and one tofu based.   They were absolutely fantastic and now I am more than willing to go with my wife to get sushi, as long as it is at Fresh Wasabi."}
{"text":"I love Fresh Wasabi! This place is my go-to for sushi. You wouldn't expect much looking at it from the outside! The happy hour deals are superb and the sushi has always been delicious. I have been here plenty of times with friends and family and I am never disappointed. Service is friendly and attentive. Definitely try it. I recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"We used to enjoy this restaurant when it was called The Sushi. Now it has new management, and the rolls are incredibly small, thin and the prices are the same as many of the other sushi restaurants. Food was good, but no longer a decent value. Service was not great, no kids meal, it just seemed like they bring out a kids size portion of terriaki chicken for the same price. Our kids got their food first, and so early that when we got our sushi .. the kids were already finished eating :-("}
{"text":"I cannot sing enough praise about Fresh Wasabi! I tried my first ever sushi roll there and immediately became hooked. From the outside it looks like a little restaurant in a strip mall but once you walk in, experience their amazing customer service and FRESH food, you realize how special the place really is. The hostesses are always smiling and ready to help and the chefs take their job very seriously and make sure to only use the freshest ingredients and roll the sushi to the best of their ability. Basically, if you're not happy, they're not happy!

I recommend going during their happy hour- they just revamped their menu and it's AMAZING. My boyfriend and I can both eat sushi until the cows come home and we always get plates and plates and walk out with a bill under (highest) $60. I love how many options they have and how if you come in a bit before (or after) happy hour they'll still give you the discount. They want happy customers, they're not just interested in the money, which is refreshing. Also, make sure you get the Las Vegas Roll. It's amazing and if you don't try it, you'll regret it!"}
{"text":"I have two favorite sushi restaurants, one in NYC and one in LA.  Both too far to drive, and both make most sushi restaurants here in Phoenix look bad.  I thought that it was the sort of thing I have to accept, living in a landlocked state and all.

Then I found Fresh Wasabi.

From a food standpoint, Fresh Wasabi (the Glendale location) is the best sushi I have found in Phoenix.  The fish is fresh, the menu is varied and interesting and the price is good.  I had the lunch special with three very common rolls (spicy tuna, salmon, and shrimp tempura), and added on a One More Night roll (because I am a pushover for mango) all four rolls were delish.  The shrimp tempura was crunchy and sweet, and the spicy tuna wasn't too much mayo like so many places do.

Now, the service is ... odd.  Not good, not bad, but peculiar.  We got food in a strange order, the rolls came out very slowly.  I am used to restaurants where they bring you rolls in succession, they are aware you have finished one, so they bring you the next and it is akin to a several course meal.  Not here, a bunch came out all together.  The one person at the table that ordered a bento box got theirs last, and then about a half hour later, the last roll came out.  But we were socializing and there for a long lunch anyway, so no one minded.  I'm not sure I would have appreciated it if we were in a hurry.

Overall, I'll take a bit of awkward service for worthwhile sushi, and Fresh Wasabi has worthwhile sushi."}
{"text":"I ordered the shoyu ramen.  The photo on the menu showed two slices of pork in the bowl, but mine didn't have any.  Could have been an honest mistake, although since I was the only customer it shouldn't have been that difficult.  The ramen tasted fine, nonetheless.  

The ambience was spoiled by loud, annoying pop music."}
{"text":"Great service, pretty good sushi. Been here a few times, other times the sushi was better, but will continue to come. Great guys."}
{"text":"My sister and I just finished eating and had an exceptional experience. Kay was our server and she is absolutely genuine and so personable. The sushi was delicious and the service was wonderful! We HIGHLY recommend trying Sushi Fix!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome service! Hilary is great at what she does. Makes everyone feel welcomed. Appreciative of the business. Great environment."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place for many years, and since it was Mr Sushi quite a while ago. 

It is a cute little family owned restaurant and the food is pretty good, although the sushi rolls are very small. The green tea from here is very good and the sushi comes out quickly.

I like this place, but none of the food ever really stands out or really impresses me. It is never bad though either, which is why I gave it 3 stars."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Staff is friendly and the food is really good. They have good happy hour deals and you never have to wait too long. Sometimes the seaweed is a little chewy sometimes but nothing too bad. Good job fresh wasabi!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants in AZ. The pricing was very good. They provided excellent service. They also let me customize my order to my liking. I would recommend this place over any other sushi restaurant in the valley. I recommend the crazy horse and guilty pleasure rolls. The cucumber salad tasted delicious too."}
{"text":"Seriously love this place. I'm from Seattle and was iffy about Phoenix sushi but this place knocked my socks off. 

The service is so great, everyone is so kind and knowledgable. My favorite rolls are the Arizona, Love at First Sight, and the Dragon Roll. Oh and the Climax! Soooo good!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi joint, always a good time! Great happy hour prices and fantastic quality food!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE going for this Sushi. Fresh Wasabi HAS to be the Best Sushi in Phoenix, hands down.  Every time I visit, I always start with the Lobster Bake Roll. Oh My, So GOOD. The staff is always friendly & ready to answer any questions you may have. The atmosphere is very pleasant. I never have to yell to talk to my co sushi lovers like some other sushi joints around town."}
{"text":"Awesome! The tempura was perfect and the serving size generous. Sushi was excellent. The Korean short ribs were sad, though, the only blemish on an otherwise excellent meal."}
{"text":"The newly remodeled Fresh Wasabi (now Sushi Fix - signage still in the works) is just as delicious as it ever was but with a fresh new clean space! 

The sushi was tasty and rolled perfectly- my sister and I had the spicy tuna roll, tootsie roll, crunch roll and the first love roll. All were delicious but my favorite is the first love roll, it's a must try!

The customer service was spot on as always - Talia and Haley were both very friendly and professional. 

I will continue to frequent this restaurant and it remains my favorite sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Came to join my mother on her lunch break at this little spot. 

It's a decently small restaurant but not too small. The sushi bar is full of interesting fish and colorful veggies. The lunch specials here are great and you have a few different options to choose from. We split a tootsie roll, spicy tuna, and a crazy roll. All were very good but I'm a huge fan of spicy tuna and I wasn't let down! The fish in all of our rolls was very fresh and delicious. The salmon nigiri was fantastic and I always add a sheso mint leaf and squeeze a lemon wedge over the top and wowzers it's amazing give it a try! The albacore shasimi was also great! 

The prices here are very reasonable although I wish the rolls would have been a little bit larger. I was also pleased to see that they served Saki and not only do they have saki but they have my favorite unfiltered saki!!!

The young lady that was working here was very friendly and the sushi chef was also nice! The service was fast and my overall experience was great! I'll defiantly becoming back. I forgot to ask while I was there but I'm interested if they actually have fresh wasabi or if its just their name."}
{"text":"I love sushi, and this place has the BEST sushi I've found in Phoenix.  It's a little off-putting with its strip mall location, but I've been coming here for years and the sushi is always awesome quality.  They have a ton of special rolls that are fun to choose from.

My favorite rolls are the Cherry Blossom (salmon and avocado covered with tuna) and the First Love roll (spicy california roll covered with salmon, tuna, and LEMON!).

I think they have teppenyaki open there now, but I haven't been there to experience that yet."}
{"text":"We go to Fresh Wasabi a lot and usually it's the same thing...the service is not the fastest on the planet, but when you are there with good company you hardly notice. Their sushi is amazing and they have a perfectly priced menu. Love it!"}
{"text":"Authentic, fresh sushi and rolls.  My favorites are the spicy scallops, climax roll, and tuna lovers. Heads up, tuna lovers has a very Asian flavor to it; which I like but I can see others potentially finding it overwhelming. Staff is helpful, friendly and efficient. The baked rolls are all delectable! The chefs purposely make each piece on the roll the perfect size to eat in one bite so all flavors can be properly enjoyed."}
{"text":"We live down the street from this establishment that was formally Fresh Wasabi. The new decor and ambiance were great. The service was also great. The sushi itself I feel is okay. It is not bad, but I have had fresher and more creative rolls. Because of the service and location we will continue to go to this establishment."}
{"text":"Sushi was average.  Service was decent. Appetizer was frozen. Location was lovely and the place looked nice and clean. It was a bit on the slow side for lunch, and staff seemed nice. My friend and I did feel rushed to order as the server stood and hovered after giving the menus. We started with an appetizer and went with splitting 3 or 4 roles. As I said, appetizer was frozen in the middle and happened to be burnt on the outside. A total turn-off. Sushi came and it wasn't awful. Probably won't be stopping by anytime soon."}
{"text":"Nice, clean place. Sushi was delightful. Waitress was super nice. Enjoyed  this place a lot!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely as good as it gets in the west valley, but it is pretty close to as good as it gets all around. I really enjoyed this place ...and no more trips to Scottsdale. Yippeeee! This is my new favorite sushi place around. I have ate sushi fresh in Japan and Guam and this is as close as it gets to that. Other sushi places in Arizona don't really compare. :)"}
{"text":"Went with a coupon.  Service was sorta slow, as i read in other reviews, but it was ok."}
{"text":"Always amazing fresh sushi with great service. Our family has been going here for 2years now and we don't go anywhere else. You can't beat their prices. Only bad thing is it can be pretty cold in here. So bring a jacket."}
{"text":"Good service down to earth and real family business. They got momma working the Sushi bar... We wanted something chill, good food, light noise and pow it's here."}
{"text":"This place is great. The sushi is very fresh and the waitstaff is very pleasant. You get a lot of food at a reasonable price. We got two times as much food here for $10 less than our former go-to sushi joint. Also, this place has three different kinds of saki flights long with saki bombers which are very nice."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with food and very friendly service but professional. Pleasing to find nice servers with some personality and smiling face. I will return with my spouse they love good food and when you add great service well need I say more."}
{"text":"The sushi was good. Excellent happy hour but service was a little slow even though it was empty."}
{"text":"This was the best sushi/sashimi  I have had in the U.S. hands down.  I have had fresher in Japan, but the taste here was incredible.  I live in Tucson, but came up to Phoenix to take my Mom out for a late lunch and asked her where she wanted to go.  It is her favorite sashimi place also.  Even the teriyaki chicken my daughter had was tasty.  Grilled the chicken first, then put the teriyaki sauce over it."}
{"text":"Fresh Wasabi is now Sushi Fix.  Same owners, same building, same menu, different name.  

I'm not sure why the name changed but I finally came back here looking for my sushi fix.  Ah..clever.  The place was packed on Friday night with a 20 minute wait.  Seemed like a good sign that people were coming here in solid numbers.

Our waitress was super friendly and took our apps and drink orders right away.  We had spring rolls, shishito peppers, gyoza, and a amf and sangria.  The spring rolls were a bit overcooked and came out a little dark.  Decent but would not reorder.  The shishito peppers were really good.  They had bonito flakes and a good sauce.  The gyoza was alright.  Kind of on the small side.  Both drinks were so-so.  Wouldn't probably order either of them again.

For our main course we ordered a rainbow roll, tuna sashimi, and a tuna wrap.  The rainbow roll was fresh, perfect size, and excellent.  The tuna sashimi was also fresh, cut well, and very good.  The tuna wrap was a big disappointment.  The seaweed salad tasted old and bad.  Also the sauce tasted off and we had a hard time even eating the fish and leaving the bad salad behind.

The price was 75+ with a tip.  Not a lot for all the food we ordered plus drinks but with happy hour being 2 to close I would be shocked to see what we would have paid before 2.

In short: some was good, some was bad, service was excellent, price was okay."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Wonderful happy hour prices. They recently renovated the inside and it's BEAUTIFUL!"}
{"text":"Great sushi for a great price! They have a wonderful selection of specialty rolls and will make you a roll if it's not on the menu."}
{"text":"One side note...This is dated December of 2010. I have no idea when I originally went and wrote this, but it's been over a year! I don't even know why I didn't post it the night I wrote it!!

I finally made it to Fresh Wasabi, at 67th Ave and Bell. My jones for sushi is (briefly) sated. It'll be back before tomorrow night, but it's gone for now. I've been hearing about this place since it was called The Sushi. And I can see why, now. The menu of special rolls was tantalizing, and I may have to make regular treks there to work my way through. I kept it simple, ordering nigiri of hamachi, halibut and unagi. The slices topping the nigiri were 30% larger than any I'd gotten anywhere else. The hamachi, as I've always found, was delectible, as was the unagi. I had never had halibut nigiri or sashimi, and it was...transparent. Virtually no flavor that I could notice. But that's OK. Works for me. I'll try it again.
We got crispy california rolls and Lobster rolls, both wonderful. Cali rolls seemed a bit chunkier than I have gotten used to...seemed like they use slightly larger portions. I may be misremembering, cuz it's been too long, but, who knows.
Anyway, seems like the dozens of good reviews and the handful of raves from people I've talked to about Fresh Wasabi are spot on. 
As a final note, they were kind of busy for a Saturday mid afternoon, and the wait was kind of long.  The lone waitress was attentive and didn't seem harried, and when we were done, the lone chef apologized for the wait. Splendid, on their parts. I was pretty generous with my tip, so they'd know. If I win the lottery, I'll eat there every meal all summer!"}
{"text":"The BF took me here for dinner to challenge my notions of good sushi and expand my sashimi horizons.  I'm 150% glad he did!

Excellent across the board; food, service, ambiance and cleanliness.  OK, the ambiance is about as good as it's gonna get in a strip mall next to a Fry's Marketplace, but hey -- this is Phoenix. This is where we've chosen to live.  They have 2 dining rooms, a full sushi bar and I believe some grill tables in the other room.

The service was friendly, fast and accommodating.  They sat us immediately on a crowded Friday night at peak dinner hour. Drink orders were taken \"tout de suite\" and served a nanosecond later.  Delicious cucumber salad for starters came out in a blink of an eye: fresh, cooling and delicious. And then began the parade of rolls; Philly, Chimichanga, Bagel, Viva La Vegas and an order of Monkey Brains (stuffed mushrooms that were off the hook...umm...err....cranium, as it were).  We scarfed.  It was all fan-fishing-tastic!

All of the food was freshly made, tasty and super satisfying.

The servers stopped back by to check in and make sure everything was OK, refilled our drinks but didn't linger or interrupt our conversation or try to be our new BFFs.

I dunno what it is about good sushi but when you have it, you know it and it leaves you with a near sexual afterglow.  I had a full-body fish-gasm that lasted for hours.  Yes.  It's THAT good.  

We ate like kings for about $60 (we did order a LOT of food that night) but it was worth every penny and I would go back here again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Nuts, I wish I would have looked on Yelp before I went to learn about the beer & sake deal :)
I stopped into this plaza to go to the Fry's when I noticed Fresh Wasabi-same sign as the place I recently visited out in Surprise which I liked, so I headed in for lunch (best to grocery shop on full stomach you know!).
I found the service to be a tad slow especially considering I was one of just a handful of patrons.  Slow but friendly, just like me!!
Anyhoo, I simply cannot get past the pork katsu/California Roll bento.  Every aspect is really good, the miso soup, salad, edamame just seem to be a perfect combo plate to me especially since I'm not a huge fan of raw.  Price/value ratio is good, though I think the Surprise location offers a wee bit more generous portions.
This visit actually inspired me to try and recreate the bento at home with some pretty decent success-my miso soup was even better than Fresh Wasabi's lol!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little place I would have never seen if my friends didn't introduce me. There is a handful of rolls that are available from the happy hour menu, a variety of drinks, and the lunch combos are great as well. I ordered a tonkotsu Ramen and it was pretty good but there was something off about the broth, all the ingredients were great, but maybe too much ginger and carrots. The pork in the Ramen was great but I think a soft-boiled egg would compliment the Ramen better."}
{"text":"2 years ago my girlfriend and I went here for dinner because she raved about how good this place is; it was so great! 


Fast forward to now and my girlfriend and I have visited on average 1-2 times a month. Everything we have tried is fantastic!


It has come to the point where we have tried other places on occasion and we are just not impressed. We feel spoiled by how good their sushi and customer service is.


Service: the wait staff is always efficient, friendly, and welcoming.


Side note: I judge service by how long my glass stays empty. I drink a great deal or liquid when I eat and can easily drink 3-4 glasses a meal. I have never had a moment of empty glass; I feel this is partly because the restaurant is smaller and more personal, and I like it this way!


Food: their fish is fresh and always the perfect temperature, and have never had a bad roll. If you are willing to spend a little extra get the specialty roll \"baked lobster\" it is truly worth the price and the visit to Fresh Wasabi!

Their over the rainbow roll is perfect with a range of fish including shrimp and salmon.


The caterpillar roll has the perfect amount of avocado and is drizzled with delicious eel sauce. 


The las Vegas roll is a tempura fried roll  with a savory cream cheese within. 


Atmosphere: it is a smaller space with intimate lighting and arrangement. There is a newer but still traditional look including colorful Oni masks. 



TL;DR: this is the best sushi I have had."}
{"text":"Wow ! Always amazing service it's like personality know the owner. Thank you for making feel at home"}
{"text":"We love fresh wasabi and have been coming here for years!! They recently reopened after a remodel, changed the name to Sushi Fix and it looks so good! Sushi is always fresh, the staff is friendly. We always sit at the sushi bar and enjoy watching our rolls being made. So glad to have a reasonably priced fresh sushi place close by."}
{"text":"The Yellow Tail was some of the freshest and sweetest fish I've ever had. I love salmon and it was great, buttery and sweet but the Yellow Tail was just out of this world. So many rolls to choose from. The service and the staff were fast and courteous. Price was middle of the road, not cheap and not outrageous.  if you find yourself around Bell & 67th Ave. I highly recommend you stop in and treat yourself."}
{"text":"Our usual sushi spot in Glendale is Sushi Catcher but upon discovering that it's now closed on Tuesdays, we found ourselves at Fresh Wasabi.  

Reasonable prices, interesting rolls and fresh fish!  The ambiance here is nicer than Sushi Catcher and that's a draw for me.  Service was excellent.  

My only complaint?  A restaurant called Fresh Wasabi doesn't serve fresh wasabi (unless it's an add-on item I missed on the menu).  I dislike the creepy green paste on every plate of sushi and thought I just hated wasabi... until I had fresh wasabi.  So, Fresh Wasabi, starting bringing your customers fresh wasabi.  :)"}
{"text":"We decided to try Sushi Fix after looking for new sushi options on here.  We were so pleased with what we found!  Happy Hour on Saturdays from 2-close?!  Awesome!  We had three rolls which all tasted fresh and delicious and spring rolls, which were also delicious.  I really liked the mustard sauce served with the spring rolls.  

The service was friendly and efficient.  We will definitely be back and we are looking forward to trying more!"}
{"text":"Another excellent YELP referral and find!!  I've eaten here several times - the sushi has been excellent every time.  I find it difficult loving places that are in strip centers with grocery stores next door - just doesn't really scream \"fine dining\" - but, it is a comfortable laid back environment and I would easily recommend it for grabbing a casual sushi/japanese dinner.

The sushi and the tempura has all been excellent, no rushing to get you out, with good wait service (there's even a TV above the bar to keep track of the latest bball games!!)."}
{"text":"Haven't had sushi in forever and this place hit the spot! My semi sushi virgin boys enjoyed the deep fried rolls and their first warning for Wasabi from the staff... who was wonderful all the way around. Can't wait to come back and do this again!"}
{"text":"Wow! First off, let me start by saying that this place probably has the best service! Amber and Kay were incredibly nice and so professional! The hostess (don't know her name) were very kind. The staff here is just excellent and everything they do. 

Food wise was the best! We got shrimp tempura/fried gyoza for appetizer, two sushi rolls (cali, vegas, and shrimp tempura), miso soup, and their spicy ramen noodles (forgot the actual name). Everything tasted excellent! Ramen was just perfect, sushi was good, and the shrimp tempura is so good when its fresh. 

We came on a late Friday night and there was no wait. Restaurant is very nice and modern. 

I will definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"The food was good, Music and Environment Comfortable, the only down fall they were short staffed on this day but, our waitress Amber did a great job. We will be back.
Thank You Amber

{"text":"Decided to try out a new sushi place and saw this one. They did not disappoint. They have a unique way of handle orders. All of their menus are laminated and you get a marker. That means they don't have to keep printing them menus and probably saves them money in the long run that they can pass on to customers. The menus were easy to read and understand.

I have to say the stuff jalapeños were amazing! Could have just gotten 3 orders of them and would have been content! They were able to make the curry rice vegetarian for us which was awesome! It was really good!

The interior looks great. Very modern with red under lighting at the sushi bar. It was bigger then I thought on the inside. There can get a lot of people in here.

Staff are really nice. They will help you out with anything you need.

Overall, this was a great experience and the food was awesome. Totally recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I worked for a Japanese company for over 20 years and traveled to Japan many times.  Over the years I have enjoyed sushi in a number of very expensive Ginza district (Tokyo) restaurants where my Japanese colleagues taught me what good sushi looks and tastes like.  Sushi Fix meals do not cost nearly as much as those Ginza district sushi restaurants, but the food is, in my opinion, just as good.  The sashimi always tastes fresh and is prepared properly . . . thinly sliced and presented with ginger and wasabi.  The sushi contains fresh seafood and is presented as the classic delicate specially prepared vinegared rice rolls, not those giant too much rice rolls that are served at most  U.S. sushi bars.  They also serve a very good selection of sake and great Japanese beer . . . my favorite is Sapporo.  Overall, this restaurant is a hidden gem and a great place to find authentic Japanese food.  The service is very good, the food is not only really tasty but also a great value, and the remodeled interior reminds me of a number of Tokyo sushi restaurants.  You can certainly pay a lot more for good sushi in Scottsdale or Phoenix, but why?  This is not only the best sushi in Glendale, but in many ways the best sushi in the Valley of the Sun!"}
{"text":"There was some deal for free dessert on valentine's day but we were still charged, even though we didn't eat it. Sushi was decent and service was friendly"}
{"text":"I came here on a late Friday night with my wife, we were in the mood for sushi and sashimi. Thought to myself that if this place got such some great review on Yelp! why not give it a shot.

First appearance, was it was a cute little restaurant. It was kind of easy to find since it was hidden in the dark end corner of Frys. The place wasn't too packed and wasn't dead either. We were quickly seated and was informed that happy hour was going on. SCORE! We didn't expected happy hour to occur on a Friday night, we thought it was like Kabuki in Glendale.

The price for the happy hour was amazingly cheap. For the amount they charge for the item, the food was good/delicious. Majority of the rolls were about $5, my favorite Vegas roll was on the happy hour menu so that was another plus. We order the sashimi for 2 which I believe was about $27 dollars for 3pc of sashimi, there were 5 different sashimi on the cute little boat they brought out. 

Overall we had a good time at this little shop! We will most definitely be coming back to this place regardless of happy hour or not.

The only downside to this, maybe it was the night shift or something, there was only 1 female waiter who was working at the time, maybe her co-worker were on break or something. It was hard to catch her to put in an order or ask for more ginger or to get our bill. 

Happy hour is: 
Mon-Friday 2-5
Mon-Friday 8-close (10pm)"}
{"text":"Quite plesant experience. Big selection of rolls and good happy hour deals. Nothing that blew my mind a tad more pricey than I would prefer. Will return if on this side of town."}
{"text":"Great little place with an intimate setting. This place was packed when we got there. The service was great as well. The sushi is just very average. It's not a world changer. The prices are not bad, but there are plenty of other places that have competitive prices with much better quality. The sushi rolls were a bit skinny and they would fall apart easily. I was expecting rolls that were a bit thicker, but these were skinny. Overall, great place. This can and probably is a favorite for many, but I'm not sure I'll go out of my way to go back. Maybe if I happened to be in the neighborhood. Don't take my word for it though, try it for yourself and find out."}
{"text":"This newly remodeled sushi joint is super cute, has happy hour all day everyday, is down the road from my house, has great service, and great sushi. Needless to say, I'm a fan! They did a really nice job with the remodel. Really clean looking and sleek. We started off with the Jalapeño Poppers: Fried Jalapeño stuffed with spicy tuna drizzled with spicy mayo, and eel sauce. We only ended up with 2 rolls that we almost couldn't finish. The Booty Booty Roll: Tobico, Shrimp Tempura, Cream Cheese, Avocado, Eel, Spice Tuna. Dressed with Spicy Mayo, Creamy Wasabi Sauce, and Eel Sauce.  It was very good! Very large bite but worth the chew. And The Cardinal: Avocado, Cream Cheese, Salmon, and Spice Tuna, topped with Eel Sauce. Very refreshing, a nice change from the deep fried roll. I'm looking forward to coming back trying more happy hour items."}
{"text":"Went for late lunch with a friend around 2:30. Excellent service ( only 5 people in the place ) they have a special discounted menus from 2-5. This used to be Fresh Wasabi."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this location. I have gone here countless times and NEVER had a bad experience. I always get great service with amazing food in a very timely manner. Amazing lunch and happy hour specials. Perfect for a quick bite to eat or a nice relaxing sit down dinner with the family."}
{"text":"What I look for in good sushi... fresh fish, good cuts, specialty rolls that have pizazz, a greeting from the sushi chefs when I enter the place, and good service.  And I got it.

I wasn't too surprised that I got all that tho... I have been to their other location in Surprise, but I'm glad that they are a good backup to my normal sushi place.

What did surprise me is that they have teppanyaki.  I haven't tried it, but with the quality of their sushi, I'm more than willing.

Definitely worth the try, especially for a hard core sushi person like me."}
{"text":"Came here for their lunch special. Ordered the spicy California roll and the philly roll to eat there and one sweet thang ( fried rolls to go). I do think their lunch special is decently priced. I did enjoy the spicy California roll. It wasn't terrible compared to the philly roll. I can't put my mind on it, I have had philly rolls before. And in my opinion this one wasn't spectacular. So out of the two- I would stick to spicy California roll. Hope the the sweet thang roll is more satisfying for my taste buds. 
It is a definitely cozy set up in here. It is welcoming and my server was really attentive which is always appreciated."}
{"text":"I LOVE Fresh Wasabi!  
This place is consistently good.  Always high quality and fresh.  They have a decent happy hour.  I don't think I've ever ordered something here that I didn't like.  I've tried as many of the rolls, sushi, and sashimi options as I can and I can't even choose a favorite.  I frequently go for the Snow White roll.  The place is small and casual, but clean and the service is usually just fine.  They've also been very accommodating with modifications and even custom-made rolls for one of my veggie-friends.  
Go here for good sushi."}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews I decided to take my significant other to lunch here.  Maaaaaaaan was it worth it!  I just became a FRESH WASABI fan!  I had such a great experience!  They have very friendly/helpful staff that are very quick.  The beer is cold, the chefs are nice and good at what they do.  I have zero complaints about this place.  The price is just right for great sushi.  The location throws you off a bit because it is in a Fry's plaza.. but once you get inside it is a totally different atmosphere.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi. Squid salad was great. Service was fast and friendly. Definitely will come back"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi--though only 3 vegetarian rolls they are still by far my favorite. Quick service and friendly staff. They have a ton of creative options and have a separate tepenaki room. Never once been disappointed by this location!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restraunt in town the staff is great and the sushi is just as good they have a great lunch and happy hour menu's. Fresh Wasabi is a must try"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place ever! Me and the bae decided we were craving some sushi and we found out about this place on Yelp. Excellent customer service, the servers were always smiling and very friendly. The rolls were very good and not too saucy. The best thing is the hamachi kama which is the yellowtail collar. It was grilled to perfection where it wasnt too well done or raw. We only went here twice because I was just in Arizona to visit my bae but we are definitely going to be coming back here every time I come visit him!"}
{"text":"I stopped off at Fresh Wasabi for lunch today. I wasn't expecting too much when I walked in since it was empty and almost 12:30PM.  

I sat down, ordered a water and 3 rolls from their lunch menu special. 11.95 for a Philly, spicy tuna and yellowfin rolls.
I also got an order of Monkey Brains.

Let me tell you, the rice was so delicious! It was cooked perfect and applied perfect. The vegetables were crisp and the fish was super fresh. I appreciated the fact that the chef didn't overdo the amount of rice on the roll. Too much rice isn't good on a roll.

Anyway, that's all I had and I am definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"This is the sister restaurant to Sushiholic. It is great, closer to me. The food is amazing, staff is friendly and on top of things. Decor is great, total over all vibe is amazing. Spicy garlic edamame is killer, a must try. The baked mussels are outstanding. Give it a try, you'll see what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"OMG I loved, loved, loved this place. The fresh wasabi was Ah-MAZING.. Las Vegas roll, California roll and cucumber salad. SO GOOD!!

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great portions and happy hour from 2:00PM till close, can't go wrong with that! Recommend going around 3:00PM, plenty of tables and the staff is really friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Very yummy sushi! It's been a challenge to find fun, local sushi joints on the west side but this one fits the bill. Friendly prompty service, good sushi rolls, and reasonable prices. Good atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"Got to enjoy happy hour here the other night. My girlfriend and I haven't been to a sushi place since we had moved to the area in January. As some of the previous reviews said, being in a landlocked desert city doesn't scream \"great seafood all around!\" However, we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and drink here! 

The waitstaff was very friendly even suggested drink options for my girlfriend. As the DD I just stuck to water for the evening minus a couple sips of her Pineapple Upside-down Cake drink which was phenomenal. That's a drink worth getting a taxi ride home for. Then we ordered some crab puffs (crab rangoons), a California roll, crunchy roll, crazy roll, and spicy tuna roll. The crab puffs tasted good, nothing special, but standard for that type of product from an Asian restaurant. The sushi rolls, however, were out of this world. We couldn't stop eating them until they were all gone. My personal favorite was the California roll, but the other three were also very good. This visit definitely exceeded my expectations in all areas and we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've had!! Amber was an amazing server and had such great recommendations. She graciously repeated the names of my sake flights several times and was so helpful. Would definitely recommend the baked lobster roll and Vegas roll. Such a wonderful experience and would definitely come back! Thanks amber for the excellent hospitality!!"}
{"text":"We've become a stable at this restaurant so much we know the family that owns it.  The happy hour is a great deal for getting some of the common rolls and the Climax roll is one of the best if flavors I've seen.  I like trying new sushi places both in Phoenix and when I travel, but this is the resturant that I keep going back to each time."}
{"text":"I went here with my family for a happy hour lunch during the week in a Thursday! It wasn't crowded at all, so definitely a great time to go. Our service was excellent and our server (her name is \"K\") had a great personality! We ordered quite a lot of food... the rainbow rolls (my favorite) were great and only $8!!! We ordered the ribs to try them out and they were surprisingly pretty good... the meat falls right off the bone which is great, but they could use a little more flavor for sure. My brother loved the squid (I didn't think they were very good) & my mom as well as Gram loved their rolls and dishes as well! We will be coming back here without a doubt!"}
{"text":"I had lunch there on Wednesday, and I still cannot believe it was as amazing as it was. Justin Y is dead on, it is by far the freshest sushi I've ever had, and I used to live 20 minutes from San Francisco! The rolls are fun inspired and unique. The seaweed isn't overpowering. The portions are perfect! Their lunch menu is awesome! 4 pcs Hamachi, 4 pcs Salmon, 1 philly roll, a daquari and edamame, 27.00 out the door.  Great value in my book, especially for something so fresh! The guys at the bar are men of few words, but they crank out quality! I'm still beside myself with joy!"}
{"text":"I know it's past midnight while I'm writing this but a couple hours ago, yesterday if we're getting technical here lol.. I went on a date night with my boyfriend and this is his favorite sushi spot. So we went. It was my first time. It was funny because as soon as we walked in, I actually saw one of my normal customers from my job! She's so nice. Her name is hills. She's very friendly and she's got some great jokes! Hahaha. And definitely let her know if it's your birthday. ;) but anyway, nice spot. Waitress was very nice, obviously lol. And we had some good rolls too. We had the spicy tuna, shrimp tempura and another one I can't remember at the moment. I also tried fresh wasabi. I never knew there was a difference. But the wasabi most people get, isn't actually fresh wasabi. It's water mixed with powder. Crazy to think that. Definitely recommend and will probably be back with my boyfriend. :) oh and happy hour last from 2pm-9pm. :)"}
{"text":"Delicious and excellent staff.  I travel from Surprise to go here just because it is so good. Fresh sushi and ingredients. I love it."}
{"text":"Amazing rolls!  My favorite is the jalapeño poppers delightful bites of flash fried jalapeños filled with cream cheese and fresh spicy tuna!   Their rolls are unique, fresh and delicious!   Our favorite local sushi place!   Service is friendly and attentive!  :)"}
{"text":"Very mellow and great space to enjoy great conversation and food.  No need to be screaming across the table either.  Awesome Top 40 music that just adds to the chill vibe.  The Tempura Appetizers were amazing as well as the Sushi was so fresh and crisp.  This place is not related to the other Fresh Wasabi on 137th Ave and Bell."}
{"text":"Bomb sushi! Awesome service! Will be coming back soon for sure. I think it was the kiss the tuna roll...? Was perfect!"}
{"text":"Ken-san has, as I was informed last night, moved to Hawaii and is now driving a cab.

The new owners trashed the little Japanese grocery that was adjoining and expanded, added some ambient dance tracks, bought a full liquor license, and now it is like every other sushi venue in Phoenix.

I ate there anyway.  It was okay.  Just another testimony to the reasons for my leaving this infernal town.

My previous glowing 5-star review will be preserved below in honor of my memories.

---
This venue is one of the very few things I miss about Phoenix.

Ken-san would always have the freshest tastiest things for me whenever I dropped in.  Unlike many of the sushi venues that can be found nearby, this is his family place and he takes pride in his art and business.

The wait can be a little long during the lunch rush, so if you have time constraints, I would suggest stopping by for dinner.

I can not recommend it highly enough.  I would almost fly to town just to eat there.  I enjoyed it so much that I was always taking first dates there.  I'm sure they thought that I was a huge manwhore since I was never bringing the same girl there twice. :D

I would always leave this restaurant happy when I lived in the Phoenix area, and you will too."}
{"text":"Not only do I agree with Randy G.'s review of Fresh Wasabi, but I know him personally. As a matter of fact, I introduced him to the experience that is Fresh Wasabi! 

In addition to all of the other reviews that are right on target, I want to share that I had (before today) enjoyed FW's happy hour (with reduced sushi prices). Today I had the pleasure of being even more thrilled and surprised to discover that not only does a special lunch menu exist but also very special lunchtime sushi prices. 

So, prior to grocery shopping next door at Fry's Marketplace, I decided to have lunch. After all, everyone knows that perusing a supermarket on an empty stomach will result in a higher grocery bill as well as more not-so-good-for-you choices!

I found in addition to the lunch menu that one may order 3 sushi rolls for $11.95 and/or single-piece sushi for $1 each! The rolls were not just a bunch of veggies and/or ersatz crab sticks either. I selected the spicy crab roll (with REAL crab), the tuna and avocado roll, and the Philly roll. All were delicious and full-sized. 

The single-piece nigiri sushi that found their way to my spot at the sushi bar were albacore tuna with a garlicky sauce, salmon, and yellow tail. The pieces of fish were generously cut and the flavor and freshness of the fish was to die for.

The whole tab, including iced tea, came to just under $19 (including tax). There was really enough sushi in my order to feed two people but I wanted to try a variety of the offerings. For two people, just add an additional iced tea or soft drink, and you'll be \"set to jet.\"

My dining adventures at FW are many and the scope of those experiences are wide and pleasantly varied. Do yourself (and those around you) a favor and visit Fresh Wasabi often!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend, as he likes sushi. I am not a fish eater, but normally sushi places also have a good japanese food menu. I ordered a chicken and noodle dish and I was very disappointed. It was so overwhelmed with ginger flavor that I couldn't even eat it. All I could taste was ginger, as if I was just eating a piece of one. As far as the sushi, my boyfriend enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and I've not been disappointed at all.

The lunch specials are a great deal! For around $6.95 you can choose one item (from teriyakis to sushi rolls). It comes with miso soup, rice, and salad. 

Their bento boxes are decent too. Their first combo is about $9. You get 5 pc sushi and cali roll with tempura, edamame, ginger, and some teriyaki with it. 

I don't remember what rolls I ordered specifically these past few times, but it's good food."}
{"text":"I used to love Tokyo Lobby....but lately not so much. So I was in search of a new west side (what! what!) sushi spot.

In the Fry's shopping center. Much nicer on the inside than on the outside. Pretty large inside.

Had a selection of rolls and all were really fresh. Good flavors. No sick mayo mixture (that other places use to cover up bad sushi). Small pieces (which I like).  Rolls were 4.50 to 8$ (for the \"normal\" rolls) and specialty rolls up to 10$.

Overall a west side win!   I will be going back."}
{"text":"This place was great! Great atmosphere, our waitress was super nice, and the food was very very good. Very clean restaurant. Good lighting and music: The women's bathroom surprised me with a really good baby changing table! My favorite item was a newer roll they offered that was enveloped in cucumber instead of rice. It was amazing! Will absolutely return here."}
{"text":"To start I was a bit hesitant because the location of the place, once we went in all of that went away. I am from NYC and lived in Japan for about 6 years, I know what great sushi is supposed to be and this is it!! The staff was also great even had a special dish made for me and my lady. I will continue to go to this place even though I live 30 minutes away. You should go too. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent sushi!!  My family comes here on a regular basis and we went with them over the Thanksgiving holiday week.  We had great service, and when I walked in with my gluten free soy sauce, the waitress knew right away what I could and could not eat, especially with the various sauces.  She also brought out a bottle of GF soy sauce that they have at the restaurant so I don't have to bring my own in the future.

My husband and dad did not get sushi, but ordered Japanese noodles instead.  We learned that they only have one Wok in the restaurant, so they brought my dad's meal first, then my husband had to wait for his to be cooked.  Next time they are just going to order the same thing in the interest of time.  My mom and I ordered sushi and they had a great selection of rolls.  Since I can't have the imitation crab or anything with tempura batter it was a bit tricky for me but I still found a few options to enjoy.  The rolls are not too big, so you don't have to worry about taking huge bites of food.  My little sister had chicken and rice, no sauce for her either, and they did a great job!

If you are in the area, definitely stop in for great sushi and service!"}
{"text":"Came here while my car was getting worked on.  Great customer service.  They offer a good variety of lunch specials, including the tempura battered ones.  I suggest the Las Vegas roll, yum!"}
{"text":"The sushi rolls are kinda thin. I heard a lot of good things about this place. I only found it to be ok. I was not that impressed. I'd go again but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner instead going to our usual sushi place. Ordered bunch of sushi  and apps on the happy hour menu along with other things on the regular menu. Overall, sushi and the other food were okay. Some of the food was very bland. Service was nice and quick. Unfortunately, it was not a satisfying dinner."}
{"text":"This is one of those quiet and cozy sushi gems one occasionally stumbles upon. We only found it because the other sushi place we were going to was closed on Monday, and Fresh Wasabi was just down the street (thank you, GPS!). Plenty of parking and easy to get in. We went kind of late so it was not crowded at all and we had the staff's undivided attention. Really good happy hour specials and if I remember correctly they had a \"reverse happy hour\" or something like that going where you got the happy hour prices on certain items at the end of the night. Nice. The sashimi boat we ordered was made quickly, looked impressive and was delicious. Our sushi chef had a real nice energy and the staff was courteous and helpful. And the kicker was the fresh wasabi we were offered to go with our sashimi. I don't think I had ever had wasabi in it's raw form and it was fantastic! Talk about a rush! I would definitely eat here again and again."}
{"text":"Excellent.  I had a spicy tuna hand roll, spicy scallop hand roll. My friend had a vegetable roll and edamame.  It was delicious.  This is my new go to place.  Ask for the fresh Wasabi, UNREAL.  I have never had that even in Los Angeles at the finest sushi bar.  Amazing. Talya is the best waitress I have ever had.  She is amazing and is so knowledgeable about all the menu items.  Love going there because of her."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch with a friend who lives on the \"west side.\"     She had been there prior for lunch and liked it.   I checked it on Yelp to see what the ratings and opinions are, and saw overall it has four stars. 

I had the salmon bento.   It comes with white rice and salad.  There are options for another side, and we both chose the seaweed salad.   Miso soup is a dollar more.   There was something fried that was tasty with a sauce, but I have no idea what it was.   It was good, though.

The salmon has a somewhat teriyaki sauce, and sat on greens.   I can't remember what it was.     It was good.   I remembered to take a photo when I was about half way done.   Darn!   I need to remember to take the photo before I start eating!  

 The seaweed salad was, well, seaweed salad, which I happen to like.   Nothing to make it stand out.   I've bought it premade in Asian grocery stores.  The salad was a bit soggy.   I don't know what kind of dressing it had.   I was not particularly impressed.  There was a large scoop of white rice.

The restaurant was clean and has a full sushi bar.   Not too many lunch customers.   I hope they have a much larger crowd at dinner. 

I would return if I was in the area.   I understand it has a happy hour.   The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"They changed their menu! Not a happy customer!! They used to have 3 combo lunch to choose from. Ramen and fried rice combo was so good. Now fried rice is 1 dollar extra. Ramen lunch combo has no chasiu, absolutely no topping!!! I can make that right at home!"}
{"text":"It was freezing the night I came in with friends. Not sure if the heat was on or what but I even though I had on a turtleneck and a jacket, it was still cold. I was not the only one that voiced how chilly the place was so I was happy I was not alone in that aspect. The food is pretty good but unfortunately the service is slow due to the lovely woman who hand crafts each order. She is great but when it is busy, you would hope there would be at least two or three total sushi chefs on hand to handle the crowd. All in all, it is a great little spot on bell that I may visit again and hope that it is not too crowded during my visit along with a little warmer. Brr..."}
{"text":"A little hidden gem! I must admit this is my favorite place for sushi so far in az! I have been to plenty \"high end\" sushi joints and this one blows then away! Amazing fresh sushi for a good price! Their happy hour menu is perfect, it has almost everything on there that you would normally order. It's not just crappy rolls. Service is beyond good every time I go. If you want good sushi for a cheap cost this is the place. Last Friday I went with a group of friends together we ordered a Las Vegas roll, rainbow roll, California roll, edamame, miso soup, and 5 sake bombs are tab was only $45!!! Highly recommend this place over anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Came here at 8pm. Had a waitress who was not attentive to our table for at least 30 minutes. Other than that the food was pretty good. Ordered some raw rolls and had a special booty roll which was tasty. The service was terrible, however the food earned it a 3 star from 1. The booty roll made me want to dance but I controlled it with the spicy tuna roll and wasabi. 

J out."}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi I've ever had. Service is just as good as the food. I recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The food keeps me coming back again and again. The New York roll is my favorite - spicy tuna topped with the butteriest avocado, eel sauce and crunch tempura flakes. One of our party got the sashimi boat and the cuts were thick and fresh. Even the chicken teriyaki is quite tasty. 

That said, I do agree with some of the other reviewers that 1) the place often appears a bit understaffed and not as quick as I'd like and 2) the rolls can be small. 

Happy hour is 8PM to close, so if you want to fill up for the cost, go then."}
{"text":"The staff used to be a the i-17 & pinnacle peak location in Norterra. Went in out of curiosity. They have happy hour 2-close everyday, this should be a red flag. Sushi is far from fresh (hence the cost). You can always tell the quality when ordering the tuna. The salmon and  yellowtail were also unappealing. I see things haven't changed much since I stopped going to the other location before they sold it. There are much better options nearby that cost about the same, if not less, that serve firm & fresh sushi. 3 starts only because the service was attentive."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in the sushi-lackluster Northwest Valley. There are a ton in the Central and East parts of the Phoenix area that are incredible and Fresh Wasabi easily competes with them in both quality, freshness and price. The staff is super friendly and chatty and always really attentive, even if you're just going in to do some quick take-out. The cherry blossom roll is my favorite."}
{"text":"Must try Monkey Brains, spicy garlic edamame and the TEMPURA CHEESECAKE WILL BLOW YOUR MIND! 
Really everything is good, fish is fresh and they have a huge selection of every roll you can think of. 
The staff is friendly and attentive and want you to really enjoy your experience. 
Our favorite place HANDS DOWN in the west valley!!"}
{"text":"Hi everyone. We went here last night and I can say this it's pretty great. One thought that came across my mind when trying to decide where to go (never been here btw) was happy hour. We had a larger party so that would've been amazing. This was also around 7PM and from experience, happy hour would be like 2-4 or something inconvenient like that. 

Imagine my surprise when I saw this place's happy hour was from 2pm to close... TO CLOSE. ON A SATURDAY! That got me super excited. So our party of 10 minus 2 were greeted by a very friendly hostess and equally as nice waitress. She checked on us all the time and made sure we were comfortable.

It wasn't AS busy as I thought it would be on a Saturday night but maybe it just wasn't late enough. Our service was quick. We ordered quite a few rolls off the happy hour menu and it was quite a good selection too. Las Vegas rolls, CA rolls, crunch rolls, salmon, spicy tuna rolls... next time, we're probably just going to get one of each.

The pieces were bite size. There may be some comments on here saying that they are a bit small but I think we're used to the sushi spots where they roll a 3-inch diameter super roll and it takes 2-3 bites per piece or something. But these ones were just right and you can actually chew after stuffing it in your mouth. That was a plus.

The kids options were priced very well. My son gets a chicken terriyaki bowl and it was probably like 4-5 bucks. And you know what? They did not over-sauce it! You all know what I'm talking about. It was just the right amount of sauce and generous portion of a child. He loved it.

Aside of the sushi, my wife also ordered the Shoyu Ramen. It was packed full of flavor. Lots of veggies and the noodles were cooked just right. Just how it's supposed to taste. 

It was an overall great experience. The staff was really nice and the service was outstanding. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I love this place!
The food there is wonderful, and the staff is extremely welcoming. If you're looking for great food, and a delightful environment to sit quietly or take friends and family, I highly recommend you try Sushi fix.
If I have a craving for sushi, this is where I will go, every time."}
{"text":"The food and severe was excellant. Norton our server did a marvelous job.
The CA Roll and Spicy Shrimp Roll were fantastic, tried the fried rice and liked that as well
Only comment to the restaurant is I wish the Miso Soup would have been a little hotter"}
{"text":"It's okay. I know it's not the freshest but it's chewy at times and I do mean the seaweed around the rolls."}
{"text":"This being our first visit to the area, we were impressed with the quality of the food, and the varied menu.  We enjoyed  the crazy horse roll and the lobster roll.  We also had the calamari,the Yaki Soba and an order of the crab puff.  Everything we had was very good and our dining experience was enhanced by Iris."}
{"text":"The waitress had impeccable taste in eyebrows, sign of a true genius. Service was great . Fish was all super fresh . Great cocktail"}
{"text":"This place was delicious!! The staff were so welcoming and friendly . We ordered 3 different rolls, soup and chicken fried rice. The rice was so delicious we ordered extra to go l. The soup was super hot but very flavorful and the rolls were fresh. The crunchy roll was a but sweet which was unexpected and it was not fried like I thought it'd be  but it was Good!"}
{"text":"Great deal specially for their happy hour!!  every single roll we had was excellent! Their drinks are really good."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. Definitely going to be on my regular sushi rotation as the sushi was fresh, the happy hour has great prices and you get a serious bang for your buck. I went with a group of 3 of us and we ordered 4 rolls, a few sake bombs, edamame and we had leftovers afterward. The size of the rolls are great and the variety of rolls is good. 
Absolutely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great environment with friendly service and fantastic food,  this is the place!! I can't tell you how much times we've come to this place lol I consider us \"regulars\".   We had just moved into the area and I was craving sushi and so I stumbled across this place.  Did not disappoint.   Food is always great and quick,  they have this pineapple upside down cake drink that our waitress always brings me once I get in lol which is amazing!  I always forget her name but she's so friendly and great with service.   I would highly recommend this place for anyone who's looking for a sushi fix with fair prices but delicious food."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best sushi restaurants in town. There is a happy hour in the evenings and another late night happy hour that I believe starts at 8pm. Happy hour prices cannot be beat. 

You have to try the fresh wasabi too - it really packs a punch! Great service and excellent food."}
{"text":"Found a new sushi place to eat at. New to us at least. I definitely recommend trying it. Quality is good and prices are even better."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant where Fresh Wasabi was. Big difference to say the least. Well done with the ambiance and the food is great!"}
{"text":"this place is just okay.  the  staff is nice and they have FABULOUS lunch specials!  but i've had better sushi.  it's not bad, and it's a great value, which keeps me going when i have a desperate need for sushi on a budget, but it's also not my favorite."}
{"text":"A surprising victory for Glendale's sushi lovers. I went here for lunch today and highly recommend dropping by to take advantage of the lunch special. Three big sushi rolls for 11.95 is tough to beat. 

My lovely girlfriend and I came here (she works near there and this is her favorite lunch spot) and split a shrimp tempura appetizer and one lunch special. The shrimp was very good, a little greasy, but good. And the rolls were also dee-lish. The only thing that wasn't was the poorly done house remix of Kelly Clarkson's \"Since You've Been Gone\" - apparently it was the 15 minute version because that song went on for the good latter half of lunch. Oh, well. No one's perfect."}
{"text":"I remember when this little place was owned by Ken and was called The Sushi. I was upset when Ken sold the place, but Masa has worked wonders!
 The sushi here is phenomenal! I haven't ordered anything I haven't loved! Their Volcano Rolls are amazing and I make everyone I'm with try it. :) 
  The staff is very helpful and nice, especially Iris. 
  I recommend Fresh Wasabi to all my sushi loving friends. Best sushi in Arizona by far!"}
{"text":"To keep it short and simple:

Yummy, fresh sushi
Clean dining area 
Friendly and fast service.
Great happy hour prices. 

Recommend the school bus roll."}
{"text":"This restaurant is actually amazing. Their lunch bentos are a steal and definitely are a bang for your buck. They come with miso soup, rice, salad, an orange, but most importantly, your entree, either gyoza/crab puff, etc. and a sushi roll. The bento is only around $8, but they give you 8 pieces of sushi!! I would recommend the spicy tuna roll and beef teriyaki bento. We usually come for Saturday lunch around noon, and the place is pretty empty. The staff is very efficient and welcoming. Never have I enjoyed a bento more."}
{"text":"Our go to Sushi Fix! Get it? The renovation looks amazing and the staff are friendly. Many great dish options and happy hour prices are pretty awesome! Haven't had a bad experience yet!"}
{"text":"Sushi was good nice portion size, service was good prices weren't bad.  Happy hour menu is great."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good sushi in Phoenix, especially when most sushi is found in Scottsdale, and usually populated by the snobby and uninspired eaters.

Fresh Wasabi is not for them.  This is a place for the real sushi eater, who is not afraid to try extreme flavors and very fresh fish. They have an incredible menu, filled with traditional sushi/sashimi, and with your more contemporary rolls, including the old standbys like Alaskan rolls, spicy tuna, Dragon, etc.

When I went, I got to have one of their Sashimi plates, which included very fresh tuna, salmon, incredible octopus, some of the best Mackerel I've ever had, and a small tuna/octopus salad that was amazing. 

I also had the Uni, which is my absolute guilty pleasure. It was oceanic, soft, and intense, the nori was a little chewy though. 

The scallops dynamite was very good, but it could have been slightly spicier, I enjoy the spicy a little more than most people do, but the scallops were sweet and mixed well with the kewpie and fish eggs. 

We finished up with a roll ( the name escapes me), topped with salmon and eel sauce, filled with a spicy tuna mixture, it was good, but nothing too special.

On this special occasion, we had desert. Green Tea Ice Cream was soft and chilled, with frost on it, quite nice, and tempura battered cheesecake was incredible. 


Also, the staff is very awesome, but that might be because we went with a regular, I'd love to go back and sit at the bar though.

I highly recommend Fresh Wasabi if you're on the west side, despite the weird location next to a Fry's."}
{"text":"Sorry Yen, but you have been replaced.  I have no idea if this place has a killer happy hour like Yen, but I don't care, this place is ridiculously good.  Went her Saturday night with the intentions of getting tepan, but there was already a family wrapped around one side, so we passed and went to the sushi bar.    They have pages of rolls, which I love because I make sushi rolls at home, so I need the ideas.  I love rolls, but I just don't want all the rice, so i prefer sashimi.  After studying the menu for a lifetime, my boyfriend finally ended up on the Combo pages, THANK GOODNESS, because that was the way too go!  We got the Sushi Combo for 2, it was perfect.  For $35, and two people you each get a miso soup, a garden salad, you spilt a little plate of tempura, there was 2 shrimp, an onion ring, a long sweet potato we split in half, a carrot, and a zucchini.  As for sushi, 1 california roll, 1 spicy tuna roll, 2 pieces each of shrimp, yellowtail, tuna, and salmon nigri, 2 pieces each of tuna, salmon and yellow tail sashimi.  That's a ton of food for such a great price.  Our yellow tail sashimi slices were at least an inch thick, and it was so buttery, I couldn't get over it.  On top of all this food we had to order some mackerel, and some clam sushi nigri style that I've never had before.  Both were delicious, and I can not wait to go back.  The place was pretty busy, so they told us they were a little backed up, and quite honestly, I didn't end up caring. Out of all my sushi experiences, I think this one is at the top of my list, seriously Yen has been replaced."}
{"text":"We're still steady customers after three years of eating here with never a bad meal, or issue that wasn't immediately corrected.

So far the best udon base I've found in the valley, but that statement really only works if you are me.Everyone I know that's eaten the miso soup rates it above average There's a wide variety of rolls,appetizers and drinks that are reasonably priced out-with happy hour.

This is my family's favorite place as kid are treated well at any time,E.g, Sat afternoon or a Tuesday night.  as soon as I am off my  lo iodine diet this is the  second place  I'm  going. ( 1st will be breakfast:)"}
{"text":"This is one of the best kept secrets in the Arrowhead area.  Their sushi  and service is amazing.  No one else has the secret beer bucket to keep your drinks cold!  Ask Jay or Kay about it!"}
{"text":"Considerably better than the surprise location. Not sure if it's the happy hour pricing or the food quality. May also be the lighting as it doesn't feel as drab."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to a zillion sushi bars, all over the world. This place was for sure one of the best we've ever had!! We judge a sushi restaurant by their hamachi and Miso soup. Both where unbelievable. The miso had prices of Shataki mushroom and excellent flavor and consistency. The yellow tail is the other measure we use to determine the quality of fish, it was beyond fresh. We had 3 rolls, Snow White, Climax and best of all the Booty booty roll. Service was even more impressive!  We will be coming back, for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Prompt service. Friendly. Tasty. Good price. Happy hour 2-close Monday-Saturday. No porch seating. Clean. Highly recommended. HIGHLY"}
{"text":"I haven't been here since it was called Fresh Wasabi, and I believe the same family owns this one.  They really did a beautiful renovation inside and it is so comfortable and clean...and a lot more spacious.  They now have happy hour from 3pm(?) to close Monday - Saturday which is amazing.  The sushi is absolutely delicious.  My fave is the First Love roll with the little bit of fresh lemon on the top.  The service is outstanding.  I highly recommend - for the food AND the ambiance."}
{"text":"I've been here once, but I can already tell I'll be back many more times! I love the quaint atmosphere and the service, very attentive. The sushi is very fresh and they have very interesting delicious rolls!"}
{"text":"Great collection of Sushi ... They have freshly prepared sushi which is just awesome..The service is also great...Been a regular over here..."}
{"text":"I recently moved here to AZ from the bay area, my family and I decided to begin scouting for a sushi restaurant.  This place has some pretty impressive reviews and I cannot disagree, we did experience very good service.  I could not say the same for the food; the ramen was salty and unfilling, the sushi was skimpy and the plating was sloppy. No recommendation from me..."}
{"text":"It's a nice clean restaurant with friendly service.  Lots of sushi to choose from and food is fresh.  However, their rolls seem small to me, and has too much sauce (e.g. teriyaki) on top that overwhelms everything.  They do have ramen, although broth can be creamier.  Their bento boxes offer lots of combinations, but their salad dressing seems to be straight up soy sauce.  I've had better for cheaper."}
{"text":"DON'T TRY TO USE YOUR ENTERTAINMENT COUPON HERE. We had never heard of this place before, but found it in our Entertainment Book. However, they post a sign right on the door that they do not accept Entertainment coupons. I see a lot of good reviews about Fresh Wasabi and would have loved to try their food, and I suppose we could have stayed anyway, but it is the principle of the thing, that a place will lure you in with a coupon and then refuse to honor it. I walked in briefly and told them that they lost our business because the only way we knew about the restaurant was through the Entertainment book. There were just two other people in the whole place on a Friday night, and they lost the business of four people for dinner because of their false advertising."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was very good, nice atmosphere. We all had the Teppanyaki, and the chef did a very good performance :)


Music doesn't quite fit would be about my only criticism, but then I'm pretty fussy about my music ;)"}
{"text":"We tried this place (while on vacation from L.A.) on the strong recommendation of friends. We weren't expecting much, as we figured there's no way Arizona sushi could compare to what we get in L.A. Well, let me eat my words down with some of their delicious fish!!! This place is really great. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but sometimes those are the best spots. Ken, the owner, is very nice and seems to remember everyone. Their spanish mackerel is some of the best I've ever had, and I don't know what it is about their California rolls but I'm not usually a big fan (typically BORING!) but not here. They're incredibly delicious! Make sure to check out the back room, where you can draw on the walls!"}
{"text":"I have had better.  I ordered teriyaki chicken and the meat was spongy. The wasabi was so mild that when i poured it on my roll there was absolutely no effect. My roll was too bready. My husband had a beef soup and he found his meat to be spongy as well. We think they brined the meat too long . If they can fix those things maybe we will come back.  Sorry guys, this was very disappointing for $55.00 dollars.  The only thing we liked was the miso."}
{"text":"My favorite west side sushi, love the exotic rolls here mostly.  I cant recall them because I make my wife pick them out.  I do know one is called the \"climax\"  because I am a guy and of course I am going to remember that.  The service is always good here the atmosphere is pretty nice considering it is in the Fry's shopping center.  I take my wife on dates here so its not too casual if you know what I mean.  I am pretty sure you can satisfy a sushi snob here but I am not one so I dont know for sure.  My wife is and she's happy....."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there after they changed ownership, eeh...Ok."}
{"text":"I feel bad that my review contradicts your overall rating of a 4 star.  This was a very poor experience based on a very recent visit.  We found Fresh Wasabi on Yelp and trusted we would have a nice Japanese meal with a little sushi.  The experience was embarrassing.  We were the only patrons in the place.   One waitress spent more time watching TV and talking to the chef than serving us.  We sat for long periods just watching her and waiting.  She was not helpful with questions about the menu for our first visit.  The food was very disappointing.  No character, no visual appeal, poor flavor profiles. I could not recommend this place and am sorry I trusted this review.  I don't like to review so critically, but it is deserved.  My only positive statement is that it was clean."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday, Happy I did. Reading the Yelp reviews definately helped my decision. Food was very good and fresh. Can't beat the price, Happy Hour from 2-Close M-Sat is nice. The Staff was awesome and very friendly. Nice decor and clean. We got a pretty good size plate of Rolls for about $23.. I will be back soon..."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place, but it was very mediocre.

The happy hour special was priced low but sadly it also tasted low.   Everything tasted off and quality was sub par.  I don't think it too much to expect sushi to be somewhat fresh.  That is what sushi is suppose to be right?

If want a sushi roll for under $5 this is the place to go, I mean its only $5.  However you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Wow!! I honestly was so impressed with this establishment. The staff was soooo friendly. I could care less if the food is great if the customer service is crap but thank God they already won me over with their kindness. Now the food. It was very good. I went in with zero expectations only because of the location and Ive been let down by \"plaza sushi\" before but it was quality fish. Honestly it was so good my husband I forgot to take photos after our appetizers. They also have an amazing happy hour. Who has happy hour till close!!!?? SUSHI FIX! To top it all off we only had one item off the happy hour menu but our bill was still extremely forgiving on our wallets for quality sushi. Thanks guys. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Came here while in town on business.    Food was excellent!   Staff was great, Amber, Haley were so helpful with what to order and then Alex crushed it with off the menu sushi creations that were amazing!   Will be back!"}
{"text":"The best sushi I have tasted in AZ, and I have tried my fair of sushi here.... a very big selection of sushi rolls, some favorites are climax roll, guilty pleasure and first love, love the screaming fever albacore salad. I have to say sushi in AZ is pricey everywhere so its standard there. 2 people usually runs about $60-$80 .... but its worth it, its delicious and very fresh!!!!"}
{"text":"On Bell Road in NW Phoenix/Glendale you will find several places to enjoy sushi.  This place is near the top when you consider quality, value, and overall experience out of all the choices you have to chose from.

Located in a completely renovated strip mall anchored by a Fry's, the place atctually looks nice from the outside and not rundown like so many other unfortunate strip malls littering the valley.  Says something for the area if they feel it is necessary to make it look new and fresh again.

The inside is nice and cozy, very inviting, with soothing music to help you enjoy your sushi/sashimi/or japanese food as you desire.  The quality is fresh and delightful with appropriate portion size as well.  They have great daily specials with bento box choices, sushi, or even teriyaki chicken.

This place is a very good choice for Japanese food for the area.  I haven't tried the teppanyaki with my many visits, but sometime I will.  Maybe an update will be due after such.  Otherwise, I would definitely recommend Fresh Wasabi to anyone."}
{"text":"Went with my family for the first time a couple weeks ago. The sushi was okay but service was great....quick and genuine, happy to serve."}
{"text":"It's few and far between that I ever give a five star review but I can honestly say that you will not find higher quality sushi in the valley.  I've been coming here for nearly a decade, back when Masa (the owner) used to call this joint, Fresh Wasabi.  Since the remodel, he has dubbed the new vibe of the restaurant, The Sushi Fix.  I'm lovin it! 

The service is always on point too.  I only order sashimi so I refuse to go to a sushi restaurant that doesn't meet the highest quality standard for fresh, supreme grade sushi cuts.  There are a ton of great rolls to try out too though."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, seems to be under different management which may have improved it from before.  Great neighborhood sushi joint with great quality and really trash sashimi!  The white tuna and salmon sashimi were excellent, pairing with the fresh wasabi makes it even better.  My only complaint is that I don't come here more often!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices. Fast service and friendly staff. Cheater chopsticks available for the chopstick inclined.  I really enjoyed the raw salmon and tuna. The rolls are also very tasty, but I prefer to gorge on the raw fish. It was Delicious."}
{"text":"Groovy Happy Hour specials and innovative rolls are what I remember fondly from Fresh Wasabi. Tuna with mango? Pretty cool. Other rolls covered with flavorful avocado slivers and topped with tempura were pretty nice. I really do appreciate the creativity coming from the chefs, and it totally makes up for the boring, more traditional items that distract you from wise selections from happy hour. 

I had the most tasteless fried squid ever. If memory serves, these squid bits were breaded and not battered, and served with plain ol' Sriracha. 

The crab puffs were just 'meh' also, but this serving is definitely more about quantity and tiding you over until the good stuff is ready.

Additionally, remember to always refuse deep-fried rolls from your waitress. The eel sauce is weak and sparse, and the only fillings I can recall were cream cheese and regret.

As far as drinks, there's a decent sake menu, but seriously, who's gonna shell out for something more expensive than Sho Chiku Bai at a place like this? We just wanna toss it in our Sapporo like bros and call it a day. Protip: Add the \"sake bomb\" option to your menu (rather than ordering beer and sake separately) like every other sushi bar in your price range. Plum wine was cool though.

So in the end, this is a generic sushi bar whose saving grace is a chef with great creativity using limited ingredients. If you want to gorge yourself on deep fried tempura everything, then go right ahead. But that's not the kind of diner I write for. I write for those who like to enjoy something more unique. And if you browse the menu at Fresh Wasabi, I think there's more than enough to pique your interest."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices.. I would gladly eat here again soon.. Actually i will eat here again soon :-)"}
{"text":"Was completely blown away by this establishment. Food, service and ambulance is outstanding. If you're hungry at lunch time, I highly recommend the Bento Box. We where stuffed and had enough to take home. 
We are now regular costumers."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Service is not too bad on busy weekends, but it makes up for the excellent food they serve. The owner decided to put two teppanyaki grills and it wasn't a bad decision, at all. If you want to save a little money on the teppanyaki, go during lunch. Sushi (rolls, sashimi, nigiri) are always awesome."}
{"text":"Big Fan of this place.

The sushi rolls are excellent and vary from healthy to heart-attack in nature.  All are delicious.  The service is good.  The wait times are pretty minimal, sushi bar is always open.  Ambience is casual.  This is as good as it gets for west-valley sushi."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The service is great every single time, the food is consistently AMAZING and the happy hour is amazing. You can't beat it. I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Not a very good place for sushi or service.  Went there this past weekend due to reviews on yelp, and also some coupons in the mail.

Sushi was just ok, service a bit below par.

Not very fresh for the sushi, and some of the fried items were very heavily battered, and pretty much obliterated the underlying taste."}
{"text":"I got the Seared Salmon Wrap, Booty Booty Roll, Spicy Crab Roll, and a Spicy Tuna Roll. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. 
The Seared Salmon Wrap has Snow Crab, Avocado, Salmon Sashmi Slices, and thinly sliced green onions as garnish. This comes with five wraps and it a distinctive taste, but it's savory. 
Booty Booty Roll has shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado, eel, and spicy tuna. Drizzled with spicy mayo, creamy wasabi sauce, and eel sauce. It tasted absolutely amazing! I would definitely order this again the next time I come by.
The other two rolls; Spicy Crab and Spicy Tuna, are your generic rolls that you can get in any sushi restaurant. 

Overall, the rolls are perfectly sized to accommodate people with small mouths. The rolls also don't fall apart easily, they are well put together to keep all the ingredients inside and mess free while enjoying.

I would recommend this place for the food and the atmosphere it brings. It's perfect for hang outs and dates."}
{"text":"We got our plate of sushi and noticed that it had a Philly roll instead of a sweet thing and our waitress Jamie said \"no worries!\" And immediately fixed it! She was great, super nice, and didn't hesitate to fix our order. The sushi was good, nothing too impressive, but I was still happy with what I ordered. The renovations look amazing by the way! Beautiful interior."}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing sushi tonight. It's really hard finding sushi dining with cucumber wrapped rolls and those are my fav. Kudos on having a baby changing station in the bathrooms :)"}
{"text":"Went to this place with my husband for the first time yesterday. It was recommended to us by a friend.  I had seen this hidden treasure before, but never been in to the store.  Food was great, and the portion sizes were GREAT.  Prices were good for Happy hour prices, staff was very friendly, and if you need something changed, the staff were only too happy to accomodate this.  There was no Childrens menu, but when asked, the staff said they would be happy to make smaller portions for children.  All in all, we will be going back again."}
{"text":"This place rocks. Doesn't look like much from the outside, but the food was top notch and the service was as good as one could hope for. Thank you, Iris!

The Climax and the Avalanche rolls were like eating dessert and the Viva Las Vegas Roll was as good as advertised. Maybe better.

I live in Boston, my buddy is from Vegas, and my brother in L.A. and we agree this place was exceptional."}
{"text":"I haven't had such fresh sashimi in a long time. We had the Sashimi for two. The fresh wasabi was awesome.  The jalapeno poppers were a crunchy tempura batter with just enough spice, drizzled with eel sauce. Yum!!! Great prices at happy hour. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour even on Saturday till 6 and again after 8.  Friendly service and fresh high quality sashimi and fun rolls.  Try the climax!"}
{"text":"Outstanding sushi and the staff is amazing! Highly recommend it! Go try them!! Great sushi and customer service."}
{"text":"This place was really good. Variety of sushi and rolls. Happy hour from 2 pm to close. Who can beat that? Tried their tootsie roll and crunchy roll. Delicious. And their staff were so nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is my favorite sushi spot.  I used to be an avid Ah-So visitor...USED to be.  I now know what amazing sushi tastes like thanks to Fresh Wasabi.  Each roll I've tried is delicious and filling.  If you go during happy hour, you can easily fill 2 bellies for $20-$30.  Try the spicy crab roll...you will not regret it."}
{"text":"First timer, never again. Our waiter speak no English whatsoever. She kept nodding yes to everything I said. I told her I was a vegetarian so no meat, only vegetables substitution,  And the only thing she repeated back was no meat! 
My appetizer came, all that was in my sushi was avocado and cream cheese.....  yeah. Smh.
Also, i ordered the udon vegetable. I noticed it was taking a very long time to come out. So I ask the waiter, she said ten minutes....  fifteen minutes passed by, I ask another waiter about my entree, she said the vegetable udon was never ordered. 

I had to get up several times for napkins, wasabi, hot water and the bill..

So there you have it!"}
{"text":"The lunch specials here at this place are fantastic!  $8.99 or $9.99 for a bento lunch, with about 5-7 pieces of delicious sushi, tuna or california rolls, tempura, soup, salad, and edamame.   This is one of the best deals for lunch anywhere!!  The quality of the sushi is usually fantastic to boot.  This is one of my favorite lunch spots."}
{"text":"Fresh Wasabi is a haven to those who cherish quality. The cuts are perfect, the rolls are deliciously complex, the presentation is beautiful, and the service is prompt and non-intrusive.

Also, don't forget why they named this place what they did: be sure to try their fresh wasabi, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Best sushi on the west side! Love it and eat there 3-4 times per week! Fresh and great quality...order the First Love Roll!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi and lots of options. Happy menu is well sized and is from 2pm to close. Nice atmosphere. Hit the place up on a Thursday eve and wasn't busy at all. Las Vegas and Tootsie roll are good."}
{"text":"Wow who would of thought it would be so hard to find good sushi in the valley.  Even the places I tried in Scottsdale were lame and uninspired.   I had the Monkey Brains (spicy tuna stuffed tempura friend mushrooms) which are always my favorite when I can find them at Sushi places.  I also ordered the 8 piece sashimi sampler and was pleased with its freshness and variety.  I also ordered the Climax Roll and the Sushi for the Soul Roll.  Needless to say I ended up bringing some home but it kept well and it made a great sack after a night out."}
{"text":"Bf and I were around this area because we wanted to check out the outlet. We were craving sushi and found this place on yelp.
We were greeted by the host when we first came in and sat us at a table right away. 
An asian lady named Iris, she gave us the menu and welcomed us. 
I told her I checked in on yelp, I wanted to get the free miso. She responded, \"of course how many would you like?\" I told her two. We ordered the calamari for appetizer. Came with sriracha sauce and eel sauce. It was different, it was pretty good. With some lemon added to squeeze for the calamari. It was nice and soft. Not rubbery like some calamari. 
We ordered vegas, tootsie, tuna, and shrimp rolls. It was yummy! I loved how Iris kept checking on us.. She made sure we were okay and made sure the food came out right and how its supposed to. 
At the end we had some left overs. We told her we would take it to go. She was so nice that she made sure we had ginger, soy sauce, and wasabi to go! I also mentioned to her I appreciated everything she had done for us because the service was great. I told her we live in Chandler area. She says \"wow that is so far, would you like me to pack your food with some ice to make sure it is fresh?\" She was so thoughtful, and I loved that. She thanked us for giving their restaurant a try. The next time we are around here. We are definitely coming back. Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"I have eatin here 4 different times now. Twice before they expanded and twice after. They have the freshes fish around. Nigiri and Sashimi blows me away along with their other crazy rolls they have. I have not been to any other sushi place in AZ that has so many different rolls to choose from. Big fan of the rolls with jalapeno slivers and siracha ontop of them. Enjoy this place anyday of the week but make sure you pair whatever you get with sake and ichiban!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I want to give them a quick shout-out because we really do enjoy this little place. Our server yesterday was laid back but a pro and he gave us a mini-Japanese lesson and couple of laughs. It is notable - the difference that good service can make. 

Their Happy Hour (HH) is probably one of the best we've tried - given the price point and the variety of selection. Not only that - the regular menu prices are below what you'd pay many other places and the food is just as good if not even better due to the creativity of the chefs. 

We really enjoyed the Ono nigiri - it's so fresh, buttery and delicious. The rolls we had this time were the classic rainbow ($8) currently on HH and the Climax. ($12 never HH) and both are worth an \"order again.\"

They have the laminated, spiral-bound type of menu here (with photos and descriptions) which makes ordering that much more enjoyable. They have the usual other offerings of udons, full range of appetizers, etc. 

Their strip mall location is the reason that this place falls off my radar, but I'm making the effort to write 'em up because I want to remember to visit more often. I don't want to be saying \"Ono! I forgot.\""}
{"text":"Went on a sister date there and ordered off of the happy hour menu, every piece tasted fresh and I loved the flavors. The waitress was nice and I'd defiantly go back again!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Fresh Wasabi for YEARS! Their sushi is always so fresh and delicious. The service is always fast to seat and eat. It's never too busy in there so it's a great small place for a quiet date. The lion king roll is my favorite. Definitely don't judge this place by it's cover. It's very small but the food is divine!"}
{"text":"Been going for years, some of the best sushi in town. Try the spicy tuna, climax roll, and first love, the Las Vegas and the amigo are awesome as well. The one in surprise is nothing like this location. I tried it and the sushi sucked. Go to this location instead. Nice affordable prices during happy hour and friendly staff. Small little quaint place but the sushi makes it worth it!"}
{"text":"We've been here three or four times and its probably going to continue to be a regular in our sushi restaurants. The Happy Hour is great as everyone has mentioned and we indulge ourselves with several rolls. Every time we've gone the fish has tasted fresh and the rest of the ingredients have been well balanced. Of course we only eat the simpler rolls nothing deep fried or overly stuffed with cream cheese or it overpowers the rest of the flavors. Good service every time we've been there, we've always had the same waitress and she's been attentive and funny."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a new place for sushi ever since my beloved Kampai changed ownership and fell from grace.  My brother and I made the mistake of watching Jiro Dreams of Sushi and knew we had to find an AUTHENTIC Japanese sushi bar to satisfy cravings the movie evoked.  

After several hours of online research, we decided to try Fresh Wasabi at 6645 W Bell not to be confused with the location in Surprise which is not owned by Masa Kim.  Tucked away in a little strip center next to Fry's we found a little piece of heaven. 

We did Omakase and OMG it was amazing!  We had hamachi, halibut fin, albacore, uni, squid, hawaiian tuna, hamachi kama and more.  Everything was authentic, fresh, and absolutely delicious.  To our delight it was happy hour (daily from 2-6pm) so we enjoyed large beers for only $4.  Masa Kim advised us of his plans to remodel this location in the near future and also told us he recently opened Sushi Style in Moon Valley which we will be trying next...maybe even tonight.  It was that good."}
{"text":"Boyfriend took me here and said the fresh wasabi was the best 
He didn't lie 
Great wait staff and excellent sushi"}
{"text":"A great sushi place! We've been here 3-4 times and just keep wanting to go back. The staff is great, relaxed and professional, and the fish is fresh and tasty. Our favorites are the jalapeno poppers (fresh take on a classic appetizer) and the salmon sashimi (the touch of lemon really elevates it), and the rolls are delicious as well - shout-out to the Las Vegas roll!  The happy hour menu is pretty good - 10-15 dishes for reduced prices for most of the night - can't remember the specifics but I remember being like \"Woah, wait, how long is happy hour?\""}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the sushi was even better, this place has an amazing Las Vegas Roll, I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"It is usuakly my favorite place but today i chsnged my mind.....  They told my Mother in law she couldnt have her siezure service dog on the chair .  
Bad form...."}
{"text":"Wife out of town. She does not eat sushi, so I thought this would be a good week to go out and enjoy. I know very little about sushi, just that I like to eat sushi. Went on Yelp and looked for a well review place near my house. I chose a place but when I got there the sign on the door said NOT on MONDAY. What to do. Pick a well reviewed place near to where I was. Fresh Wasabi was less than a mile away. 
Decor? I guess typical of most I have been to. Clean friendly people. I was seated as soon as I got there as the place was not super busy. There were about 5 or 6 tables with people enjoying their meal. 
I always have trouble ordering. I am learning but still need help. I asked my waitress what she suggested. I told her I wanted a verity. She suggested a combination of a tuna roll and about 8 other pieces of different kings of sushi. This ended up to be a great suggestion as I really enjoyed the meal. Way to much for one person to eat. (I did eat it all.) I was stuffed. Meal was served with soup and a salad. Both were excellent. My waitress was very attentive and kept my glass full of tea. 
For being friendly, helpful. good food, nice quite relaxing meal? This was the best place I have visited (Lets say Arizona). If I want sushi on Monday this is the place."}
