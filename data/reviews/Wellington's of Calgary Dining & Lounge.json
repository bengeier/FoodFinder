{"text":"Great food, great ambience, always pleasant staff.   Love this place!!  Definitely on the pricey side, but for a special night out you can't beat it!!"}
{"text":"Service was awful and food took forever to come out. Other tables came, ordered, and ate before we got our food. Our 5:30 reservation didn't get our meals until 8pm. Then the bills were all wrong and took an hour to sort out. The food was good when it did eventually come out."}
{"text":"After dining there several times, and being more than impressed, we tried it recently. Or we tried to try it. Upon entering, with a completely empty dining room, we were turned away as they didn't have room. Not one person dining there , but they had no room for two people."}
{"text":"So I chose this place for client entertainment lunch based on the ratings. I was surprised to see how unassuming the shopping center Wellington's is located is. Once inside the restaurant, things looked a lot better.   I ordered a Ceasars salad app,  seafood linguini entree and finished up with a mudpie dessert  (coffee ice cream on a crunchy chocolaty base with whipped cream)  The salad was just OK but the pasta blew me out of the water- it was soooooo good. Just the right touch of al dente with a rich, creamy sauce. My colleague and I both agreed that it far exceeded our expectations. It's hard for me to meet a dessert I don't like so the coffee ice cream mudpie worked too. Service was attentive and left no room for complaints.  I'd definitely love to come back for dinner here sometime and try out their Spanish coffee. I took a star off for the salad but put 2 back for the pasta"}
{"text":"Went to dinner at Wellington's for the first time on Tuesday night, and my boyfriend and I were incredibly impressed. We sat in the dining room as it was quieter than the lounge side. The gentleman that sat us to our table was also our server, and he was so friendly and inviting. We started with the table caesar salad, and it was the best caesar salad we've ever had. The seafood pasta was amazing. Both portions were larger than what we expected. Our waters never went empty, our food was great, and service was awesome. I've had yelp for a while but this restaurant drove me to write my first review! Thank you Wellingtons!!!"}
{"text":"We have been to Wellingtons for many special occasions for many years now. My family used to go over 30 years ago and my husband and I now go for special dinners.   Our most recent visit was for my husband's company Christmas dinner. The service here is impeccable. When they are busy like at Christmas time, they will limit the time that you have, but that is completely understandable and the service does not feel rushed in any way.   We had Derek as our waiter and he was simply amazing. So respectful and makes you feel so special. The food, as always was incredible and did not disappoint.   If you want the \"white glove\" treatment at an old school steakhouse, you simply must try Wellingtons!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time in the lounge,  service, what service.  Went tonight and watched 2 other tables come in after us and get served. If you can't hire professionals don't hire anyone at all.  We just wanted to order a drink and a meal, could not even do that.   The best part is the floor manager watched is walk in and watched us walk out and say nothing,  the server looked at us and said nothing as she served the table right beside us.  I am in the industry and this was bad.  To bad I have had the steak and its good.  I would leave no stars if I could"}
{"text":"I made reservations for two for a night out for my boyfriend's birthday. Upon arriving at Wellington's, we were greeted with friendly faces and promptly brought to our seat after our jackets were taken and hung up for us. The service was excellent, our glasses were never empty and we never had to wait long for anything requested. The best parts of the night were that the grill is open for viewing in the dining area, so you can watch as your food is prepared, and we had table side cherries jubilee flambe for dessert, which was beyond excellent. Everything from the food to the service to the price and atmosphere was better than I could have expected. Definitely 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! The table side caesar salad was amazing, so much garlic!  The main course - the Beef Wellington is to die for. It's delicious, perfectly cooked and the waiters are wonderful. They're attentive, but not annoying and it's generally a very nice atmosphere.   A bit pricey, but 100% worth it!"}
{"text":"For me the best restaurant in Calgary! Really special place with great service and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Wellingtons Restaurant - Napoleon would be Envious  Wellingtons is a culinary delight of fine dining and an inspiring institution in Calgary. It has survived 30 years of boom and bust and bitumen bubbles. Something our provincial leaders are still trying to understand.    This fine restaurant however, still provides a consistent, steady, and unwavering restaurant service, proving that it must be doing something right. I've returned to Calgary after an absence of nearly 20 years, only to discover that it is still around, still offering extraordinary food.   My recent favourites, include the prawns and mushroom starter, smothered in garlic, white wine, butter and parmesan cheese, followed by the beef steak tomato salad, and for my mains, the usually the Steak Dianne. They have a great election of wines and both my wife and I, love the traditional tableside service for the ceasar salad, the chateaubriand, and some of the flamed desserts.  It is a truly wonderful experience being served in this colonial manner, only achievable with experienced waiters. I thought it was amusing that all the servers were mature men with ties and white shirts, and no evidence of young, nubile, short skirted help. And I absolutely loved the service!    If you are a beer and pizza scoffer, or burger, fries and coke person, please go to your local neighbourhood pub, as this place is not for you. This is not a snobbish opinion. I simply would not want you to be disappointed with the way fine food is prepared and the way service should be traditionally offered.   Despite this restaurant being located in the SE boonies (the sticks), miles away from where I live in the NW, I still recommend that you go there, if you want a traditional and extraordinary fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Great service and pretty good food. One star reduction for value since it's keg or cattle baron quality but a few dollars more."}
{"text":"This was the worst \"fine\" dinning experience I've ever had. Wellington's is a pretender. Their idea of fine dining is a façade of waiters dressed in black wainscots, with wooden paneled walls and a coat check. Besides serving us food that wasn't fit for a dog, the service was pathetic. Executive Chef Nick Georgoulis should be ashamed of his kitchen staff and the meal we were served.   For an appetizer, I ordered the French Onion soup. I'm wiling to bet it was Campbell's straight from the can, served with a soggy crouton and stringy, melted cheese.The broth was oily and lacked any real flavor. The only thing that stood out was its saltiness. The onions weren't caramelized nor was the cheese browned. Tim Hortons serves better soup.   The terribly prepared soup set the stage for the rest of the meal. For the main, I ordered the Seafood Linguine. The dish was missing the scallops. Worse yet, the mussels smelled VERY off and some had not opened.   For a $27 Seafood linguine I expect fresh shellfish, not dead mussels, canned clams and previously frozen ingredients. I also expect the pasta to be made in house. That's why I'm paying $27 in a fine dinning restaurant! Canned clams, and dead mussels what were you thinking?   When the waiter came to check on us, I explained the problem. He didn't seem too interested. He offered me another choice and when I declined he said something to the effect of, \"well I tried...\" I believe the proper response would have been to get the manager. Instead, two of us got to sit around and watch the third eat.  Unfortunately the guy playing manager was sprawled out in the lobby chair, talking on the phone. Clearly he was too busy making personal calls than to fulfill his managerial obligations. The hostess was texting on her blackberry. It made me think of three city workers standing around, while one guy holds a sign.  Wellington's fails in all departments: their menu is an uninspired relic from 30 years ago, charging $25 - $65 for entrées that don't deliver, There's no accountability nor quality controls. If the chef or owner cared at all they should be stunningly embarrassed.   As an open review, I'd love for Wellington's to challenge that anything I stated is inaccurate."}
{"text":"The food was good also like the decor pricing was OK will go back soon easy access the selection of beer is fine looks really clean staff needs more training and manager was also nice"}
{"text":"I would like to preface this review by saying that a 5-star rating is something I reserve for a truly exceptional venue/experience. That being said, I can confidently say that this is my favorite restaurant in the city of Calgary and I have enjoyed dining here for well over 15 years.  The restaurant is located on Bonaventure Drive SW, just off Mac Leod Trail South. It is a longtime family favorite and we have enjoyed many birthdays, anniversaries & special celebrations at Wellington's.  On my most recent visit to this restaurant I ordered the escargot appetizer & the lemon dill salmon special as my entree. Both were absolutely DELICIOUS! My entire group enjoyed their meal and, as usual, we had an absolutely wonderful time!   Wellington's offers upscale, fine dining with attention paid to every possible detail. The service is impeccable & the quality of the food is consistently excellent.  I cannot say enough about Wellington's and I recommend it to my friends, family & the Yelp community as one of the very best in Calgary.."}
{"text":"If you're looking for that classic steak house experience--the one grandma and grandpa had each and every anniversary--then look no further.  More than just kitsch though, Wellington's delivers on their particular area of expertise: steak.  It's a place where the servers are still largely male, fitted into vests, and adorned with bowties (of the clip-on variety, I say with a sniff).  The steak chef is on display in a flame-fueled fishbowl of sorts (on our night, the grill chef looked like he was straight out of the pages of a Dickens novel), which really adds character to the dated dining room. If you go (and I suggest you do) two or more of you MUST order the freshly prepared Caesar salad.  Prepared by your server tableside, the dressing is started with anchovies and garlic, oil, egg yolk, dijon mustard, pepper, and liberally whipping with a fork.  You haven't had Caesar salad until you've had it done fresh before your eyes--and don't let the anchovies freak you out!  In fact, check the label of your favourite Caesar dressing; they're likely hiding in there already. While our first trip to Wellington's was for a special occasion (my mother-in-law was visiting) I would go here just for a night out.  If you like, join in singing Happy Birthday to Aunt Ethel, celebrating her Ninetieth, or wait with baited breath for someone to propose--chances are, both will happen during the course of dinner. Reservations recommended--this isn't MacDonald's, fool!"}
{"text":"Went here because The Cattle Baron was busy, we have been before and the food and service were outstanding.   Not this time, we sat in the lounge it was so loud my husband could barely hear me, the service was mediocre at best and the wait staff was incredibly casually dressed for service and it appeared our waitress hated her job. I ordered Beef Wellington and hub ordered the filet, neither were up to previous expectations, won't ever go back, too many other options."}
{"text":"Went there Saturday to celebrate wedding with friends. The food was amazing, the only thing better was the service \"exceptional \" with a great atmosphere. Highly recommend if you want a nice formal sinning experience"}
{"text":"Excellent steak and excellent service. We came with a group of 12 and expected a little slow service accordingly, but we were pleasantly surprised. The steak was extremely good and cooked perfectly. The owner/manager came over to ensure we enjoyed ourselves. We will be back"}
{"text":"I want to give this steakhouse a 4 but I can't. I'd definitely do a solid 3.5 if possible. Really nice staff! I loved that they had a coat check at the front. Our waiter Carlos was awesome. He made a wicked table side Caesar salad.    - ordered a margarita no salt and I figured it would come on the rocks but it came blended and tasted like limeade.  - I got the beef Wellington (when in Rome!). It was good. Steak...perfect! Puff pastry was ok. Could have been cooked a tad longer and more \"puffy\".  - sides BLAND! The stuffed potatoe was dry as a bone. The butter, sour cream, bacon bits, chives helped but it still wasn't amaze.  - came with \"vegetables\" which included 2-3 carrots and bok choy (random).   After we got the cheque the service STOPPED. I wanted more water but literally saw no one.   So...it was pretty good (steak wise). Side wise (no)."}
{"text":"It's good but \"safe\". They say if it's not broken don't fix it, but I feel they could really up their game by branching out a bit.   It's definitely a place the older generations enjoy, but eventually they are going to have to make some changes to their menu. I find I am bored of their food fast. With so many great and inventive restaurants out there, it feels like Wellingtons is starting to lag behind.  Their salads are basically all lettuce/greens. I feel a bit like cattle when eating them, privileged cattle, but cattle nonetheless. I get that its focus is the meat, but a great restaurant knows that all items on their menu are equally important. I think they need to challenge themselves by upping their salad game. They could also try out new sides.  They recently added yam fries to their menu, which is a huge step in the right direction. As time moves forward and the older generation becomes less prevalent they will have to incorporate items like yam fries to their menu to bring in more customers.  Pros: The service is great; on top of things and very friendly. Food is very good and the cooks know what they are doing. Prices are reasonable for the style of the restaurant.  Cons: Food that lacks in zest. Easy to get bored of menu fast. Interior could use a refresh. Overall the place needs a breath of fresh air.  When you are craving a great steak for a reasonable price this is the place to go. If you are older and find yourself missing how restaurants \"used to be\"; you're at the right place. If you want to excite your palate and enjoy flavorful, fresh, food then you will want to bring your patronage elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time here with wifey and must say the dining area felt date in a good way to throw back steak house of yesteryear.   Very professional servers and lighting was on the low side.   Selection is good but description of items lacking on menu I.e like most of my food to have a fuller description instead of generic Cheesecake or Caesar salad.   Presentation of apps to salad to main course was good but not for the price you are paying.   We ordered special seafood appetizer and was not very flavourful. Caesar salad was too sour.   Beef Wellington was amazing. Highly recommend but the sides were average.   Service was excellent with a 9/10.   Overall try Wellington but skip the other items."}
{"text":"My work took me here for my birthday, as it was close to home, and we could have a few wobbly pops!  We sat in the lounge, and they gave us VIP treatment! The lounge is pretty casual, the dining room looks a little pretentious...  The food was actually really good! The salt and pepper prawns are amazing. The steak sandwich and twice-baked potato are yummy. Also comes with a salad.   Service is hit or miss, depending on whose section you sit in, but pretty good night out, and great place to sip on some cocktails and watch the game."}
{"text":"Being from Vancouver, a fellow Canadian city in close proximity to Calgary, I thought to myself - I have Alberta beef all the time. It's not like I'm an American who has to specially ask for Canadian/Calgarian beef. So why make that extra effort for steak in Calgary if it's all the same? Wrong.  Luckily my friend who's only been living in Calgary for a few months already knew of this place and brought me here as my one and only stop for \"Alberta Beef\". And after having mentioning it to a few other Calgarians, they also agreed that's their \"go to\" steak place.  Firstly, a place like this in Vancouver would be in the trendy part of town, which would mean you would pay even more on top of the regular price of steak in order to pay for rent. But instead it's hidden on back side of a non-descript strip mall. And not to judge a book by its cover, as soon as you step in, it's upscale with dark wood with well spaced tables and a few booths. There's also the main steak grill that is jutted out from the kitchen into the dining room and sealed with a full length window so you can watch the grill master at work. Basically it feels like where the Godfather would go for steaks. I think there are places like this in Vancouver but I don't think they're within my budget.  Which brings me to my next point. In Vancouver, in a NON-steak house you'd be paying $30 for a 10+ ounce steak. Then $40+ at an actual steakhouse and that's without sides. Our price for the \"Wellington-Sized\" Prime Rib 15 oz. was $35 with a sufficient amount of sides. The 14 oz Striploin was also around the same price. I believe the price is perhaps 10% higher than say The Keg. But the quality is at least 30% better if not 50% in terms of incredible texture and taste!   Also the size of the steak if ginormous! I mean I've seen a 15 oz before in Vancouver and did not look THAT big. So I would say either they're more generous or Vancouver is too \"accurate\" in their weight calculation.  The service was excellent as well. I mean it's at the level of real steakhouses where we got table-side dressing of our potatoes. Now you don't get that at the Keg!  To sum it up - you pay a 10% premium on The Keg pricing, but you get the quality and service of a real steakhouse like Hy's, Gotham and Morton's (I've only been to Hy's). And best of all, you don't pay the HST so the bill is even cheaper than it would be in BC!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with the family and the first thing I thought was 'These are really comfortable chairs!' Maybe it's because I'm not used to the fine dining experience but damn, those cushions...  I ordered the Beef Wellington and it was incredible. Tenderloin was juicy and lived up to its name. Puff pastry was good but nothing crazy so I don't think it was housemade. I wasn't expecting it to be. The foie gras and mushrooms were very flavorful, and were an awesome complement to the filet. The roasted potatoes that I ordered on the side were surprisingly delicious as well as they were well seasoned and had a nice crisp to them. Vegetables were solid but nothing spectacular as they usually are with any fine dining restaurants.  One member of the family thought the prime rib she had was exceptionally tender. Another had the veal which he thought was good, but nothing special.  Just an excellent execution on the food. I actually ordered a medium-rare filet and thought it came out slightly closer to medium but the food was so good that I was able to bypass that very minor mistake. Price was comparable to most fine dining places in Calgary ($30-$40). I couldn't decide between 4 and 5 stars as I really felt it should be a 4.5. But damn, those cushions..."}
{"text":"Oh Wellington's. (See the pun in that?) Had it not been for one of my dining mates storming off in a huff due to bing told very rudely to take off his ball cap by the blonde woman with the terrible hair I would've given them 5 stars. (Was that a run on sentence? I apologize for that.) We had no idea ball caps were not allowed in their \"fine\" dining section. Had she asked him nicely he would've obliged. But she so blatently told him, \"you can't wear your ball cap in here!\" Oh well...that lady needs a lesson in how to treat dining patrons. We don't know your restaurant rules. Perhaps it is dining etiquette, but we didn't get the memo.   From my own perspective I found the staff to be very pleasant with regards to such a large party for our table of 20 guests. On my end of the table we ordered the rack of lamb, beef Wellington, escargot, raw oysters, and calamari. I can tell you that each and every dish was executed to near perfection. It is very difficult to do such a thing for 20 guests at the same time. My lamb was ordered medium rare and came out as such. The side vegetables and roasted potatoes were perfection. I rarely eat all my veggies, but in this instance I did. The sauce drizzled upon my plate was the perfect amount of savoury. The beef Wellington was very good. I had a bite of it, though I didn't care much for a baked pastry surrounding steak. It was good nonetheless. The oysters were excellent. (Although, how difficult is it to prepare something uncooked?) The calamari was made so well alongside the tzatziki sauce. Yum!! I think the highlight of my dinner was the escargot. They did the butter sauce so right with the right seasoning. It wasn't salty nor bland. Perfection!!  I seriously cannot wait to go back for dinner again. I really enjoyed everything from the service, the food, and to the ambience!"}
{"text":"One of the best  Caesar salad in Calgary!  Steak is tasty as well!  Every time I went back to Calgary, this is the restaurant I would always on my list."}
{"text":"Super .... Been here a half dozen times or more, always great !!! Should be coming here more often than we do. Steaks service all of it always great"}
