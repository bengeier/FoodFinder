{"text":"Happened to be in town for a wedding and decided to try the Royal Vine for a drink and some light fare.  I have found that wine bars are usually either too pretentious or pedestrian.  The Royal Vine in neither, striking a perfect balance with a warm welcoming atmosphere, a wonderful mix of uncommon, delicious wines, and an appropriate selection on light plates all at reasonable prices. My wife and I ended up spending several hours there, sampling a number of excellent wines and discussing wine and food with the owners.  If you like wine, or are starting to learn more about wine, this is the place to go for a quiet evening out.   The warm and relaxed atmosphere is a great place for date night.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"After going to the wine bar at least once a month for over 3 years, we were sad to see that it has closed indefinitely according to the sign in the window."}
{"text":"This is THE place to go when you want fancy food and drink and can barely get out of your PJ's.  The wine selection is large, the mixed drinks larger (and stronger), and the food is all fancy-schmancy and really delicious.  It's got an intimate atmosphere and zero snobbishness.    Try the apple, blue cheese, and walnut pizza.  Or any of the combo trays.  Or the brie.  Mmmm."}
{"text":"It's my favorite local wine bar!  They have wine on tap!  A great selection, knowledgeable staff, a nice patio, efficient service, and a great liquor & wine store next door.  It's a great date location with cozy couches and chairs and occasionally they have live music as well!"}
{"text":"I live very close to this place (walking distance) and visit this wine bar frequently. The problem is that the service is terrible-- very slow staff that seems more interested in chatting then being efficient. The menu has a good wine selection but the food menu is a bit overpriced for the inconsistency in quality that they offer."}
{"text":"First time visiting the place and very impressed. We definitely went at the right time. It seemed that for the new year (Jan.) they were running all kinds of specials. We got $10 off our bottle of wine and a free cheese, crackers and fruit plate. I loved sitting on the couch rather than a hard wood-back chair that you often find in bars/restaurants. The lighting was dim and there was relaxing jazz music being played. The bar maid/server was very helpful and attentive without being bothersome. There were a variety of people there... from a family... to a couple... to a single person. It felt classy and intimate while at the same time casual and relaxed. Don't know how they pulled that off but it just feels comfortable no matter what you are looking for. The only thing that would have made it better imo is live music and a fireplace."}
{"text":"Royal Vines is my favorite wine bar.  The list is ever-changing, bringing in fabulous new varietals regularly. The ambiance is lovely- perfect for a date, a night out with friends or a special occasion.  The food is also very good.  We usually split some appetizers, but ALWAYS get the baked brie.  I also love that you can create your own flight.  Last time I was in, we got $2.50 off a glass of wine with a food purchase!    Carolyn has a great review, but don't let her PJ's comment fool you... while Royal Vines is not high-falootin (did I just say high-falootin?), please do not wear your jammies. It is a classy place. If you want to wear your pajamas, go across the street to the townie bar."}
{"text":"What a cozy little spot hidden away in North Royalton.   They actually offer wine flights, which I've been trying to enjoy more lately.  I'm trying to figure out different style of wine I may like and flights are a perfect way to do that.  Their flights were reasonable priced between $9-13. While they may not be offering super rare finds or 200 bottles, they have a nice atmosphere, great service and good prices.  What else do you need for a good night out?"}
{"text":"What a cute little wine bar in the 'burbs of Cleveland! While visiting a good friend of mine in Cleveland, we spent our Friday evening enjoying a few glasses of wine. The ambiance is great, the service exceeded expectations (even splitting the tab for us), and the wine selection and prices were exactly what you'd expect from a great wine bar.  AND - they had wine on TAP!! That was the coolest thing I've seen!"}
