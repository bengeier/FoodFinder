{"text":"The Nile Cafe is very, very small. 

Very. 

I mean, really, the place is teeny-tiny...but it doesn't matter much. It's also usually empty. 

When I first started working downtown, I didn't know where anything was. I had no idea where to head for lunch, with the exception of the Jack in the Box across the street from my building...and that was just not going to do. Driving around on 7th St., one of the first beacons of possible culinary delight winked at me from the corner of Roosevelt - The Nile Cafe. I love Mediterranean cuisine, so I made time to stop. 

I've actually visited the Nile Cafe several times, and the experiences are always so different from one another. The food is consistently okay, with two marked exceptions - the delicious artichoke hummus, and the absolutely terrible falafel. 

The service is where the big gap resides. There is one man who works there, (I perceive him as being the owner, although I have no actual reason to think this), who is very kind and courteous. He is patient, attentive, and soft-spoken but also friendly. Everyone else who works there is disinterested to the point of rudeness. Blank stares, no verbal acknowledgement...it is very uncomfortable to dine in, and, honestly, a little uncomfortable to order out. 

I go back occasionally to fulfill my desire for artichoke hummus. Other places make this, but none are as full of chunky goodness as their variety. Some of their soups are tasty, and almost everything else on the menu is typical Mediterranean fare - not bad, not great, and capable of hitting the spot if you're in the right mood. The falafel is baked, not fried - being moderately health conscious, I thought I would enjoy this change in preparation. I didn't. Falafel just needs to crunch, man!

If you're going to try the Nile Cafe, order out. It is so rarely busy -  you can be in and out in less than 15 minutes, unless you neglect to fill up your meter's belly and your car gets towed."}
{"text":"I was super excited about going to the Nile Caf√© after reading all my fellow Yelpers reviews.  Result: HUGE Disappointment
I am not even sure where to begin...

I went there with a few co-workers (one coming from a very Greek family) for a Thursday lunch.

Red Flag #1 - No one in this place at 12:15
Red Flag #2 - They had NO background music other than the clinks and clanks coming from the kitchen.
Red Flag #3 - When asked the waiter what their known for he went on to tell us that their Gyro is great and mis-quoted what was in it.  Last I checked there is NO chicken in Gyro's.
Red Flag #4 - The hummus that everyone is raving about I could probably make at home and it got served with stale pita chips
Red Flag #5 - Our Gyro's and Chicken Schwarma's came wrapped in Tin foil and served in a plastic red basket.
Red Flag $6 - Surprise surprise the Gyro meat was really dried out.
Final Red Flag - They received a supply/food delivery that came out of a Blank Range Rover and they just walked it right through the main dining room. No delivery truck or backdoor.

Is zero stars an option???"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!
My girlfriend and I went here for the first time this afternoon for lunch.  They gave us a small sample platter of four different types of humus and toasted pitas on the house.   They were all good, but the artichoke was our favorite.   We both ordered the Gyro with a side salad for our meal.  We came a little late so we were the only people there.  Service was very quick.  Both the salad and the Gyro were fantastic!  The gyro is probably one of the best I've ever had!  The meat was VERY tender and had an amazing flavor... seasoned perfectly!
We will definitely be back for more!! We even ordered a large order of the humus to go."}
{"text":"I tried going to this place 3 times before I found it open.  Then I found out that it changed owners and now has regular hours. 

I only had the falafel and they were super delicious.  They bake them instead of fry them!!  So I'll definitely be back for more!

Also, David, the owner is super nice and has the most gorgeous eyes....."}
{"text":"I loved it. Homemade hummus that kills me it's so good and perfectly spiced chicken breast. Excellent and affordable."}
{"text":"When I saw the Nile cafe, I got a little giddy because I always imagined an adorable little cafe in one of those precious live/work units lining Roosevelt. (Tammie Coe doesn't count. No sitting room inside!)  

I stopped in for lunch today. Now, take this review with a grain of salt because I a) only ordered one thing and b) I got it to-go. 

There are 4 or 5 tables in the dining area, with not much breathing room in between. The server/cashier seemed tired and wasn't too friendly. He seemed annoyed that I asked for a take-out order. 

The menu is really limited, and strange. Not offering a traditional sampler plate with goodies like hummus, dolmas, and falafel gets them an immediate thumbs down.

I got the chicken shawarma sandwich. At $7.95, I expected it to be a little more substantial. It was all chicken, and the chicken was pretty dry.  There was quite a bit of nasty yellow lettuce that got picked off, but there were pickles and maybe a few tomato chunks in there somewhere. I think I tasted one. The pita bread was a little rubbery- like it was warmed in the microwave. No bueno. 

I know, I know, I shouldn't be whining about a chicken sandwich having too much chicken. Balance is important though, and this sandwich had nowhere near enough complementary flavors to make it a winner. 

Sub par sandwich aside, I will give the Nile cafe another try and edit accordingly. I don't feel like I gave it a fair shake with a sandwich to go."}
{"text":"Imagine my delight when I saw that the Nile is now open for breakfast! I am a huge fan of the hummus, lentil soup and spanakopita here, so I was excited to try out breakfast. I couldn't be more pleased :-) I am mostly vegan so when I asked whether they could prepare grilled veggies, potatoes and toast for breakfast, they didn't hesitate to accommodate. I was also very happy to learn that they will be rolling out a gluten free and vegan menu, score! I will certainly be back...and did I mention that the delicious hummus is now available at AJs?? Can't wait to tell all of my friends!"}
{"text":"My wife was craving some middle eastern food. This fits the bill, very authentic and very tasty."}
{"text":"Ate at the Nile Cafe last night. It's a medium sized restaurant in a strip mall. Sparse decor with a couple of TVs. VERY family friendly, as the proprietor had his kid there. 

The best part about the place was the kind, attentive service. Our pretty waitress and the owner both thanked us a couple of times for stopping in. They just seemed really grateful.

As other reviewers noted, the small sampler plate of hummus was a nice free starter. I had the salad with my dinner. It was a basic plate of lettuce (with a decent dressing). I recommend the lentil soup, instead.

I had the gyro schwarama, which came with a generous portion of rice. It was enough to have left overs for lunch today, but it was all a bit greasy (though, in their defense, greek is almost always a bit greasy). Tender, flavorful meat.

The highligh of the meal was the caring servers."}
{"text":"What a disapppointment.  I really can't think of anything posistive to say.  My gf and I arrived at roughly 1:00 and there was no one else in the restaurant, guess this should have been a clue.  Upon sitting down we we handed a menu from one of the most disinterested waitressess I have experienced.  The young woman had pretty no interest in taking our order or answering questions which was probably because she did not know the answer.  We asked about one of the deserts and she had to go in the back to ask.  As it turns out it did not matter what the answer was, the desert was not available.  

The menu selection was on the small side which is not a bad thing if the quality is outstanding.  Sadly, outstanding is not a word to describe any portion of our lunch.  My gf and I split a few items on the menu.  We had the Taboule Salad, Lentil Soup and a side of fries with feta cheese and a vinegar sauce.  

The lentil soup was almost passable, but it had a certain blandness.  When the taboule was brought to the table the chef, maybe owner, gave a disclaimer \"hope you like it really sour\".  Turns out it was inedible and we returned it. The fries with feta and vinegar sauce had such potential for a junk food moment, the feta was yummy and the vinegar sauce was good, but they served all the yummy stuff on frozen crinkle cut fries, how sad.  

After returning the taboule we were still billed for it and had to ask not to be charged for it.  The chef maybe owner guy unhappily did so.  The one upside is that I had lunch with wonderful company who would make eating worms fun."}
{"text":"Hubby wanted to try The Nile Cafe on this past First Friday. It's within walking distance of our home, and by the time we got there, we were not the only ones interested. We got a table pretty quickly anyway in this TINY restaurant (4 cramped tables where people have to move the tables and chairs just to let people through). The menu is appropriately limited. We got a hummus sample plate shortly after we sat down. The regular hummus was overly garlicky and lemony for our taste, the artichoke hummus was zippy, but I can't imagine eating a lot of it, the cilantro jalapeno was quite tasty according to Hubby, but too hot for him to eat much of, and he liked the red pepper hummus best (as did the people at the next table). 

I ordered the spinach pie which had been described as 2 filo-wrapped spinach and feta appetizers. What I got was spinach and onions wrapped in a doughy triangle- clearly not filo, with no feta, and only one of them- which was fine, because I sent back the single monstrosity. Hubby had Howashi which was spiced ground beef in a sealed triangular sandwich- it was just ok. The true standout was the falafel. I once spent a summer at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, taking a Modern Standard Arabic class. We were strongly encouraged to practice our Arabic at a local diner which has since set the falafel standard for me. The Nile Cafe, at last, rivals those. They are crispy on the outside and almost creamy on the inside- not the least bit dry (which is a common problem)- and the accompanying tahini was also very delicious. 

The falafel is the ONLY reason I am giving The Nile 3 stars.  The overwhelmed waiter/cashier/busser had to take our order twice, but did not ask us to pay for the spinach-thing or our drinks in the end. I hope they can get past the new restaurant snafus. We could use a Mediterranean restaurant in the 'hood."}
{"text":"The owner is very nice and friendly. The food is fresh and flaverful. FYI: The owners wife makes the best salad dressing."}
{"text":"In todays tight economy I really hate to speak ill  of a restaurant unless they deserve it this place does not... really.... BUT I was the only patron in the restaurant and had to get my own salt and pepper and i sat without a water refill as i ate my dinner untill i was almost finnished on the high note the baba ganoush was fair  at a  decent price  the salad was quite good fresh and crisp and the kafta kabob was dry should have had some tazeki with it to help moisten the meat . the lady/waitperson/maybe owner was nice enough but not overly intrested in making sure I had what i needed as I ate my dinner 3 stars is kinda pushin it .......the real question is would i go back?????   we'll see they did have some lunch specials 11am 3pm"}
{"text":"The Roosevelt location of Nile is closed and cleaned out, as I discovered during a wasted lunch hour about a month ago.  I posted this fact to yelp, but it hasn't been confirmed yet.

I love Mediterranean food.  I wish Nile Cafe were still there.  But it isn't."}
{"text":"The Nile Cafe is AMAZING !!! One day I visited the Desert Botanical Garden and found myself famished. i was looking for something fresh, healthy and vegetarian. I Found this little gem of a place. IT was very quiet, only a few tables occupied. I ordered the hummus (3 different flavors) and the veggie roll. I took a couple bites and knew this was the freshest ingredients! 
I came back a couple more times and decided to have my birthday party here and honestly it was the best party I can remember. The Chef Souzan is Egyptian and I consider her the \"Babette of the Middle East\" (from the movie Babettes Feast). They are closed on Sundays but she opened just for my party of 30 guests. Souzan arranged everything, the most amazing belly dancer, the hookah pipe man who carried in 5 of the cadillac of hookah pipes. The food was fresh as ever. Hummus made from fresh beans. nothing canned here. This little unassuming place came alive at night ! Too bad her place downtown phoenix is no longer, but it's worth the drive to Scottsdale!! Oh all the food is Kosher, and the lamb seriously is succulent!!"}
{"text":"Love the place. The shawarma is great and the people are very friendly. It's quick, very reasonably priced, and good food. Not sure what the reviewer Dan M. was looking for in this place, but for a solid lunch for under $8 in less than a half hour: the Nile is a great addition to the lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I loved it
It was rather American-ized
But I thought it was delicious

I loved the Kingdom kebab
It was chicken and steak schwarma

We had cheese pies

The hummus sampler

And I thought everything was damn good.  Hooray!"}
{"text":"This small mom and pop shop has homemade hummus that is so good. Try their hummus platter which comes with garlic lemon, roasted red pepper, jalepeno  and artichoke hummus! 
If you're not into hummus they have a very tasty howashi sandwich!"}
{"text":"After calling to check that this restaraunt does deliver (which they do as long as your order is at least $30) we decided to give them a try.  We are big fans of greek food and the traditional fare with the kabob flair looked to be pretty enticing.  Honestly, I was not expecting this place to blow me away.  The portions were small compared to other restaraunts and this is the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars.  For a dinner that I would have rather paid $35 for, I paid almost $50, but I have to admit, the food was totally worth it.  We ordered the hummus trio with extra pita bread and the kabob dinner for 2.  I have been to quite a few Greek restaraunts in my time and none of them have left me saying Wow.  I'm still tasting the yummy spices.  The meats were flavorful, the rice was delicious, the hummus was fresh and each had it's own unique flavor and even the vegetables were delectable.  I don't know what spices they are using, but it was amazing.  Even the dinner salad that came with the meal was fresh and tasty.  I most defintiely will be dining here again soon, whenever I get the yen for a tasty meat and rice dish served up with some hot pita bread and I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"What's with restaurants not opening until after 5 pm?  What if I'm hungry at 4?  After Plan A failed, we wound up here.  For Plan B, it was quite enjoyable.  The cafe is relatively small, maybe a dozen tables at best, decor is simple, and staff is friendly.

Since we had never been, we decided to opt for the sampler platter.  We were soon presented with a sampling of several hummuses or hummi, you pick.  All were not as thick as I'm used to.  Not that it was bad, just different.  I thought the original and artichoke were a little heavy on the lemon, but if you like tangy stuff, you'll love it.  I really enjoyed the roasted red pepper and jalapeno varieties.  There was also another dip, I think it was the babaganush, charbroiled eggplant puree, which was quite good as well.  I wasn't impressed with the pita bread.  Just tasted like something you could pick up at Fry's, but they were generous with it. 

The rest of the sampler included falafel (ground fava beans-it reminded me of a hushpuppy, I know, I'm an idiot, but it did), dolmades (stuffed grape leaves), kibah (meatballs), and spinach and cheese pie.  Everything was tasty, but I wasn't blown away by it.  As a disclaimer, I will say I have never had some of these items so maybe I was expecting something more.  I did really really love the spinach & cheese pies though.  We ended with baklava.  I enjoyed the flavor, but was disappointed that the fillo was so chewy and could not be cut through easily.

They also have a small selection of beer and wine at reasonable prices.  Beers run around $3 and wine was $6 I believe.

Definitely worth a shot if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"What a find!

Great food, wonderful server... an all around great time!

Started out with Caramel Hazelnut coffee... yum

The hummus was wonderful and the lettuce wraps are a \"don't miss\" item!

I had the Jerk chicken sandwich.  The flavor was fantastic, but the bread was too large for the chicken breast.  The chili sauce and pineapple flavor to the sandwich made for a thoroughly enjoyable experience.

My girl had the Seafood chowder soup (loved it) and the eggplant (she said it was OK, but nothing to write home about)

The five stars are for the food and service as well as the decor and cleanliness!"}
{"text":"I got a deal on LivingSocial about this place. I had passed by it many times but never knew it was there. I got the Mississippi Fish & Grits. It was delicious. I know my fried catfish and this was up there with some of the best I've had. Ideal brunch fare for sure. Huge portions. I'll probably be back before the end of the week!"}
{"text":"Whoever opened this place needs a reality check.  Although they've apparently redecorated, the food is crap, the server is crap, the vibe is crap.  

My boyfriend bought a Groupon here, which I still have no idea why.  We live close by, but nothing about it screams 'try me'.  We went for breakfast, and there was only one dude working behind the bar.  He clearly was serving his friends, and the banter and refills were much more important than the customers.  We walked in, and another older couple walked in right after.  We were the only people in the place, yet the server moved at the pace of a snail.  It took a solid 10 minutes for us to get waters, but his friends were having plenty of attention with mimosa refills.  We really enjoyed their awfully loud night out recap.  

I ordered the french toast and my boyfriend ordered the catfish & grits.  Both of our plates were just ok.  My boyfriend said the fish was good, but everything else pretty much sucked.  They were 'out of' many items and their credit card machine was not working.  Good thing our Groupon (that the server didn't even check) covered the bill.  

Do yourself a favor and don't try this place."}
{"text":"Delicious! great service! We had a business lunch there, just 4 of us but it was a treat. The Kingdom Kabab Was very good, I had the Gyro very tasty. yes it was $6.99 a meal but it's not Mc D's It's fresh all made there, Clean restroom and clean kitchen, worth a little more for a special lunch. with exceptional service."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 4 stars simply because they have koshari!  I haven't seen koshari since I was in Egypt and this was nearly as good...I asked for it spicy and it was but not as spicy as the stuff in Egypt...otherwise delicious!"}
{"text":"After two hours of suffering in the YMCA half-marathon this weekend, my wife and I were driving back home and noticed The Nile Cafe. Well, to be fair, we noticed that there was a sign for a new coffee shop called Rev right next to the Quizno's. We got out of our car and noticed that Rev is still a shell with nothing in it, and we walked to the other side of the buildings and happened across Nile.

This place is so new it was tough to tell it was open. Nothing in the way of decoration, but so what? I don't eat paintings!

We just grabbed a large container of their Cilantro-Jalapeno hummus ($5.75)  and some pita bread and took it home. Let me tell ya, it's got some kick! It's definitely my favorite hummus, and I will try putting this even on things hummus doesn't belong on! 

I had to knock a couple stars off for the store-bought pitas. The Nile Cafe is gonna have to do better on the pitas to compete. But I still plan on rounding up some work friends and trying these guys for lunch. Schwarma, falafel, howashi and tabouli all sound good to me! The chicken curry soup sounds tasty, too.

I'll update this after my first real meal there. But go get some hummus. Seriously."}
{"text":"For my birthday lunch, a good friend of mine suggested we try the Nile Cafe along Roosevelt. This place is near then east end of the First Friday Art Walk and thus has likely received excellent exposure due to it's placement. Although we had a late lunch (1 pm) there was no one eating. Which is usually not a good sign. But we were already there and it's neighbor Krispy Kreme and Quiznos is no substitute for a locally owner restaurant.

The menu was small, printed on yellow piece of letter sized paper in half. The options weren't exhaustive but that is not indicative of the quality of the food. We ordered the sun dried tomato hummus to share. Our waiter did not ask what size we wanted and likely made a presumption for us. Bad. All of their hummus has a disclaimer in parenthesis 'if available', save their regular hummus. I am not really sure how jalapeno and cilantro hummus can be seasonal in Arizona. Perhaps they make fresh batches every day and serve it until the run out. 

My friend got an iced tea and got water (non-bottled). Out server was attentive without hovering. The water was despicable. I do not think they use any filtration system. It tasted of an amalgamation of many unpleasant flavors. It was almost undrinkable. 

I ordered the chicken meatball sandwich and my friend got the beef schwarma. The waiter informed me that it was no longer on the menu and unavailable. I find it hard to believe that printing a new set of papers and folding them thus omitting this menu item is so difficult. So I got the kingdom schwarma instead. Both of ours came with several dill pickles embedded inside. Perhaps I do not know 'Nile' food, but I sincerely doubt that brine and cucumbers are staples in this cuisine. 

Overall the scwarma was decent and the hummus was unremarkable. I am not sure if their attempts at food warrant a return visit. It is not novel. It is not memorable save the bad water."}
{"text":"Appetizer: Hummus with Pita- ooh, the hummus was thin (not thick like a lot others around town) and so delicious! Perfectly tangy with the lemon and a perfect start for the meal! 

Main Meal: Split the falafel and the beef schwarma. I liked the falafel better but both were good. The falafel was really really good. Full of flavor and the perfect texture and consistency. 

The Nile Cafe is small (3, 4 tops and 2,  2 tops inside, a couple small tables outside on the front walkway). Great for a quick lunch to get in and get out. The staff was nice, seemed like a lot of employees for such a small place but it was kinda funny to see how many different people walked out from the back. 

I am so glad I tried this place out-- I will be returning!"}
