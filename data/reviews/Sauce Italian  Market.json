{"text":"great place for coffee and pastries, have not tried the food in the restaurant but will be doing that soon enough. breakfast sammies are sooo good. the naughty counter also has lovely cannolis, macàrons and other things sinful. all in all top notch! I'll be here everyday for the next 3 weeks"}
{"text":"Just recently learned about this place.   Great Service  and lovely fresh food.  I had the Turkey panini  and Mexican bean and corn salad combo.   It was delicious and nutritious and brought to my table.   I had a coffee to go along with my lunch.  It took all my willpower to walk away from the great Italian dessert section and other \"goodies\".  At the coffee bar   If one just wanted a coffee an snack. Stop by.  If you want a great lunch. Stop by.  The only reason I did not give Sauce 5?stars is because I have not tried the dining room that was at the back and a big surprise.   It looks wonderful so I will stop by sometime for s great dinner."}
{"text":"Haven't been in for awhile.  I had a delicious ravioli pomodoro today.  I was sad that the salted caramel tart was no longer on the dessert menu, but luckily, it's still sold in the market.  So one of the staff members carried one into the restaurant on a plate for me.  

I have to say, for the delicious tastes you get here, the prices are very reasonable.  The atmosphere is positive, and the staff have always been awesome.

This is definitely one of my \"places.\""}
{"text":"The service and food is to die for. Our server Ethan was simply fantastic. The owner Jenna really contributed to the experience. I'm pretty picky with Italian food, and swore I'd never eat it in Calgary. But, this place changed my mind. A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for lunch/brunch, very reasonable prices for their pasta dishes (10$), not to mention absolutely delicious!  I always stop by the attached market and grab some cannolis for desert :)"}
{"text":"Went here for a GF's stagette dinner (12 girls in tow) and Sauce did a great job taking care of our group. There were also other big parties there and not once did we feel we were being neglected.

Sangrias were on special so a few of us got some. Not sure if they had different bartenders making the drinks but not one of the sangrias tasted the same - which was a shame since I thought mine was delish while the others ranged from being too sour or too sweet.

For my entree, I went with the Prawn Pesto Linguine and it sooooo good! The pesto lightly coated the noodles and the crumbled cheese and micro greens were a perfect touch.

One of the girls was \"baconed out\" (is that even a thing?!), but it worked in my favor as she passed me the candied pancetta from her Caesar salad. 

Best.Dessert.Ever. Lol
Perfect savoury & sweet combo and the crispy crunch of the pancetta was the perfect end note to my meal.

Oh! The ladies bathroom is so gorgeous!  They had a huge wall mirror that you know we took advantage of to take group selfies :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend had lunch here and we were very impressed. The service was wonderful, the atmosphere was great and the food was AMAZING. The pasta was cooked to perfection and the burger was one of the best I've ever had. Everything was drenched in garlic and truffle oil and all made from scratch. Also amazing soup. The best part though was that the prices were a fair bit lower than we would have expected for a restaurant of this quality. It's definitely going to be our new date spot and it's right around the corner :D"}
{"text":"Ehrmagerd. So good. Amazing. Food like you've never had before. True authentic Italian cuisine at a very reasonable price. A MUST do in Calgary. The food is so fresh, it must be sourced locally. I had the carbonara with 2 meatballs and my partner had The primavera. We were in ecstasy the entire meal. We started with the mussels, which were amazing. I recommend getting the bread to sop up the natural juices of the mussel dish."}
{"text":"I would rate this only mediocre.  Pasta was not exceptional, portion was small and service was only so so.  Prices are high for what you get.  Glad I tried it,  but there are definitely better Italian eateries to choose."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner.  3 of us had different pizzas and we all agreed the toppings were unique and tasty but the crust was awful.  It reminded us of over-baked Bobali crusts you can buy at the supermarket.  There was nothing thin, chewy or crispy about it.  It can best be described as thick cardboard.  The spaghetti and meatballs was quite good.  The space itself is very nice but really noisy.  So noisy it was hard to have a conversation.  The best part of the evening was the cannoli we got  from the market on the way out.  Now that was D-lish!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Sauce with my family for $10 Pasta Night. 
My husband ordered Chicken Parmesan ,I had the Linguini Boscaiola \"Mushroom Lover, my son had the Lasagna and my daughter ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs from the kids menu. 

The chicken Parmesan was mediocre, lacking sauce on the pasta and the pasta was very bland. Sauce seemed to have some spice to it but the flavour wasn't great. 
My dish was very disappointing, first of all the pasta is tasteless, the mushroom had no flavour at all. I could not taste Parmesan, truffle oil or the garlic was.  The only flavour was a mild olive oil. I spoke to the server that I thought it was bland. He asked if I would like more sauce, I said yes. When he returned the dish now had arugula on top(it didn't come with it before) I could definitely smell the truffle oil.  Yet after tasting, it just tastes oily. I added salt which helped a bit, gave it a chance but couldn't finish. The best part was the arugula they added after I sent it back. 
My son enjoyed his lasagna, the sauce was the only sauce in all our dishes that had some flavour, although the portion was quite small. 
My daughter ate some of the spaghetti, the sauce had a spiciness to it, which isn't the best for young kids. The meal came with half a large meatball. 
Overall a disappointing supper, we will not return.  
They are almost there with the menu,  I would suggest salting the pasta and revamping the sauces. If you are going to have simple dishes those two ingredients should be amazing. The waiter was nice and efficient, food was definitely the bad in this experience."}
{"text":"We came on Sunday for $12 pasta night. Our waiter was stellar! I had a hard time picking my pasta dish so he offered something off the menu that AMAAAAZINGGG!! 

From the pasta dishes we've ordered my group and I agreed that if we rank them from absolute best to great: 
1. chicken and artichoke gnocchi- off the menu
2. clam linguini diablo
3. cheese ravioli pomodoro 
4. sausage and pepper penne.  

I've been here a few other times and the food here is delicious! I will continue to come back. 

On a side note, the washroom here is stunning! I call reading an article that they have one of the nicest washroom in Calgary"}
{"text":"The pasta! Oh the pasta.  I came here after my little guy said he wouldn't mind some spaghetti and meatballs, so we came here since we were in the area.  I didn't have a reservation and didn't think I need one since it was after lunch, but they were still quite busy! Luckily they were able to seat us and we enjoyed some pretty delicious pastas! I went for the linguine carbonara with the sautéed chicken add-on while my son had the kids spaghetti and meatball.  Pasta was cooked al dente and the flavor was spot on.  Portion was a tad small but I didn't order any appetizers or dessert, and for $12 it was great value! 

I can't wait to come back and try more of their pastas... and pizzas!"}
{"text":"I recently ordered a cake and 16 cannolis for a party. Everyone raved about both desserts. The cake looked simple but the quality was outstanding. Rich chocolate cake with mascarpone whip cream and skor bits. Way way better than Glamorgan and about the same price too! The cannoli is seriously the best - my guests were taking second and third servings because that's how good it was. I highly recommend Sauce for all my future dessert orders."}
{"text":"I tried Sauce for the first time on a quiet lunch hour between Christmas and New Years. I'm generally not big on going out for pasta since I can cook it easily enough at home, but I had an interest in trying this place since it was new and easy to get to. 

My husband and I shared the bruschetta to start with the hot sicilian spaghetti and remo pizza for our main. 

The bruschetta was good, as expected. The pasta was nicely cooked the the pizza dough had a good chew. All toppings were acceptable, but nothing was noteworthy. 

With only a single pop for a beverage, our bill was still over $40 before tip. I understand Sauce has specials throughout the week including $10 pasta and BOGO pizza. Given the mediocre acceptableness of the food, I think the regular prices are a little high. 

I probably won't go out of my way to visit again, but if you are in the area, it's a fine place to visit for some Italian."}
{"text":"Lunch is great and enjoyable. Dinner is expensive and very NOISY. Deli makes a turtle look like it's in a hurry"}
{"text":"Confession:  I live really close to Sauce so I'm here a couple times a week.  I struggled with the review because Sauce is so many things in one: it's a cafe, market, deli and restaurant.  In terms of the coffee, it's pretty good.  I usually get a French roast but for naughty days, I get a tiramisu latte, which is quite nice (very sweet!).  There's also things like muffins, cookies, scones, lots of different kinds of cannolis, macarons and cakes in the display.  I'm not a fan of the muffins, but the cakes are quite good.  The market area has different pastas, sauces, coffees, teas, salts and snacks and are all reasonably priced.  There's also fresh bread available daily for $2.50 each and there are lots of different types of bread available each day.  The deli has soups, sandwiches/paninis, salads, meats, cheeses, pasta sauce and fresh pizza dough.  The paninis are very good.  The restaurant is pretty decent and has specials everyday, including $10 pasta nights on Sunday and Monday (dine-in only) and BOGO free pizza on Tuesdays (take-out only).  Those are the only specials I've tried and the pastas are good as are the pizzas.  The restaurant is very kid-friendly and is usually packed for pasta nights so reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"I gave Sauce a second try today for their panini and salad combo. Two items of note... My panini was advertised as chicken, brie, and roasted apple. However, their \"apples\" were actually a smattering of roasted mushrooms. Not entirely gross, but not what I was expecting. The second issue for me was the seeming blandness of the roasted sweet potato salad. Ingredients were nice and fresh and dressing amount was appropriate (not too heavy) but methinks they need to bump up the flavour components of the dressing to give enough of a flavour punch. On my first visit, I had their Waldorf Salad and observations were identical; nicely dressed, fresh, but a touch on the bland side."}
{"text":"I was invited here for lunch and excited to try it out.   I liked the atmosphere.  There is an open area and a restaurant.  I tried the open area and ordered from the restaurant.  I enjoyed the two friendly wait staff I spoke with.

Ordered mushroom soup and the spinach chicken/apple salad with blue cheese.  The apples were missing from the salad but the the host at the cash helped me out very pleasantly.   The mushroom soup came in a large portion but wasn't too flavourful.   The biggest turn off was a rather deep pool of oil that separated and stayed on top of the soup.   Tried to mix it but it may have either needed less oil or to be blended before serving.

I ordered a coffee while waiting for my meal.   The male barista with tattoos didn't make it and I had to ask the female barista a second time 3 minutes later.  The male barista was annoyed and decided my name was buddy... 

Overall I think this place has potential.  Looked like they have a good variety of cheese and cannoli.  For a very authentic Italian cafe like experience, I prefer Lina's Italian Grocery."}
{"text":"An oasis of value and yumminess in a sea of overpriced mediocrity. The menu is extensive and quite creative. I appreciate so much the generous fresh handful of dressed, mixed sprouts on the plate with the appetizers. The cappuccinos are like clouds of perfection. I love the décor and mix of seating options. So happy so close to home. Always seems busy and specials most nights of the week so service can be stretched at times (but servers are excellent). Peroni on tap too! The coffee bar has amazing and well-priced treats. Haven't tried the deli yet. Please come here and experience for yourself this wonderful place so they will be around for a long time. Grazie, baci and ciao for now."}
{"text":"I found it a little hard to find parking as there is no designated parking for this place. I had to go around the building twice until I finally found a spot in the street, luckily it was after 6 because it was limited parking time before that.
Food was pricey so the 4 of us went for the $12 for a 6\" personal pizza deal; one of them said it tasted really good but I didn't find it that great. Service was decent but not spectacular.
The restaurant itself has a nice decor, good lighting and inviting to enjoy a nice time.
Overall it wasn't a great experience so I'll go to a different Italian restaurant next time."}
{"text":"Super cute Italian place. We came in to go to the market side but I cant wait to try more of the food, the cookies we grabbed were DELISH!!!! the shop is small but so so cute, the café looks AMAZING and the restaurant smells devine... and the bathroom is GORGEOUS!!!!!!! seriously stunning.
the cake prices seem very reasonable, and so I cant wait to go back and grab some."}
{"text":"Go check out this new addition to 17th Ave. Beautiful Italian market with a cafe and bar.
We found the ambience to be quite welcoming and warm with a great variety of pastries, coffee, oils, etc."}
{"text":"A bit of a disappointment. It is certainly a space that is needed in this area of town, but they really haven't embraced much Calgary community

The market is simply everything\"sauce\". Everywhere you turn they have  packaged there own product, it just rings tacky. Not much interesting local or international product here. Too bad. 

Our meal was OK, the dining area is very loud. Service was good, we had the pizza it was ok."}
{"text":"Review: Lunch at the restaurant.

We were around the neighborhood and felt like having Italian for lunch. We stumbled upon this establishment and surely stumbled in the right direction. This review is for the restaurant beside the marketplace.

Bottomline: Nice modern decor. Solid food at the right price.

Atmosphere: Beautiful decor. The restaurant has a chic but classic Italian feel to it. Service was good. It was interesting to have to walk by the marketplace to get to the restaurant.

Food: we ordered the Gnocchi Poutine to start and the Clam Linguini Diablo and the Pollo Cacciatore for the entree. The gnocchi poutine was a nice fusion of Canadian and Italian cuisine and worked quite well together. The cook on the gnocchi was great and the stringy cheese curds made the dish very appetizing. The clam pasta was okay, but the spicy red wine tomato sauce on the pollo pasta was fantastic. The flavors exploded in my mouth and I immediately craved for more. Unfortunately, the rest of the dish was a bit over seasoned.

Value: Great price for what you are getting for lunch. Portions were decent and I've been told you can get the same price on pasta nights on Sunday and Monday."}
{"text":"It was my third trip to Sauce today - all lunch visits because of the $10 pasta. Food is good. Outside of the specials it can be a pricey meal and today we had the hardest time getting our server's attention.

Parking is a hassle. 30 minute options and one hour.  I'm a slow eater."}
{"text":"First time here. The entrance walks through a marketplace or shop style area with a variety of European food. The restaurant ambience was louder, open and semi casual. Our waitress wasn't overly attentive and missed basics like refilling water. She also seemed to struggle with talking to men for some reason. 
I ordered the porchetta trio which is called a favorite. I really didn't enjoy it at all. It's above average from your typical restaurant but not very good. I would give them another chance but would definitely order different next time. If you are a big guy like me you will probably leave hungry if you order the trio."}
{"text":"A friend and I were here yesterday for the first time.  I had some food samples from the market and bakery as well as a mocha.  I didn't bother looking at food prices because I wasn't here to shop or eat.  I can tell you that they make a great mocha and it was an average price.  The spinach dip that I tried was amazing and the scone I sampled was fine.  The staff will have conversation with you about the place so ask questions if you want because they have time right now.  It's been open for 2.5 weeks so far and apparently the Sauce crowd already picks up around 10:30am.  The deli looks like it has great food (to stay or go) and there's seating.  My vegan friend didn't find anything in the deli that she would eat.

Apparently they have underground parking around the back of the building but there's no signage for that.  The first hour is free and then it's $1 per hour after that.  I found free 2hr parking along 32nd St and 14th Ave.  

I'd definitely go back to eat at the restaurant or buy another mocha, which was better than Starbucks."}
{"text":"I stopped in to have a bite in the market/cafe and was pleasantly surprised at the numerous options of dairy-free and soy-free salads and sandwiches; soup of the day was also an option! Great price for a soup and salad.
I was interested in having a dessert from the cafe display case, unfortunately I was told that probably everything contained dairy, so I left slightly disappointed. Fingers crossed- I would love to see them use coconut cream and/or oil as an alternative option for a few of their treats some day."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple of times, but that isn't what this review is about. This review is about their new picnic baskets. I picked on up today to go to the park and watch the eclipse with my wife and her family. We were all very happy with the amount of food that we received and the price. 

The prices was $40.

What we received?

4 Nice size sandwiches. We got 1 ham, 1 turkey and 2 roast beef.
4 salads. We got one of each that they had.
4 drinks.
4 cannoli

If you are planning a picnic or a road trip, I would definitely think about ordering one of these."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food!!! The arancinis are one of my favourites in Calgary! The mussels in white wine were just delicious and the pizza was really really good!! Absolutely nothing to complain! The service was not bad... I look forward to go back there!! I want to try the rest of the menu!!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at Sauce a few times before and thought it was overall good for good quality, service, and atmosphere.

Ordered a take away tonight as they were fully booked...the beet salad cost $10.50 and consisted of only 5 chunks of beet. Way over priced"}
{"text":"Love the deli & coffee bar! I often go here for breakfast/lunch and a coffee while I work. Staff is awesome, coffee is excellent & sandwiches are fantastic too."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite sandwich pit stop with beautifully crafted, delicious sandwiches. Now for $9, the sandwiches come on meagre 'hamburger buns', which for the addition of the bakery seems lacklustre. 
Albeit tasty, the sandwiches (and sides) are rather small considering the price. With Subway across the street, it makes it difficult to choose Sauce for a sandwich of value."}
{"text":"Best pasta in Calgary. Best service. Best dessert. I swear to god I love this place. They are so friendly and professional and they make food an experience. They pride themselves on being affordable too!! $10 lunch pasta!!! Come on!!!!"}
