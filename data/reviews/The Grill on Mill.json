{"text":"Wow is all I have to say! I'm not a big meat eater but the ribs were absolutely delicious. Not to mention their fries were on point. It's nice to see Mill Ave offering new places to try, and this one is definitely going to be my go to spot."}
{"text":"I love this place for their Taco Tuesday specials. The tacos are HUGE and the steak tacos are delicious, the best on mill (coming from a seasoned veteran of going to taco Tuesday's on mill). Also the cheap drink specials are a nice bonus!"}
{"text":"Great food and happy hour prices! Def try the tritip steak, pulled pork sliders, onion rings, chicken tenders and tacos! All they need is some spicy wings and this place would be perfect!  Already came back twice! Come by!"}
{"text":"Had the Pig Sandwich (BBQ shredded pork) and while it tasted ok, it was a little mushy for my taste. Not bad but not special. This place is huge! Way too big for where they are located, in my opinion. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was dead, only two other patrons in the place. The people working there were nice enough but when the gal brought our order to the table, she didn't bring any condiments, napkins, salt/pepper, etc. Maybe you're supposed to grab those things yourself, I don't know. She was nice enough and brought most of what we asked for. One thing I don't understand is why they don't have decent napkins in the place. We ate BBQ! It gets very messy and since we weren't given silverware, had to use our fingers to pick up the pieces that fell in the basket. Come on, make sure everyone has plenty of napkins.   I know these are little things but the owners/managers/workers better pay attention to those small things if they want to stay in business. The food isn't spectacular enough to warrant just average service. And not once did anyone ask how we liked our food or check in on us. Maybe that's not the concept here but if they are trying to mimic NCounter next door, it's a fail. Sorry."}
{"text":"Not organized at all but the tri-tip and fries are amazing! Also they don't give water cups they charge you (C'mon it's Arizona!)"}
{"text":"Awesome new spot on Mill with great food and great people! The staff is extremely friendly and always attentive. The chicken tacos with spicy bbq is personal favorite. They take the time to get to know you which goes a long way in the industry  these days. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been waiting over 25 min for my grilled cheese to be remade. I asked for pickles on it and when it came out there were none. I didn't think it would be a big deal to make another one..... after waiting 15 min I asked if it was still coming. I was told the chef had a full grill but it wouldn't be long. There was a table of 4 here and no one else. After finally getting my grilled cheese.... it wasn't all that great. I requested to have it off my bill and our server had to get manage approval. My fianc√© had the tri tip steak sandwich. Very bland until we requested horseradish sauce.... amazing with it. Service was less than adequate, food was ok. U get what u pay for."}
{"text":"Burgers are very good. Only thing that sucks is the waiting staff is really slow.. it took her 20 min to bring back drinks for 2 people  when it wasnt a full house and another 30 for the food which is fine because I know it's cooked fresh!"}
{"text":"Best Value in Tempe! I have been to every restaurant that sells tacos on Mill Ave as I work in the area. The Grill on Mill is by far the best value for Taco Tuesday! They make their tacos using full size tortillas, not the tacito size. I had one chicken and one steak taco. The flavor was great and they actually put a good portion of meat in the taco, just the way I likes it!! I am looking forward to my next visit to try their other smoked meats..Great Job Grill on Mill  !!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I don't write many reviews - I came into the Grill for lunch yesterday with a co worker and I have to say I was impressed. I had the smoked Tri-Tip and he had the smoked chicken, the food was awesome. I liked the spicy BBQ sauce on the sandwich, it's gooood with the garlic bread.   I grew up in Texas, I have expectations and by far the best BBQ that I have had in Tempe (there is not much) and really friendly people. Chase, who I think is the manager came over and talked to us for a while. This place is dialed in, i'm excited to see them take off. Much needed addition to Mill street and i'm stoked it's so close to the office."}
{"text":"Love the Chicken Sandwich with Bacon With Chef Sean and the Jackson Margarita  and Bloody Mary made by Mr. Jackson!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great beer selection, friendly staff, am always satisfied every time I eat here!  Tri-Tip is the best in the valley!"}
{"text":"Went to this place as a request from Yelp on hot and new. The place was dead empty, it was Sunday at 8 PM so i'm sure that had something to do with it. Bartender was super nice and welcoming though and he informed us that this was their third week open which explains the emptiness.   The decor and atmosphere of the place is great, it is pretty chill and you order your food in the front and eat at the tables around. I ordered the ABC Burger which is avocado, bacon, and cheese. It was a charbroiled burger which was pretty good. My bf got the tri tip sandwich which was also quite good. My biggest disappoint were the fries they tasted very much frozen/ out of the bag and were not crunchy at all. The fries along with the ranch which was too watery are my biggest complaints and reason its only ok. If they improve that this place has alot of potential, there are many TVs around so its a good place to watch games and such."}
{"text":"I hit this place up after A-mountain and I was not disappointed. The Tri-tip was very good. It had a heap of meat and I added bacon which was the best choice I've made today. The bread is roasted garlic bread and works so well. I also had a nice Fresh Squeeze IPA and that paired amazingly."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Completely ignored us during the entire time we were there, food took forever, food server was so slow and lax! Made us late for a show, when I told them that we needed to get to a show, she just shrugged ! No sense of customer needs at all! Very disappointing will never go back!"}
{"text":"My heart goes out to this restaurant because the first time I ate here the waitress realized i was trying to avoid animal products and immediately suggested i get the breakfast burrito and she made sure she told the chef what ingredients to use. I appreciated that more than she'll know! They also host \"geeks who drink\" on Thursday,  which is a great way to hang out with friends, drink beer, and play trivia! They have a good draft beer selection (and btw for once it's good looking gentleman bar tenders! Not half naked women...) and they are all patient and will help you decide what brew to order. Side note:good French fries!"}
{"text":"This place models itself after Firestones in San Luis Opispo, Ca which has the BEST tri tip sandwich on the planet. I have been there many times while living there and I can say without hesitation that The Grill on Mill NAILS this sandwich. AND their using red oak to smoke the tri tip!!! 5 stars just for the sandwich alone, but the place is nice and people are friendly. Recommend highly!!"}
{"text":"This review will certainly be skewed based on a few factors. I'm starving, it's late to eat dinner (10) and the only places to eat near my hotel were hotel restaurants which I distrust through experience.  As my gps drew me closer to Tempe and AU on a Thursday night, I wondered how this would turn out.  It seemed a lot farther than the 2 miles the gps said was from the hotels area.  But again, I will not eat hotel restaurant food if I have a choice.  As for the Grill on Milll, my choice over the Irish Pub across the street, was suspect once I walked in. Bright lights, lots of bar area and open spaces wreaked of college hotspot. One look at the menu reinforced my suspicion.  At this point though, I'm eating here! Wings, burgers and salads pretty much is the fare, with BBQ sandwiches and ribs to appease.  Pig Sandwich (Pulled Pork as you can guess) was good but small and maybe a bit too saucy.  With the good sandwich roll I did enjoy it. My Caesar Salad came in a stainless steel looked-to-be a dog bowl.  That kind of grossed me out as all I could think about was the slime I have to wash out of my dog's bowl. I do miss him though when I travel! This place I'm sure rocks with the college crowd as is seen with the high stars and reviews given already.  So, I'll give my 3 stars and call it a night."}
{"text":"Rob knows how to pour a perfect beer! Awesome bartender, chill atmosphere, and good food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is just ok. Prices for fries and onion rings are $2.25-$3.00! Should be more like $1.00-$1.50. Better options out there for a more reasonable price."}
{"text":"First time here, absolutely amazing Tri-tip sandwich! J.D. Love came to our table to check on our meal and he let us know that he really tries to make the best Tri-tip and he really does!!!  Must give 5 stars for great food, and great customer service."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon for the Grill on Mill because I was craving barbecue and I only live about 10 minutes away from the establishment. Typically, in my opinion, restaurants that are on Groupon are relatively new, or struggling to say the least. When I arrived to this place during lunch hour there were literally two people in there. No big deal! I overlooked the menu and ordered the Rib Meal, chicken fingers, & The pulled pork sandwich. As soon as my cashier put in the order and the guy yells from the kitchen we are out of chicken fingers, we have no barbecue sauce, oh and let me check if we have any ribs so he then turns around and bends over and checks inside a container on the ground and says oh we have one more half slab ribs I don't know how they are going to taste though because they've been there since this morning.  So then I ask about the try tip sandwich and he said we usually simmer that in our barbecue sauce which we are out of but I do apologize it is dry today. Still trying to give them a chance I ask for a sample of their pulled pork which I'm so glad I did because it was extremely dry. The cashier apologized and said if you're craving barbecue I honestly would go somewhere else but if you like greasy hamburgers I suggest you order one from here and chuckled. This was so ridiculous I just turned away and laughed. I will be getting a credit back from Groupon. Save your time and money people there's no way I would ever go back to this place even if it was for free."}
{"text":"The burger was one of the worst burgers I've ever had. The menu is extremely basic with little options. Prediction: Out of business by end of summer 2016"}
{"text":"While eating at this restaurant last night, a man who we had earlier been told was the owner drunkenly approached me while my roommate and her boyfriend were outside to tell me that she looks like a bitch. He apparently thought it was funny or a good idea to insult the only patrons spending money in his brand new Mill Ave restaurant. In addition, the food was mediocre at best. The bartender who served us, however, was great the entire time. It's too bad he works for such a prick. The owner definitely lost three customers immediately, and he's sure to lose many more as the story was posted in neighborhood Facebook groups who did not react favorably to his \"joke\". I will never spend money at The Grill on Mill again, and I hope others will follow suit."}
{"text":"Food was bad. Kitchen grill staff was literally having an argument with the bartender. Food not good enough for the price they charge."}
{"text":"They recently just opened up a few months back.  I work down in Tempe and love going places for lunch and this is by far my favorite place.  I really like the pig sandwich as it's the perfect amount of food with a side of fries!  After work I will occasionally stop in for a beer as they have a nice selection both Draft and cans.  The staff is friendly and always greets me with a smiling face!  Stop in, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Location is close to the Tempe Beach Park and Hayden Butte (\"A\" Mountain). I heard about this new BBQ place so decided to check it out for myself. The inside of the restaurant is quite big, almost too big in my opinion. I had the 1/2 chicken plate with fries and salad which the salad was fresh and the fries were good. However, the chicken was not as good as some other BBQ places that I have been to. The biggest issue I had with the meal was that they only have plastic utensils here and not proper cutlery to dig through the meat. This was very disappointing and I even asked other staff if there were any available to use. While the food was fine in general I'm not sure if I will come back because of this."}
{"text":"Ice cold beer! The location is great, if you sit up front you have a view of \"A\" mountain and the traffic on Mill Ave. They were out of our first choice beer. Food (brisket sandwich,?burger and pulled pork sandwich)was good. We had to go to the bar to get beer and the bartender told me I had to go to the back to order food. I expect that at Chipotle by not a sit down place."}
{"text":"This place is good! I had the ABC burger, it had avocado,bacon, with jack cheese! Total cost with fries and a drink $13 I highly recommend you try the spicy BBQ sauce. I will definitely be back for the ribs! Great location with plenty of space"}
{"text":"We have been frequenting the Hayden Butte Preserve for our Monday Hikes of late, while the weather was still cool outside.  And as we were walking to our vehicle, we smelt the aroma of BBQ wafting through the air on Mill avenue.  As we looked around, we surmised that it must've been coming from this establishment across the street, as this appears to have been the only restaurant that was serving anything that would resemble this aroma.  We then walked across the street, and entered this place. It was nearly completely empty, except for one other person having dinner at the bar.  We were greeted by the Bartender, whose name was Dan. He took our drink orders, and handed us these paper menus. As we looked around, we surmised that this place may be a great spot to hang out and chat for hours, but this may not exactly be a mecca for culinary delights.  And after placing our order, receiving them relatively quickly, we were absolutely correct.  There was nothing impressive about the basic menu. Typical plain jane, bar food - absolutely nothing special. The BBQ chicken that I had was dry, and the sauce was simply tangy, but nothing extraordinary. My wife had the Hot Dog and Sweet Potatoes, and she commented that she has had better in the past.  The only redeeming qualities that enabled me to rate this as high as 3 stars were Dan's prompt and courteous service, the anticipated atmosphere of the place when it would be packed, and the overall cleanliness of the interior and the surroundings.  I hope that the food offerings and preparation improves with time because this place definitely has some possibilities."}
{"text":"****12/11/16 Update****** No contact and no follow up I guess poor quality food and customer service is the standard here.  ******************************* I will start off by saying I understand this is a grill and I ordered a salad. Unfortunately the service and the food were way below what I expected based on what I was told by other people. Long story short I got a crappy salad that looks like it came out of a bag for $11.00  There is a sign out front that says \"Order at the bar or at the cashier\" I went to the cashier which is next to the bar and stood there for what seemed like 10 mins because the two people were standing there talking with their backs to the customers. See the picture. Normally I would have said something but I just wanted to see how long I would have to stand there out of sheer curiosity.  I ordered my food then went to sit at the bar to wait. I assume the person who was talking to the cashier in the picture is the bartender because she walked behind the bar a few times. She didn't ask me if I wanted anything and actually completely ignored me. She did however have a conversation with someone at the bar who had not drink or food in front of him so I can only assume that he was an employee or a friend of hers. I decided to get something to drink and eat in the restaurant rather than take it to go but changed my mind given the service.  ***The salad*** I attached a picture of my 11 dollar salad after I mixed it up. It consisted of what looks like salad out of a bag and honestly I think McDonald's does a better job of making salads and that's saying something. It had no avocado like the menu says. It had a minuscule amount of corn and very few discernible black beans. Totally not worth 11.00  My understanding is that they are opening a few more locations soon. I don't recommend wasting your time."}
{"text":"Based on some of the reviews, I was excited to go try a new place on Mill. I had the Steak Cobb salad and I was very disappointed. The steak was tough and very cold, like they just pulled it the fridge. The ranch was very runny and watery. Ncounter is across the sidewalk and they have a similar salad, at a cheaper price, and much better taste. The people I was with both got the Tri-Tip Steak Sandwich. Both said the meat was tough and it was not heated up enough. The BBQ sauce isn't anything impressive. Based on the lack of people in the restaurant, I don't imagine this staying open for longer than a year. Hopefully they lower their prices, include sides in the price, up their quality of food, and create good lunch specials for the people who work on Mill. A BBQ place has good potential on Mill, but since there is such high competition in the area, they are really going to have to do something to make themselves stand out. The best thing about this place was the service, everyone was really nice and attentive to the few customers in there."}
{"text":"Great service Food was delicious! Low prices, very affordable. Didn't like there are no \"combos\" and you have to order the sides separately. Kinda overwhelming if it's your first time. I had the tri tip sandwich with coleslaw YUMMY My friend had the sweet potato fries and the pig sandwich was GOOD too. Definitely worth it. Coming back next time I'm visiting the area!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband, for ribs and were extraordinarily disappointed!  The ribs were tough and chewy, the coleslaw strangely sweet (Apple?) and the beans dry. Our suggestion is stay away if you're looking for Barbeque."}
{"text":"This is a great new spot! The food is fantastic, I'd recommend the tri-tip. It's huge and able to accommodate a crowd, so as this place gains notoriety I hope to see it fill up. The thing that truly stood out for me was the staff. They're super friendly and you can tell they're happy to be a part of this fledgling operation. I felt welcomed and they were very curious to how my experience was to make sure it was up to their standards. All I can say is I really wish this place well and hope they take off! The concept is different from your usual Mill affair, it definitely stands out."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good tri-tip in this area.  Luckily TGOM has hit town.  Parking near Mill is always a pain and the entrance to this place is a little hard to navigate but once inside the food and service are very good.  I ordered the tri-tip sandwich with fries.  The meat was smoked perfectly, the sauces delicious and the fries were piping hot.  Service at the bar from Alix was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"The $5 pork sandwich was great and they have a decent selection of beer on tap. Know that most if not all items are a la carte. Typical experience with the bartender, hardly friendly but not rude. A pleasant modern environment that's great for a quick lunch. The location is killer on this one being on mill close to ASU and Tempe Beach Park. Will definitely be back to try more of the food."}
{"text":"Tri-tip was good.  It wasn't the best I've had, but I'd definitely return.  I was a little disappointed in the limited menu.  However, I already knew I wanted to try the Tri-tip based on other reviews.  Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Strolled in here and ordered a tri-tip sandwich and a beer with my wife.  The Tri-Tip was perfectly smoked.  The bread they put it on was delicious and grilled to perfection. It was served with a side of BBQ but it's almost unnecessary as the meat is flavorful enough.  The service was great and the beer was ice cold.  There's plenty of TV's to watch whatever game is on.  Mill needed a new spot and this place answered the call."}
{"text":"The the trip and pulled pork were amazing ! The staff was incredible.  I will be back next Sat for a sando and a cold brew !"}
{"text":"The spot was empty but 4 stars on Yelp so thought why not!! The head chef (I think he was head chef) even came out to confirm they had my order right. The food was good, even has a bar. Definitely would come back :)"}
{"text":"I came in for a quick bite to eat. The tri-tip sandwich is very tasty with enough smokiness to remind you that you're eating barbecue. The sauce was perfect (not too sweet) and the fries were hot and perfectly seasoned."}
{"text":"My son and I enjoyed it a lot! Wasn't crowded this day (I think because the college students were gone for the holiday.)  Service was great, the ribs and hamburger, n fries were excellent, and THEY USE GLOVES (yes!) My beer was SUPER cold too!  Will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place. Their food is fantastic! Love their BBQ, salads, today I tried their grilled chicken sandwich & this is on my top fav's list. THe service is great, too. The people are really nice & this is such a clean place. Love it."}
{"text":"Love it!!! Food and beer are REALLY good, but the people are better. Huge place with a modern twist on smoked bbq, fair prices, and a good mix of crowds throughout the day. They should franchise:) Cheers!"}
{"text":"First of all if you crave REAL smoked chicken, ribs and Tri- Tip in the Phoenix area you now have a new place to get your fix. REAL smoked meats have a smoke ring on the edges and succulent meat- not fall off the bone- needs a little tug to get the meat off the ribs for example. Great location on Mill between 3 rd and 4 th- 50 steps from the light rail and a cool vibe.  BTW- if you are a SF Giants fan the manager Chase Krukow is Kruke's son. Been open only 2 weeks - food quality is top notch and prices are crazy low for what you get on your plate."}
{"text":"Went there once never going back. Ordered a burger and fries. The fries were soggy and disgusting. The burger was hard and overcooked I asked for medium well and I could barely bite into the burger. Service was terrible took about 30 minutes to receive this burger. I will never go back"}
{"text":"Food fantastically yummy and since moving to Arizona I don't know  that I've ever said that plus the prices was so fantastic I feel like not only did I get my monies worth I actually left feeling like I robbed them or something."}
{"text":"Built into a former yogurt shop and adjacent to the ever-popular breakfast and lunch spot, Ncounter, this establishment is a nice addition to the often ever-changing and sandwich and pizza heavy food scene on Mill Avenue.  If offers a small selection of outside seating and a surprisingly roomy interior. The walls are painted some sort of dessert gold/yellow patina and the emblem for the place is a roughly drawn representation of the old flour mill across the street, that gives Mill avenue its name.  The crown jewel of the menu appears to be the grilled tri-tip sandwich which is essentially sliced meat on a bun. Don't get me wrong, it was well spiced and the bread they use is fairly thin and holds things together well. i grabbed one of the bottles of spicy BBQ from the front to add to the sandwich as I ate it and it was quite good.  I also split a basket of onion rings with a friend and they are clearly homemade and not bad at all, though the price, at $7, seems a bit high but once again, made from scratch. I actually liked the also homemade onion rings from Tempe Tavern so I recommend the owners of this place go do a taste comparison.  As it was lunch, and a work day, i did not take advantage of the bar b ut they have a nice selection of craft beers on draft, along with the traditional college town mega-brewed pilsners known more for the low cost than having an actual taste. In addition, it is a full bar so they can do mixed drinks as well. I'll be interested to see if they will eventually provide a specific cocktail list if they don't do so already.  Other foods on the menu appear to be some well-priced burgers, including a vego burger and they do offer BBQ ribs and chicken as well.  Al in all, a nice start and I have a feeling they will do well but some suggestions, as they did just open:  +Have a holder for the plastic tops for the soda cups. Having them just stacked by the soda machine feels a bit scattered. In addition, have a small container with either lemon or lime slices for ice tea, soda, or water. It shouldn't take too much effort and is not an uncommon practice.  +Have a dinner plate plate option for the tri-tip versus a sandwich. Maybe I missed it but it seemed a sandwich only option.  Other than that, nice place and it isn't so much just 3 stars because anything is wrong but because, honestly, while the food was good it didn't wow me but I'm happy it is different from what else is available on Mill. I hope to see them continue to innovate and try new things as the owners get a feel for their customer base."}
{"text":"On lark a co-worker and I walked down to this new spot on mill Ave.  We decided to try the abc burger. Avocado, bacon, and cheese burger.  Great flavor and fresh taste. Fresh, thickly sliced avocado and crispy bacon.  The fries were crisp and went perfectly with a burger.  I added their bbq sauce with surprisingly had a good bite to it.   I'd say the only issues were that the entrance is not conveniently positioned. You do have to walk the length of the restaurant to order.  Service, freshness and flavor however all score an A+"}
{"text":"I'm always excited when a new place opens on Mill Ave. I work in the area and the same restaurants get kind of boring after a while. I'm not going to lie - my expectations were quite low.   Whenever I walk by, the front of the restaurant is always so dead. It's empty most of the time and even as I peak in, it never looked busy. The set up is a bit weird, but this doesn't take away from my great experience there today. They picked up as I sat down to eat though, which made me happy to know I wasn't one of only a few people eating there (usually a bad sign for me).   I ordered a cheeseburger with a fried egg on it (I LOVE that they do that). It was reasonably priced and cooked to perfection. To top it off, they have there own sauces as well - spicy and sweet. I'm not sure if they make them in house, but either way it made the burger taste that much better.   Great food only means so much to me though. My expectation for any restaurant is that the staff be friendly and provide great service. Granted there aren't any waiters, but I was greeted by a few people and you could tell they were happy to see me there. So many restaurants have this sense that don't need to provide great service to keep their customers. This place gets it and I'll be going back for sure to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE. Went in and ordered a Grilled Chicken Sandwich, said it's take about 45min to defrost and then the time it takes to grill it so I picked the ABC burger instead. It took them nearly 30min to get the burger going because they were too busy chitchatting and socializing behind the counter. Walked out and I'm not going back anytime soon. Terrible service, paid $8.10 just to sit around and watch them talk and take their sweet ass time. They don't even deserve one star because this isn't the first time it's happened to me"}
{"text":"My Best friend and I stopped and ate some chicken strips and sweet potato fries here.  Amazing food and great fun atmosphere.  By the way Joe was awesome and should be the manager.  Very helpful and friendly.  Try this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"Grill on the Mill has jumped to our favorite spot since opening! Super staff, amazing service and awesome food and beverages ! This will be my new ASU sons go to place for sure !"}
{"text":"We ordered the Pig Sandwich, 1/2 rack of ribs and a tri-tip sandwich. The pulled pork for the Pig Sandwich was soaked in one of their two bbq sauces. This sauce is very sweet and really too thick...we didn't like the sauce or the sandwich. Couldn't really taste the meat, just the thick sauce. Tri-tip sandwich...I believe the waiter said they smoke the meat for two hours. Not sure if two hours is sufficient but the meat could have been softer. The second sauce is also very thick with a little more heat. Onion rings appeared brownish in color indicating that old oil was used to deep fry them. Not a fan of the meats or sauces and won't be back."}
{"text":"Today visited this place and had concerns if I would like it being a vegetarian. My friend told me that you get veggie burger and the patty is boca and am pretty sure you will not like it. But even then I went for it and was pleasantly surprised as the patty was not that hard as I expected and it was very soft. I also added a fried egg on top of it and I think it is an excellent add-on."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork sandwich [$6.75]. It's just meat inside bread. You can add toppings for more money. It was alright. The decor inside is pretty standard - black tables and chairs and TVs along the walls. Everyone looked like zombies, busy staring at the TVs. There's a 10% discount when you show your ASU student id."}
{"text":"Very good place. Joe the manager is very customer oriented. He has a great personality. He said they will be having a one year anniversary for the restaurant and I will definitely be back to support."}
{"text":"This restaurant surprised me multiple times. First I was surprised that there was a BBQ place in mill ave, it's kind of hidden at the north end of the strip. Then I was surprised how spacious it was inside, plenty of seating and space with large tvs with easy viewing. Then I was a little surprised with the simplicity of the menu. The BBQ menu items prices rise quickly so options for a quick or simple lunch might feel limited. The real winner is the pig sandwich which is priced well and is portion well. The flavor will satisfy your BBQ cravings and even when paired with a drink and side still makes for an affordable lunch. If your in the area and craving some BBQ, it's defiantly worth a visit."}
{"text":"Tried this today for the first time!  I thought it was really good.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and onion rings which were great.  The interior is a little dull as there is no theme or anything like there is at most places on Mill.  The space is huge and they have a great front patio.  The staff was very friendly.  I am excited to return and try out the bar.  I definitely recommend you give it a try!"}
{"text":"It's a good thing thing placed is closed down. I came in on a Groupon deal. It seems you almost always have to be leery of Groupon restaurant deals as their restaurants seem to be sub-par or heading towards going out of business. This place was both.  Frankly, my instincts also were concerned because based upon everything we saw, I was concerned for health reasons too. Glad to see the free market took care of the extremely bad restaurant. Also, it's just hard to put much trust in Yelp reviews as well these days."}
{"text":"Awesome California brisket in Phoenix. Easy light rail access. The burgers are great with a good selection of draft and bottle beers. Service is top drawer! Highly recommended. Plenty of room for large parties and great high tops for intimate dining. They have a large bar for and great drink specials that vary by the night."}
{"text":"They need to step up the BBQ process. Chicken seemed mildly smoked. Couldn't find the markings (smoke ring) or flavor in the beef. Five customers in the restaurant and five employees. It would be great to have a successful legit BBQ place on mill. They are friendly, but, hey, I'm here for the Q!!"}
