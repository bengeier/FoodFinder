{"text":"Excellent New York style pizza. It looks like they're focused on fewer options and fresh ingredients, and it's working. The whole family loved it!  I hope this is here to stay!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!! The ingredients tasted really fresh on the pizza. Also got the green salad and it was delicious, house made dressing was a plus!"}
{"text":"Love this pie. Not thick but not thin. Perfect medium between the two. Have had a pepperoni mushroom and the cheese. Both great, cooked with a crisp. Will be going back again."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in Strongsville. The sheet pizza (about $16) is ALWAYS a big hit at our parties. Excellent!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza for the price!  They don't charge extra for vegan cheese which is unheard of. They have lots of toppings & specialty pizzas & calzones.  I like the crust.  The pizza's ready fast & the staff are super nice!"}
{"text":"Out-of-towers looking for quick, cheap dinner, we stumbled on Gina's Pizza. What a great find. Great pizza and salads with homemade dressing. Very good vibe, kind people and good music."}
{"text":"We couldn't be happier with this pizza!! The wood fired crust is slightly crunchy on the outside and light and steamy inside. Hand tossed and not too thick but a nice crusty border. The ingredients are fresh and delicious! We had the Mediterranean one night... amazing. We ate it all and kept talking about it (ohmygod, that was soooo good!!) and were sad there was none left over for breakfast. ;-) Another time we got the Tri-Color, which has a pesto sauce, roasted cauliflower, tomatoes... and ricotta along with the pizza cheese. I've never had ricotta on a pizza! I thought I was done getting excited about pizza. Turns out I was wrong! I don't know the owner (Gina) but whenever we go in, she's working hard, hair in a bandana, making pizzas.  There hasn't been good local pizza here since LaVazios in the 1970's, so this is big news. Also, it's pizza that you can eat and still feel good and healthy afterward. It's not greasy or overly salty. You know how you eat some pizza and go, omg, WHY did I just do that? Well... that doesn't happen with this pizza because it's so fresh and delicious. You won't be disappointed. It's only carry out. No dine in or delivery."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE Gina's! Always cooked to perfection and if you order a pepperoni pizza, you're actually getting a pepperoni pizza...they load them on there!  Their calzones are delicious too! Toppings are loaded on these too. Don't hesitate...order now!"}
{"text":"Great pizza is hard to come by on the West side of Cleveland. Westlake has Sweet Basil - which is above average - and used to have Casa Vella at Crocker Park (close to NY style) until it went out of business. The rest is all \"Midwest\" style full of dough and slathered with cheese.  No good authentic NY or Neapolitan style pizza left (though Tomoris in Lakewood shows promise).   Gina's makes a solid pizza that is fresh and better than the rest in the area (definitely better than any regional or national chain here). The sauce is a bit tepid (can get lost in the cheese and toppings). The crust a bit basic (not enough chew or flavor).  The plain cheese is probably their best."}
{"text":"Gina's rules! Every time I come home, I make an effort to order a pie from here. And every time I've gone in, Gina is there which is pretty great. A huge selection of fresh and interesting veggie toppings, vegan cheese, very reasonable prices, fast service, fun and interesting sodas in the beverage cooler- pretty much all I could ask for."}
{"text":"Pretty good NYC style pizza. Sauce was good and the cheese was amazing. I would recommend this place to anyone and they seem to be doing good basement. It is a bit pricey, but still a great place to grab some pizza."}
{"text":"This is very good pizza!  Definitely has more of a \"homemade\" feel than a lot of the other local pizza places.  The crust, cheese, and sauce are all definitely above average.  The hidden gem on the menu is the garlic knots.  These are absolutely phenomenal.  They're soft, fluffy, with just enough crispiness on the outside.  The flavor and texture are great and they're always fresh and wonderful.  This place is worth going to for the garlic knots alone.  Also, the owner is incredibly nice and always pleasant to deal with.  This is a good local business to support."}
{"text":"Great local place with great pizza! A real gem in Bay. Lots of options for toppings. Note: no delivery, just pick up. Also no dining area, strictly take out.  Pro tip: Get a pizza, then go to Sibling Revelry brewing and take it inside to eat with a local draft!"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good! I like that they have a simplified menu with fresh options. Def the best option for pizza in the Bay Area. The caprese salad was great too. I do wish the hours were a bit longer. 8pm on a Friday night seems a little early."}
{"text":"Great Pizza.   Thin tasty crust.   Love the salads.   Always fresh and the Italian dressing is spectacular and also sold separately.    Friendly owner and staff."}
{"text":"Yes. Just... Yes!  Fantastic pizza, fantastic place. Fantastic! Ordered a 16\" on a whim while in from out of town. Wish I could pack the whole place up and take it home!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal crust.  Best real New York style pizza in Cleveland.  Salads are fresh and huge, and the lemon vinaigrette house dressing is fantastic."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Strongsville, and the prices are VERY fair.  The over-sized pepperoni are a hit in my family.  The subs are all great tasting and a value for sure!    The sheet pizzas are even awesome here!!  It's certainly better than the chains."}
{"text":"We love the thin pizza at Gina's Pizza! We have tried a few different varieties of toppings. Whatever toppings we have ordered, they're always fresh. The pizza sauce and crust are light and flavorful.  You can taste the fresh herbs in the sauce. The pizza is a great value for the price. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Unfortunate, but was not a fan. We did not like the sauce at all. The crust wasn't our favorite. Not our version of NY style pizza. We wanted to like the family shop but sadly did not."}
{"text":"Best thin crust pizza place on the Westside hands down. Consistently great za! Well done Gina."}
{"text":"Family joint located on the West Side. Fantastic homemade pizza which is worth the price (higher/mid range). Carry out only.  Crust is homemade and authentic (thin crust style) and is just as good as some of my fav. spots in Little Italy. Sauce is smooth and has good flavor but doesn't stand out enough compared to the other elements which is why I only gave 4/5. Tons of toppings to choose from and everything is fresh. Other menu items besides pizza include salads & calzones.   Service is fast (15 min) for pickup. I am looking forward to trying their pesto. Overall I would much rather support the local businesses out there like Gina's vs Dominos or the other chains."}
{"text":"Great pizza. The crust is as good as I have ever had and the many toppings are fresh and plentiful. A good value for the mobey. Reminds me of the NY style pies I had as kid in Boston. Gina, here is wishing you much success- from two big fans in this household - in addition to the 6 other family members in town for the holiday!"}
{"text":"OMG...if you are vegan or lactose intolerant maybe even have issues with gluten Gina has you covered!!! I'm lactose intolerant and she totally fixes my need for pizza and the GF  crust is amazing as well!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, I loved the sauce and crust! Like other reviews, it tasted like the authentic NY pizza!"}
{"text":"Just ok. As I continue my search for the best pie, not the best and not the worst pizza in strongsville. Could use some more spices in the sauce, crust run of the mill. Round pizza with square slices."}
{"text":"We ordered the vegetable pizza, but substituted ricotta for broccoli, as neither of us likes broccoli on our pizza. This pie was outstanding -- so good we finished every last slice for lunch today. This is, far and away, the best traditional pizza in the West Shore suburbs."}
{"text":"Pizza.  Delicious.  Fresh.  Pizza. When I walked in for pick-up, the place has a very positive vibe.  Clean, well lit, and everyone there had upbeat attitudes.  Very friendly.  They have the best list of toppings I've seen. The pizza was cooked on time and to perfection.  Ever since our move from FL we've been looking for a fresh, delicious pizza place and we have finally found it in Gina's Pizza.  I only wished it stayed open a little later.  Sometimes that pizza craving doesn't hit before 8pm ;)  We will definitely be coming back and I love that we are supporting a LOCAL business - not a chain restaurant.  Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"For me Gina's has some of the best tasting pizza in the metro Cleveland area, that I have had. Yes there are many styles of pizza out there and many different pizza preference and so I understand that the way you are brought up may determined your likes and dislikes in food that could be different from others.  For me spending a good portion of my life in the northeastern region of the United States, Gina's got it right on as far as that New York flavor profile that I personally love. For me there are three major components that make up a good pizza, the crust, sauce and cheese. The crust at Gina's was the star for me, it had that slightly charred flour taste on the bottom that I love, that can only be produced by a pizza being cooked directly on a hot oven deck, whether it's coal, wood or gas fired oven.  A taste you can't get in some conveyor belt type oven. The crust was crisp, yet pliable, with a nice tip sag that naturally could be folded when picked up. The sauce was well balanced without being overly sweet with just a nice natural tomato flavor to it. And the cheese I would be guessing was a mixture of a couple different  kind of Italian cheeses with nice natural salty quality coming from either a good quality Romano or Parmesan cheese mix in. Can't wait for my next pizza from Gina's. I'd like to also positively point out when picking up my pizza the entire place was noticeable very clean and fresh inside. As a side note I would question  the Thomas R. negative review, the only review every written by him."}
{"text":"So far, Gina's has been the best pizza I have found in Strongsville. I could go for a little more sauce, which was also a tad sweet for me (the reasons for 4-stars), but all in all a good pizza; the toppings were/are fresh, cheese is delicious, crust was cooked perfectly.   If you have been to Gina's and have since found better in the Strongsville area, I'm all ears and would love to hear from you. There are still a few places left on my list to try, but for now Gina's is my go-to pizza place."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! Amazing salad dressings and feta cheese for salad. Wish I knew where she gets the feta!!"}
{"text":"So happy to have found this excellent local pizza shop as we just moved into the area. Pizza, salads and dressings are wonderfully delicious and fresh. Perfection!!"}
{"text":"today i wanted to try a pizza from here  ,hello foodies  anyway i decideed to try after 10 yrs   anyway i ask this guy at night ime about what is inside the pep,   he seeem s very angry to tell me what was inside the ingredients  ,NOT EVERY PEP IS PORK ONlyWITH BEEF , some pep are mix with chicken turkey (YUK) the crust was however excellent  fresh"}
{"text":"Tasty pizza and very friendly service. There also isn't any space to eat inside but they do have daily specials."}
{"text":"Calzones are amazing as well.If you're a West Shore resident you need to give Gina's a try."}
{"text":"Awesome New York style thin crust pizza.  Super fresh toppings and really nice people."}
{"text":"I felt like Gina's was not anything too special.... 3 large pizzas was $50, which was more than what I wanted to spend but fine. They didn't have black olives, either, which is weird and deal breaker for me. Pizza was fine, I didn't hate it but for the price I think I would definitely go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"What a FIND this place is!  FINALLY, my long search is OVER!  Gina's Pizza is, hands down, the BEST tasting pizza pie in all of Northeast Ohio!  It reminds me of some of the very best pizzerias where I grew up in the NY and NJ area before I moved out here 20 years ago.  Crispy thin crust, authentic 'NY style' baked to perfection, foldable, flavorful, well-balanced, and oh so fresh tasting!  Pizza perfectionists and purists can judge a truly great pizza by simply tasting a plain cheese slice without any toppings.  Gina's is simply amazing even just plain.  I won't mind taking the drive to Bay Village from North Olmsted when i'm craving the very best tasting pizza.  This place IS 'the real deal'!"}
{"text":"And so ends my hunt for delicious, nearby, NEW YORK STYLE pizza.   In our house, \"pizza\" and \"Gina's\" are synonymous. I love the pizza (huge slices), the breadsticks are GREAT when they're fresh, and Gina herself - according to Boyfriend - is apparently just as sweet as can be. My dog even covertly ate two HUGE pieces once when I wasn't looking, so the pizza also has the canine stamp of approval! My only qualm is that I wish they were open later on weekends...I wouldn't dream of patronizing anything other than a local independent eatery, and Gina's is our go-to for take-out pizza."}
{"text":"We actually stopped here on a whim one Wednesday evening. You know that moment when you ask your girl what she wants to eat and she says, I don't care and then you give 5 options but something is wrong with all of them, welcome to that moment. We ended up driving around and just parked in the lot that the small hometown shop was in and finally agreed that something new was worth a shot. Behold Gina's Pizza.   We were welcomed by a high school kid and a middle aged woman who seemed to be manning the shop on their own. They were super friendly and welcomed us by highlighting the menu and saying that they could have a pizza done in a few minutes. As with all new pizza places, I was a bit skeptical but the woman (who may or not have been Gina) whipped us up a medium sausage and pepperoni pie in less than 10 minutes. I have to say, the personal touch of a small business chain compared to a corporate Papa John's really shined here. You could tell the people working really valued our business.   We said our thanks and arrived home and our mouth was watering from how good the pizza looked & smelled (I devoured my half before I could take a picture). It was more of a thin crust style pizza (perfect chewability), lighter and tasty sauce and loads of cheese. The ingredients were FRESH and I could not get over how good the sausage was.  Whoever this Gina lady is, she has made a GREAT establishment. My only complaint is that this place isn't open more than it is (it has small business hours, not really open super late). One of the best pizza places on the west side and one of the best finds of 2015! Hats off to you Gina's, you have earned my business and I hope you succeed."}
{"text":"Gina's Pizza was not only delicious but the staff was absolutely amazing. They were very friendly even though we came in with a bunch of children. We also received free shirts from whom I assume is the owner. I definitely recommend and wouldn't mind going again."}
{"text":"Best pizza on the west side. Great caprese salad, home made dressings, fresh toppings and lots of options for vegetarians and vegans."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Cleveland. I owned a pizza shop at one time. I know pizza. This is legitimate. Get the tri color."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas around, beautiful crust and cheese. Can't wait to try their pesto pizza!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite pizza places around!  It's nice that it's right down the street from us, but I would definitely make the trip for this pizza even if it wasn't.  Great NY style pizza, fresh ingredients, locally owned, great staff. The price is a little on the mid to higher end, but I don't mind paying it for the quality of food I'm getting.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Wonderful newer pizza place!   Love it!  Fresh fresh fresh ingredients. We order a pizza with basil sauce, ball mozz, tomato, spinach and mushrooms.  Amazing!!!!!  If you want thin crust it's excellent.  Salad is crazy good too. Romaine and spinach.  Recommend the ball mozz for cheese.  $7 for a big salad it's a deal!  Highly recommend the sundried tomato balsamic."}
