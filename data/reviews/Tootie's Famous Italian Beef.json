{"text":"I am addicted!  Everything I have tried is very good.  Plan to be hungry, the portions are generous.  Came home today to find a menu on my door so now they deliver!  I will have to add an extra workout, but it will be so worth it."}
{"text":"Chicken with Mac n cheese is incredible!!!  Great beef and service. The owner is a really nice guy too!"}
{"text":"If you do not have two hours to wait for your food do not order from here. Also the sandwiches are not made for delivery and come extremely soggy. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Mama Mia ... I just had \"the treat\", a 6\" hoagie roll filled with hot, delicious Italian beef and an Italian hot sausage link ... topped with giardiniera and provolone cheese. All this is moistened with the hot and tasty au jus in which the beef was cooked. If you've had Chicago style Italian beef sandwiches before, you will not be disappointed. If you have never tasted one before, welcome to your new addiction! I can't wait to go back. Go there ... why are you still reading this ... go eat!"}
{"text":"I ordered an Italian Beef sandwich and I was so greatly disappointed. Over priced, skimpy on the meat and had soggy, over cooked vegtables, apparently to make up for the shortage of meat. I'd never seen Italian Beef sandwiches in Pittsburgh before so I was excited but what a let down. Italian Beef sandwiches are popular in Chicago where it is typically a big, phat, meaty sandwich that is so good, greasy, messy, FILLING and less expensive even when I order it with hot peppers and onions. No comparison!!! Tootie should go to Portillos in Chicago and learn how to make this Chicago staple, don't skimp on the meat and make us 'Burghers some good food."}
{"text":"My wife and I have only been here a couple times but we will definitely continue going. The food is great, huge portioned and well seasoned. The workers have always been pleasant and open to conversation while they make your food. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Make sure get it with the pickled vegetables when they ask you. The beef sandwich is the best. It's slow cooked so it has a lot flavor, and at the same time it is very tender and soft."}
{"text":"I only had enough time and appetite for the beef sandwich. It. Was. Awesome. The owner was very nice too.  Can't wait to get back and try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick beef sandwich. Need to eat it rather quickly as it does get soggy. Guys working are nice and friendly. Great food to fix a hangover"}
{"text":"Order delivery from here about once a month. Typically get the Nicky T. Combo with the chilli as the side. Combo comes with a delicious homemade brownie (and i am a picky brownie fanatic) and it meets my satisfaction. There mac n chees side is just as good as there chilli side i would say. There meats on there sandwiches are very fresh and the seasoning and flavor is unique and A+ and what really makes your purchase worth the money. I guess the only very small gripe is you wind up spending around 20 bucks for a combo if you order delivery after you calculate in the delivery charge and tip. Which might be a little pricey for some folks factoring it is a meal just for one. But all in all i have enjoyed all my meals and will continue to order from this establishment the future"}
{"text":"Used Tapingo to get tootie's delivered - I didn't have any food in the house and they were the only place besides a pizza joint that offered delivery at the moment so I said \"hey, might as well try it!\"

Driver called me 5 mins before as well as when he arrived which I liked! 

I got my food, I had only ordered a 6inch Italian beef but the bag also had a container of mac and cheese!! It had bacon and it was actually really good. Pleasantly surprised.

As for the sandwich, the bread was super soggy but honestly I should've expected that as my meal was delivered and the beef is basically soaked in broth. I like my meat soaked in broth though so it's good. Probably would've been better on a harder roll, but I'm not sure if Italian beef is traditionally on a soft roll so I won't complain too much. Tooooons of beef on the bun, as well as some veggies. The veggies are why this didn't get a 5 star review, mainly because they seemed frozen or something. Also I'm not a fan of celery or peppers but I can easily pick those off. 

So, not sure I'll order delivery again because of the soggy bread but if I'm near the brick and mortar location I'll drop by!"}
{"text":"From Chicago this was the farthest thing from it.  The beef was just shredded in juice. Had no real taste. Bread was blah and giardinera was super week. Pittsburghers don't know the difference unless they have gotten real beef in Chicago before. This was not it. Won't be going back. Should be called shredded roast beef sandwich. Guy that served it was nice though."}
{"text":"This food was amazing! Karl, the owner, was super nice and gave is samples of his delicious food while we tried to make up out minds. 

Highly recommend the mac and cheese, and make your sandwich a need AND chicken!"}
{"text":"One of the few places that deliver to the slopes. Takes a little but of time but the food is coma inducing heavy in a good way. They'll get my business again when I'm drunk and starving."}
{"text":"Literally just drove into Pittsburgh and our first interaction with the city was the south side and Tootie's and what a great impression! The beef sandwich melted into the bread, amazing. It was spicy but balanced. And yes get the pickled veggies. Just do it. The mac and cheese ain't too bad either."}
{"text":"You walk down the street on the south side and this off the beaten path hidden gem practically calls your name. You walk in and are greeted by a huge wooden counter where all of the magic happens. The sandwiches are piled high with meat and made on fresh rolls. The chili is TO DIE FOR! It comes with I can only describe as a cornbread pancake and cheese sprinkled on top. I have never had anything that I did not like here. This is a must visit on the south side!"}
{"text":"Came through in a clutch! 
I'm visiting friends in town, and we had a really early dinner. Sitting in the hotel sipping on some wine, and I get hungry. The snack counter at the hotel I'm in is worse than gas station food. Knowing it was late I looked to see if anything open would deliver. Checked out Tootie's menu, called to place an order and was told it'd be 45 minutes. I was willing to wait, and super hungry. Not only is food super good, they delivered it faster than expected. 
I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. The meat was pretty good, but the bread was tasted like a hot dog roll and instantly became sopping wet, they ran out of cheese, and the vinegar marinated vegetables were absolutely disgusting. There was nothing on the sandwich besides the meat and the veggies and it cost $10 for a regular sandwich. I absolutely do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ordered the Italian beef sandwich - quite good and really enjoyed it.  

I also had the chili, which was also good, not spicy enough for my palette but that is likely a preference/regional thing as I am from the South. 

Overall, great food - especially for delivery, but the prices do seem a tad steep."}
{"text":"I was hungry and turned to Yelp for ideas. Checked a few filters, sorted by rating, and this place popped up on top. Never heard of them, but decided to give them a try.,

OMG! I am *SO* glad I did!

I ordered the \"Tootie Time #1 Combo\" and selected the Hungry Hippy (6\" pan fried tofu, teriyaki mushrooms, sauteed onions and green peppers, provolone cheese, marinara sauce.) sandwich and the (8oz) mac n cheese (with bacon!). The Combo also comes with a can of soda (Diet Coke in my case) and a brownie. All for $14.99. (With delivery, tax and tip, my total came to $20.)

The sandwich was to die for! The mac n cheese was kind of so-so, but what can help but be better with bacon? And the brownie was a very nice treat as well.

And in spite of a 45-60 min delivery estimate, the driver was at my door in just under 30! I haven't had delivery service that quick in I can't remember how long!

I am DEFINITELY going to be ordering again.  I'm thinking the Tootie Time #5 Combo
(6\" Barnyard, 16oz chili, 16oz mac n cheese, 2 sodas, and two brownies.) next time."}
{"text":"Tooties is awesome. Plain and simple. Stumbled upon this place while going to a concert in the South Side and what an awesome hidden little gem. The food is phenomenal, we loved the Mac n cheese and chicken. The owner couldn't have been more rad. He was kind, gave us samples, told us about his history. He uses family recipes which I think gives the delicious food that awesome little charm. You can also bulk order his food. We loved the chicken so much we bought some to bring home for dinner. Lastly, Tooties delivers...to MANY zip codes! I live in Garfield and they deliver from the South Side which I thought was incredible. Even great to order lunches if you work in Oakland. Not often that you find good food, awesome service, and charm all in one. Thanks Tooties."}
{"text":"One smart dude owns this place, piping his delicious smells through a duct toward the outside. Though Tootie's is tucked pretty inconspicuously half a block down a side street, wind carries the aroma pretty far into E. Carson. 

We were across the street at Local and when we left, the smell made me so hungry all of a sudden. I HAD to have this, but if my school campus has taught me anything, it's that this smell could come from anywhere... whatever it was. My friend was brilliant enough to ask the doorman. He pointed across the street and told us to get chicken and beef.

THANK YOU MR. DOORMAN. He must get paid to direct people here or just really love this place. I mean, how can you not? 

I was actually stuffed from dinner despite being fooled by the delicious scent, so we split the chicken and beef between the 3 of us. It was not cheap though. Almost $9.50 for a 6 inch. But it definitely made up for it in the flavor compartment. Also love that it wasn't just saturated with saltiness. Worth it? Maybe not $10 for a 6 inch. Some of the other items seem a bit cheaper. Ask for extra giardiniera, imo. Theirs is not spicy or acidic enough. 

The owner's a real chill guy. I'd be happy to support his business again and again. They are open late, so if you've got drunk munchies in the south side, come here instead of pizza (sorry Sal's).  It's goooood. 

NOTE: SMALL. 1 table, 3 seats, barely standing room."}
{"text":"When all I can say is wow I think that I might need a sixth star. This place was great. 

Tooties is located on 16th right off of Carson so as far as location goes it couldn't get much better. The place is slightly bigger than a mouse hole. There is space for the hot line, counter, a cooler and a single table with 3 stools. It's definitely geared toward takeout and delivery. But the space is warm and clean so I like it. 

The service is awesome too. I stopped in around 10 on a Thursday and the only one there was the owner. He was incredibly friendly and had samples for is without even being asked. Big points in my book. Getting our stuff after ordering took a little while but that was due to the fact that he had to make some of the thing we ordered from scratch. I am more than ok with this. It's nice to see a business put care and effort into their food and I will never complain about waiting for fresh cooked product. 

Now for the main event: the food. For me great food starts with a great aroma and the scent of slow roasted beef pervades Tooties. Your mouth starts watering as soon as you walk in. The sandwiches are awesome enough to backup the aromatic promise to boot. The beef is succulent and juicy. The bread is soft and chewy and soaks up all the juice. The giardinera is crunchy and tangy and the sandwich as a whole leaves a wonderful spicy sting on the lips for the better part of 20 minutes. I would also suggest the Mac and cheese. It is cheesy and creamy and awesome. They do use bacon in their Mac and cheese which is almost cliched nowadays but come on, bacon. 

All in all I loved Tooties. I can't wait to go back. They make a Chicago staple that I feel is a welcome companion to our beloved Primanti's in the late night sandwich pantheon."}
{"text":"They have the yummiest sandwiches. My boyfriend and I got the beef/chicken sandwich and honestly it was one of the best we've ever had. Plus, the owner is very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"St Patrick's day and had the best corn beef sandwich ever. Great people great
 place."}
{"text":"Why have I waited so long to try this place?!

One rare night while partaking in some Carson Street livations I walk by Tootie's and noticed the short line out the door. I though of some of the Yelp reviews of the place and decided to give it a try.

Once inside I realized that it was pretty much a take out shop as there really isn't anywhere to sit other than one small table which was already taken. If you can't decide which meat to get you can ask for a free sample to help make up your mind.

Your choices are four different types of sandwiches:

Famous Italian Beef (Slow-Roasted, Shredded, Seasoned Beef) available in 4, 6 or 12\" sizes. 

Hot Sausage (Uncle Charley's gourmet hot sausage) on a 6\" hoagie bun.

Tooties Famous Chicken (Slow-Roasted, Shredded, Seasoned Chicken) also available in 4, 6 or 12\" sizes. 

Specialty Sandwiches which are a combination of two or more meats, available in 6 or 12\" sizes.

Since the place is called Tootie's Famous Italian Beef, that's what I decided to go with. I went with the 6\" Juicy Italian Beef hoagie filled with Italian Beef, Giardiniera, and Provolone Cheese. I flew home to eat it as the smell was intoxicating. Let me just say that it was not only the best Italian Beef sandwich I have ever had but, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had period!

Tootie's Famous Italian Beef is a great sandwich to help you sober up after a night of bar hopping on Carson Street and is something different than going to Primanti's which everyone does.

 I highly recommend this place. Five stars!"}
{"text":"Had heard about Tootie's for a while now and finally made my way there on Saturday.  I had my beef \"Tootie's style\" with cheese and giardiniara, a truly unique touch!  The mac & cheese was very good, too.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"As someone who lives in southside, I've tried quite a few late night options after the bars are closed and I'm on my way home. Tooties, by far, is my favorite. It's right in the middle of all the action, but tucked in a side street enough so there's rarely a wait (like most of the pizza joints at 2am). Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The place is small and there is exactly one table and two chairs for those wanting to dine in. It's definitely more of a to-go place. The cook is super friendly and helpful. I tried their beef sandwich because I heard it's the most popular item. To be honest though, I did not think it was all that. The meat was on the bland side and the steamed vegetable didn't really spice things up much. I got bored after the first few bites. Maybe I didn't try the right thing. 

Overall, the beef sandwich here was just average. I honestly prefer Subway or Jimmy John's over the bland sandwiches at Tootie's."}
{"text":"The cluck sandwich was pretty good but I was extremely disappointed that my delivery took an hour and a half. It was ridiculous to wait that long with no apologies. Totally not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Tooties for a long time. Finally got over there to pick up a sandwich. It did not disappoint. Start with the bread. Soft, fluffy, and a little wet. Perfection. Melts in your mouth. Then the pickled veggies and peppercini give it is crunch and a little different flavor. The beef is flavorful and the perfect texture. I'd give it a 4.5 if I could. The only gripe I had was I would have liked to get a bit more of a cheese flavor. I couldn't even detect it in the sandwich. I'll ask for extra next time. Overall awesome sandwich and definitely going to be a regular in my household moving forward."}
{"text":"$16 dollars for a 12\" Italian beef w provolone?  Are u serious?  The beef is kept shredded and swimming in clear broth, the provolone which cost me an extra $2 was 2 slices and I ordered it 'Italian beef with provolone, NO peppers...' We found out on driving away that there was peppers on the full sandwich...!  I gave the guy a $1 tip and he couldn't even pay attention to my order.  The shredded beef has a decent flavor but real Italian Beef is slices of beef marinated in beef broth, NOT shredded beef with barely any texture.  I WILL NOT BE RETURNING...  YUCK...!  

Update: You can count on it Karl- there are way too many better sandwich shops on Carson that will get my order right and not charge me a fortune doing so..."}
{"text":"Good quality, delicious food. Fast and friendly service. Highly recommend stoping in and giving one of their sandwiches a try. A nice unique option when you need something quick."}
{"text":"Alright so I rarely write reviews but I have to for this place.  I absolutely love this food. The sandwiches melt in your mouth. The chili is the best I've ever had from a take out place.  Every time I order tootie's I always get a Nicky T, cup of chili with extra cornbread, a brownie and a san pellegrino.  They are also one of the only places with so many drinks to choose from.  The food is always hot and delicious and they always cater to my silly requests in equally silly and friendly ways.  An all around great establishment with a unique selection of food and a stellar staff.  I eat here pretty much at least once a week.

{"text":"refreshing new addition to the sea of mediocre pizza & gyro places along Carson .
no seating .  across the street from where former Pens player Max Talbot used to live .
i'll be back many times.  hope they stay in business ."}
{"text":"My hot sausage sandwich was delicious, my Chicago Chop salad tasted great, but wasn't chopped.  My only real issue was my Chili mac.  I ordered a large side, and what showed up was a half filled 6 oz container.  I was super bummed.  The few bites I had were great, I was just really disappointed, and a little shocked that there could be sizes smaller than what I received.

***Update

Super surprised, but a new large order of chili mac just arrived at my house.  Awesome customer service, and thank you."}
{"text":"Living in Pittsburgh for the month, and trying to find the best places to eat, and Tooties is at the top of the list! The juicy beef, mac and cheese, and chili are OUTRAGEOUS!!!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in on my way home from a movie at The Waterfront. It was about 20 minutes before they were going to close. I'd hate to have people stop in while I was getting ready to close, and I apologized, but they apologized back for it being a little messy!

I had a Groupon for a 6\" sub, and they were happy to take it. I don't make it over here that often, and figured I'd stop in since i was nearby. So glad I did. They told me it was good for any 6\", but I just HAD to try the Italian Beef. Loved them in Chicago, and I can tell you these are the real deal. Delicious roll stuffed with beef and giardiniera were fantastic, with a great tang. And couldn't believe that the whole thing actually held together better than the wrapper!

Can't wait to go back and try something else, but it will be really hard to steal me away from this outstanding combo! Easily as filling as a Subway footlong, but not even in the same taste/quality league!"}
{"text":"Tried this place today for the first time. I didn't like it all. Needless to say  I got a 6 inch Italian beef sandwich  which was extremely messy,can of pop and a can of pop for 11.00. Which I felt wasn't worth the price so needless to say I won't be going again."}
{"text":"OMG this is great! Undeniably the best steak sandwich on the Southside. I went with the 6\" beef as recommended by the counterman. I ordered 3 so I can share with the critics back at the house. After a 15 minute drive home I tore into this gorgeous,  stacked, steak sandwich piled high with Italian beef and topped with the spiced garden mix and WOW! I think the home crowd may have to get there own! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Yes.  That's all I really have to say.  Yes to Tootie's.

I stopped by last Saturday after the South Side Soup Contest to take advantage of $1 off sandwiches.  I didn't think I was hungry until I got home and started eating my Italian Beef sandwich.  And then I was sorry I didn't order 2.  The meat was juicy and flavorful and moistened the bread just enough.  If I still lived in the South Side, Tootie's would be seeing me way more often.

Tootie's is not very big so don't plan on staying to dine in.  The menu only includes a few items, basically beef or sausage and different sizes depending on your appetite.  Any place that isn't another bar is a welcome addition to the South Side!"}
{"text":"We ordered a variety of sammies for lunch today and were all in agreement that they were OK. We all agreed there was something missing. Some good provolone or something maybe. The spicy veggies were a bit much, but at least added some flavor to the sandwich. It just needed something else. Oh well, off to try another of the many places in the Southside next time."}
{"text":"This's a joke,, I ordered 2 sandwiches and they delivered only one when l called them they said it was a mistake and the other sandwich on the way, However after 1 hour waiting they told me that they wrapped the 2 sandwiches together that's why it looks one,, who dose that??"}
{"text":"I was not expecting to like this, but dear God, was I wrong. The sandwich I had delivered came with more meat than a Peppi's sandwich, and with flavor to match. The veggies took a backseat to the heroic meat pile stuffed between a bun, and although at first glance it appeared too small to count as a full meal, it was so dense that finishing it became a task. A delicious, food-coma inducing task. 

That said, this is definitely a \"sometimes food.\" While it's delicious as hell, I wouldn't get one every week. Just thinking about it is making my mouth water though... 

Don't let the name fool you. Tootie's has its food-game together. Go out of your way to try it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered from here tonight and it was delicious!! We both got the Italian beef sandwich and 6\" was more than enough to fill his huge appetite. I loved the giardiniera and pepperoncini that came on the sandwich. I love all things pickled and it was a nice surprise on the sandwich.  We did get some chili to split and I only had enough room for a couple of bites, but it tasted like chili mom used to make. We got the food delivered and the food came really quickly and was still hot when it got here. We will definitely be trying the food out in the store very soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwich. Juicy, little spicy very good value. Both the chicken and beef rock. Beats any Italian beef I've ever had."}
{"text":"I was driving through Pittsburgh from visiting a friend in West Virginia, when I decide to spot for lunch. That's when I decided to try Tootie's, which was a tough decision when Pittsburgh has so many 4.5-5 star restaurants. My experience can be summarized by saying Tootie's 4 star rating is underrated. I ordered a 4oz Italian beef sandwich and a side of Bacon Mac & Cheese. The Italian beef was juicy, spicy and delicious. I love how the bun soaked up all the flavor. The pickled veggies on top added a crispness and bite to the sandwich, which I loved. The polish guy working when I went was great, he struck up a great conversation. I wish we had a Tootie's in Rochester, NY. I hope one day I'll be able to return."}
{"text":"It's really hard for me to not give a 5 star review. The food was absolutely delicious. Like....I'm already thinking of when the next time I can order is. The roast beef is delicious and the pickled veggies really add a lot to the sandwich.

The mac and cheese is even better than I anticipated. Isn't all mac and cheese delicious? Not. Like. This. Absolutely delicious and soooo flavorful. 

Another key point is that they deliver to us! We live in Brookline and they deliver all the way over here which is extremely awesome!!!! 

The two reasons I had to take away a star (sigh..) is because 1) we put a note on our order for GrubHub to have the meat separated from the bread just so it wasn't soggy on the ride here. That did not happen, although we can possibly blame GrubHub (not sure how the ordering system works) Luckily, the bread truly did not sacrifice too much. It wasn't a big deal. BUT we also did not get the two brownies we ordered. Also not a HUGE deal except I was really looking forward to it and especially being pregnant, I wanted that brownie. ;)

All in all, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, and order form this place. You will not regret it. That was one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time. We are very very impressed and plan to spread the word! I'm already dreaming of my next Italian beef sandwich......



Update: changed to five stars for amazing service. They definitely made it right and it was completely unexpected. Also, brownies are delicious, too!"}
{"text":"Italian beef is a great import for Pittsburgh. It fills a hole which gyros and subs miss. I'll be glad when Carl succeeds sufficiently to add a better location. Good guy, really good sandwich."}
{"text":"You know that scene in When Harry Met Sally where Meg Ryan fakes an orgasm in Katz's? Well, that's the reason why Tootie's only has one table. One bite and your eyes will roll into the back of your head and you'll be making sounds you've never made in your life. These sandwiches are really *THAT* good. 

Try the Nicky T. - it's the best of both worlds with both chicken and beef. You'll wish you'd ordered at least two, so you may as well just give in.

Bonus: Small, family-run business, owned by a genuinely nice guy."}
{"text":"Umm Bacon Mac and Cheese on awesome sandwiches?!?! It doesn't get much better than this. Mac on a stick . One of the most underrated places around."}
{"text":"I decided to utilize my Eat24 weekend coupon to try out their original Italian beef and their mac n' cheese. It was a busy night at work, so I decided to utilize their delivery service as well. 

The food quality and flavor was only outdone by a speedy delivery that would rival that of a Jimmy John's driver! The ordering process was seamless, easy to use and accurate. I would add an additional gold feather in their cap, because they even followed the delivery instructions I added to the order to a T! 

Now, you might be curious as to why all of this good food and great service only elicited a four star review. Andrew Jackson is the reason for that. The portions weren't adequate to burn a 20 dollar bill. Then again, when you're tummy is rumbling and you're stuck on a night shift, no price is too high for quality food fast!"}
{"text":"Sub was pretty good. Got the farm. What I can't wrap my head around is why this costs $23. It wasn't as big as one would expect for a sub that expensive. Pretty dissapointed"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try an Italian Beef Sandwich for years but I haven't been to Chicago. Today I got a chance to stop in and get one today at Tootie's. Guy who was working was incredibly friendly and clearly had been working hard on a catering order but took the time to take care of me. Let me tell you this may be the best tasting sandwich I have ever eaten. I'm kicking myself for not getting a second one to take with me only because I live about 35 minutes away. Place is right off Carson St and I partied there in bars for years and never knew this delicious sandwich was just feet away. My stomach is trying to convince me to drive back tomorrow. That's how good it is. Straight addicted"}
{"text":"The Tootie's beef sandwich is a perfect cylinder of tastes, requiring neither melted cheese nor ranch dressing, Frank's nor french fries. Pittsburgh, with your gleaming bridges and mobs of blue collar drunks, this should be your signature sandwich. Primanti's is fuckin' dumb.

Also I love the pickled veggies. I would eat those alone as a side salad."}
{"text":"Delish Italian beef!  The recipe was perfected by the owner's mom  -- and it's worth every bite.

The menu is simple as is the space. In this case, simple ingredients deliver an awesome sammich."}
{"text":"Great Italian beef sandwiches! Italian beef is a Chicago staple, and I got hooked on them while living in the Windy City. Tootie's is as good as anything you'd find in Chicago.

Skip the gyro and pizza places that plague the Southside and go for an Italian Beef instead. Make sure you get it dipped!"}
{"text":"I REALLY enjoyed my experience here!  I had heard a lot of good things about the place and had gotten to speak to the owner one night after working at a bar down the street.  Sadly, he was closed up by that time.

I came back a few weeks later and he really bent over backwards to give us a good experience.  Where to begin?  I went there with my wife and two friends.  He set up seating for us outside, gaves us samples of his new chili, gave us samples of the chicken and the beef, the sandwiches were HUGE, and he checked on us regualrly to make sure everything was going well.  

I highly recommend this place.  Definitely different than all of the other food offered on East Carson."}
{"text":"Amazing flavors combine to make your taste buds tingle long after you finish the sandwich.its an amazing place,compact to say the least and I recommend calling in ahead of time,one time when I figured parking might be tight as usual I asked the proprietor if he would please bring it out to the car when I pulled up.outside since I have a hard time getting in and out of car due to hip replacement and he gladly did it,please tip this guy even if he is the owner.we need these little mom and pop places in the burgh,not the chains who claims they are pittsburgh best cause they put fries on yhe sandwich.I hope people realize slaw and fries are cheaper than meat."}
{"text":"Great hole-in-the-wall kind of place that serves a fantastic Italian beef sandwich for a cheap price. Make sure to get n extra helping of pickled vegetables to really add an extra kick to it.
The sizes seem smaller than they actually are. A junior is definitely enough for a moderate meal."}
{"text":"Tootsies is great for both dinner or a late night snack. The menu actually has a ton of options, everything from sandwiches to sides-love the mac on a chick sandwich. I had a hard time deciding what to order but the employees are extremely helpful and friendly. Michael was great at giving recommendations on the menu. It is an extremely small space so waiting for your food can get a little cramped but it's for sure worth it. Great place all around, if definitely recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Tootie's is delicious! A bit pricey for a 6-inch sandwich, mine was just under $10, but I would much rather pay for quality over quantity! 

I had a chicken/beef combo sandwich and I could barely finish the whole thing! It is PACKED with meat and provolone cheese and topped with pickled veggies. The meat was and SO tender and clearly slow-cooked with some love. They also have sausage and the option to put Mac & Cheese on any sandwich. I was quite disappointed the Mac & Cheese had bacon in it since I don't eat pork, but I imagine that will be good news for many others.

The place is SMALL, so it is not ideal for groups and honestly is best for take-out because there is only one small table that could fit 2, maybe 3 comfortably. The gentleman serving us was very friendly and nice to chat with! 

Please never go to Primanti again and eat here instead. You'll get a much better bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Delicious and simple. The Italian beef was extremely flavorful as well as the mac & cheese. 

Rather than a larger roll, the sandwich size difference is the weight of the meat. The smallest is slider size, then junior ect. Their menu is not just itailian beef. They offer other sandwiches like the one with chicken & macaroni & cheese (on a hoagie roll!)

I live in south side so I'm sure ill be back."}
{"text":"Oh my, finally had a chance to try this place and so glad I did!  The employee was awesome,  gave us a sample of the delish bacon mac n cheese. The sandwiches were melt in your mouth heaven! Will definitely be back, they also deliver!"}
{"text":"This place probably fits the definition of \"hole in the wall\" best out of all the restaurants I've ever been to. I would never have noticed it were it not for the sign pointing me to \"hot Italian beef\" on Carson. 

This place basically serves three different types of meats in sandwiches: chicken, beef, and sausage. Each is rather distinct, and the flavoring for all of them is not found elsewhere. One that really struck out was the usage of rosemary in the beef--very interesting. Even more appealing was the presence of all that juice that was still present in the meat and the sandwich; even before picking it up, the juice was just leaking out.

The owner there is extremely friendly, and it's obvious that he wants his customers to be satisfied. Also offered us a sample of mac and cheese without any inquiry from us--that was really nice. And checking in on Yelp or FB throws in a soda and chips for a buck more. And the fact that some very solid food is accessible until late into the night is so convenient. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"The best food I have ever ordered on delivery in any city ever. Much better than the expensive restaurant at my five star hotel. Had the best mac n' cheese I have ever eaten it my whole life and the shredded famous beef sandwich was also to die for. Amazing how juicy it was given it wasnt the least bit fatty or full of grease. If i lived in Pitt, i would order multiple times a week and weigh 200 lbs. Delivery was super polite and timely. Best delivery food in the USA."}
{"text":"Got a quick to-go order after work. Had the Italian beef sandwich and chopped salad.  Both were delicious and flavorful!  Both servings were very big. The owner was extremely friendly.  Will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Carl was way cool and has the best back story... An absolute must part of the sandwich experience!

Split a six inch beef sand b/c we were on our way to dinner, but Carl threw in samples of the mac and cheese and turkey chili as well...

Next time I'm in the 'burgh, will definitely stop in at Tooties!"}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall in South Side right off Carson Street. There's only one table but it's location doesn't require eat-in. I had the chicken with the giardiniera. It was delicious! My husband had the Italian beef with guardiniera.  Perfectly authentic like we were sitting in Chicago. Highly recommended for anyone traveling through the South Side!"}
{"text":"I am not the biggest fan of tons of spices. The fact that I am able to give this establishment a 3 is a testament to how good it is in spite of all the seasonings present. Been wanting to come in here for a while and finally made it in. Was a bit sad that I couldn't get any macaroni and cheese -- they were out of the sauce -- but I decided to go ahead and try the beef sandwich I had read so much about.

The interior of this establishment is VERY small, so be certain you have a plan on where to eat the goods.

I will eventually return, but until winter arrives I will most likely get my beef sandwiches at Donatelli's Italian Grocery in Bloomfield on Friday. Less seasoning just seems to be my thing."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites in the country. I'm originally from the west coast but I travel a lot and I love trying new food. When living in the Pittsburgh area I order delivery from here a few times a week. The owner is very nice and the food is always outstanding. My favorite is the classic Italian beef, however every sandwich has seemed to be a knockout. Sliders are a great way to try other sandwiches and the bacon mac & cheese is one of the best mac & cheese's I've ever had... it's an absolute must (as long as you eat bacon). Overall a must try in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"We ordered the food to go, it was hot and arrived to us in a timely manner.  The bacon macaroni and cheese was fabulous.  The almond salad was good and the raspberry dressing was tasty.  The salad was small and only fed two people.  I would recommend this to people."}
{"text":"Italian beef! If you haven't had authentic Italian beef, you need to try it, and Tooties is the only place I know in pittsburgh to get the good stuff."}
{"text":"BottomLine:
Destination? No
Fave: Pomelo San Pelligrino

I'm not getting all the stars people are giving this; it was OK but more a college late nite/hangover food. We were hoping the Mac N cheap was magic, and it is a bit different but it did nothing for us.

K for the chicken and sausage; roll was fairly standard. Nothing really notable about chix or sausage. Beef was Italian beef, in a juice making the thing a tad soggy (as was sausage).

Well get gyros or tacos a block away next time."}
{"text":"Best Italian Beef Sandwich in Pittsburgh.  No one even comes close.  Vegetarians need not enter, nothing for you here."}
{"text":"Italian beef sandwiches in the south side....heck yeah! Don't wast your time with gyros and pizza...the sandwiches here are amazing...getting it dipped equals out of this world! My bartender introduced this place to me shortly after it opened...and we haven't stopped eating here since. Dude is friendly as heck and I can't say anything bad about food or service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I'm glad that something like this has come to the south side. It is a welcome addition to all of the pizza places.

The food here is really great. Don't expect a sit down meal. It is street food. The guy who runs the place is very friendly and the food is awesome. They also take credit cards which is something a lot south side restaurants don't do. I have probably eaten here 5 time since they opened."}
{"text":"Tootie's is not gourmet or health food. Tootie's sells 2 types of meat - spicy Italian Beef and Sausage. You can get either on a sandwich or a mix of both. The sandwiches are very dense and meaty which makes up for the fact that a 4\" Italian Beef costs more than a Subway footlong. If you get the 12\" at Tootie's, you should also invest in a bottle of Tums. 

The actual storefront is tiny - with a counter and not much more. Plan to take your sandwiches in a bag to eat in the street or at home. 

As others have said, these sandwiches are a good counter-balance to the hot dogs, gyros, and pizza you can get elsewhere in the South Side. So far, I've only had the sandwiches for 2 very filling lunches, but I'm looking forward to enjoying them as late-night drunk food. 

Stop in if you're hungry for a filling, juicy, beef sandwich. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"That hot roast beef hits the spot when I'm hungry at night.  They're always open late and they deliver!  It's getting a bit pricey but it's still worth it.  I don't like the new menu with just descriptions of the sandwiches. The old names were cool.  The Farm is a great name for a sandwich."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of beef sandwiches and this was no different from any other.  

We had the beef sandwich with pickled vegetables. My favorite part of the sandwich was probably the bread, but the beef seemed to be lacking."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try Tooties for awhile now and having some work to complete, I ordered some take out due to them being one of the only places available to order from. Let me disclaim with the food is DELICIOUS. I mean that but the portion was all wrong. I ordered a half order of the fat boys soup, chili and chicken over bacon mac and cheese. While each component was delicious, the mac being my favorite....however I received much much less of it, and a little too much chili. Being in the industry myself, I have to be fair and say I maybe ordered at the wrong time. Would be willing to try again but I'm kindve disappointed."}
{"text":"This little hidden gem was such a great find during my trip to Pittsburgh! My friend was raving about the place and really excited to take me here. I can definitely see why! We were lucky that the night we went in the owner was personally serving us. He was extremely friendly and let us sample a few of the meats before we decided what we wanted. I went with a chicken and sausage which was so amazing, didn't realize I basically would get double meat (thought it would be split 50-50) but that's a problem I'll happily deal with, oh nom nom nommmm!

I will definitely be looking forward to visiting this place again on my next trip to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I came to Tooties after a night out with my girlfriends. I wasn't planning on getting anything since I eat a strict vegan diet, but I was so happy when the man offered me a sandwich that was totally vegan and INCREDIBLY delicious! He also gave my friend a free birthday brownie out of the kindness of his heart. I love this place! Definitely check it out! All my meat eating friends were raving about their regular sandwiches as well! Yummy and kind, my two favorite things!!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best sandwichs in Pittsburgh!! They have one flaw and that's pricing. The South Side of Pittsburgh has it share of ritzy comers and goers but consits a lot of poor college students and senior citizens who will often think twice about paying $15 for a footlong sandwhich. The prices are reasonable when you consider that it's just starting up but if they can chef up the 12'' for $7-8 in the future business will boom!"}
{"text":"I frequent the Southside a lot. So I was surprised to find out that this sandwich shop has been there for 2 years and I had never heard if it or noticed it. We tried it for lunch today and really liked it.  We realized that we actually had seen cars with their logo on top. It seems that most of their business is delivery. The place is tiny and there is one table to sit at that seats two. We sat at the table to eat. We talked to a couple of employees and they are all nice. 
We ordered a 6 inch chicken sandwich, 6 inch beef sandwich, side of chili, and a side of Mac and Cheese. The chicken was incredibly moist. It is cooked for hours and shredded. It is placed on a bun with a small mixture of carrots, cauliflower, and banana peppers. They are pickled so it brings a sour note and a crunch to the sandwich. Very good. The beef is just as good as the beef. There are other types of sandwiches to choose from also. The chili was a little thin even though it had beans and ground beef. It could have used more chili powder in my opinion. It's topped with grated cheese which is a nice touch. The Mac and Cheese was my husband's favorite. It is she'll shaped noodles with a creamy cheese sauce and a bit of bacon thrown in. You can even get it on your sandwich. 
It's a little place with BIG taste."}
{"text":"Had their chicken sausage. Was so good. The meat was juicy and so tasty. Ordered it for delivery and didn't take long and was still very warm."}
{"text":"Ever since watching my first Rick Sebak tape, I've made attempts to develop myself into the ultimate Pittsburgh tour guide--not for KDKA, but rather for my friends and family members that came to visit the city. Casually known to my visitors as a place of despair, consistently lame weather, and awful sports fans, I take pride in hearing the variations of \"Holy wow, I never realized Pittsburgh was so awesome\" at the end of visits.

And so, in my quest to spot out everything worth it in Pittsburgh, I stumble in to Tootie's on a Saturday afternoon. Greeted by the owner, he initiates friendly conversation before telling us that this is his mother's beef recipe straight from Chicago. I go ahead and order the smallest option, not expecting too much.

Biting into the sandwich was kind of like that part in the Wizard of Oz where all of a sudden everything bursts into vibrant color. Notice that the menu has one option: beef sandwich. Yeah, you can get a sausage, but that's just a small filler on the bottom of the delicious beef sandwich. If you really want (and I am wont to really want), you can add provolone, green pepper, onions, or even marinara sauce (they call it the Benny, named for the guy who runs the Rex and goes wild for the combination of marinara/onion/green pepper). 

Tootie's is the perfect addition to my Pittsburgh tour. Convenient location, open late, friendly atmosphere, and unbelievable sandwich. Ask for it dipped. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches, literally the best in pittsburgh #famous"}
{"text":"This place is hilariously bad. Chipped beef held on a hot table for hours. Not fresh after 11pm. Go during 6-8 for a good meal but the late night is terrible even if you've been drinking"}
{"text":"Delivered on time! Servings are pretty big and packed with protein. Overall, great food! Will try again!"}
{"text":"Excellent flavor.  In fact the Italian Beef is sooo good that I went home amd tried to make it myself. One of my new favorite sandwiches! 
The place is tiny, 1 table,  so plan on getting your order to go. 
The dude arrived late that morning so was running a bit behind on food prep so I didn't get to try any sides. 
It's been a couple weeks since I ate here and have told everyone they absolutely must try it once, you should too!"}
{"text":"These sammiches are delicious, juicy, messy- authentic. Some reviewers note that the bread gets \"soggy\". I think that's just the nature of the beast, yinz. I've had their classic, their hot sausage, and one topped with mac + cheese. All were delish, though the classic italian beef was my favorite. It really was a stunner, and I recommend it for your first trip or if you're unsure of which one to choose.

I also love that they deliver. I would eat here more often if my budget permitted."}
{"text":"I got the Italian Beef Sandwich (Large) and the bacon Mac-n-cheese (Side). I ordered this for delivery to the DoubleTree hotel and it only took 30 minutes. The food was good, but my knock is how expensive this place is. The \"Large\" sandwich was only a 6 inch sub roll. I guess I am just accustomed to a large being at least a 12 inch. I paid a total of $20.53. That included a delivery charge of $2.00 and a $3.50 tip. The food itself would have been a little over $15.00, if I would have went in, which I still think is expensive. I do not mind paying that much for dinner delivery at all when I am on the road, but not for a 6 inch sandwich....."}
{"text":"I didn't come to Tootie's Saturday night to have some grub prior to a rendezvous with Orange Goblin and Holy Grail at the Rex Theater. 

Oh, food was had, namely, The Barnyard, a whammy of a sandwich that consists of shredded, slow-cooked Italian beef with chicken (also slow-cooked and shredded), provolone, diced grilled onions, diced caramelized green peppers, and a link of hot (haute?) sausage inside a luxuriously pillowy, custom-baked 6 inch hoagie roll. The innards are so generously packed inside the cut of spongy bread, a fork is provided for your convenience so that not one iota of this Midwest import can be excusably discarded. 

No, I came to chat with Karl, the Chicago transplant who brazenly decided to move to Pittsburgh and bring with him to the South Side something most of us here have only seen Guy Fieri devour on television. While I munched on an egregiously toothsome hero in this closet of an eatery (luckily, the one small table in the place was unoccupied), we discussed food, bands, relationships, women, film -- we became friends. Making things especially cordial was the complimentary thimble of turkey chili Karl presented me with to gauge my opinion. \"Man, I'm not even nutters over turkey, but I dig this,\" I said to him as he slowly nodded his head while smiling like a DJ who had found his groove.

So yes, Italian Beef is a grand, gorgeous, splendid thing and not at all redundant. Eating it had me full of regret over not having traveled or lived enough. That must change. In the meantime, I have Mr. Horn to thank and his supple, humid, supremely edible grinders to serve as a reminder that Chi-Town awaits me patiently with the porchlight on and an empty seat at the table."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, the name is a bit different and the names of the sandwiches seem like jokes. Not only does this place give you something to laugh about, but they also give you amazing food. It's all very simple and delicious. Not at all over priced, super low minimum delivery fee. AND THEY'RE OPEN SO LATE. I ordered my food today and from the time I hit send on my grubhub order, it only took 12 minutes for them to get here. If thats not impressive. I don't know what is."}
{"text":"Tootie's is basically a carry out shop.  One high table and two stools....that is all there is.  

Very tasty italian season beef with perperoncinis on top with a few other veggies including onions.  Tasty, tasty, tasty.  Nice and filling.

The only other option on the menu is Sausage or a combo of sausage & beef.  Very friendly service."}
{"text":"I ordered the sausage and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese never showed up. I called the store and asked for it and another sandwich. This second sandwich and my Mac from my original order never showed up. When I called the store they said it had been delivered and I would need to talk to the owner and that I had to be lying. I'm not sure what the driver did with the order. It ended up being 20 bucks for a sandwich and chips. I would not recommend to anyone even if you were on a strict Italian beef diet. Not only did I not get most of my food but I was treated with disrespect and the 20 dollar sandwich wasn't even filling."}
{"text":"A refreshing new addition to Pittsburgh! Nothing else like it in the city!

You know when you make soup and the meat gets all tender and fine and bursting with broth? Yeah - that's Tootie's beef and chicken! There is so much flavor infused into it that you don't need anything else on the sandwich besides the cheese and pickled vegetables. 

Their chili is also fantastic. It's very different from your typical red-sauce chili as Tootie's is more like a thick, hearty soup loaded with meat, beans, veggies, nestled on top of a cornbread \"pancake\" and topped with a cornbread \"pancake\". A must-try!

Feeling non-committal? No problem, Tooties gives free samples!"}
{"text":"Got Tootie's delivery so I'll give this review with a grain of salt.

I was really interested in trying Tootie's, as many delivery places around Oakland are the same generic pizzerias with very similar menus.

I was very interested in their combo, as it is a pretty good deal and comes with a lot of food.

First, I got the chili. It was a little small of a portion, so I have to believe that it wasn't the same size as the regular side chili not part of the combo. It was tasty, not too spicy, and had a pretty delicious cornbread/pancake (which took up half of the dish).

As my sandwich, I got the Mac on a chick. This is where my preface of delivery comes into play. The chicken was very delicious and the roll was amazingly soft, but the Mac and cheese was dry and just tasted like noodles, but again, probably because of the delivery.

The best part of the meal was the brownie. I wasn't expecting much from a brownie from a delivery place, but it was the softest, most chocolatey brownie I've ever eaten.

I would definitely like to go to Tootie's and eat it fresh, although I've seen other reviews that it's a small place. Nonetheless, it was quite refreshing and a good change of pace from Oakland eateries."}
{"text":"I ordered from this place on Postmates. They sent me the wrong soda and sent me the wrong size of the bacon mac and cheese. I will not be ordering from this place again!"}
{"text":"This was an epic place! the best italian beef and sausage I've had. Awesome service, they grilled fresh veggies for me rather than give me the ones that had been sitting out, the guy did this on his own without me asking and at 12 am. He was funny and friendly. It made my day."}
{"text":"I've experienced much better for much cheaper. The bread was served soggy, the meat slathering had a strange scent of quality dog food, and the pickled toppings were too heavy on the vinegar/bitterness. Given the presumed local late-night crowd, and excess alcohol consumption, I'm sure this place can stay afloat, but Under no circumstance will I be back to Tootie's"}
{"text":"My honey stumbled ( literally...lol )  upon this little diamond in the ruff and we stumble ,walk ,run back as often as possible  We LOVE IT !!  Can't say enough..."}
{"text":"I wish I could give two reviews for this establishment.  The Italian Beef sandwich I had was quite tasty but everything else fell short.  Below is my order with details.

Italian Beef Sandwich  $12.33
  Large 8 oz.
  Hot Peppers
  Meat and Bread Separated for Delivery
Bacon Mac and Cheese L - $7
Fat Boy Soup - $15.99
$2 delivery fee

The Italian Beef Sandwich was the only highlight of this order.  It was separated for delivery (.39 up charge is worth it based on the bread they use) and I optioned to have hot peppers.  The bun wold appear to be a typical Restaurant Depot bulk roll, nothing special.  It had a 1/8\" slice of provolone on it stuck into the bread.  I'm guessing it was Lamagna provolone.  The meat had great flavor and was enough to fill the sandwich.  I would order this again or possibly go in person to try it in-house.  4/5 stars

The Bacon Mac and Cheese was not very good.  It appeared to be just oil with melted cheese and cooked bacon.  I was not impressed with this at all and definitely not worth the $7 they charge.  2/5 stars

Concerning the Fat Boy Soup, I'm not sure where to begin.  If I had only two words to describe it I would say 'hog slop'.  It was the aforementioned oil & cheese mac and cheese with some kind of over-cooked chili layered on top of it.  Now I am sure I will get the wrath of the overly sensitive owner/manager when I say this, but it was horrid.  It was DISGUSTING.  When beef is over-cooked, it turns into a somewhat sandy substance.  The protein structure is destroyed and what you are left with is little bits and pieces of what used to be meat.  This is what their chili was like that they put on top of the mac and cheese.  Tomato, beans, sandy meat over oil and cheese macaronis.  I guess that they make this in batches and keep it on heat for hours on end, possibly mixing old with new.  I had only 3 bites then tossed it.  Maybe that's why I didn't get sick?  1/5 stars because I did not throw up or have it come immediately out the other end."}
{"text":"Yum! Great for anytime but especially good for late night Saturdays!! Tastes homemade in the best way love it so much. I'll be back (this was my first time)."}
