{"text":"My ALL-time favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte!  Fantastic atmosphere in bAr area and amazing food!  Their homemade hot sauce is a MUST!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Mexican restaurant in south Charlotte.  My husband and I have been coming here for over 3 years now and the food is consistently fresh and fast with impeccable service by their always friendly staff.   The prices may seem a bit high compared to other local Mexican restaurants; however, a lot of Mexican restaurants in the area have greasy or over cooked food.  Not here!  I don't think we've had one bad meal in the entire 3 years we've frequented this restaurant.  We've recommended it to so many friends and family and will continue to visit this great local establishment."}
{"text":"We came here with a group of 15-20 year-old campers during a camping trip near Charlotte.  These guys were amazing to us.  The service was out of sight, with dozens of staff members filling our glasses and keeping our buffet filled with delicious food. The fajitas were great, and the guacamole was especially delicious.  Everything was fresh and perfectly prepared, which is hard to do for a buffet style dinner.  The atmosphere was fun and friendly, with a spacious dining area separate from the bar  and a really cool outdoor patio. Best of all was the service, which was friendly, attentive, and prompt.  We had a pre-arranged price given how big our group was, so there wasn't any specific incentive for the restaurant to be so nice to us.  They just seemed to take pride in their service and their business, which is rare and admirable these days.  My only regret is that we didn't have a chance to sample their great beer list or try one of the monster margaritas that looked absolutely mouth-watering!  I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town.  This is a grade-A business.  Two thumbs way up.  Thank you Salsa's!"}
{"text":"Best salsa I've ever had!! Great food, great staff, great drinks, great location!! One of my favorite places to eat, Drink & be merry!!   : )"}
{"text":"The food here was very good and service was quick. I got the sangria margarita and while it was tasty it was definitely weak on the alcohol. The ambiance is also a little lacking and could use some updating. But overall a good experience."}
{"text":"The food was exceptional and not bland like most typical Mexican restaurants. Price was a tad high but not enough to turn you off from coming again. All in all, this place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This place has great food, great value, good drinks and specials and they get food our pretty quickly. If you are looking for good Mexican Food and fun with friends this place is it."}
{"text":"Food was great!! Margaritas are everything!!!! Great selection! They also have drink specials! The chips and salsa is delicious! My New Mexican spot!!!! Must try!!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here an hour ago. Extremely sick. Called the restaurant to let them know and the manager did not care. I am still so sick and in so much pain. Asked to speak to the owner and the manager said no. Don't eat here.  I noticed some of the food was cold but didn't want to make a big deal i Of it since I was there for business. Terrible!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from out of town.  I ordered the chimichangas to go.  I enjoyed it, and the guacamole and pico de gallo that came with it.  I will go again while I'm here for the week."}
{"text":"So good. Food, drinks, and service. I come here at least once every time I stay in the local hotel."}
{"text":"Food has gone downhill from 2 years ago. Servers are kids...not trained well.  The steak in the tacos was chopped real small, dry and overcooked...not fresh.  Chips were cold.  Just not what this restaurant used to be.  And iced tea is now $2.75, which is sad, especially when the server doesn't come fill it up or add ice."}
{"text":"Had a great time food was awesome staff was great I recommend the chimichangas and the frozen margarita pitcher"}
{"text":"Food was so-so. I had the fish tacos and it was pretty bland/safe. It didnt see very authentic- there was no flavor! I had to use a bunch of their hot sauce/salsa to spice it up. That was also an issue- their salsa with the chips and salsa was bland. They served their house salsa w my food and it was also just spicy but not flavorful.  I would not come back.  I would gladly hit up a taco truck 3x for the money I spent here.   On a positive note- their specialty drinks like horchata and lemonade are humongus. And their desserts are massive as well."}
{"text":"This review has been a long time due for Salsa's. This place has great salsas (as it should!) and drink specials all week long. The service is quick and impeccable as they are very attuned to your requests.   The last time we came here we had literally 30-40 minutes to order, eat and get to our movie. They know my husband and I so well that we don't even have to ask for the various salsas or even drinks!   They have recently revamped their menu and have added many different dishes aside from their usual fare. There are many different vegetarian options as well that are very good. The side of vegetables that accompany many of the dishes are cooked to perfection with the right amount of seasoning. The portions are rather large and can even be split between 2 people.    My only qualm would be their house margarita - I do not care for the pre-mixed drinks that are more sour mix than tequila so I steer clear of that. Other than that, great choice for any meal, even an impromptu quick weekday dinner."}
{"text":"Got the fajitas combo steak chicken and shrimp the dish was excellent. Also had the Jumbo strawberry margarita very good but very pricey. Bartender waited on us and he was very good."}
{"text":"We went for a business lunch on a Wednesday. The servers were attentive and speedy. Our group of 10 seemed to all enjoy their food. I had the vegetarian quesadillas.  They were very tasty and I had the biggest plate on the table.  The atmosphere was fun, but relaxing enough that we could talk to each other in normal voices. There were flat screen TVs in the corner running SportsCenter. I would love to come back and try the chimichangas. They looked amazing!"}
{"text":"First visit and certainly will not be the last....very good. The salsa is perfect served  with warm tortilla chips   I had soft shell shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"When I crave Mexican, all I really ask for is a good margarita, decent rice, and some cheesy meaty goodness wrapped in a tortilla. Unfortunately, salsa's disappointed me in all of these areas. The margarita was watery, the food was mediocre, and the only promptness I saw from the bartender was when she brought there check. I'll stick with taco bell next time I want crappy Mexican and slow service."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Been a few times and never disappoints. Their food is fresh and authentic. I love their chicken fajitas."}
{"text":"OK, like everything in this little area.  The price was alright, my burrito was alright, the salsa was alright.  There's got to be a better place close by!"}
{"text":"The food is ok. My favorite is the fried ice cream. The staff are so so. We had to keep getting Ho to get out waiter/waitress because they weren't very attentive. It's a little overpriced for the quality of the food as well but if you're just trying to quickly satisfy a craving it gets the job done"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. The veggie quesadillas, spinach enchiladas, and burrito tequila are at the top of my list. All three pair nicely with a Victoria or glass of red.  The service here is excellent! We have always had a great experience whether lunch or dinner - the staff is the best!"}
{"text":"Although not close to my area, well worth the trip. The camarones diabla are great and the carnitas are awesome."}
{"text":"This location was moved from Sardis rd. We frequented that location because the food and service. The new location is good as well. I always get the same thing so I wasnt disappointed. Its not great but its good. Growing up on Mexican food I dont go for authenticity. Overall its tasty fast and in a great location."}
{"text":"Overpriced, generic Mexican in Ayrsley, Salsas just isn't that good. The Salsa is bland as is most of the food. The drinks are expensive, you can do slightly better around the corner at Don Pedro's  Read More: http://eatitcharlotte.com/2016/02/28/salsas-mexican-grill/"}
{"text":"I love Salsa's! I came with a group of probably over 30 people, we were all camping near Charlotte. Therefore, it was probably a tough job handling all of us. But they went above and beyond! We had fajitas with delicious toppings like cheese, sourcream, and amazing guacamole! Many of us had this delicious mango drink, and the servers were incredible! Don't hesitate to try this place out! It won't let you down :) Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food we've had in a long time maybe ever... Great food, service, and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit but friends said the menu has changed. There are other items I will try when I return to Charlotte. We ordered a margarita pitcher with house tequila. I had the calamari. The serving was generous enough to share as an appetizer but it was my meal. It was much better than expected; hot with heat and spice. One of my friends had the fish taco that he also enjoyed. I can't recall the 3rd dish but there were no complaints until it got close to closing (11p).  We arrived at 10p. The lights come up, the music stops which is acceptable.  the server damn near wiped the table down while we are still seated and nibbling on our well prepared dishes. He started pulling plates and glasses sometimes without asking if we were finished. We didn't appreciate that. We weren't lingering and we were not the only table still seated at 11p. If the staff is not prepared to seat a party at 10p for dinner and drinks they should have bar only seating for drinks and/or appetizers only."}
{"text":"It's on a decline.  When my husband I first went there it was really good and servers were really cheerful.  After a few years it wasn't the same.  The food went from great to cheap.  I order a chicken dish most of the time and in the beginning no issues towards the end it was chewy.  So we don't go back."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience.  We used to come here all the time as our go to Mexican place.  We have just recently moved back and decided to try it again.  We will not be going back anytime soon.  The service was very slow and communicating with our waiter was next to impossible.  My husband ordered steak fajitas and the meat was chewy and had a strong flavor.  As for the veggies, it was mostly tomatoes.  He loves onions and there were only 5 slivers of onion on the whole plate. They weren't busy, so that wasn't the issue.   Very disappointing but live and learn."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! Located in a lovely atmosphere which looks more like a small town than a shopping mall, we expected more. Although there was a quiet room near the entrance we came in, we were directed to a sports bar-like area in the back. The food was good, but we could hardly enjoy it with a football game being blasted near us. Not only that, but there was a different sport on the TV's all around the room. The bartender and servers seemed indifferent to the fact that only one person was watching a TV at the bar with the game on, and the rest of the room had on a different sport!  The food was good, but we would never go back to a place that did not make us feel comfortable! Not with so many other Mexican Restaurants in town."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a marg and quesadilla. Not a good drink at all, but the quesadilla was nice and cheesy and the guac was yummy."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to visit Salsa's over the weekend.   I was starving so I ordered the Fiesta Platter which comes with a chicken and steak quesadilla, chicken flauntas and grilled shrimp on top.   Yep...all that. I said I was starving!   The quesadilla was a bit different. Instead of the meat and cheese being cooked inside the tortilla, it  came out topped with the cheese and meat over lettuce. It was pretty good. I wish they wouldn't put it over lettuce though, it made some parts a bit soggy. But that's a minor issue, because overall the dish was very tasty. I was also really pleased with the portion size. The shrimp were cooked perfectly. And they had just the right amount of seasoning. Delish! My only issue was the flauntas they were a bit blah....not enough favor for my liking. But still overall this was a really good dish! I'd definitely order it again.   But still this is a pretty good spot to get your Mexican fix!"}
{"text":"Great service! Fun environment! Queso has great flavor. The bar tender and servers are so kind. The Crystal Ball drink was awesome!"}
{"text":"Just picked a random restaurant in the area and went to Salsa's.  They have a $6.99 fajita special on Fridays and it was great.  Plus a complementary full basket of nachos and salsa to boot.  I ordered the Mango juice and it came in a huge beer glass (2 pints??), couldn't finish it all.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"For a mexican restaurant, Salsa's was decent.  There food is good and their margaritas are tasty.  I love chips and salsa and thought they were good here.  I'm not a tortilla chip conseseur like Joseph L.  If the chips are fresh and cripsy I am a happy camper.  The fried ice cream was delicious.  Chi-chi's was about the last time I had fried ice cream at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Food and service were both incredibly lackluster. We had a rather large party of 10, however we were only one of a couple tables seated, with a couple more people sitting at the bar on a Saturday afternoon. Our waiter was very nice, but he seemed incredibly overwhelmed. He was manning both the bar, and all of the tables. This was despite the fact that there were several servers working however they all seemed to be in the back of the restaurant doing busy work. The poor waiter who was helping us was given no help from his coworkers. This culminated in a rather poor thing experience.   My boyfriend and I ordered nachos from the appetizer menu with high expectations as nachos are really difficult to mess up. I've never had a nacho I didn't like. Until Salsas. While the cheese and toppings were plentiful, the chips were almost nonexistent.  At one point, we asked our waiter if he would bring more of the free chips they serve and he replied he would be right back with them. However, his attention was quickly pulled back to the bar and we never received more chips. Our nachos were only about 1/3 eaten and by then became a soggy mess. We had to throw them out.   Had anyone of the 4 or more extra servers jumped in and helped this poor waiter/bartender, perhaps our particular experience could be saved. However, to their credit, the rest of my parties meals looked good, and they seemed to leave satisfied."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but their drinks are what will bring you back. The $20 pitcher of margaritas are awesome."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a busy weekday and we were in n out within 40 min with great food with great service. Even the place was packed, we did not had to wait at all to get a table, very well organized seating arrangement. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. I typically do carry out so I cannot speak on the service too much but they are always friendly when I come in. The traditional chicken quesadilla and the queso are both so good!"}
{"text":"My family and I go to Salsa's whenever I'm visiting. We went today for my daughter's birthday lunch and once again had a wonderful time. The service was amazing. Everyone is so friendly and they even treated my daughter to birthday dessert. Our drinks were delicious,  I had a yummy jalapeñorita. The beers were ice cold! Our server was attentive and made us feel genuinely welcomed. The food was tasty and plentiful ( beef empanadas,  ensalada del Mercado,  steak chimichangas, margaritas, calamari and Cooronas). Great place!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch.  Accommodated special request to have Chorizo added to a dish.  Generous portions of guacamole when ordered as a side.  Prompt and attentive service"}
{"text":"I love the fact that this restaurant has a separate delivering service where they can bring the food to you $20 dollar min is okay with me. Especially when the food is good! I will recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants some good Chinese food."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant while in the Charlotte area. Seeing that it is in a shopping center, the restaurant has a pretty good size--they were able to accommodate my 30+ coworkers while there for a business dinner. I was not impressed by their beef or chicken impanada or their saled (the ranch did not taste like traditional ranch dressing). My chimichonga was ok, but if you are used to your chimichonga shell being soft, make sure you tell them NOT to deep fry it. The Chimichonga is a very big portion. I tasted their lime(house) margarita and was not impressed. But I also had the strawberry and a mango & pina colado swirl margarita (VERYYYY GOOD). You can ask them to mix the flavors if you like. I am not a fan of tart margarita's, so I would not recommend the house margarita but I would recommend any another flavor--mango, strawberry, etc. The Chips, salsa, and queso dip were RIGHT on the mark and did not fail me! Salsa was not to spicy and queso was sooooo good! If you go on Monday nights, they have drink specials so be sure to ask your waitress! If I was to go only for chips, salsa, queso and margaritas-- I would give them a 5 but due to their food I would have to say a 3!"}
{"text":"Stay away, bad drinks, cold food, and complete lack of concern for the customers experience.  Really mean it, stay away."}
{"text":"It was such a beautiful day to sit outside and have lunch. Our waiter watched the clock for us to have a margarita (12 on Sunday), and the salsa was the best that  we've had in a long time. I had the lunch fajitas and it was a perfect size and I really enjoyed them. This is a perfect spot before a movie   I highly recommend Salsas!"}
{"text":"This is restaurant fail 101. Poor service, so so food, worst of all was trying to pay the check. It took an extra 10 minutes or more to figure out the 3 of us paying, error after error before we just paid to get the hell out of there. Worst communication I've ever experienced and I am a former restaurant owner. In a price value evaluation,  I believe quality of food and service were poor and inferior to other similar establishments. Would suggest if you get to the door, TURN AROUND, GO ELSEWHERE,  unless you want to waste your time and $$. One star is actually all I can give, would have been a 1/2 star."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Mexican food, stay clear of this place. I got the most basic dish. It was a combination 2 taco shredded chicken plate, crunchy. They brought me chips and salsa on the house. They do have really good chips and salsa. My order came after 3 mins of ordering. Suler fast. I swear they use the crunchy tacos from a box.not authentic or tasty. The shredded chicken was lukewarm and had no flavor made my stomach feel queezy. The beans were ok and the rice was flavorless. The service was not so great. I would rather eat the Mexican food at Macs Speed shop rather than come back to this place."}
{"text":"We love this place!! Food is awesome, service is great! They have a nice outside patio. My favorite is the pollo con queso . The Salsa is amazing too."}
{"text":"Great meal! Literally the only complaint I can think of is that the food came out fast. We started out with margaritas which were delicious and had just the right amount of alcohol. We had queso (delicious) and chicken chimichangas. The service was attentive but not overly so. Would definitely so back if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"Been living around Arysley area, my friend and I wanted to go for a quick dinner and decided this place. The location is a die for with the nearby movie theater, hotels and colleges. Though not crowded I love the Arysley neighborhood for it's beauty and calmness. Having trusted the restaurant here would be as good as they look we decided to pitch inside.  Don't get misled by the bright neon lights and pub like appearance from outside. Entering inside the pub I was disappointed by the tiny little tables and chairs. My friend and I are regular adults at about 160lb but trust me the chairs were too small for our rear. The place seemed over packed with lot many tables than it could hold.  We were offered chips and salsa in a tiny little bowl - the chips weren't crispy and were pathetic. We didn't even touch it. I ordered an Enchilada and it came on a smaller plate than I expected. The taste was just bland with some white gooey stuff which they call cheese. That's when I decided never to return here again.   This is one of the few Mexican restaurants where I got out as hungry as I got in. Barely filled my stomach. Unless you want to go to Alice's wonderland where every thing is super tiny and minuscule, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a Sunday in the Bible Belt. Being the sinners we are we enjoyed margaritas and chips and salsa as our meals were prepared.   The atmosphere was somewhat eclectic. It seems that it couldn't decide between being a night spot or a Mexican Café. Glitter balls on the ceiling of one half of the room, more of an al fresco dining area on the other. There is an outdoor area for dining. Which is very nice.  We had kids with us, so we ordered a kids app platter, my husband had the Tequila burrito, and I had shrimp tacos Mexicanos. Kids platter was all fried, not the best option but hey we are on vacation.   My tacos were sloppy and bland. Really bland. I guess that is what I get for ordering something off the menu.    Hubby's Tequila Burrito was cheesy and very spicy. It was delicious and made me jealous. Would recommend getting a specialty.   Drinks and service were great, but food was 50/50."}
{"text":"Came in on a rainy Saturday prior to going to a movie. Chips and salsa were brought immediately to the table. Chips were warm, salsa had a nice small amount of heat. I ordered the Burrito California with chicken. The green peppers in the burrito were not cooked fully, otherwise it was a tasty burrito. I ordered a small side of guacamole- it had a good lime and cilantro taste, which I love. Reasonably priced, typical \"quick\" Mexican food. Would I go back, maybe. Would I recommend it, sure, if that's what you are looking for."}
{"text":"Loved the service, food was authentic and very tasty. Tortillas were solid but not like those from texas"}
{"text":"Awesome place. The food and drinks were great. The staff was very friendly and helpful when selecting things on the menu. As an out of towner, it was really nice to stumble in on a place where it seems they have a regular clientele and know what they're doing to accommodate their patrons. If I'm ever in town again, I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the service is superb! Adrian is the best server in the place! He's funny, friendly and of course, if you end up being a regular, he always stops to chat. The food is excellent and portions ate definitely generous! By far the best in the Steele Creek area! Cook time is usually quick as well. They're Queso and Guacamole are so good you won't be able to finish your meal because you filled up beforehand! I would definitely recommend coming here for any meal!"}
{"text":"This is our go to spot. Yummy food, drinks, and very nice staff. If you're not looking for an alcoholic drink, try their homemade lemonade! We will be back!  Oh yeah, very fast service as well. That's always a plus!"}
{"text":"I just happened to come here with my boyfriend to eat lunch before our movie because it was close to the theaters. I got the pollo con queso and my boyfriend got a burrito. They're both amazing!! There were only two other parties in addition to us, likely because it's New Years Eve, but that made our service so much faster. It seemed as though we got our food in 5-7 minutes after ordering. Not to mention, the chips and salsa served as free appetizers were delicious."}
{"text":"The tequila burrito with steak is a must try!!! So flavorful!!!  The kids choices are great too!  Loved that they offer fruit as a side!"}
{"text":"I came on a day at lunch when they were super slammed due to a conference in the area. That said, the service was still very good even if I did have to wait a bit to be seated and get my food. The chips and salsa were obviously fresh, and the tamal was authentic; an all around delicious meal. Will be back for happy hour soon to taste the margaritas!"}
{"text":"Hostesses were horrible and the manager. Hostesses reached over table to pass notes while we were eating and didn't apologize.  Manager came over and excused service saying they were overwhelmed.  I was taught by the age of 4 not to reach over someone's food while they are eating.  No excuse"}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the margaritas and the service is outstanding! It is authentic gourmet mexican so it is average price, not too cheap but not too high either. LOVE LOVE LOVE the food!  Pollo con Queso and Queso Fundido is amazing!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. The tequila burrito with beef was pretty oily and the chips were maybe a day old. The only reason it got 3 stars was because the beers were priced just right. They helped to cut through the grease and oil."}
{"text":"Not a stand-out Mexican place, but still passable. I had the Burrito Tequila, which was jammed with thin flank steak and HUGE! Staff was friendly. Make sure you ask for Big Papi when you get there. He'll take good care of you."}
{"text":"Slow service, mojito tasted like watered down sour mix, received incorrect order, and veggies for veggie fajita were without any sort of sauce, just a sprinkle of seasoning. It gets one star for the outdoor dining area. I left without finishing my meal because I was so disappointed. Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Everytime we come to Charlotte, we go to Salsas. We love this place! Awesome pitchers of margaritas. Awesome chips. The salsa is good and queso is amazing. We had chicken burritos, enchiladas, and pork carnitas. Everything amazing! Mexican food is not as good in Connecticut where we live. Check this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"A few days ago I was looking for The claim\" Best Burger in Charlotte\" at Eat Here Now a burger joint. They where closed so I went across the street. First of all I have found  many places that are very good when I have been looking to dine at another place  and for what ever reason I did not make it  so the odds where for me that what ever I found I would want to go again.             I am not Irish at least I do not think so, that may have been why the luck of the Irish let me down on this one.Here is the run down location Ayrsley  Town Blvd area a busy area with a mix of restaurants, a movie theater, A sports bar that I have already reviewed   and was terrible. This is a  prime location  and any restaurant  owner would give their first born for this space.And their second born for that matter.             As you may have read I am a Chips and Salsa person I make my own chips and salsa of many kinds so if you got chips, Salsa and beverages you got me . More about that later. As I walk in you pass threw  a pretty nice little bar area  with only 2 people? In this busy location? What gives I thought?             So we make our way past the decor that any Mexican restaurant has I notice I guess maybe 5 maybe more very large  flat screen TVs so now you have a bar and Tvs  Ok sports bar ?The place was pretty clean and a patio outside in the back that I though when the weather gets cooler would be packed or should be..             We get our chips and salsa Ok with the name of Salsa's you better bring it.!!  There is something about  using certain names of the food that you have in a restaurant that tells the customer \" with that name surely its good/\"I know your still waiting on the chips and Salsa report  we will get to it a moment .              I have to give it  to them they make a mean Mango Daiquiri but, it took forever considering there was only 6 people in the whole place and 4 of them where finishing  .And I normally do not ask about the price  but, the menu that I am looking at does not even have them listed nor the price I felt that very strange for a Mexican restaurant  at  such a good location (again) Why not have it on the menu?                I had the El Presidente a combo platter withTostada,taco,Chile Relleno and my other  wanted Carne Asada typical  Mexican restaurant chain restaurant food big  cold plates and heated up in Broiler just so so taste and not much  authenticity .Oh ya back to the chips and Salsa chips stale over heated I hope what I have heard is wrong that the chips are reheated off of someone else s plate that's terrible. And the salsa watered down no flavor . Just a FYI I had some chips that I had made the Day before and I tasted some of mine and the \"Fresh\" ones we just got home with... Theirs where terrible !! Come on no excuses 6 people in the place it takes me about 1 minute to make enough chips to feed 4 . Maybe a Taco Bell would do better at \" this\" location?"}
{"text":"Try the Burrito California!! It is amazing!!! Saturdays they have $.99 Coronitas, $4.00 wells and $7.99 premium margaritas"}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night with a group of about 30 people.  The service was prompt and friendly.  Our wait staff made sure the everyone had drinks shortly after being seated. The Mojitos were delish as were the Margarita's according to my companions.  I had the Burrito Tequila, which was huge and scrumptious!  The rice was fabulous and the guacamole chunky and mouth watering.  This place is definitely on my list to revisit."}
{"text":"The service wasn't that great at first, took a while to even order our drinks. When our waitress finally came around she was alright, sweet and attentive. The food came out fairly fast, but it was really bland and that \"red sauce\" is super gross. I do not recommend the veggie enchiladas or the veggie platter; not tasty. I guess I give it two stars because the Horchata was pretty good and our waitress was nice, but that is about it. Will not be returning and can't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and normally would give them 4 stars but this last time we had horrible service and I was charged twice for extra cheese with my dish when I did not revive it the first time and complained. I also can't give them 5 stars because their margaritas are over-priced and they don't list prices on their drink menu. Not even for soda! I'm pretty sure I've been charged different prices for the same drink before since I frequent the place."}
{"text":"Stood at the door for a long while before anyone bothered to seat us. Then they brought out the chips and salsa. The salsa was fantastic, unfortunately it was served with thick, stale chips. I ordered a house margarita on the rocks. It was bland and tasted watery. I ordered the steak fajitas. They were very good and the salsa verde was delicious. My husband got the street tacos and said they were very good. I tried to order dessert, but they were out of the fried cheesecake, so I skipped it. They did offer to make fresh coffee. The prices weren't terrible, but for the so-so taste it was overpriced. Overall we probably won't go back (mostly because parking is impossible). One thing is for sure, they live up to their name.... the SALSAS were hands down the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"We gave this place a second chance and were even more disappointed the second time.  Margaritas were disgusting and over-priced.  Food lacked flavor, except for the burrito which was unbearably spicy.  We will never be back"}
{"text":"The food is slightly above average and drinks my wife and I had are weak. The service was so so on not a very busy night and the rice and beans weren't very hot when served. The chips and salsa were pretty good but I really think the place is a bit overpriced"}
{"text":"Our service was fairly quick and the staff was friendly. However, the food was very bland, cold and did not look appetizing. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Overall the food was good - the rice, vegetables, and margaritas were delicious! The chicken, unfortunately, was slightly chewy and had no flavor. If it weren't for pairing the bites with cheese and rice it wouldn't have been worth eating. The salsa and cheese dip had great flavor, however!"}
{"text":"This place does not deserve 4 stars, the food was ok but nothing exceptional. The guacamole was tasteless which was disappointing and the rice was a bit too spicy. Shrimp was good though."}
{"text":"Overpriced ($76 for a couple) and the staff was rude. As we were leaving we could not get the door open-manager at the front said they lock it during cold weather... I'm pretty sure this is Against at fire code... We will not return. Not worth the money"}
{"text":"Love their sopa de pollo.   Tortillas are great and the salsa is fresh.   Beer specials $1.99 for any pint,  including craft IPA,  make this place a great watering hole too."}
{"text":"This is a solid 2.5 as I've had better tex-mex even in Charlotte.  The daily specials saves them.  The drink specials may help some.  For me, I don't have to have it because the chips don't sell me BUT I rounded up to give favor for a 3 star versus 2 stars because 1) They are locally owned 2) They run daily specials even on weekends 3) They run drink specials for those of you that drink.  4) I can respect any fajita special although I'll warn you not to order the beef here it's the cheapest chuck I've ever seen.  5) Free parking    That's about it.  They offer an Arysley discount but I've only ever ordered a special so you can't double dip (as no one should want to considering the #1 point, above)"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout while staying at the hotel on the corner for business. Friendly service and food was ready in 10 minutes. Still hot when I got back to my room, a short walk. I ordered carne asada tacos, which they kept calling Mexican tacos. I assume they are the same. Food looked delish but had very little taste. Carne asada has cilantro and onions, both of which the lady said were in this, but I can't taste either. The meat is fresh and would be great with more taste. I really wanted to love this!"}
{"text":"Salsa's is a great little Mexican spot in the town of Ayrsley.  We used to go there almost weekly when we lived in Steele Creek.  The veggie quesadilla is excellent.  Carna Asada also delicious.  Portions are large.  Drinks are fantastic, great beer selection and yummy margaritas.  Salsa is soooo good.  Really nice outdoor seating area but comfortable indoor restaurant as well.  We miss going there now that we've moved to the other side of Charlotte but we try going back when we're around there."}
{"text":"Location for me was awesome, across the street from my hotel. Staff was very nice. Drinks were great(try the jalapeño margarita). Restaurant was also clean. The food was very meh. It was very boring and bland. No heat in the salsa, tasted like purée tomatoes."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Salsa's Mexican Grille since 2009! This restaurant is Ayrsley Towns NUMBER ONE hidden gem. During my college years, I lived at Colonial Grand at Ayrsley. Needless to say, I've watched this town transform into what it is today. My roommates and I would come here often, today the meals are a little pricey. Out of all the restaurants that have come and gone, Salas's Mexican Grille has continued to stand strong.  Personally, I love the Jalapeno Margarita! Here are a few of my favorite meals:   If you're a seafood Fan, I would recommend trying the \"Seafood Fajitas\". This dish is served with fresh scallops, grilled tilapia, and jumbo shrimp. Talk about sizzling perfection! This dish can easily feed three people.   The Steak Quesadillas are really good and filling. You also get a side of lettuce, sour cream and pico de gallo.  Dessert anyone? Try the Fried Ice Cream you won't be disappointed! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside."}
{"text":"OK, but don't talk about customers when they are 3 feet away. I went in for lunch by myself, went in the street door, they sent me back to a waitress/hostess station to be seated.  Other people came in after me ( I was there shortly after they opened) and they let them seat themselves where they wanted.  The waiter seemed upset I was not ordering a mixed drink, I was just looking at the menu to see what they had for future visits.  The food, taco salad was okay...then I waited and waited and waited about 25 minutes for my bill, which was not brought by the person who originally waited on me, I asked for a tea in a to-go cup, the girl said unsweet, I said no sweet, she said okay, unsweet, they brought the bill, which I already had the money out for and left it. Then brought tea, I asked was it sweet, she said unsweet, I told her I had asked for sweet, they finally took the money for the bill, and then the original waiter finally came back and asked did I need the bill.  I heard this girl laughing and telling someone at the station that I kept changing my mind back and forth, no I ordered sweet tea from the beginning.  If you are going to laugh at customers and complain, you should not do it three feet away from them."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Pina Colada before a movie and had some time to kill. The chips were OK, while the salsa was better than average.  I felt my drink was overpriced at around $10 and was quite surprised when I got my check. It had very little alcohol in it."}
{"text":"Ayrsley is definitely a busy shopping complex that is convenient to I-485 and Tryon.  I mainly go here for the movie theater, but it seems like there are a lot more places opening up that would keep me hanging around longer. PSH and the Beer Temple are good adds and there seems to be something for everyone.  Salsas has been here for a while, but I think there's probably a good reason why I haven't made it in for a while.  Everything was okay... I was a little skeptical because a couple of previous yelp reviews/photos made the place sound worse off, but I'd say it's a solid 3.  Walking in, the hostess wanted us to sit at the bar, but there was some confusion and we wanted a booth.  Unfortunately there was large table of 20 people that lined up along the booths so it was a little awkward to get in... and I'm sure the server would have preferred us to be at the bar instead.  Whatever... I guess maybe don't push all the tables together to block off the booths?  As a result of the tables, you could tell the server was having a hard time going in and out and checking in on us.  I was left with an empty water glass for half the meal.    Had it be any other day, I'm sure the service would have been fine.  The food was nothing to write home about, but it was a decent portioned dinner.  Probably priced a little higher than a typical tex-mex place, but I guess it's the Ayrsley area."}
{"text":"Video of food below....  https://instagram.com/p/Bhpmg7snNVE/  I visited this restaurant 2 weeks ago. The staff members were very attentive & that's what I call \"Customer Service\"!   To start ~~ I ordered the house chips & salsa with a Jamaica Margarita & it was delicious!! I  For my entree I had the POLLO HUASTECO ~ marinated chicken breast topped with a layer of barbecue sauce, queso sauce and a slice of pineapple. Served with Mexican rice, beans, lettuce and sour cream!!! The bbq sauce & queso combo paired well with the chicken.   Fun fact: I am a lover of all things spicy!  Spoiler: They didn't have a house hot sauce :-(   This is a restaurant I will visit again!"}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended by some friends. We parked in the lot and the entrance is a little confusing. The host staff was very friendly and we got a booth table. There is a lot of selection on the menu. Their salsa was very good but I wouldn't expect anything less since the name is called Salsas. We asked for spicy salsa and it was so delicious. My husband got the chicken fajitas and he liked them a lot but thought the portion was small compared to other restaurants. I got the large burrito with grilled chicken and thought it was good. The rice is also pretty fluffy!"}
{"text":"The food is really good here! I've tried many of their dishes and I've got to say that this one on of the few Mexican restaurants that I enjoy! From the nacho to burritos to fajitas they are all really good! And the alcohol beverages they sell are also really good! Would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Came in with a larger group on a Sunday afternoon, and we were seated quickly in the back area and received pretty good service.  The chips and salsa were flowing and they had well priced lunch specials, which I ordered one to go for the misses!  Located towards the back part of the Ayrsley commercial area across from the movie theaters, so I can see why it's hard to drum up business from S. Tryon traffic, which is why I've never heard of the place before.  I would recommend for an affordable lunch if you're in the area.  The only problem is the food is typical and not the atmosphere of a similarly priced Azteca which gets kudos to the bustling atmosphere inside."}
{"text":"Great sangria and mango juice.  Food was very good and the service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is really great! I love the drinks and the atmosphere. Kid friendly. Their pork tips are sooo good. Solid choice when craving Mexican."}
{"text":"I've dined here several times and the food is delicious. The only thing that kills me about this place is that their prices are bit too steep for my liking. Again, the food is awesome but I feel like i can get awesome mexican food at another establishment for cheaper."}
{"text":"My waiter was lovely but my food left much to be desired. The food was seasoned decently but it wasn't hot. Very lukewarm. I ordered the carnitas fajitas with refried beans and rice. If it had been hot, I would've given higher ratings because it was seasoned well. But less than warm food doesn't move me."}
{"text":"Very nice Mexican food and drinks . Had a wonderful time there. Service is quite fast and good . Why are there three names for same restaurant on yelp? I think they should make it one name so that reviews can be properly consolidated ."}
{"text":"We actually go here pretty regularly. Super reasonable, pleasant staff and patio, good food. We've actually stopped going to Don Pedro's when we want Mexican as we've had more inconsistent experiences there and it's very loud. Our most recent visit at Salsas we sat in a booth near a large table of after work folks who were apparently IT/Enterprise Architects for a local firm. They were a bit loud discussing business, which, since I work with EA Directors, I leave work to get away from such convo, but not Salas's fault - maybe sit couples away from larger tables/ppl with small kids when not crowded. Also, sometimes the table set up (as in this large party) make it difficult to move in the dining room/get to the door.  All in all, we really like Salsas and will continue visiting fairly often."}
{"text":"I have had it with this place.  We live close by and have ordered take out several times, and they seem to manage to ALWAYS get it completely wrong!  I don't know why it's so hard to get an order correct.  Shrimp does not equal Steak!  No beans does not translate to extra beans!  Today was the last straw for my husband & I...we will not be recommending or returning."}
{"text":"I have only been here for lunch, as it is close to the office. The service is always quick and friendly, especially if you are on a time crunch. They get your drink order right away and have some authentic choices. Free chips and salsa are given to each table at the beginning of the meal and replenished as quickly as you go through them. Lunch specials are worth taking a look at it, and the portion size is definitely a bang for your buck. Word on the street is they have great drink specials and dinner is good as well. Worth checking out if you are in the area and looking for somewhere affordable to eat, but it won't knock your socks off. The servers did play along with us as we pulled a prank on a member of our party by pulling out sombrero and birthday candles. Their sense of humor was much appreciated."}
{"text":"Good food, great bartenders. Every time I visit I stop here. Pork carnitas get the thumbs up."}
{"text":"The food is very mediocre, and the service is shoddy. The chips tasted burnt, and when we asked for another basket they tasted the same. Everything on the menu is significantly overpriced as well."}
{"text":"This was the best Mexican I have had since I have moved to Charlotte. I had the tequila burrito with shrimp while my boyfriend had the California burrito with steak. Both were full of flavor and extremely authentic. Most of the Mexican restaurants I have experienced out here have been very bland, but Salsa's spices and sauces forced me to finish this monster of a meal.  Their Margs were also very impressive- many flavors to choose from and the frozen were mixed perfectly.  We will definitely be returning and recommending it to anyone!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. This place use to be so good. Prices went up and the quality hit the bottom. I actually use to think this place should be charging more. The California Burrito use to be in my top 5 dishes in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Friday lunch. We all got the fajita special, which was really good and just the right amount of food. Salsa and chips were brought out quickly. Chips are nice and thin...salsa is not the best (kind of flat), but that didn't stop us from polishing off the whole basket. Service was quick and food came out exceptionally fast. They happily brought us separate checks and we got back to work with time to spare. I think we'll be going back again soon."}
{"text":"With the mixed reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect. I got the burrito tequila which was a substantial amount of food, had a delightful flavor with the perfect amount of spicy to it. my husband got the salsa special. It was very delicious! But not as much food as we expected. No beans or rice.  But the meal was so delicious! Even my husband, from Orange County, CA, was impressed with the food!"}
{"text":"If you want to pay for over-priced basic flavored food. This is your spot! To begin... the welcoming was completely awkward, they continued to look at us for a few minutes before actually saying something. The service was ok. The rice had no taste and the carne asada had no seasoning. Unfortunately, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Been on the look out for another new mexican restaraunt that sales great margaritas and i definetly found it all though i wasn't crazy about my food,I ordered the empananda's .Maybe better luck next time.I had the toasted coconut margarita ,definetly very tasty i pretty much almost licked all of the actual roasted coconuts off of the rim of the glass.They offer alot of different variety of margaritas which i love about the drink menu because everybody knows you cant go to a mexican restaurant and not induldge in a margarita!   Parking.Let's talk about it. Trying to find this place today i actually rode past it twice,there's a parking deck in the back which it took me a minute to figure that out.Far as the looks of the inside of this place nothing to talk about just a plain older setting the hi lite of this place was the disco ball i spotted in the top of the ceiling.Was a little pricey compared to other small mexican joints for i only had a margarita and empandands and paid $25.Not bad just pricey for what i had.Might re visit this place tonight just to try a different flavor margarita since i loved mines so much ,this place won me over with their margarita."}
{"text":"The waiter was excellent. All the employees use manners and professionalism by greeting you and being kind. The food was amazing. This is my favorite spot."}
{"text":"Always craving Mexican, I stopped in here on the way to a movie across the street. We were greeted and sat down right away. Throughout out our dinner, the servers were very kind and speedy. The food was just Okay, not bad, but I wouldn't make a point to go back. My margarita was warm and our fresh guacamole didn't taste very fresh. We split a dinner and everything just tasted heated up from earlier in the day."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place years ago when lived on the South side of town, but hadn't been in a while.   I was hungry... I mean to the point where my stomach was interrupting my conversation with loud talk! We waited about 7 minutes before our waiter greeted us to ask if we wanted anything to drink. I was too hungry to care, so I ordered the martini on special and a water. The drinks returned in a timely fashion, so all was fair (again) in my book.  I ordered a chicken burrito and it was huge! \"Oh no, stomach don't fail me now\" huge!   I was delicious and I managed to eat 97% of it before throwing in the fork. I wouldn't rush all the way to this side of town for another, since the total for two people was a little pricier than other places I've visited... but it's Arysley!"}
