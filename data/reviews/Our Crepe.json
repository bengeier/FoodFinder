{"text":"Very very expensive for the portion and components when i asked to put more chocolate she said thats for what you paid $31 for 3 crepes!! What i tried before they put chocolate inside not like empty crepe!!half banana and hard to taste tge Nutella...  Not worth what i paid for. Dont recommend"}
{"text":"It is a good place for one who likes to enjoy his/her time or good place for visiting friends.
The crepe was a little bit sweat for me.the portion is enough for two small apetite like two girls.
I like the place.The server was friendly and the place is cozy."}
{"text":"Clean, comfortable and courteous staff. 
Had a breakfast crepe with a latte, very filling but not overly heavy or greasy. 
Would absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"Our family of 4 was welcomed warmly by the owner/s.  We had 2 crepe with Nutella and banana which was absolutely delicious.  A must visit place if you are in mississauga and craving for something sweet."}
{"text":"Serendipity!
A really good place, brightly decorated, comfortable ambience and v friendly owners. We had the strawberry Nutella crepe for the kids. They loved it, served warm, good portion size and artistically decorated with a wedge of pineapple and a thin fillet of cantaloupe, twirled like a bugle. 
A really good place to go to, except I guess the mall's a. It tired and hence this place suffers."}
{"text":"Worst crepe and service ever! Came at 1:30 PM where it was completely dead. Asked the lady if we can sit at a table where my girlfriend and I can face the tv and she said no its reserved.. because THEY need access to the tv.

Ordered a ham, mushroom and onion crepe.. ham tasted like those packages of cooked ham from no name brand. Disgusting and salty. 

Girlfriend had a breakfast crepe with spinach chicken mushroom and mozzarella. I told the lady specifically that she do any like cheese. So she took out the mozzarella.. but she failed to mention their spinach is a spinach feta cheese mixed together.. her crepe came out completely raw.. egg whites still completely runny. We told the lady and she said no that's how it's cooked. It's scrambled and it looks like that. She then said she can take it back and cook it a little longer for our \"peace of mind. \" I literally took the fork and scooped out egg whites for her to say that. 

The only good thing was their mocha.. but definitely not worth it to come back"}
{"text":"Crepes are freshly made, yummy & a wide variety of choices of both sweet & savoury crepes. The place is nice & quiet, very clean with free high-speed wifi. Staff are friendly too. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"We'll definitely be returning!
We ordered the mixed fruit crepe with ice cream.
Great presentation and delicious!
The staff are so welcoming and nice, especially to my 3 year old son.

Glad we stopped by here after the passport office."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the breakfast bacon and egg crepe and the nutella and banana crepe for desert with a good coffee."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Food was really good and treatment was extra special. We loved both the sweets and dinner menus. This place is definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband went there few times we have mixed feelings about this place.one day their crepes are the greatest and other day super dry that you can't even chew it.i wish they could be more consistent with quality."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem. Love the service of the couple who runs it. Lots of savoury crepe options. Perfect for brunch
Great latte."}
{"text":"The environment is quiet, comfortable and decorated really pleasantly. The server was very friendly and upbeat. I loved staying here chatting with friends while sipping our tea. 

However, I ordered a crepe with Nutella, bananas and strawberries and it costed me approx. 10 dollars. I felt like the fruits were kind of old and dry and didn't taste very fresh. The crepe itself was only OK, nothing special. It was definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Excellent
Service was outbid this world. Quite a surprise of this hidden gem. 
Food was Wonderful!!

Go! Go soon!"}
{"text":"Love the decor love the food! It's a great place to hang out with your friends, the owner is really lovely too. 
Went to go watch a soccer game and everyone was involved. The place doesn't get very crowded but that to me is an advantage, more seating, not that the place is lacking any. 
The food does take a long time to come out and may be a little bit overpriced but if you're looking for a place where you want some serious desert crepes this is the place."}
{"text":"Quite nice cozy joint to enjoy some time with you significant other or friends. As soon as you walk in you feel the place is decorated nicely and you want to have a seat and enjoy some waffle and Crepe. 

The owner is European so the don't expect North American fast food service. The owner takes the time to make the best crepe and chats with you while making it. Which gives it the uniqueness required and makes it interesting to see how its done.

Then he brings it direct to your table where you can enjoy it. I liked the crepe here it was different than other as it was more crispy and due to that it was more taste. I also wanted to try their new Belgium waffle but the owner said they ran out.Their coffee is cheap and good too. Plus they have Italian shots and cappuccinos. 

The seating is comfortable. They have sofas, chairs, bigger table and the place is kept quite clean.

All in all its a nice place to hang out and have some good crepe!"}
{"text":"Came here based on others' reviews and was definitely happy! There isn't really anything bad about this place! It really is a \"hidden gem\" =)

Came here with my fiance (again....if you read my reviews then you'll know we pretty much eat everything together!) we love crepes (and everything else) so we had to try this place. 

The atmosphere and look of the resto is very nice! Love the decor! Super chill and welcoming. It would be a great place to meet up and/or have a nice chat with someone! If you're a coffee/dessert lover then you'll like this place too!

I'd say it's worth trying!"}
{"text":"I came here with two friends, and I ordered the crepe of the day, which was the Martin (banana chocolate crepe).
While I loved the bananas and chocolate drizzle, I wasn't a fan of the crepe's texture. It was thicker than I expected, and much more mushy/wet (not a thin crispy texture). I didn't feel that its price reflected its worth and probably won't come often."}
{"text":"Our Crepe is a unique, one of a kind experience.

Offering a warm sit-in environment, perfect for conversation with friends over a delicious assortment of over 50 different crepes, salads, and breakfast options. 

I first discovered this place about a year ago when my brother and I were looking for a unique breakfast restaurant for mother's day. Cora's was our go to breakfast spot for many years and it was time for a change. 

Thankfully we found Our Crepe that was conveniently located in the Central Parkway Mall, just minutes from Square One. 

Trying new restaurants is sometimes risky but this was worth it. 
Whenever I'm looking to get my \"Crepe Fix\" on, I don't hesitate to drop by Our Crepe.

P.S -Try #19 
(Spinach, Feta Cheese, Boiled Vegetables, Cheese)"}
{"text":"My wife and I went Our Crepe for our 13th Wedding Anniversary. I had a lunch crepe with blue cheese, Olives and bacon and my wife had a dessert Crepe. There food presentation and taste exceeded our expectations. The staff is very friendly. The service was fast. I highly recommend this awesome hidden gem in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I was first time here today, the place is nice & confortable. There are many choices from the menu, my hubby selected the mushroom, onion, tomato & bacon crepe, I picked the dessert crepe of apple, cinnimon & cream cheese.They both tasty, the crepe is soft & chewy but not too thick. The manager (boss maybe) is friendly. 
I have decided come again on next Sunday :)"}
{"text":"Eh, it was okay. The service was ridiculously slow and it isn't like they were busy.  Portions were average sized.  I can honestly say we won't be back."}
{"text":"Always attracted by the promise of crepes, we decided to try this place.  

Very clean and bright, limited seating. Friendly and prompt service. They have a large number of filling choices for the crepes. 

The fillings are tasty and the portions a good size. Their presentation is excellent. Prices are reasonable.

Unfortunately the so-called crepes are NOT really crepes as we used to get at the Magic Pan.  It was as if they had mixed up a pancake batter without eggs and cooked that.  The result was a thinnish, stretchy, somewhat rubbery product, which on the face of it sort of looked like  a crepe, but more like a partially cooked pancake and tasted bland."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised to find a creperie with great prices and the level of quality and service at Our Crepe. The place is large, has comfty furniture, and and extensive menu of delicious and well-presented crepes."}
{"text":"I stepped in and the manager wouldn't be nicer .. in certain arrogant voice .. (close the door) the place wasn't welcoming the location wasn't good. I would never recommended it for this cute welcoming and I would never come back. It doesn't deserve a star at all."}
{"text":"We just stumbled upon this place after dropping off our daughter at school. We've been back here several times since then. What I like about the place is that they prepare the crepe fresh so it is warm and the cheese is freshly melted. You may have to wait a bit but it's worth it. I have tried several versions of the crepe with blue cheese. It's surprisingly good. On our first visit, they served the savoury crepes with a side of what seemed like sour cream. I thought it complimented the crepes really well. On our succeeding visits though, they stopped serving the sour cream. I hope they bring it back.

They also serve waffles, coffee, and tea. Wifi is also available.

I hope they'll be able to maintain the quality. In the meantime, we're going to keep coming back and try out more of their crepes."}
{"text":"My wife has a store at the mall and we have become regulars at this place. I am always looking for consistency and this is the 5th time we came here so far. They have a vast selection of crepes (probably too many) but always the ingredients are very fresh and good quality. Presentation is impeccable and the service very friendly. 
 It seems that the crepe business appeal to the Europeans mainly Polish and Russians even thou those are from French origin. I would recommend this place for a nice chat and a crepe, the restaurant is clean and everything is done from scratch. Keep the good job and don't cut corners or lower the ingredients quality and you will have our business for many years.
It is a nice place to bring your friend, have a good coffee and a dessert crepe. It is a bit on the pricey side, but you get china and real forks and knives, and the crepes are always nicely decorated, and they bring the food to your table, So if you are looking for a big portion , this may not be the place, you may be better off at the other fast food, since I don't think this is a fast food restaurant. 
You can ask for the Internet code for free wifi."}
{"text":"Surprisingly nice atmosphere in a run down mall and plaza.  This is a ma and pa store, with a European owner.  I really like these kind of shops because you can tell they really care about the food quality.  

This is not fast food, this is a sit, enjoy your breakfast type of place, like a coffee shop with good food. I ordered #52, which was 2 eggs, sausage (or bacon), cheese in a large crepe that comes with fresh fruit.  The crepe itself had a soft, crispy nature (does that make any sense?)..what I mean is soft but with a bit of crispiness, so I think that's a good thing.   

I went very early, so I was the first customer, and there weren't any people after me, which made me feel bad because the owner was very nice, so I encourage people to try this out.  Also, while coffee isn't amazing, it's still very good (better than Tim Horton's).  

As for the atmosphere, clean and modern, so it seems like a good place for people to hang out and chit chat.  

I think I will return, but the downside is I work in Toronto and want crepes for breakfast, but they don't open until 9 am and I'm downtown by 7:30 a.m.  Maybe another weekend breakfast spot?"}
{"text":"this little privately owned eatery is small and clean. The food takes a little while to prepare because it's all fresh but you can sit and drink coffee or tea and read the paper while it's being prepared the food is delicious and the owners are very friendly great for a Sunday morning or middle of the week treat"}
{"text":"Great coffee, huge selection of crepes and friendly staff make this cozy independent cafe as good as a strip plaza joint can be.

Ok, first I must admit Our Crepe looks much worse from the outside than inside. The bright orange sign looks like a boring franchise place not too inviting due to dates typography. Interior is ok, some comfy seating and some dull tables. 

As far as the food in concerned: they offer more than 30 different crepes, including breakfast crepes, lunch crepes and sweet treats; pineapple and chicken being my favourite. The crepes are ok, I personally would keep the toppings and change the dough recipe slightly and turn off the polish tv. 

The best thing is their coffee. Try an espresso or cappuccino: it tastes just like the one I just had in Europe a week ago. The right amount of crema, hazelnutty taste of flavourful dark roast. Yummy."}
{"text":"I really love this place! Amazing food and customer service. The owner treats you like you're his friend- you always feel welcomed. I keep coming back"}
{"text":"Good crepes,  neat place, acceptable service... I wish their crepes were slightly thinner and if they had used fresher ingredients like replacing the 80s styled canned mushrooms...

Small place, avoid if you're in a rush or the place was more than half full... Owner does all the work single handily, so you might have to wait a while for your order..."}
{"text":"Really great place to sit and have a chat. They've got couches, chairs and tables, artwork and photos, even a seating area in a nook for some privacy.

Consider it more a lounge that serves food than a restaurant with good seating.

We did two crepe orders, one savory, one sweet. The crepe itself was nice. The toppings a medium (nothing particularly wrong with them, just not amazing either).

It was quiet when we were there (late Monday morning) and the one very friendly staffer present even brought our food to the table after we ordered at the counter.

Will be back the next time I'm looking for a place to relax and chat with a friend."}
{"text":"Crepe was substantial and well presented. While the savoury menu may seem large, their combos are basically small variations of a few options. I.e grilled chicken with tomato, grilled chicken with tomato and olives, etc. 

Would be better if you could order a la carte and choose your toppings. 

I had the chicken with tomato, olives and mozzarella. Toppings were of Subway quality.  Pre-cooked chicken strips, canned sliced olives.  Meh. 

Took a while to come out as others have said. Seems like they could use another person working. 

PS the person next to me had her text alerts unmuted and got a text every 15 seconds. I know it's not the restaurants fault but I really wanted to smack her on the side of the head."}
{"text":"This crepe place is really close to where I live, and I  came here when my bf and I wanted dessert (more like I wanted dessert) 
It is situated in a small plaza where this one place looked more modern than the other stores & restaurants around it. We were greeted immediately when we walked in late friday evening, the owner (I think) was extremely friendly and helpful. I take forever to decide especially with what I want in a crepe but I settled for their special- nutella and banana. 
The freshly made crepe was yummy and it wasn't as heavy as other dessert places.  

Next time I will try their latte or even one of their breakfast crepes!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to have dessert if your around the area. They mainly serve crepes, waffles, and some hot/cold beverages..and there are a decent amount of seats inside so you can also get can comfy in there as some seats are sofa type.

Anyway, I quite like it here honestly but of course its not comparable to places like Demetres. While the crepes we ordered was good, the size of the ice cream that came with it was a little disappointing for my partner and yet I was okay with it since my nutella crepe didnt need to be overpowered more with the ice cream.

The staff is nice btw.. I like how we were greeted when we came in and was patient with us while we chose our orders.

I do recommend going here! And I will be back soon when am around the area."}
{"text":"Nothing special. 
A very dreary mall. 
The place stopped serving coffee, Even though they where still open. 
Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Very tasty crepes at a decent price. Ordered #25 grilled chicken with mushrooms and fiancee ordered #16 spinach with blue cheese. Quick and efficient service. What I liked was that the owner was nice and even took pictures for a group that was dining here. Also one lady had a comment about a crepe and they replaced it no questions asked. 

Wish these mom and pop stores flourish. Lets support them.

Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Took my little sister here for International Women's Day. We ordered the same thing: a crepe with Nutella, almonds and ice cream. The crepe was delicious ... How can you go wrong with Nutella. Yum! Their coffee is out of this world. Super fresh and I feel like they take the time to put TLC into each order they serve. We'll definitely be coming back when we have a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Pleasing environment, good dishes, esp. crepes! This is definitely one of the small gems my wife and I will frequent on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"This is the definition of savory. The atmosphere is cute and comfortable. The food is perfected, delicious, and healthy. The only thing i'd change is making the crepe 10 times the size...cause i would eat it."}
{"text":"Like Bernie and some other Yelpers have stated, this is NOT a fast food joint.  Your food is not nuked from frozen.  It will not be ready within a couple of minutes.  As long as you have that expectation in your mind, you will enjoy being transported into a chill, friendly, easy-going environment.

Male owner was genuinely happy and inviting.

I thought that I'd order the Belgian Waffles - since they were advertised, but not on menu - with honey, walnuts, almonds, & whipped cream.  My bf had the crepes with Nutella, bananas, walnuts, & ice cream.  

What stood out was the relaxing atmosphere and also the attention paid to plating.  I'd definitely go back as I'd rather go to a hidden gem like this than Spin, Just Desserts, etc."}
{"text":"I was in the area and needed to find a place for brunch. This restaurant is located in the same strip plaza as a 24hour McD's and a Food Basic. I don't come to this area often but for as long as I remember, this plaza is very old and I come here only once every 5-10 years to renew my passport or to do anything government related. 

The restaurant is very clean and spacious with a lot of tables/seats. Unfortunately, during my 1.5hour stay, there was only 1 other customer who only ate for 15 minutes and then packed everything to go. It is a great place if you want to have some alone time or just to catch up with a friend. The seats were comfortable but the place was overall very dark in the morning. There's definitely a lack of windows and the lights were dim. I would prefer to eat my breakfast in a brighter place.

The prices in general were on the higher side, but it is comparable to other crepe places. My mom and I decided to share a plate to taste test it out first before ordering another one. We got the breakfast crepe with eggs, spinach, mushroom and bacon ($8.49). We also ordered an alkaline coffee (~$2.00). When I asked about the difference between a regular black coffee and the alkaline coffee, the lady at the counter said that the alkaline is good for detox and is an energy booster. We also got the supreme coffee ($3.50), which is sweetened coffee with ginseng. 

Let's talk first about the coffee: The black alkaline coffee was very light, almost tasteless. To me, it was 2x lighter than the Starbucks blonde. Mom and I are used to more of the Starbucks pike so if you are used to strong(er) coffee, I don't suggest you to order this one. The supreme coffee was made from a instant coffee packet. It tasted just like any other packaged instant coffee with just added ginseng flavour. It was wayyy too sweet for my liking as I usually don't add sugar to my coffee. If I had known, I wouldn't have ordered this. 

The crepe: It was a huge plate of crepe that was decorated with slices of cucumbers and fruits. It was perfect for 2 people to share. I didn't really like the taste of the filling inside, I thought the sauce that they put in was weird, but I still ate it but just didn't enjoy it. I am guessing it was the bechamel sauce. 

The service was great. The lady at the counter was very nice and explained things in great detail. 

Overall, I don't think I'll come back. There are sandwiches that I might come to try, but I doubt it considering it is a crepe place. Their dessert crepes might be better...?"}
{"text":"Good selection of crepes and they are wonderfully done. Plating is excellent and it looks as good as it tastes. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place that offers crepe and found this restaurant. Its located along the sides of Central Parkway Mall. This place is easily accessible by bus or car. There's plenty of parking nearby. 

Ordered a savoury crepe to go. The crepes are delicious but a little soggy, probably because of the steam as it was closed in a box. It would probably be better if you dine in. The sauce was a little too much. It made the crepe really salty. Next time ill probably ask for less sauce.

Overall, average place. Atmosphere is a little dull. Lighting was really dim. Crepes were okay."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what people love about this place. For me, it was kind of \"meh\".

The place is large, with lots of tables and a couple of sofas. I'm not a fan of the decor. I'm surprised that someone said that this is an ideal place to hang out with a friend or your significant other. As I was having lunch there, I actually thought to myself \"How weird...Our crepe advertises itself as a creperie/coffee lounge but I cannot see myself just hanging out here. Just eat and go.\" It lacks a proper atmosphere for it to be a lounge. It's not particularly cozy with its cafeteria style tables and chairs and white and orange tiles on the walls.

The menu is quite impressive, with dozens of sweet and savoury crepes to choose from. The food does take FOREVER to arrive. We were the only two people there and watching the two workers prepare our food almost made me fall asleep (that's how slow they were). Anyway, I wouldn't mind if it was worth the wait, but in this case it wasn't. Food presentation was beautiful and it made me very excited about our two crepes. However, the crepes look much better than they taste, unfortunately. The savoury crepe was pretty bland and rather heavy. The sweet crepe was dry and chewy (not sure if it makes sense). I mean, these weren't the worst crepes I've ever had but they were far, far from the best I had. So, in short \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Environment was appealing and the food was good, however, the service was really slow. I feel as though the savory crepes should have more ingredients. The price is good, so I will probably go back.

Update: I love this place. Price, food, people are all great. Definitely will continue going back. Hot chocolate is so good."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the middle of a local strip plaza in Applewood Village. Excellent crepe selection, fresh quality ingredients and nice presentation. The owners are extra friendly and go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. Will be going back there and recommending to friends for sure"}
{"text":"This place is okay, the main reason I rated it so low is the service. The people are so rude! Yelled at me for \"not saying a number\". Don't plan on going back..."}
{"text":"In one sentence (maybe a run-on): An adorable decorated crepe serving coffee lounge catering from morning to night.

I really think this place is great. It's situated in a ghetto mall, but this venue certainly stands out with bright orange colours and well lit. As I recall, it opens from 9-9. Although I doubt that anyone would want to eat crepes for 3 consecutive meals; you can rely on this place for any hang out.

I ordered the grilled chicken, cream cheese and mushrooms crepe, it was very good. Not too salty and not too sweet as I would have suspected it to be. After a very filling meal, I proceeded to order the apple cinnamon crepe, but this was too sweet for my liking. I would recommend the plain crepe with powered sugar (the first choice in the dessert menu); much less sweet and just perfect!

They have two spaces that have comfortable sofas, fits 4 per section. I would see this as a nice quiet alternative to a study area early in the mornings. It's really comfortable, we spent a few hours here playing card games and chatting.

They also have a large television screen, they had TLN on.

You could just order your food at the counter and they will serve it directly to your table. I'd go again to this place, just to hang out or have brunch. Really comfortable, and I was relaxed. Beware tho, it's almost $10 a crepe. Minus one star for that."}
{"text":"Had a chicken crepe there
Pricing is reasonable 
Presentation was very good. I liked the fruit on the plate
The crepe was good, but not excellent. 
I will go there again Sometime to give it another try.
I would rate it a 7/10"}
