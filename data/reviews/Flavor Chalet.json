{"text":"This was the worst experience at a food truck ever! All of the \"Specials of the day\" items that he had displayed on his white board were not available. He was out of everything! He heated up one last hamburger patty (not fresh) for my young daughter and put the patty on a stale hot dog bun! No lettuce, no tomatoes, etc. I asked for a plain bean & cheese burrito for my other young daughter and he put rice & curry in it! Hello?! what part of PLAIN beans & cheese did he not understand! He then wanted to charge me FULL price for my order plus the burrito and hotdog hamburger. I told him that it was not a fair price and he was arguing with me about it- I will never eat here again and I will let many friends know about this experience!"}

{"text":"Flavor Chalet was one of the food tracks being served at the Capital Lawn. I order a side of french fries and grilled cheese. The large image behind the truck and his whiteboard suggested fresh thin cut fries. But the fries he was setting up was from a frozen bag and they weren't thin cut at all, just large soft fries that he had to prepare the oil to deep fried them on. He also took a long time just getting prepared to make my grilled cheese.   In short, he was very disorganized and at least 3 people who were waiting on him to take new orders, left. He spend almost 10min working on my food, he didn't bother to take new orders. He was the only person running the truck.   The fries were bad as expected and the grilled cheese tasted funky. He didn't used american sliced cheese, but used shredded cheese. He also used 2 regular size breads you get at Fry's. For these two orders, I paid $12.50.   In addition, his idea of curry meal on the whiteboard showed a large plate nicely prepared with the toppings. I saw a guy ordering it and he got a small Styrofoam bowl with some premade curry served in it. That cost him $6.   Took a total of 20min to get my order. I would avoid this place."}
