{"text":"I have been here three times. The first two times, the food was great, and the service was really good. The third time, service was ok, but the food quality has dropped since I was last there, and I even found a hair fried into one of my chicken wings. My friend got the ribs, and said that they were dry and tasteless. I've recommended this place to people, but now, I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"I came here tonight for the first time . My friends have always came here and wanted me to come and try it out . I came in I sat down a server came said she was not our server but brought us a glass of water . 10 min later we still don't have a server we didn't have a menu . The manager comes over says if we don't want to order we need to leave now . Really rude throws us a menu and tells us to order we ordered a coke . She said she didn't want to bring us that we need to order food . Still being rude we asked for the owner . Completely stood up for the manager being rude considered it completely okay. By the time I was finished speaking to the owner I decided to leave without ordering anything because I am not going to sit in a place where I am being harassed and forced to order in there time . I hope everyone seriously considers not supporting this kind of service. As a owner of a company I would never speak to customers like that she does not deserve business being that bitchy ."}
{"text":"Good food snd service. Had a burger and poutine.  A little out of the way for me but no regrets."}
{"text":"Above average pub fare at good prices. Daily food/drink specials and great service at this non-chain pub. Live music on weekends. 4 stars"}
{"text":"This is not a fancy bar and grill, typical old styled venue with wood chairs and the southern atmosphere. The bar was full with an older crowd. The food here was not the best, the nachos tasted stale and stiff, the spinach dip tasted like heated up Philadelphia cream cheese. The best was the classic poutine but was drowned with gravy. Although this is not my type of atmosphere, our server was very attentive and helpful.

{"text":"Oscars is a 'Jack Astors' type pub with a patio that gets lots of beautiful sunshine in the afternoon and evening.

The food is very standard. Chicken, ribs, seafood, pasta, sandwiches, appetizers and salads to choose from and all pretty standard in flavour and quality. 

The service is friendly and attentive though the system on the patio seems to be whoever gets to the table first gets it because we were asked if we'd been helped yet about 4 times by 4 different girls (better over attentive than under attentive though). 

It seems to attract a lot of middle aged people looking for somewhere to drink a beer alone so if that's what you're into, this is a good place for it.

Overall a good option if you're looking for a watering hole before or after working up a sweat at Chingaucousy Park."}
{"text":"Read the fine print!  Went in with a coupon for free wings with a drink. But the drink that comes with the \"Burger and a pint\" special doesn't count. The fine print also tells you that the burger with the special has 3/4s of the meat patty as the regular burger. Burger was served extremely well done, very dry with little flavour. Waitress tried to up-sell bacon, cheese, and gravy, but if they were going to force us to buy another drink, I'm just buying what I have to, and nothing else.  Also, our waitress was unaware of how much extra a Coors Banquet is, compared to the standard Canadian ($1.75, not $1). Waitress also neglected to inquire as to wing flavour. The decor is dated, to be kind. It's the same beer hall it's been since it opened. Overall, a less than spectacular dining experience. Closer to \"let's just eat something\". Their only saving grace is their sponsorship of the local hockey team, the Brampton Beast."}
{"text":"wings wings and more wings! 
half price wings in sunday monday and tuesday! great portion and great staff"}
{"text":"Great food and great deals for kids under 10.  They are very friendly.   Can be a little slow at times but the quality of food and service makes up for it."}
{"text":"We tend to be at Oscar's for Karaoke on Sundays. It's a fun, friendly atmosphere with great food and drinks. There's a regular crowd on Sundays, who belt out some great tunes. Servers are friendly and knowledgeable.
Wings are delicious and their fries epic, especially their poutine.
I usually go with the classic double rum and coke, but I have tried most of the specialty shots and the fish bowls, all are equally delicious. Great place."}
{"text":"A decent solid restaurant. Nothing spectacular but good nonetheless. The Thursday steak special is excellent. It's a 8oz steak w baked & side of corn bread & beans. The staff is very friendly & very attentive. All in all this is a solid restaurant."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time tonight for the Sunday wings special and it was a nice place to get some wings if you're having wings craving.  The price for a pound of fryers or roasters are the same, even boneless too.  I like this place and will definitely come back with friends and their families.  Try it out and enjoy some wings and fries.  Oh and don't forget your liquor too."}
{"text":"I found Oscar's to be an ok, standard pub, but nothing special. The place can get a little loud when there is a game on.

The menu is quite extensive with a number of common pub food items. I had the lemon pepper crusted salmon. It was good, although I found the lemon flavour a little too strong (which is unusual because I like lemon a lot). The potatoes were very good though."}
