{"text":"I was very excited to see a new Chinese restaurant near the area.  So decided to drop in.  I was very disappointed from the parking lot to the food.  They didn't bother cleaning up the slushy snow by the door; I guess they're just waiting for a law suit.  The minute we went in, I had a very uncomfortable feeling.  This is a new restaurant but the flooring and seating are dirty and none of the staff put a smile on their faces.  As to the food, we order a Seafood Super Bowl congee and Yuen Chow fried rice.  Both are pretty tasteless, and definitely very disappointing.  We will most likely not going back.  Wait for the next new restaurant around."}
{"text":"I came In with high hopes, and am sad to say that I am very disappointed. Everything we ordered excluding one dish (Duck) lacked flavor. I'd like to think I am far from being a picky eater. Even coming in very hungry, you'd think I'd enjoy the food more. Service was great, but unfortunately thats not enough to make me want to come back."}
{"text":"With a name like Congee Palace I hope it's as good as my mom's, boiled lovingly for hours with chicken and pork bones until it's a thick creamy  bowlful of goodness instead of a runny gruel.  And the verdict is .... Good .. but I suspect it has msg added and I still like Chi's Noodle Place on Central Parkway better.  Decor is modern and clean.  Tables are quite spread out so you're not crammed in like some places.  They had some dim sum items on the menu.  We ordered steamed shrimp rice rolls, meh.  Rice rolls are either done well or just blah there really is no in  between.  Most people seem to come for the congee.  Service was not friendly but rather a cross between perfunctory and auto pilot with just a hint of the potential to be friendly.  Perhaps if you're a regular you get the smile?!?!    The large bowl of congee and 2 dim sum dishes fed 3 of us for about $25 so you can't go wrong.   Would try it again..."}
{"text":"So pleasantly surprised by this restaurant!  The decor is non-existent.  The service was polite but they didn't check on us very much.   However, it's a good sign when the entire restaurant is filled with Chinese people.  And the food arrived quite quickly.  We tried the siu mai (yummy),  beef rice noodles (delicious), seafood congee (a bit thick for my liking but there was plenty of seafood) and the chicken and vegetables (pretty good).  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is a very typical Chinese congee and noodles place - not much decor, and typical meh service.  However, what differs from other local congee place is their healthier cooking style - no (or very little) MSG, and less oil and salt in dishes.  Some people may find it bland, but I do prefer this!  I partically like their congees - pretty much taste like home.  Be prepared to wait if you go during weekend/Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill.  Chinese restaurants should be served within 5-10 minutes of ordering, however the rice noodles took 10 minutes, congee - 20 minutes and wonton noodle soup - 25 minute.  If everything was amazing, I wouldn't mind but it was mediocre at best. Not even Markham/R Hill standards.    Dried shrimp rice noodle - rice noodle was too grainy and rough and there were like 4-5 small pieces of dried shrimp.  2/5  Mixed meat congee - it was okay but the meat balls were a bit chewy.  3/5  Wonton noodle soup - this was the only thing I truly liked.  It appeared like they were made fresh.  4/5  Overall, it's quite pedestrian and I'd usually give it 3 stars but for the slow service, it loses a star."}
{"text":"I changed my review to 1 star cause this place is no longer around ......no more duck soup for me ..boohoo Shut down ......closed .......bye bye ....arivaderci"}
{"text":"Ok so the four stars reflect more the service.  The food is 3 stars.  Servers speak english and actually pour the tea for you.  They will refund take out if not desirable and they crack a smile when they serve.  We had the lobster for lunch.  It hit the spot!  If you are searching for a great spot for some chinese cuisine in Mississauga.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Congee Palace was pretty good. My aunt and uncle were there and we didn't even arrange it, that's how I knew this place must be a local favourite.  Congee Palace would've gotten five stars if I didn't have to wait 20 minutes to order. No one greeted us at the door, so after a few minutes we seated ourselves.  Menus were placed on our table but no one took our order. I considered going up to the counter but the only person there was on the phone taking takeout orders I guess. Eye contact also didn't work. Eventually one of the bus boys noticed us waiting and let us know someone would be over to take our orders shortly.  After we put our orders in, everything was much better. Food was flying out of the kitchen. It was REALLY good. We had beef tenderloin and onions (my personal favourite), steamed veggies, lobster, chicken, steamed rice, and a few other things my dad ordered.  The lobster wasn't the best I've had but it was definitely good. The rest of the food was so delicious. Better than the regular dim sum spot I frequent. I was happy about that.  I don't like Chinese desserts as a rule and my dad doesn't either but he loved the milk pudding. Even my mother enjoyed it and she rarely eats desserts. My boyfriend tried all of the desserts that were brought to the table: red bean (soup?), milk pudding, and tapioca soup/pudding? He basically looked like a kid in a candy store. He was REALLY enjoying it lol so it must've been really good.  There is a lot of seating space and it was constantly busy. The washrooms are clean but the doors open the wrong way and don't have a handle you can pull so you have to grab the top of the door to open it which I found weird.  The long wait did turn me off of here, but I would probably visit again. ."}
{"text":"Tried it tonight for the first time. Very good food. Service was okay! The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it could be cleaner. The bathroom was very dirty, no soap for washing your hands. But overall great food. We had:  Sweet & Sour Pork  General Tso Chicken  Yang Chow (Fried Rice)  Chinese Beef Tenderloin (w/onions)  Seafood Congee  Cantonese chowmein (crispy noodles)  Fish filet with corn (Guper fish)"}
{"text":"Yet another new Chinese restaurant in the south Mississauga area. Came here with some friends and had quite a feast as seen by the pics I posted here. Typical of cantonese food the food is slightly on the bland side. Pepper and hot chilli sauce took care of that. Price was quite reasonable for the amount we ate.  I notice that the restaurant is open for dinner only!"}
