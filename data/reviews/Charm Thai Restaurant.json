{"text":"The real stand out was the appetizer \"mixed plate variety of appetizers\"...WOW. just outstanding side sauces,  truly.  the beef and chicken stay on this dish was succulent and flavorful; the steamed shumai dipped in the hot/sweet sauce was YUM...

Sweet attentive wait staff, my lemongrass chicken entre was juicy and flavorful, not so spicy hot it couldn't be eaten, just spicy but enough to make your sinus open up a hair.  my companions beef and macadamia nuts was very good.  Our dessert was fried ice cream I can only give an average rating."}
{"text":"A coworker told me about this place last week.   I love spicy food, and I certainly love a spicy Pad Thai.  However, the only place I can find a decent spicy Pad Thai is in Chicago, and have been desperately searching for a year for a place that would listen to my \"extra spicy\" request.  (I don't understand why places in Cleveland don't make things extra spicy when requested, but that's a whole different issue...)

My boyfriend and I (both residents of Downtown) were not too thrilled at the prospect of heading to a shopping plaza in Parma for dinner, but we thought we would give it a try.  I was pleased with the decor.  Not too fancy, but enough to make me feel like I was in a decent establishment.

$4.95 for a glass of wine, and $5.50 for his Bacardi Mojito (for real?).

Just under $6 for an appetizer of Crab Rangoon.  BEST Crab Rangoon I have ever had.  Presentation was also nice.

I forgot what he ordered, but it was ground chicken with peppers, onions, and other things, and a side of sticky rice.  He didn't ask for extra spicy, but it was still flavorful.

My Pad Thai (Country Pad Thai) was EXACTLY what I was looking for.  So flavorful, and extra spicy, just like I had asked!  The portions were HUGE and I have enough leftover for dinner this evening.  

2 drinks, app, 2 entrees, plus an extra side of rice, enough food for leftovers,  with tax (not including tip), the total was $42.   Probably one of our cheaper dinners.

Charm Thai has 2 new faithful customers, that is for sure.  If you are looking for great Thai food, this is the place.

Thank you, Charm Thai!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is great, kind of quiet. The food is delicious. Probably not cheap enough to eat at every day for dinner but it's a great place to take out-of-towners who want Thai food. If they've never had it, this is a perfect introduction. If they have had it, they won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Come here for the sushi not for the Thai.

The Pad Thai is pretty bad. Lacks flavor and they barely put any sauce on it. Pretty disappointing.

However, their sushi is great. I recommend the Naruto and the Crunchy Roll.

The restaurant is nice. It's normally pretty quiet. It's a cute space."}
{"text":"So yummy! Lunch was quick and really good and reasonably priced. Definitely will come back"}
{"text":"Country pad thai was good. The spice level was adequate and  it was flavorful. Would recommend the fried ice-cream too."}
{"text":"I'm in the Cleveland area for the week on business and Charm Thai was recommended to me by a friend. I love Thai food and was excited to try something different. This place is amazing! The food is fantastic. I got the scallion pancake --- sooo good --- and the country style pad thai which my friend also recommended as it is her favorite dish there. It was so good!! tons of flavor and not so much heat that you can't really taste anything. The price was really great(compared to the NY prices I am accustomed to haha) and the portion was huge. The menu is big and diverse and has just about anything you could want. I didn't get any drinks but they had a nice selection of wines, beers, and cocktails. The decor is really sweet and appealing, it's really beautiful inside, but comfortable. The service was so fast -- I think I had my order like five minutes after ordering! The owner is super sweet and was very kind to me. Charm Thai is a treasure! I'm so glad my friend recommended it and every time I come back to Cleveland I'm going to come back and try something new!"}
{"text":"I've only ordered take out, so I can't comment on the dining experience, but the hostess has been very nice. Also, have only personally ordered the Pad Thai, which I think is fine - on the same level as other local Thai restaurants. The first time I ordered, I asked for spicy, and then quickly realized that I had made a huge error in judgement on the level of spiciness I thought I would enjoy. Since then, I've asked for it mild - and they kindly provide me with a tiny take home container of what I assume to be highly concentrated red spice, which I sparingly add to my noodles when I get home. My family have ordered the fried rolls, and other noodle dishes which have all been good.

So yes, the parking lot entrance is a little tricky. You don't want the driveway to the church. You have to turn into the parking lot by where Dunkin Donuts is, and make an immediate left at the very first driveway."}
{"text":"The Mango Chicken Curry is very good!  I recommend this place to anyone that wants authentic Thai food at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Charm Thai's sushi and thai food can't be beat. There sushi is the freshest I have had. I don't think there is a better place to eat sushi. One of my favorite dishes that I can't get away from is Massaman Curry Chicken.  I am glad that I don't live closer or I might eat there every day.

Check out my picture of the rainbow roll and spicy tuna roll."}
{"text":"we ate here on 11/04/12

tried tamarind duck for the first time though we always order the homestyle duck.
was intrigued by the tamarind mango sauce.

sauce was okay, on the sour side obviously, but we prefer the sauce of the homestyle duck, which is curry based.

(6/10 chopsticks)

best thai restaurant in cleveland.

service is very friendly, and the food is always good and consistent.

must haves are the fried rice and crispy duck dishes."}
{"text":"ordered takeout one during a sushi craving.  Amazing sushi!  I was only inside for a minute to pick up my order, but the inside is very nice.  That nice balance between romantic and casual.  The hostess was super nice.  Can't wait to go back when I'm having a Thai craving"}
{"text":"My wife and I love Thai food, and have tried most places around Cleveland.  Charm Thai is our favorite both because of the food quality and service.  We are vegan, so we always order the Crazy Noodles with veggies and tofu, extra extra spicy (7 out of 5 stars).  This is by far the best Pad Kee Mau type dish out there.  We went 2 weeks in a row on a Friday, and the waitress asked if we wanted the same thing as last time, and remembered our appetizer, entree ordered with special requests, drinks, etc.  Top notch food and service.  Defiantly worth checking out."}
{"text":"Just walking in, the hostess is really sweet... asked me what I liked and made some suggestions. I got the pad thai (dine in) and duck choo chee (to go order) both were delicious. .. great service.  Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I love going to this place. Service is good and the food is fresh! Love the fisherman's treasures and seafood madness. Sushi is awesome as well."}
{"text":"I am from out of town and got a pad thai and drunken noodles at another place (map of thailand) - (all today) and was very disappointed. it was supposed to be a treat so i looked up by reviews another thai place (this one) and ordered a pad thai to go. too bad i didn't try it there- i would have left it. it was the worst I have ever tried- worse than the previous which I did not thonk possible . the noodles had no flavor- just cooked, no spices, no color. big portionbut no flavor. never going again if passing through town."}
{"text":"It was worth the car wheels turning for 36 miles to get to this authentic Thai restaurant.  The interior is sophisticated and colorful, yet quiet and welcoming. The service was attentive and gentle.  The Pad Thai, Country Style was exquisite in its appearance and taste, with perfectly blended Thai spices and ingredients. I can not wait to go back and try another dish or two, as recommended by a Thai patron at an adjoining table.  I would love to have this place plunked right into Chagrin Falls.  I would be there every day! I highly recommend, if you haven't noticed yet. :-)"}
{"text":"We have eaten here 3 times since moving to Cleveland and it is our favorite place to eat so far. The service is always excellent and the food is second to none! I would recommend that if you have a chance to try this place out, DO IT!!"}
{"text":"Just completed my first visit, must say the food was awesome some of the best if not the best I have had since I moved back from Vegas"}
{"text":"like the old adage goes, a good tom kha gai is hard to find. charm thai's is up there in terms of delicious (though NOTHING will top surin in atlanta for me.)

my dad and i went here for dinner a few weeks ago, and i was pleasantly surprised by how good it was, especially considering its random location next to a giant eagle get go and a dunkin donuts. the interior is clean and really gorgeous and open. it wasn't crowded, but it was also a sunday night.

i had the tom kha (duh) and massaman with tofu and brown rice (yes!). the portion was HUGE and really excellent. i am ruthless when it comes to reviewing thai but this was truly some of the best i've had in northeast ohio. my dad had the crazy noodle, and i was almost kicking myself for not ordering it because it was so colorful and also delicious. 

i would probably be here constantly but for the fact that i live in lakewood. service is attentive and super-helpful and the prices are affordable. for the portions and sheer deliciousness it is worth it. 

luv u charm thai. please never leave."}
{"text":"Very good food! There were four of us and each had different appetizer and a meal and everything was just excellent. Prices are reasonable and food very authentic. Also we had three deserts. My mango with sticky rice was a very pleasant surprise. My husband had those banana chocolate rolls and they were great. Our server looked a little unexperienced but he sincerely tried to do a good job. The food quality compensated lack of good English. Overall, I would recommend this place. Very reasonable."}
{"text":"Went here several weeks ago. We got the duck choo chee and the crazy noodle. Food was very good. Service was very quick and their prices are very good. I liked how the waiter was very attentive and provided great service but did not check on us so much that it gets annoying. We're definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place by accident. Stopped to avoid snow storm traffic and so glad I did. I had the hostess select my meal since I had not been there before and I figured she would make a great recommendation. I had Crab Rangoon as an appetizer and the Pad Thai with shrimp and chicken for dinner. Delicious! I can handle hot and spicy dishes so she recommended level 3 on heat and it was perfect. Spicy but I could still taste the great flavor.   Service was attentive and friendly. Clean and bright atmosphere."}
{"text":"A great local establishment. Friendly and prompt service with a good selection to choose from.  I love the curries, panang and green are my favorites.  The Pad Thai is great as well. Try the Bangkok Beef, it is tender and satisfying.  Mel, you've got something special here.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Got takeout this past weekend.  Had gotten takeout once before a few years ago and was pleased then, and had heard good things since.  However, we weren't impressed this time.  For starters, the online menu doesn't show prices, which is annoying for a place that does a lot of takeout business.  Our group ordered a soup, a couple appetizers, a few chicken dishes, a shrimp dish, and a pad thai.  The chicken satay appetizer was well-liked, but none of the rest got very good reviews.  The sweet and sour chicken was disliked, and the pad thai was bland and really heavy on the peanuts.  My buckwheat noodles were overcooked.  Average price was about $15 per person, which didn't seem like a good value.  I ordered the Mango Paradise entree, and it contained just 3 shrimp.

The one good thing I can say is that they offer a broader variety of sides than most Asian takeout restaurants (udon, rice, angel hair, and buckwheat noodles, and jasmine and brown rice).  And they can make fried rice with brown rice, which is nice."}
{"text":"We're so lucky to have this high-quality of food and service in this area, believe me, we're thrilled. Which is why we go to Charm Thai every few weeks. Me and my wife have eaten sushi at 30 different locations around Ohio, and the USA, in major big cities, and honestly, nobody has better sushi than Charm Thai. The chef there really knows what he's doing. Only downside, they never have any toro. This place is a gem and we will keep coming back because it really is amazing."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went here for lunch based on a friend's recommendation. One big plus was that our waitress was great, very personable and friendly. The husband got the $8.25 Pad Thai and I ordered the$13.00  Broadview Maki and the $12.00 Rainbow Maki. I later  noticed when I checked their website that the Rainbow Maki does not include avocado. I think this was an attempt to skimp down on the fish. While my hubby liked his Pad Thai, he didn't think it was anything special. The sushi tasted fine but 1/2 hr later my stomach began to hurt. I had nothing to eat prior to lunch. Luckly I didn't have to visit a bathroom. I just don't think that I would make the trip to visit this restaurant gain. Nothing special. Just o.k."}
{"text":"We had the Pad Thai and the Crazy Noodles! The dinner was excellent and I will go back again ASAP! The atmosphere was very nice, clean, and welcoming. Great place for dinner with friends!"}
{"text":"Considering where this place is located this is pretty good Thai food. My top two things I keep coming back for are: the Country Style Pad Thai(spicier) and Thai Style Basil. Hands down delicious and slightly addicting. No really I order take out from here probably once a week. Can't talk about the service b/c I always get take out but everyone I've dealt with has been very pleasant.

Back to the Pad Thai - I've tried the few around the city: Ty Fun in Tremont, Sweet Mango in Berea and Strongsville, Tea House Noodles Downtown and I gotta say, I keep coming back to Charm Thai. The country style is that addicting! It also helps that it's 10 min. from my house. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very, very delicious restaurant I went to in a whim with a friend who was in town.  Every dish we got was absolutely delicious. The pricing was pretty reasonable for this kind of food.  I believe I ordered a mango curry, which was delicious.  My friend got some kind of duck dish, which was also amazing.


I tried one of their sweet milk teas... which was good!  They also make a good bubble tea."}
{"text":"Very very good. I've been looking for decent Thai in the area, and this is it. I got the veggie potstickers and red curry. Red curry has great flavor and it just spicy enough! Definitely impressed and we will be back !"}
{"text":"Their red curry and crazy noodles were both excellent. The staff seems to have a grasp of food allergies, which is a bonus. They are willing to make accommodations for their guests.

There is a nice atmosphere without seeming strip mall, and I think it would be a nice place to go on a date. There is definitely a cozy feeling without it being tacky. 

I have eaten in and gotten take-out and been happy with service both times."}
{"text":"I always get the curries. The mango or the green are their best.  Veggie fried rice was okay, kinda bland to me."}
{"text":"Solid option for good Thai food in seven hills area. We weren't expecting this place to be very good, but after two meals we'll keep coming

Friendly service. Great hot tea. Good ingredients and fresh, real flavors - not just syrupy sugary junk you seem to get at every other Asian restaurant in the area. 

I had fried duck in a curry sauce the first time. Crispy, juicy, perfect duck in a spicy curry. Liked it a lot

The basil fried rice was perfect with excellent basil flavor and spice. Would get both again. 

I've had better basil rolls before but they aren't bad here. Lot of lettuce."}
{"text":"My family are all big fans of Asian food. My middle child, especially. At 12, she loves sushi, all kinds of Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Vietnamese food. Tonight she tried Thai for the first time - of course, she is a fan. Charm Thai is a great spot. She tried the Pad Thai and loved it. I enjoyed the duck choo chee very much. Our server was terrific. With an appetizer of chicken dumplings, two entrees and an iced tea, with tip we spent about $40."}
{"text":"Went back for a 2nd trip since my first meal was so divine. Again I was very pleased. Service was very good again. This time for an ap we got the Tempura Shrimp roll. It as literally the best sushi roll I have ever had hands down. I even sushi all over the country NYC, Chicago, LA, San Francisco, as well as other CLE. places. This one was THE best. Tender hot shrimp with bean sprouts and fish roe. It was fresh and delicious. Got the green tea bubble tea again bf had coconut both very good. I can't to go again and try more sushi!"}

Minutes from 77.
Freshest ingredients and very reasonably priced. 
Best Miso soup!!
Staff is super and restaurant is beautifully decorated!

{"text":"Great Duck Dish

First time at the location.  It's in an out-of-the-way 3 store strip mall.  Very clean and neat interior.  I happen to know one of the servers, Jackie, who works there (and was working today) and she had recommended the crispy duck.  So I decided to give it a try.  Was not disappointed.

I decided to try the hot and sour soup first.  Totally different from the traditional Chinese hot and sour soup.  You could taste the heat and the sourness.  Very good.  But if you expect the Chinese variety, this isn't for you.  It had a couple of whole shrimp and some whole mushrooms in it.  

I also tried the Chili Duck.  They have about four different crispy duck dishes with different sauces.  The Chili Duck was recommended by Jackie.  This was probably the best duck I've had in a restaurant.  It was accompanied by fresh vegetables (which I didn't eat much of - focused on the duck) and a side dish of choice.  I had the sticky rice.  Very good choice.

Jackie also recommended the Thai Iced Tea.  She first asked if I could tolerate milk, which was no problem for me.  It was delicious.  A different iced tea experience, but one that I would try again...and again.

All in all an excellent dining experience.  Will definitely go again.  AND...I would certainly recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys Asian cuisine but would like a change from the standard Chinese fare.

P.S.  Another reviewer stated they are not open on Sundays.  I was there today, Sunday, May 20.  They are in fact opened on Sundays but apparently only have the dinner menu items available according to their website."}
{"text":"I love their hot and sour soup, pad Thai, and crazy noodle!!! And sushi is fresh and yummy!!!"}
{"text":"i've been jonesing for Pad Thai endlessly lately and we decided to check out Charm Thai on Saturday night. I got ballsy and got my Country Style Pad Thai at a level 3 hot and was not disappointed in the level of heat. in fact it hurt my for a couple days after. 
I'm open to going back again. the restaurant is nice, the service is great and the food was good. though, next time i'm sticking to level 2 heat or lower."}
{"text":"I eat Thai food all over the USA- because yes I'm obsessed and also I just happen to travel a lot. This place is one of my fave restaurants ever. There food is excellent and the owners and staff are so kind. Basically for me - when I eat Thai food they hold the benchmark. 

When I go to Charm Thai- I feel like family. My favorite dishes are the Chicken Thai Basil, Crazy Noodles ( Pad Kee Mao), Pad Thai, spring rolls and crab Rangoon- the list could go on. I have not had a bad dish yet.

The atmosphere of restaurant is cute, quaint and pleasant. I would say do all in the surrounding suburbs this would be an excellent date night spot or take out for any given reason. 

Note: they are not open on Sundays"}
{"text":"I will have to try this place again and try a different dish. I got the red curry with vegetables and the spice level was so weak. I also got a pineapple smoothie that was pretty good but there was some sort of after taste that was kinda sodium like.

The decor is great, unexpected from the outside. Not a typical cheesy Asian place, very polished. The service was not bad but not great. They open at 11am and we got there at 11:30, there were a few tables but not even half full, and I felt rushed. I understand trying to turn tables but this was a bit much. I will repeat maybe after lunch hours."}
{"text":"Seeing positive reviews on Yelp is usually how I make most of my food decisions. But I have to say this place was an exception. I ordered vegetable friend rice with tofu. You would think a meal filled with vegetables and rice has no chance of going bad. I was wrong. The veggies tasted like they have been left out or spoiled for a few days. The rice was undercooked and all in all, it tasted like they sprinkled soy sauce all over the plate. I also had terrible diarrhea the next morning. Not going to this place again. 

Also--- the customer service was terrible. The waitresses try to do a good job, but the owner/manager is a different story. She cares more about her $2 extra for steamed tofu than the actual quality of her food."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Thai places in Cleveland.  Whenever I try a new Thai restaurant, I almost always start with pad thai and a tom yum type of soup, so it's easy to compare.  Good, expected flavors that hits the spot. I wouldn't call it unique, but I wasn't disappointed either.  I never used to mind this part (since I used to believe this was a hallmark of authenticity), but I do wish the shrimp tails didn't contain their shells.  With that said, I am glad they included the shrimp automatically in their pad thai and soup without parsing out the protein like most Thai places lately.  A good blend of authenticity and American CLE."}
{"text":"We got the fresh basil rolls, pad thai, and mango fried rice. Absolutely delicious. Classy atmosphere, attentive service, and very clean. A+... just wish they were located a little closer :)"}
{"text":"A lot of women from my church love to come here so I decided to take my husband to try it out this past weekend.  

The staff and managers here are great.  We were both somewhat new to Thai food, so the older sweet lady manager came over and helped us decide on some menu choices.

The steamed chicken potstickers were amazing.  In fact they were so good that I couldn't even snatch up a photo before they were gone.

My husband got the hot beef entree.  Overall he liked it, but said that the beef was a little tough.  I got the beef Bangkok curry.  Very delish.  The meat was super moist, practically falling apart in the dish.  The curry did pack a punch though...which I wasn't expecting.  My mouth was burning for at least an hour after dinner.

Overall, the food and ambiance was good.  Giving 4 stars, since we thought the side portions of rice were too small to accommodate the amount of curry/entree.  Would we go back?  Probably.  Just have to prepare our palette for the spice."}
{"text":"Had house salad and the spicy authentic version of pad thai... great meal!

Would go back again!"}
{"text":"Really good Thai food in Parma? In a strip mall? 

This was the initial reaction we had to this suggestion, but Sweetheart and I met 3 friends there for dinner a few nights ago, and it was great. Now, I could eat Thai every day, but Sweetheart is less enamored of it. We both opted for the Crazy Noodle dish - hers vegetarian, mine with chicken and shrimp. We each loved our respective versions. We shared a bunch of appetizers with our friends - spring rolls (maybe called basil rolls?), scallion pancakes, crab Rangoon, and itty-bitty egg roll things. All of the appetizers were good, some were even really good, but they weren't oh-my-word-call-my-mother delicious. 

For entrees, we had the aforementioned Crazy Noodles, spicy Pad Thai, something with scallops, and some sushi and pot stickers. Reports on the sushi and pot stickers were good. I tried the spicy Pad Thai, and it was tasty - not super spicy. The scallops didn't meet my standards, but I'm from Maine... The flavor of the sauce on the scallops was tasty. All five of us were happy with our meals. 

I also had a decent gin and tonic from the bar. 

Service was good, and it was a comfortable and pleasant atmosphere. 

Ignore the distracting typos on the website's menu, and just go get some really good Thai food in Parma."}
{"text":"They didn't let me in at 8:20pm when they have sign saying they are open till 9 pm on Sunday's"}
{"text":"Just checked out Mint in coventry, gave it 2 stars.  Pales in comparison to Charm Thai- yum!"}
{"text":"Started off on a bad note. The place was almost empty yet I stood at the door for over 5min without as much as a \"we'll be with you in a minute\". Once the food started arriving it picked up a little though. The miso soup was some of the best I've had. After that, the sushi appetizer (5 piece chef selection) arrived. It was good, the sushi was fresh. For my main course I ordered the Duck choo chee. I wasn't too sure about it at first, but the more of it I ate, the more I liked it. My main issue with it was the undercooked vegetables. Maybe the reason they didn't get cooked thoroughly was because they were cut in chunks so big that I had to cut each carrot and squash piece into three more pieces just to fit them in my mouth.  they were such big chunks that some of them were still cool and raw in the middle. Over all I was not upset with my dining experience, but it was just an average meal."}
{"text":"I was a bit worried as we pulled into the parking lot to see that this restaurant was attached to an empty storefront and a Dunkin' Donuts.  My fears were calmed as we were seated and the smell of garlic, lemongrass and peanuts began wafting out of the kitchen.

The food is absolutely fantastic.  Slightly Americanized Thai food in freakin' Parma.  Servings are huge, the veggies are fresh, the decor is nice, and the waitresses are on the ball.  

Sadly, I didn't get to the sushi because the servings were too big for me to eat any more.  

The appetizers were all spot on, and the steamed dumplings were among the best I've ever eaten.

The Spicy Duck is awesome, the skin is crispy and snaps as you bite into it, the sauce is pleasantly warm and sweet.

The Duck Choo Chee is a beautiful curry dish, and my only complaint is that the skin was not as crispy as the spicy duck's.

The Lemongrass Chicken is very Americanized, and safe even for grandma's palate.  

I cannot wait to go back, and I hope that this charming establishment survives the construction on Broadview Road."}
{"text":"Great pad thai, decent service, overall nice place.  The bathroom doesn't make sense at all... just go in, it's bizarre.  I'm trying not to hand out 5's this year, but I really love this place.  Improvement would need to come from better service and touching up the ambiance."}
{"text":"I don't like thai food, and this place turned me off completely"}
{"text":"Yup I'm a fan.  I've tried a variety of menu items and have found them all to be delicious.  There are some 'Chinese' items on the menu for the less adventurous, but for those who love a good Thai curry they do a pretty good job.  I've also made a meal or two here purely from the sushi bar.  They have interesting specials that they ad to the menu while supplies last.  They recently had urchin roe that was presented in a nice simple maki roll.  Turns out Urchin roe is not my thing, but most of the sushi places around don't even offer it so I was more than happy to see it available and knock it off the need-to-try list.  

Lately I've discovered that I really prefer my sushi somewhat plainly prepared.  Sashimi and simple maki is just fine with me.  I'm just not in love with batter-dipped-deep-fried-honey-glazed-cream-cheese-and-Krabstick rolls.  Fortunately I've found the menu here to be accommodating and very reasonably priced.

The place is cute and the wait staff seem to be cheery and on the ball.   The kitchen works like a machine and even the sushi seems to come out with little wait time.

OK so there are two nitpicks.  1.  I chose to sit at the bar while they prepared my take away one day.  During the 10 minutes or so I waited neither of employees behind the bar asked if i wanted to order a drink while I waited.  Thought that was weird. 2.  I ordered the Seafood Madness once and here's what I have to say about it.  A.The name is stupid. B. I bit down on a hunk of mussel shell among the veggies, and it kinda hurt.  C. It was not \"** spicy\" as the menu claims.  When a Thai place says a dish is \"** spicy\" it should make my eyelashes sweat.

 Bottom line is I will be back again and again and I enthusiastically recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Charm Thai's food for several years- I have yet to find another restaurant whose curry competes with theirs. I always appreciate the fearlessness with which they apply their spiciness; 4 and above is not for the faint of heart! The service is always excellent, pickup is prompt, and the décor is beautiful. I definitely will be a returning customer for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"Absolutely love coming here! Pad Thai is my all time favorite dish! My husband and I always get our favorites and then a new dish to try! Never unhappy and I love the girls there! It's a perfect date night spot!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food! Nice, friendly service & cool ambiance! The owner helped us choose what to try & it was all delicious! I highly recommend trying this Thai restaurant if you love Thai food! You won't be disappointed! The Pad Tai was amazing & so where the appetizers! I'm pretty sure they serve the best Crab Rangoon I've had so far! We will return there, for sure!"}
{"text":"I went here to order to go one day because I heard from a friend that there's this new Thai place that just opened up down the street from where I live. I ordered their country pad thai - the portion is plentiful and for the price worth for. I wanted extra peppers and they didn't even charge me for it which I found pretty cool. What threw me off was when we made reservations for a separate occasion (Valentine's Day) around 7:30pm. The place wasn't really packed, it was a moderate evening. In other words, there were several tables but plenty of wait staff. 

Service is a big thing for me when I go out to eat so I didn't get that here. There were only 3 of us and literally, was sitting for about a couple of minutes and we didn't even get menus. We had to ask for them. The menu selection wasn't really that impressive and I think it's overpriced. 

FOOD tasted good and portions were perfect. Not really a WOW factor for me. We ordered the following dishes: 
1) Duck Choo Chee - portion was a-ok, the dish was cooked great and it had a kick to it that i was looking for
2) Mango Fried Rice - tasted like there was curry cooked in it, it was good. 
3) Chicken Ginger Basil - tasted like it is, the chicken was tender and not overly dry. Plenty of ginger in the dish 

All came with a choice of 2 sides: We picked Jasmine rice, but there were 5 other type of rice and noodles which I found it unnecessary. They had \"sticky rice\". 

I give it 3 stars because if the service was a bit better and the host was a little more helpful in giving recommendations then it'd be a 4 star. Plus, the food was AMERICANIZED. Not authentic. Decor in the place is intimate and great to bring a group of friends or a date. They do have a sushi bar, and full bar service. But overall, I wouldn't come again because I like authenticity and I didn't get that here. It was too overpriced and I only came here because I wanted to try eating there vs ordering out."}
{"text":"tried Charm because of a Cleveland Blog that mentioned it. I got the Pad Thai and Basil rolls with sauce on recommendation of the lady working the register. (very nice and friendly). The food here is delicious and plentiful. I've had Pad Thai at many places and Charm has an authentic freshly made Pad Thai. The rolls were also perfectly made with fresh carrots, basil, shrimp and lettuce. Fresh and crispy. I had enough left over for another meal. I would like to try more items on the menu ,but afraid I will order the Pad Thai over and over. I did not eat in the restaurant, but will check it out soon. Looks clean and nice decor.
Prices are good.

{"text":"The Pad Thai is extremely fresh with an amazing light, citrus  flavor. Great portions for the price too."}
{"text":"What a waste of money!!  my husband and I decided to skip the typical New Year's Eve party, and have a quiet dinner at home.  We hadn't had Thai food in quite awhile, and ordered take out from charm Thai.  I hope the new year is much, much better than the food we purchased.  Absolutely awful, complete waste of money.  Pot stickers were tasteless and were soggy, the mango curry---yuk!  The mango curry and pad Thai both awful-the chicken was dry and I found two pieces of shrimp - that's all in the mango curry dish.  Never thought a restaurant that calls itself Thai could screw up such a simple entree as pad Thai. Please don't waste your money. My New Years resolution-no more charm Thai food!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!!! I was introduced by a friend who kept begging me to try it, as she was already a huge fan. Man am I glad I Iet her talk me into it! My work is 5 minutes away and I now eat lunch here once a week. I always crave it!

I get the country style pad thai, which is the best pad thai I have ever tasted. It is a spicier version of pad thai and is perfection. I have ordered pad thai other places that I still love, but it's never the same. You can order it on a scale of 1-5 stars of spicy and 2 is just enough kick without making your tongue burn off as you eat it. I have tried 3 stars before and had to blow my nose from the heat clearing out my sinus' the whole meal. 

I am so glad charm thai is so close to where I work!!!"}
{"text":"Nice and cozy place. Food is good, specially crab appetizer. Lot of attention by staff. Had a really good time."}
{"text":"I used DoorDash to have our dinner delivered, I think this is where I went wrong. I had someone call me and inform me the restaurant could not do my order as I had placed it (light pad Thai sauce) on he Country Style Pad Thai. I said this was no problem and just make it as it comes. Then they called me back 15 minutes later and told me that they didn't have any Shrimp Basil Rolls left - no biggie I realize these are popular. When our food came (which was quite quick after this mishap) my pad Thai was wrong. Not only was it not the Country Style (spicy version) but there was tofu inside which wasn't listed on the menu. Overall the quality of the food was fabulous. I think that next time we'd be better off going to eat in person and are looking forward to it :)"}
{"text":"The best Thai food that I have had. My green curry chicken was better than any that I had in Thailand! The pad Thai-phenomenal. The owner is very sweet and the service was superb. Do not miss out on this restaurant ."}
{"text":"Love this place! Have been numerous times and everything I have ordered has been great! My favorites are the country pad thai, mango fried rice and red curry. Great little gem in Parma!"}
{"text":"Mango curry is great...great lunch special....Decorated well...fresh vegetables...."}
{"text":"Stopped here to to check out the resturant for the first time the employees were very welcoming i ordered the pad thai to try for the first time and i have to say it was very good alittle diffrent from chineese style cooking but will defenitly recommend trying"}
{"text":"If there was one more reason to need a teleportation device, Charm Thai is it. The sushi was fresh and so tasty, our spring rolls light and delicious, my friend's curry dish was just superb. The service was very friendly and quick and even though we stayed past closing time, we weren't given the bum's rush. Now all I need, is one in Lakewood.

Charm Thai: further proving that some of our country's best food is found in strip malls."}
{"text":"Got take out for the first time.  Hubby got sweet and sour chicken with rice.  I got pineapple chicken with udon noodles.  This was not what we expected.  Firstly,  the sauce  was very soupy and thin, but the veggies looked fresh.  The noodles were very thick, reminding me of worms.  Never had these before so not sure if they are supposed to be like that. After a few bites, I decided I really didn't like the taste at all. The carrots were under done and hard.  The veggies would have been tasty but drowning in the soupy sauce, if you could call it that,  ruined those too. The chicken was okay, but ick with the soup. Hubby didn't like his anymore than I did.  Sorry but we won't go back."}
{"text":"Just had my first meal, and probably my last at this place. 

I ordered the Pad Thai as part of a take-out order. For $11 bucks, my expectations weren't that high, but it was hard to get over the portions being so small. If you've ever had one of those weight-watchers microwave meals, that was similar in size to the container I received. Perhaps when dining in, they give you more? 

My bigger concern is that they don't do a good job removing the veins of their shrimp. Of the three pieces of shrimp that came with my meal, all of them still had at least half of their veins still in place. Maybe other folks don't mind eating that, but I find it nasty."}
{"text":"Dinner for four at Charm Thai.  Started off with the Steamed Shumai and was pretty severely disappointed--seemed more like the kind of stuff one would pop in the microwave instead of having at a restaurant.  Things did not get any better with the \"Hot and Soup Soup,\" which might be better known to some as Tom Yum Soup:  The broth was good and just the right heat level (for me at least, and admittedly I don't like things too spicy), but the shrimp, mushrooms, and other ingredients were in far too short supply.  I heard positive things about the Seafood Coconut Soup, but did not try it myself.

As for main dishes, the Pineapple Fried Rice was pretty solid, but I've had it better at other area Asian restaurants.  The Pad Thai seemed to be pretty par for the course.  The Beef Macadamia was alright, but I probably would not get it again.  I really liked, however, the Duck Choo Chee.  The curry sauce was very good (again, not too spicy for my own tastes) and went well with the boneless sliced duck.

The restaurant environment is very inviting and definitely has a relative upgrade in style over what one usually expects out of an average Asian eatery.  One slight problem is that we happened to visit on a cold winter night, and the restaurant seemed to have difficulties keeping warm (likely compounded by the high ceilings).  Overall, Charm Thai is a definite step up from your average takeout, but I thought that it suffered food-wise against some of its area peers."}
{"text":"If I was Parma Mayor Dean DiPiero, I'd be pretty huffy after reading the majority of reviews, which have the common theme,  \"It's a pretty darn good place that you shouldn't expect in PARMA!!!\"

But the reviewers are right, nice place with a very friendly staff, an unpretentious but elegant atmosphere, and consistently tasty food.  I don't eat a lot of Thai food, but I'm always happy with my meal.

For this neck of the woods, this is one of the culinary highlights."}
{"text":"I've been here two or three times and the meals have been consistent each time. Not true for the service but that can be expected anywhere. Good selection on the menu with prices you'd expect to pay at any similar Thai restaurant.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good for Cleveland, mediocre for Thai in other cities"}
{"text":"Ate here today! Loved it. The pad Thai is delicious, the duck is amazing and the sushi is wonderful!! The service is always fast and friendly. They put a lot of thought into the decor so it's nice to eat inside or you can carry out. They have a full bar with good cocktails and a wine and beer list also. Love this little hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Alright went back here when my partners were in town.  They crapped on the wine but they can do that because it makes them feel good about selves.

We again started off with the Basil Spring Rolls and the Chive Pancakes.  Both are awesome.  Must haves.

I once again had the Green Curry but we also got the Mango Curry and a Basil Thai Curry but i couldn't find it on the menu.  Again, the Currys here are awesome.  You won't be disappointed on the food that is for sure."}
{"text":"Used to be great... Not so much anymore.  Dined in with my wife, and I had the country style pad thai. I like it spicy.  It came out grainy and warm. Not spicy at all, and not very good.  Very disappointed. Won't return"}
{"text":"Definitely weird seeing a Thai restaurant in Parma, in this area. It doesn't quite belong, but I do hope it lasts and helps the people in the area broaden their horizons.  With Japanese, Thai, and even Korean restaurants in or around the city, Parma is REALLY coming into its own.

You actually get an even bigger sense of \"Why is this here?\" when you walk in. The decor is very modern industrial, seemingly reserved for big city restaurants (NYC, Chicago, DC). I love it. The service is good. The menu is identical to that of Sweet Mango, and I can't remember if I heard that it is the same owner. It wouldn't surprise me, although the food quality takes a small hit, and the price is a bit steeper (business isn't quite as booming as Sweet Mango).

The pad thai here is good, again considering where you're at. If you're willing to drive a few more miles, there are better, cheaper options. I have tried a few other dishes but I'm a pad thai man and this more than does the job if I need to grab a quick takeout dinner.

If you're in the area and are craving Thai food, Charm Thai is more than capable of delivering the goods (figuratively).  Sweet Mango and Map of Thailand are better options if you really want to treat your taste buds."}
{"text":"We had reservations here 2 weeks in advance for a birthday dinner and when we arrived, our seating arrangement was so jacked up.  We were seated way in the back and our whole party was seperated by awkward seating arrangements.  Majority of the people were sat in an L shaped booth while the rest of us were in our own booths. We had 4 different seating areas which made it not fun at all.

First impressions its a clean, dimly lit place with a friendly staff.  Attire is a little more on the higher end of casual.  They offer food from thai, chinese, and japanese (sushi).   They have a full liquor/beer bar including xmas ale! (5 dollars ea)

The rest of our friends finally arrived looking around all confused on where to sit, as we're not all together.  The food finally came out.. MmMmm luckily their food made up for all this disappointment so far.  We got some sushi and curries along with rice and other chicken dishes.  The sushi was surprisingly good for a thai place lol. The curries were mediocre  and calamari was pretty good. 

All in all.. This place was okay.  I just wish they have had planned our reservations out better.  They should have placed us in the front on the long table. If you're going to eat here just come in smaller groups I guess.  The service on the other hand is amazing.  The staff were all friendly and had smiles on their faces.  The food is good for a local thai place in the area and the location is pretty easy to find. If you're looking for a truly authentic thai experience look elsewhere.  It's more of a modern day americanized thai place. Id totally recommend this place for a quick fix on your thai/japanese  craving though if you're in the area.  I drove 45 minutes so my expectations were high from all these reviews on here."}
{"text":"This was a random stop for me. I was taking care of some business and was lunch time. 

I was greeted with a friendly smile and the service was on point.

I ordered the mango fried rice. It was amazing. Full of flavor. I will be coming back next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Overall the taste of their food was fine. The quality was OK. The portions were small for the price.  One appetizer, one rice plate which was $9 and barely fed two people, and two entrées was $50 plus tip.  If you want great Thai food, look up Siam Cafe in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I thought I already reviewed this place, but looks like I missed it! I've been here two or three times so far, and have to say the food is great!! I love the spices, the portions are good sized, and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I stopped in Charm Thai after dealing with rusty metal all day.  After walking in, I felt under dressed and just settled on getting some Pad Thai to go.  It was pretty good.  Medium sauce, not heavy, not light...good on taste, lots of vegetables.  Could've had some more Tofu but then again I am a former (and on my comeback tour) tofu-off champion.  
The menu had typical Thai choices and some Indian as well.  I do hope I get to try more of them.
Lovely décor and atmosphere including a sushi bar too.
Next time I'll sit down and dine rust or no rust."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and will say it's delicious! Great service, nice atmosphere, and good generous portions of food! 

A great place for Thai cuisine!"}
{"text":"I was in the area after going for a hike, so we stopped here for lunch.  The decor at the restuarant was nice and clean.  It was decently crowded for a Saturday lunch but we still got seated right away. I ordered the pad see ew and my friend ordered the pad thai off of their lunch menu.  While the dishes were decent, I wasn't that impressed.  I thought my dish could have more flavor and (maybe I was just really hungry) the dishes seemed a bit small. I also ordered a taro smoothie which was pretty good.  There are definitely other options for more flavorful Thai food and better prices."}
{"text":"What an amazing treat.  The food was so fresh and delicious.   Before hoping on a plane to head to Texas, I'm glad we stopped for lunch.  Definitely will frequent this place every time I return to Parma, which this year is quite frequently."}
{"text":"I normally don't eat Thai food. This was only the second time ever trying it actually. The first time was a pretty good experience and this one went pretty good as well so now I'm 2 for 2. Spicy enough just like I wanted it. Big portion of noodles and chicken. Not overbearing at all. The sushi was fresh as well. The ice tea was terrible. Winner for the most part."}
{"text":"Love their Chicken Pad Thai. I would give them 5 stars but they stopped serving Sushi and they are not consistent with spices."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Cleveland. This place is always good. 
Chili salmon special today was awesome. 
Pad Thai is always a hit. I stole some if my daughter's today and it was great as usual. 
My wife loves the curry here."}
{"text":"Charm Thai is an excellent restaurant! My boyfriend and I visited the restaurant on a Monday for dinner. When we arrived we were greeted by the hostess and quickly seated. Our waitress arrived a shortly after and took our drink orders. After much contemplation over the menu we ordered dumplings as an appetizer. It was very delicious and came out quickly. For dinner I got the green curry which was very tasty. All in all a great experience and I am looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"I arrived late one evening for dinner on a weekday night. I arrived with about 30 minutes to spare to their closing time - I was the only customer present during this time frame.

I looked over the menu and ordered the Tom Yum soup, the Som Tum (Papaya salad) and I wanted Kee Mao Gai (Drunken noodles). They did not offer Drunken noodles specifically, they had something close - but I decided to order their crispy, spicy duck instead.

Turns out they could not serve me the Papaya salad. Apparently, they were out of some of the ingredients required to make it. Which was disappointing.

I ordered both the soup and the Duck to be extra spicy. Both were well executed from a spice/heat level.

Service was good. I wish they had waited to start mopping the floors until after I had left. The smell from the disinfectant/chemical in the mop water was unpleasant and interfered with my enjoyment of the meal.

#CharmThai"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place's chive pancakes.

For a while, I've been on the lookout for good scallion (green onion) pancakes, and this, certainly, fits the bill.

The sauce is great, too."}
{"text":"PROS: Americanized Thai food that's edible...in PARMA.  Pretty large servings.  Decent-sized, airy interior, good for groups.  Cute, mod decor.  (I'm a sucker for colorful lamps, soft light and dark wood paneling.)

CONS: Food ranging from sub-par to very mediocre at best. Spotty follow-up on the part of the wait service, even when the place is practically deserted.  

AMBIANCE: Casual fine dining.  Intimate/romantic and classy but not imposingly ritzy.

SECRET AWESOME DISCOVERY: Mixing in a side of udon with the duck choo chee dish=amazing marriage of texture and flavor.

...

Wow.  Why are the ratings for this place as inflated as Pam Anderson's tits?

The ratings for this place are waaaaaay too high.  Even 3 stars is being generous--it's really 2 stars in my experience with Thai food, but (not to continue the broken record of my fellow Yelpers) it's Parma for chrissakes.  That there's Thai food in Parma is a notable feat in itself.  Hence the extra star.

Dinner for two:
Appetizer: soft shell crab tempura
Entrees: Country Pad Thai and Duck Choo Chee with udon as side
Extra side: jasmine rice

The appetizer was probably our least favorite.  Unless you're a huge fan of soft shell crab or chomping through soft shells and savoring a fishy taste, you can safely pass on this palette teaser.  The mango salsa was syrupy but decent.  Could've been turned up a notch by switching out the iceberg lettuce for something more textured and fragrant like arugula, frisee, lollo rosa, or even just some chard or romaine to counter the sugar of the mango and the fishy-ness of the crab.  Another thing that threw me off was that it was only one huge piece of fried crab, cut in half.  I was expecting finger-food-type strips of tempura crab, not one crab, halved.  So definitely not something to order for a party of more than 2 people.

The Country Pad Thai was decent but on the bland side and not spicy at all (yikes).  We literally couldn't take another bite till the waiter came to our rescue with some authentically strong, chili flake sauce.  The dish came with shrimp (with shells on), unwieldy, slab-like chicken breast slices,overly dried out fried tofu cubes, plenty of green onions (which I liked), and a small slice of lime to add some much-needed zest to the dish.  Could've been vastly improved with more spice, lime juice, bean sprouts and crushed peanuts/peanut sauce--all of which were so sparingly used that I honestly thought they had omitted them entirely.

And finally, the Duck Choo Chee was better, taste-wise, but overboard on the coconut milk.  The sauce, in which soggy-skinned fatty duck morsels, bell peppers, and carrots were swimming, must have been at least 85% pure coconut milk.  Everything was tasty, creamy, and overwhelmingly coconut-y--which may be a good thing, if you're really into coconut.  Our side of plain and dry udon--which we'd expected to come in soup as it's traditionally served--turned out to be the best addition to the coconutty dish.  Mixed in the sauce, the thick, textured Japanese noodles offered a nice counterbalance to the creaminess without absorbing the sauce too much.  Try it!  You'll agree.
       
If this place is capable of making anything slightly authentic or good, it might be available off-menu via direct orders with the chef.  Till I find a way to get in on that super secret off-menu selection, I'd rather go hungry than come back, next time an Asian food craving hits me in Parma."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place!

So, it's actually very difficult to make a good pad thai, which makes it a good barometer for the quality of thai cuisine.  We've been to multiple thai places in the Cleveland area, and we've had pad thai that was too sweet, too mushy, too dry, as well as one that had an all-around off-taste.  Here, the pad thai is nice and moist with the right level of sweetness, maybe slightly runny, but altogether very well done.

The charm fried rice tasted pretty decent too.  We were, however, a bit disappointed by the chive pancakes - they tasted thick and doughy.

The whole place smells of incense, which bothered my girlfriend a bit.  But overall, I would rank this as one of the better thai places in the area."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and the service is great. Parma doesn't have many non chain restaurants and I think this is one of the best. Duck red curry is wonderful."}
{"text":"Got yellow curry when I was here with a friend~ Really good, I just do not think cherry tomatoes go with curry. I hope to come back again, want to try this place out more than the other curry places nearby."}
{"text":"We've been eating at this place since it opened up, so it must be over a dozen visits or so now. While it sits in a strip mall next to a Dunkin Donuts, typical of a Parma establishment, the interior decor is sharp and attractive. Every dish has always been tasty, and beautifully presented. I absolutely love a number of the dishes, particularly the yellow curry (with chicken-excellent), and the scallop & eggplant dish.  I must admit I haven't tried many other main dishes or the sushi, because I come specifically when I want one of these two dishes. My wife and kids love the mango fried rice - an oft ordered dish for them. Dinner portions are large, and the appetizers have always been tasty (with an exception of the soft-shell crab tempura, which we didn't care for). Service is always attentive. We recommend it often to our friends - and to you!"}
{"text":"I am new in town and was delighted to discover Charm Thai within 5 minutes of my house. The building itself looks pleasant and clean. The woman working the counter was very helpful as she gave me every menu they had and invited me to sit at a table as I decided. I ordered the Basil Chicken with Jasmine Rice. ($11.95) The order was quickly prepared and I was on my way. The meal was ample in portion and was all high quality ingredients. Long story short - great meal with good fresh flavor. I will a regular in the years to come. Very satisfied!"}
{"text":"I recently ventured into the Thai cuisine world and this place was a great restaurant to kick it off. 

My friend lives down the street from here and recommended it to me. 
It is a nice place and to be honest I felt a bit under dressed. She ordered a few things for us to share and try. Everything was good! 
The portions are def big enough for one hungry person. We ordered two types of rolls and some pad thai that was extra spicy upon request- yum!
Thai tea and a small to-go container for late light leftovers and I was good to go"}
{"text":"I've only tried the Pad Thai and some of the sushi items and they were all very solid. I've read that they have removed the sushi which is a shame but the Thai options are worth a try. It's a decent lunch spot in the Seven Hills area."}
{"text":"the food is very good, delicious and a great price, Spicey string bean and chicken dishes are great but PLEASE GIVE US MORE SHRIMP !!  MORE SHRIMP you get just 3 pieces in each dinner , I'd give 5 stars but don't jip me on the shrimp, also it might be the owners son or a young adult maybe 17-20 who will be a smart azz at times, he will tell you to go look at his fish, when you look at the fish he will say you didn't take my fish did you , give me back my fish , a little weird but he thinks its funny,  stay away from him , very far away and do not look at the fish !! enjoy your meal"}
{"text":"There must have been a change in ownership as they longer serve sushi.  The portions have dwindled and price stayed same.  Not worth the money....too bad because it was a good place for Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"Way bigger and attractive on the inside than I expected.  Got the pork panang curry and I was literally scraping it out of the dish with a fork to get as much sauce as possible. Pork was slightly dry and the vegetables were slightly undercooked but the rice was perfect. Dinner portions are a good size and lunch portions are perfect for mid day.  They offer 5 different stars of spice, and if you like heat I'd def start at a 3.  Great little neighborhood joint; happy to have found it and will be back."}
{"text":"I am incredibly picky when it comes to Sushi & Sashimi there are only a few places in the area where ill eat these and Charm Thai is one of them.  There is a good variety to choose from here and everything I have tried has been very good. 

As far as the rest of the menu goes
I have only tried a couple entrees here; The Chili Duck and Basil Chicken.  Both were good and were portioned perfectly.  The Bubble Tea smoothies are good too, I'm a big fan of the green tea variant.  They also offer brown rice as a side which is great.

The decor is typical for a place like this nothing special, the service has been consistently nice and fast. 

I really do not have anything negative to say about Charm Thai I would recommend it to anyone especially to to those who enjoy Sushi & Sashimi as much as I do."}
{"text":"A nice restaurant with or of the best Thai food.
The owner always welcomes, with a smile. I have taken loads of my friends, and every single one has went there again. Fresh food, love the basil fried rice there. Crab Rangoon also a favorite."}
{"text":"I have only ate at a couple Thai restaurants so my experiences are limited.  That being said this place is great.  I have had the country pad Thai, a couple curry dishes and the Crazy Noodle dish and they have all been great.  The country pad Thai is my favorite.  I have not tried the sushi but I have heard great things about it. Highly recommended ESP in an area where there isn't a large variety of unique high quality restaurants."}
{"text":"This place used to be the best thai restaurant in the Cleveland area by far, and i used to recommend it to everyone. But this has all changed. Now the food is dismal. Two visits ago, both me and my brother were served undercooked chicken on the Papaya salad. We told the server, and she apologized profusely, fixed it, and gave us 15% off the meal. Then, several days ago I decided to give them another chance, and so ordered the country style pad thai to go. The pad thai used to be spicy, well seasoned, and one of the best dishes i had ever had. When i got it this time, it was bland, cold, and outright disgusting. In fact the napkins in the bag were more appetizing than the pad thai. It was so terrible that i wouldn't even give it to my dogs to eat. The significant declined of this place is very sad because it used to be amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  The Duck Choo Chee is awesome!  And the Mixed Plate is a great appetizer."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese, Thai, Japanese food in this area. Tastes gourmet and they have brown rice. Huge sushi assortment as well. Full drink menu from wine to beer to cocktails."}
{"text":"After searching for a decent thai restaurant, we finally find one! My yellow thai curry was excellent. My thai tea was done well. Believe me, other places have effed up a simple thai tea.  It's nothing like the thai restaurants in LA but this one is close enough. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I don't have a lot to add to the many accurate and great reviews already posted except this: THANK YOU FOOD GODS FOR BRINGING US MERE MORTALS CHARM THAI!!!

Not only is their Thai food as good as it gets (try the duck choo chee. Oh. M. G!), but their sushi is as good as anyplace we've enjoyed it in Cleveburg, and we've had it at Sushi Rock, Parallax, and that great place on Chagrin whose name escapes me at the moment). 

Don't let the location fool you. Not many Clevelanders know that Parma was founded by the Thais! OK, maybe not, but, still...it's a wonderful wonderful restaurant that deserves the praise. Nice people run it, too."}
{"text":"I have been here at least four times now and each time I am impressed. This is the kind of place that just gets it right. I order a pad thai or curry entree and it is always excellent. The prices are reasonable, the service is better than I'd expect, the place is classy (even though its in a strip mall next to dunkin' donuts) and you get a lot of good food with each entree. Some dishes worth trying include the panaang curry with a side of rice noodles, the spicy green bean dish and of course the pad thai. Wash it down with a cold Singha beer from thailand and you'll be happy. I have never tried their sushi because it seems odd for a Thai restaurant but if it is anything like the rest it will be excellent. 

There are a lot of good restaurants around but this is the best Thai restaurant I have found in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious overall. Love their fried rice! I do wish they had more sushi options. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"I am big fan of Thai Vietnamese Korean Japanese Chinese and Italian

OH well other than these what else we have left?

Charm Thai was my favorite restaurant but not anymore they perhaps changed the chef? Last year? I tried 4 times 2016 2017 and never been good

Only reason why I left 3 stars is charm Thai was my favorite for a long time other than this I would leave 2 stars"}
{"text":"Great food. ..moderate prices.  Pad Thai is yummy and the potstickers have a delicious sauce on them!  Service had always been good"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Pad thai to go and the food was ready in 15 minutes and hot. I have never had Pad Thai here before so I thought this would be the place to order it from based on the reviews. I really enjoyed the entree and flavor. It did have a heavy lime flavor but I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I was craving thai food and this hit the spot.I had the pot stickers, rice paper rolls with shrimp and pad thai. All were good and I would have again. Even with the level of spice added it was not as spicy as I would like but the server offered sauces with the spices to add in that hit the spot. I did also try he chicken curry dumplings the sauce was good but the whole chicken meatball thing in the middle was not for me. Service was very attentive and friendly. There is nothing like good service. For people not familiar with thai food there are pictures in the menu to help you out. I would reccomend and return."}
{"text":"I know, it's beside Dunkin' Donuts in Parma, but really - please try it!

We've eaten in and had take out.  The Crab Rangoon is perfect.  They aren't the huge, over-fried Crab Rangoon that come from Chinese delivery, they are delicate, crispy, and not-too-sweet.  The Country Pad Thai is a spiciness that is just-right and all off the fruit fried rice dishes (pineapple, mango) are really delicious.  The Beef Macadamia is also very good. 

Overall, totally surprising for the location and the best thai food that I've had in the area."}
{"text":"Charm Thai is much better than Thai Gourmet and one of the only two options within a 5 mile radius for a Thai lunch. Charm Thai has high ceilings and is kind of a fancy interior for a strip mall. The menu is very similar to Thai Gourmet. They also offer sushi. The menu is somewhat limited and hosts the usual mainstays. My favorite lunch has been the Thai Basil Chicken. It is usually helpful to ask for the hot chili sauce if you like spicy food. The service was excellent and the people working there seemed to enjoy their jobs. Unlike the dudes at Thai Gourmet who seem like they are on their 19th nervous breakdown on each lunch rush. I wish some of the chaos from that restaurant would spill on down the road south to Charm Thai. It is a very peaceful and serene lunch getaway without all of the corporate chatter you have to deal with when dining at the lunch hour in Independence."}
{"text":"I want to say this place is the on my list of the Top two best Thai restaurants in the Cleveland area.  The pad thai dish is truly authentic (my Thai friends from Thailand told me so).  Get the country pad thai dish, my favorite.  I haven't tried many of their dishes, but you can't go wrong with the country style pad thai and the basil fried rice.  My friends who are non-Thai enjoy the curry dishes and the panang dishes as well.  LOL at  the previous poster who said that he/she didnt like Thai food and rated this restaurant poorly...of course if you dont like Thai food you arent going to like it duh.

Anyways Ive been to many local Thai restaurants and Charm is one of my favorites.  I am originally from Chicago and I know good Thai food.  Their fried ice cream is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Simply put: I'm addicted and I don't know how to stop. I've always loved Pad Thai, but I've never been addicted. Now thanks to Charm Thai, I'm completely smitten. I've honestly never had anything but the Vegetarian Pad Thai, but it's the best I've ever had. Everything is incredibly fresh. The veggies are nice and crunchy; not the soggy over-sauced mess you get at some places. One warning though: if you ask for something spicy, they're not going to kid around. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone. For those used to Parma's chain restaurants, this is really a gem."}
{"text":"Charm Thai is good. The interior is nicely done, with plenty of seating and comfy booths. I've tried a few of their dishes, and all have been tasty. Pad Woon Sen, Charm Fried Rice was definitely a fave, and even the Red Curry. Their service can be a little slow at times and for the prices, the portions are just kinda skimpy. Great location and will definitely come back - but not the best value for a small restaurant in a strip mall."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is always good, the workers pleasant and prompt. The bubble tea smoothies are all very delicious!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for Parma, Ohio.  The portion sizes were adequate for sharing.  We ordered:
Country Phad Thai - This entree is recommended.  It's spicy and flavorful.
Regular Phad Thai - This entree is only OK, it's not very flavorful.
Chili Crispy Duck - The duck is fried, sliced then topped with a spicy brown sauce, pretty good.
Green Curry Beef - There was too much coconut milk in the dish which made the curry very thick and drowned out the flavors of the curry.  I would not recommend this entree.
California Roll and Salmon Skin Roll - The sushi rice was a bit too hard. 
Soft Shell Crab - The mango salsa topping made this appetizer worth trying."}
{"text":"Used to be good they sold the place now not so good and they don't even have sushi anymore which was the best thing that they had"}
{"text":"Forgettable Thai food. Went here with high expectations based on glowing reviews. 

I have tried many Thai restaurants and the three dishes we tried here were all mediocre to sub-par. 

Potstickers are bland, boring typical frozen and reheated style with little flavor and boring sauce. 

Pad Thai- a staple- was very bland and lacked any real flavor. 

Pineapple chicken was in a nondescript brown sauce - tasted like bad elementary school Chinese. 

Overall would not be driven to try again. Servers tend to be confused with requests and answers to their own questions."}
{"text":"Ordered the pad thai (carry out) and was very disappointed. There was absolutely no flavor except for the peanuts. I have had the country version in the past, but opted for the regular. I will not oder this again."}
{"text":"A lot of cool trinkets are set all around this place, it was set up very nicely. Very cozy place. They have a jellyfish there in a tiny tank, its fake though. Everyone was extra friendly during our visit. 

Menu had one or two Vietnamese dishes, Pho and maybe another. A sushi menu as well, I stuck with the Pad Thai(traditional), it was excellent. 

One down side to this place is arriving, its like a video game that keeps changing routes to keep you out. I don't know who constructed that parking lot, but they need to go somewhere very high, I mean YouTube vide \"stairway to heaven\" high and jump ever so gracefully. You have to enter from the street, drive through the gas station, cut across Dunkin Doughnuts drive-thru then park. Horrific! After all that work just to park, anyone who eats here earned their meal upon successful arrival.
