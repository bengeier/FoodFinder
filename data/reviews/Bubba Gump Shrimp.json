{"text":"The food, service, and drinks were great! I loved the dish, Jenny's catch- the lobster sauce was out of this world and tilapia didn't taste fishy at all! The dish was recommended by the waitress whom was really nice to us as well! Great place on the strip! Has outdoor eating as well."}
{"text":"By far my worst dining experience in Vegas.  All the décor was great, but the service was not.  The food was bland and greasy.  I felt heavy and tired walking out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.    Service was okay.    My 20oz Bud Light was $13.72???????? WTF?!?!?"}
{"text":"I spent and wasted 238.00 dollars on nasty food...jambalaya was hot and couldn't even taste flavoring...shrimp were over cooked rice was hard...kids pizza was not cook thoroughly and my husband ordered a burger medium rare...it look totally raw/pink....very upset about this Las Vegas Strip location.....would not recommend...and the service was not superb! It was mediocre!..."}
{"text":"Where to start- food was ok and beer selection decent.  Very disappointed with our dessert.  But my son loved Forest Gump and just loved the theme, including getting all the questions correct on the quiz.  Biggest downside- very pricey but everything in that area was over priced."}
{"text":"I went in with family on Thursday. We parked at Planet Hollywood, took about 10 minutes to walk to the restaurant. The lower level is the gift shop which you have to walk thru to get up to the restaurant (of course). There's a patio with the view of the strip which was pretty nice and the waiter was good. The appetizer was awesome, we ordered the bubba far out dip (tortilla chips & spinach roasted bell pepper, artichoke and jack cheese). We had the seafood trio and surf & turf entrees, both dishes were too salty and the steak was a little overcooked. The fizzy fun and frozen lemon-ups beverages were awesome and we got to keep the glass. Overall, for the price we paid, we were disappointed and expected more. Will I go back? Probably not!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Bubba Gump and I'm sure it will be my last. I am not a picky eater but my boyfriend and I developed the worst case of upset stomach after eating here. The location is good and the service is wonderful...  BUT the food  just did not sit well with us.   We ordered the dip for an appetizer. It was okay, not super hot as it should have been. I ordered the shrimp poboy for an entree which was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. Again, we are not food snobs and this was the first place we ate in the day. I'm gonna assume it was the dip that did us in. I really would love to give this place more stars. The waitresses are really good and attentive. But based on the vomiting and upset stomach my boyfriend and I both experienced after eating here I just can't. If you eat here maybe just stay away from the dip!"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic and quick! Food was great!  Loved the Forrest Gump trivia and knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"As a local, I was excited when we finally got one but my recent visit will cause me to never visit again. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich & my friend ordered the mahi. Both meals came out really fast and as we started eating, we realized that neither piece of our meat was cooked. I am not one to ever complain at restaurants but the chicken was pink and raw. The fish was gummy and uncooked. After informing our waiter he talked to the manager who did nothing for us. We decided to order dessert to make up for our awful meal. The cookie in the dessert was so hard we couldn't eat it. We had to finally ask for a manager.. who went on to tell us he wasn't sure why we would be on the strip during Memorial Day weekend and that he would have a talk with the chef. I'm not sure why we ended up paying full price for everything. I am extremely disappointed.. I love this restaurant but won't go on to recommend this food or service to anyone."}
{"text":"The service was just terrible. Half the time we didn't even know who our server was. My friend ordered vegetables sautéed with NO butter and olive oil instead but got a bowl full of vegetables in a pool of butter.   The view of the strip is amazing from here though."}
{"text":"Very good shrimp and crab legs.  Staff was very nice and accompanying.  We were able to get right in no wait and food came out shortly after we ordered."}
{"text":"Pro: Good decent food.  My server was great and attentive although he had his hands full with so many tables.  I left my bag and had to go back for it, and the GM had it up front for me to pick up. Con: It's overpriced, but so is everything in Vegas.  Everything was going good until I had flipped the plate to show \"stop Forrest Stop\" to get my check slip.  The waitress supervisor, I'm assuming, came with another server and gave me an attitude of why I showed the sign and what I wanted.  I smiled and said, \"check please.\"  My server gave me the check and so did the other one.  I gave my server 19% tip for good work, but a real ding for the rude supervisor."}
{"text":"The food was good, but overpriced.  Having said that, we did enjoy our dinner.  The servers were friendly.  We did have a reservation so got right in and seated. That was nice.   Be warned, if you have any difficulty walking, on crutches or in a wheelchair, it is a long distance from the parking garage or valet (which we did use)."}
{"text":"The flavor and variety of the shrimp are excellent. It was served hot and fresh. The hostess was very friendly.  The waitress was not patient. It was our first visit, so we had a couple questions about the menu. She was irritated by this. If the restaurant was busy, I would completely understand. But, we were only one of five tables in the whole restaurant at the time."}
{"text":"Bubba gumps based on the movie Forest Gump, later the waiter quizzed me on how many Dr Peppers Forest drank, he said 15, theres also a Dr Pepper sign on the restaurant wall, prior to all that I asked for a Dr Pepper, waiter said they \"dont have Dr Pepper\"...  WHAT THE??  ...no Mr Pibb either..."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this restaurant.  We had good food and good service.  The only complaint I would give is being charged 15 dollars a beer and not letting us know the price. You get to keep the glass but what if you don't want the glass. I'm a bartender and I wouldn't just bring someone the larger size and asume they would want the glass. That's pretty rediculous."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews on here. I think people sometimes make the time to leave that good ones out. Our server Chad #1 was awesome! The coconut shrimp was amazing! And so was the french fries, ranch, and mango strawberry chillers!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here this past weekend for my gf bday at this location! First timers! Food was delicious definitely what I was expecting and a lot more. I had the surf an turf and my gF had the \"in stuffed\" both entrees were great. Only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars was because our waiter lagged with our alcoholic beverages and our appetizer we where one of 3tavles that got there first and we where the last ones to get our stuff other than that everything was perfect !"}
{"text":"I've experienced Bubba Gumps once before coming to this one. When I heard Planet Hollywood was opening one I couldn't contain myself. The first thing you have when you enter is a souvenir shop which makes sense since there are a ton of tourists wandering the streets. you have to go upstairs to go to the actual restaurant. The walls are covered in Forest Gump memorabilia which makes it dangerous as you're walking up the stairs if you can't multi task.  Once we made it to the top the host asked whether we wanted to be seated inside, outside or at the bar. We chose outside and glad we did the view is AWESOME! Fast forward to ordering our food; our waiter was very helpful with explaining anything we had questions about and even offered suggestions. Most of the best tasting drinks come with a souvenir cup.   We ordered a bucket of shrimp, half Cajun half garlic & butter, they dumped it out on a giant platter so you can grub away. Be careful though it can get messy. We also ordered lobster stuffed shrimp on top of jasmine rice. It was very oily but when something is smothered in butter what can you expect. It mixed well with the rice. Couldn't finish everything so we took a to go box and our souvenir cups all for $75. A bit expensive but i'm sure it would have been cheaper without the cups. Overall great service, food and great time."}
{"text":"So let me just start off by saying that we love Bubba Gumps. We've gone to different locations and have had great experiences every time...except for this one. The restaurant wasn't very crowded. There was no wait, but we got seated in the very back room all by ourselves. Felt a little out of place and ignored. That was strike one.   Strike two was when we ordered. I wanted a dish that came with tilapia and just wanted a different fish like salmon or mahi mahi. Most places would say \"sure no problem\" but our waitress said \"nope. We can't do that.\" Imagine my shock when a restaurant can't do a simple switch like that. It took several tries of me asking her to please go double check with the chef before she finally went to ask. She came back and what do you know...\"oh okay we can switch that for you\". It's just very irritating when a restaurant makes it seem like a hassle to do something simple for a paying customer.   After that whole incident I had asked for a comment card...and guess what. They don't have any. Of course they don't have any. So that's why I'm writing this here.  All in all food wasn't anything special and service sucked. Our food was cold when it came out and they just dropped it off without a word. There are so many options on the strip and you can find something a lot better! Needless to say I will not be returning or recommending this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the gumbo and the spinach dip. Unfortunately, the drinks were pretty weak. The server was nice, but be sure to check your receipt-they charge for souvenir glasses."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend ate here on the second night of our vacation, and we both had a really good time!  As big Forrest Gump fans we both loved the was the restaurant was decorated, especially for my girlfriend who had never been to a Bubba Gump before.  We both enjoyed our meals, and despite it being the busy dinner time our meals arrived in no time at all.  Portions were plenty, and both of us struggled to fit it all in.  Hardly a bad problem to have.  All in all we both had a very good dining experience; from the food, staff, and atmosphere.  A quick photo at the Forrest Gump bench and the experience is complete!  Highly recommended, whether you like shrimp or not."}
{"text":"While the food was good, the quantity is a pure RIP OFF. Having been to Bubba Gump across the country, the quantity of food is ridiculously small. The manager Denis does not know the meaning of Customer Service. He just kept a stupid smile on his face while saying that it is not his decision...he is the manager."}
{"text":"Typical fried food joint. I knew what I was getting in to before going, but over the years they have gotten really proud of their menu items and I can't really justify the price for what you get. While the fish and shrimp are cooked well, everything tasted the same and didn't have much flavor. The service was excellent hence the bonus star. Too expensive for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Bubba Gumps and I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was and at how great the service was.  Our servers name was Bryant and he was extremely chill and knew the menu pretty well. He made some menu recommendations and provided great conversation. Interacting with him makes me want to go back to Bubba Gumps Las Vegas.  WE NEED MORE SERVERS LIKE HIM!"}
{"text":"My first time ever eating at Bubba Gump and I was impressed. Our Server Eva was fantastic, very friendly and very informative. She was an angel.  I had the fish and chips it was the best fish and chips I have had in a long long time.  Very happy will definitely recommend Bubba Gumps to others."}
{"text":"I stopped in just to have the Gumbo on my way back to Phoenix from Burning Man.  The service was excellent, the bartender made me the BEST strawberry lemonade that I've had the the food was stellar.  I can't wait to go back and eat again."}
{"text":"Awesome drop in spot. We didn't get shrimp like I wanted, but was thirsty. So I got the mango sparkler thing. Sat at the bar. Friend liked the Mama's bread pudding, price for portion was great. $8. My sparkler was sugary deliciousness. Julie and Grande were chill low key fun to talk to. Great Customer service Reppin for the brand. Hopefully we go back for shrimp before my birthday weekend is over."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is casual and laid back. The drinks are awesome. I had the New Orleans shrimp-slight metallic taste Andy rice was a bit dry. Also had the hush puppies--not traditional style hush puppies and slightly undercooked. My boyfriend had the jambalaya-it was great. Had the dessert sampler. None of them were up to par. My main detractor was that they wouldn't seat us until our entire party arrived-even though we were ordering drinks and appetizers. I still give them 3 stars for the atmosphere and drinks. But food left a little to be desired. Oh and the sun was in my eyes the entire time."}
{"text":"I had a great time here.  I took my dad here and it was a lot of fun and the food was excellent too.  The key is to this place, get drunk and eat!"}
{"text":"Good service but the fish and shrimp were a little over cooked. The sauces tasted great though!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Bubba gump locations and always had good time, but this one is really bad. Will never come back again. Rude servers, cold food and dirty everything.."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night while visiting las Vegas and the food and atmosphere were great! Drinks were amazingly tasty and the food was nice and hot! I do want to point out the friendliness of the staff... we were automatically greeted at the door. We were seated within minutes.. our waiter was very friendly..the food came quick.. and I also witnessed a server bringing drinks to a nearby table and a red slushy drink spilled and got on the customers white shirt. And it all happened in front of what I assumed was a manager. That manager did not hesitate to walk that customer to the gift shop and get him a free t-shirt...i thought that was pretty amazing!! 2 thumbs up Bubba Gumps"}
{"text":"Roach showed up on the booth I was sitting at right before our meal showed up. It was literally next to my shoulder. The Waitress saw it exactly at the same time my husband pointed it out and she killed it with a napkin. Manager offered the free meal but we just couldn't get ourselves to stay to eat after experiencing that. They also gave my husband a free glass that came with the beer he ordered.. So that was nice of them."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Basically everything is fried or basted in butter so how can you go wrong. The hush puppies were amazing and the stuffed shrimp was good. The decor is adorable and I loved that the staff came around to quiz us on our Forrest Gump knowledge. We did alright lol it was a fun time overall!"}
{"text":"The food was nasty. The shrimp was over cooked and cold! The bread was hard. I ask for no tomatoes they brought tomatoes! The person next to us had to return everything they ordered also! Would not recommend this location! On top of all that they didn't even try to make anything right!!"}
{"text":"We have been to several other bubba gump's in the past and found the food and service to be great. The las vegas one on the other hand not so much. Our server was okay but the food wasn't that great. I had the (i think it was called) the seafood feast. Twenty two dollars for 4 small shrimp 4 hush puppys and supposedly fish sticks. Which where some deep fried breading with a sliver of fish inside. Would have been better off at fast food"}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience at this place.  Prices are expected for strip... not extremely high.   First of all, I am the Front Office Manager of a major hotel.  I know service.  Our server was pretty good although our water stayed empty once we consumed.  Our issue was that someone from the kitchen delivered our two appetizers to the wrong table.  40 minutes later we asked where they were and they put this information together.   The manager came over and apologized for the delay and said he would personally bring them out when they were ready.  Not sure what that was supposed to do for us but he didn't personally bring them out anyway.   We decided not to order entrees after that debacle.  Our total bill was $74 (had 3 drinks, no biggie).  Asked manager to comp part of the bill for having to wait so long.  He told me, \"I really can't do much for you, maybe a buck or two.\"  A buck or two?   Good service, bud.  Why would I go back to Bubba Gump?"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Employees cared a lot about you manager always check on how things were going very very good food!!! :) happy"}
{"text":"Horrible.  Walked in. Greeter dropped menu and said 'here you go' coldly. Then we sat at the table for more than 15 minutes without even a drink order or a hello. 11:15am visit and it was dead there - probably 5 patrons. 6 workers were hanging out at the hostess stand when we walked out, enjoying themselves.  No one even noticed we were slowly walking out."}
{"text":"We went there with a party of 7 on our recent Vegas trip and were seated right away (it was a weekday). The service was really good. Our waiter played fun trivia games with us and the overall atmosphere for my \"Forrest Gump\" loving family was fantastic. We loved all of the little details that made the restaurant so nostalgic to the movie, including the \"run forrest run\"/\"stop forrest stop\" license plates on the table to use to get the waiter's attention. Perhaps it is a tourist attraction but overall we loved the place, loved the food, and enjoyed the service."}
{"text":"Worst food ever! We ordered calamari (breading was at the bottom of the basket) and there were more fried peppers than calamari... Then my boyfriend ordered coconut shrip and that had to many layers of coconut to where he could not enjoy the  shrimp... I ordered the something new orleans and the sauce was terrible.... we walked out hungry."}
{"text":"The service was great!  The food was very good and the drinks were delicious. The drinks are a little pricey but you get to keep the collectors glass when you are done. If it's a plastic glass they wash it and give it back to you. If it's a glass glass then you get a brand new one from the gift shop when you leave. The seafood hush puppies are amazing. We Weill return!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on August 11, 2014 for dinner with my family. I've been to their location in San Francisco, so it isn't like I'm new to the place.  Pros of the night: -Our waiter (I believe is name was Andrew?) was very enthusiastic, when he came by and didn't seem like many other waters who literally look like they hate their job. -The food was very good.  Cons of the night: -The garlic bread was said to be out ASAP, but it came literally 3 minutes before our entrees came out. Mind you we had already been waiting for about 20 minutes. -I did not know that at this location you had to pay for drink refills. My first cup strawberry lemonade had an average amount of ice in it, so I was not complaining, but my second cup but literally a whole cup of ice. Why I had to pay $.99 for that, I don't know. -The sign \"Stop, Forrest, Stop\" is supposed to bring a waiter over quickly, but my sign was out for about 5 minutes before a waiter came, even though we were right next to their payment machine."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars!!  This place sucks... I've eaten in the Orlando and New Orleans restaurants and loved it! This place sucked, bad food , worse service and the inability to bus a table and let us sit in the location we wanted to sit! Don't waste your time in this location!"}
{"text":"Went to Bubba Gump on a Saturday night. It wasn't as busy as I had expected it to be. We used to always go to the one in Hawaii and I was craving their Hush Puppies (which btw is to die for). I've always loved Bubba Gump. It's cool how this entire restaurant is based off of the movie Forest Gump.   Anyways, the food selection didn't seem like there was as much as the menu in Hawaii. We mainly came for the Seafood Harvest but unfortunately it wasn't on their menu.   We ordered the Calamari for appetizers, Run Across America Sampler (as a meal), and the Trio for our entree. All three tasted pretty good and were up to our expectations on taste.   The service was mediocre. Nothing exceptional but not bad either. Our waitress was nice for the most part. There were a few times that it was hard for us to get her attention, let alone any otter waiter/waitresses attention, but we'll give them a pass since there were 3 birthdays while we were dining there.   Overall, I'd go back again. I wouldn't NOT recommend this place because it definitely hits the spot if you're looking for seafood on the strip with a very minimal to no waiting line."}
{"text":"Can I say delicious?? I love bubba gumps got to treat my fiancé out last night. I'm the beginning the service was a tad bit slow. But we had a certain waiter that would talk with us and ask trivia questions about the movie. Kinda pricey but still worth it"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was excellent! Jessica is an awesome server and Jenny's Catch was superb! The crab legs were seasoned to perfection I was well pleased with my experience !"}
{"text":"Messed up our appetizer, messed up my husband's meal then they got my meal wrong too. We are easy to please folks who just wanted some lunch. After waiting 2 hours, we left w a bag of to-go food as we couldn't wait any longer. $50 for 2 lunch entrees (we had an appetizer coupon). The manager was trying to calm down the table of 9 next to us who had gotten their orders screwed up too. I'd pick somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Good food! I was visiting Las Vegas with my husband. We went to the place for shrimp. I barely eat shrimp outside, because normally the restaurants don't peel the shrimp shit out......I know the shit is a line on the shrimp back.....when I order their shrimp,surprised me, they cleaned them so well. I was happy about this point! The food is really tasty, the service was good! I would like to recommend this place to my friend;)"}
{"text":"Had a very nice time. Food was terrific. I sat on the belcony...great idea..great location....our server Erin was allot of fun and was very attentive. Defiantly would come again!!!"}
{"text":"I was some what hesitant about eating here after reading the reviews but I am glad I went. The service was good. The server was patient and answered all my questions. The wait wasn't long and I was able to sit on the patio with the wifey. The food was good and I don't have any real complaints. We didn't wait long for our food and everything was hot. I don't understand all the bad reviews. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here after a friend in our party raved about a few things on the menu. And honestly, for what it is, Bubba Gump Shrimp is a pretty awesome place.  Started with the Hush Puppies, which were amazing (and came with a terrific dip); then did the Po Boy with Shrimp. Definitely not bad - the bread was a bit tough and the Mayo didn't quite stand-up to the other ingredients, but overall was still pretty good.  Also had a few Margaritas in the process.  Great service, clean environment, and awesome patio."}
{"text":"Today I have to give it 2 stars due to our rude waitress. When we first got there our menus were just dropped off at the table and told our waitress would be with us. Once the waitress arrived she attempted to rush us on our drink order we stated we were not ready she walked away came back asking are you ready now? Drinks were ordered and appetizers too I ordered a dip and my friend did too. Drinks come and appetizers too by a different server who brings us out two of the same appetizers. So we stated that we didn't order two of the same things. She states that ok no problem and then our waitress comes up to us and says rudely \"Didn't you order the dip that you sent back\" We attempted to tell her that we didn't want two of the same appetizers and she walked off with a attitude and service went down from there. We had to ask for togo boxes and the check from someone else due to the fact we couldn't find her again. Once the the check came she split the tab which was not asked if we wanted it that way. So now we had to wait for another receipt to be printed before leaving. I love this place but today was not the best."}
{"text":"I'm a local in Las Vegas and I went here after spending the day with my friend who came down for the Labor Day weekend and I always wanted to try the place. I love seafood and when I worked at Marshalls just a few blocks away one of my customers said to try the place if you want good seafood. The prices are great for the average seafood place. It's very lively there was two birthdays when we went which was a cute birthday song.  The service was good aside from when the waiter came over to do Forest Gump trivia he kept staring at him while my friend was with me at the table. It was a little unnerving to have him staring at me like that.  The food was okay but wasn't the greatest. I ordered the ship wreck platter and the crab was sweet as crab usually is, the breaded shrimp was delicious, the fries were great except for the misleading bucket it all came in, and sadly the battered fish was a let down as I love battered shrimp it lacked seasoning to it. The side coleslaw and the butter, didn't bring out the taste of the crab, wasn't that great either. My friend ordered their trio appetizer plate and she said it was good but the fish was overcooked for her liking.   The alcohol was very overpriced too but what do you expect from a restaurant on the strip except it cost a meal to have one."}
{"text":"My momma always said, \"Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.\"  Well, no... actually Forrest Gump said that. MY momma always said, \"For God's sake, Ryan, why can't you put down that Nintendo controller and play outside with the rest of the NORMAL kids? And what the hell are you wearing all that TINFOIL on your head for?\"  No, Forrest Gump was the one who talked about chocolates, and Bubba always talked about shrimp, hence, we now have the chain of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. restaurants. They're all over in touristy spots, and the Seestur raves about the one in Anaheim in Gardenwalk. She even sports the sweatshirt proudly. This from a girl who would practically retch if she even got near seafood.  So boy, howdy, was I excited to see that there was going to be a Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. on the Las Vegas Strip. So excited, that I didn't even care it was located mere steps from the horrifying (to me) Goretorium. I was going to brave the danger and go to Bubba Gump, and if one of the evil scary monsters from Goretorium and/or one of the sleazy porno-card giver-outers on the corner of Harmon and the Strip came after me, well, by God I would buy fresh boxers from the Bubba Gump store.  If life is like a box of chocolates, I should have tried poking the bottom of the candies before coming here. I got stuck with that one everyone else dodges. You know, the one with the pink cream-ish center that's supposedly cherry or raspberry but tastes more like Pepto Bismol.  Las Vegans hardly need a reason to celebrate but we find them anyway, and as I had just been unceremoniously and hurriedly booted out the door by my former employer, ironically who stood across the street from Harmon Corner and rhymed with \"Bosmopolitan,\" I decided to have a little \"New Beginnings/I Got Fired\" dinner at Bubba Gump's.  Figuring I was the last one there (as I usually am) and not wanting a demon to jump out of the Goretorium and eat my soul, I asked one of the store clerks, \"So... I'm in the store... but where's the restaurant?\" She smiled and directed me up the stairs toward the back of the store. A sign or something would have been nice.  I headed up the stairs, where I was actually first, gathered the party, and we were seated. They explained the license plates on the table that say \"Run, Forrest, Run!\" and \"Stop, Forrest, Stop!\" which I thought was a cute touch.  The crew was stellar. Our main waitress was super bubbly and thrilled when she heard we were all locals (like, apparently they had not been frequenting the place... what a shock no locals on the Strip). She was very attentive to our needs, to the point where we never really needed our \"Run/Stop\" plates on our table. She even regaled us with ghost stories in nearby mining towns. So despite whatever else I say in this review, the staff was great and should be commended.  And with that being said... well...   We started with a round of drinks. Since it was my firing party, I was ready for something nice and strong, so I went with Bubba's Blue Hawaiian: vodka, rum, gin, Blue Curacao, pineapple juice and Sierra Mist, yes, please, come to DADDY! The menu says $8.99, but don't be fooled! That doesn't include your collectible Bubba Gump glass, so you're more looking at $13. You have to specifically ask to NOT get the collectible glass, whereas I think it should be the other way around. But the drink was pretty good. Not quite an AMF, so it won't belt you on your ass, but not a totally tame drink either.  Dinner came around, and I have to say I was gravely disappointed with my dinner.  I got the Shrimper's Heaven, which along with french fries came with Fried Shrimp, \"Chilly Shrimp,\" Coconut Shrimp, and Shrimp Tempura, along with three sauces: Asian, cocktail, and a Cajun sauce that reminded me more of orange marmalade.  I started with the \"Chilly Shrimp,\" which I thought was just going to be cold shrimp like you might find in a shrimp cocktail. No, in fact, that is wrong. \"Chilly Shrimp\" is Bubba Gump's version of \"Peel-n-Eat Shrimp,\" which means the shrimp is cooked inside its shell. Yes, shrimp have shells, and shrimp have legs, which took that portion of the dinner from \"tasty seafood morsel\" to \"creature that used to be alive, probably leaving behind a family he supported and a shrimp company job that will have to do some PR work to explain his disappearance and he was probably named Charles.\" I can't eat things that could probably be named Charles. So there's a quarter of the dinner shot down.  The rest was tolerable. The coconut shrimp and fried shrimp were kind of dry, but the shrimp tempura was fine.  What wasn't fine was the bill: for JUST that and the drink, after gratuity I was paying $55 BY MYSELF. People, I just got fired! Just because I was paid out my vacation pay doesn't mean I need to be spending it all on dinner! I'll stick with Lazy Joe's for some good, affordable shrimp from now on.  I guess stupid really is as stupid does."}
{"text":"Ate at Bubba Gumps last night on the Strip.  Food was good enough but wait staff lacked enthusiasm and the elements of fun that I have experienced at other Bubba Gumps throughout the country.  I would try a different restaurant next time."}
{"text":"Clima familiar, boa decoracao com o tema do filme Forrest Gum, sempre uma excelente opção!! Não deixe de pedir o drink Coronita, maravilhoso! Os patros são frutos do mar e todos com camarões, vale muito a visita, além da loja no exterior para os aficionados em compras!"}
{"text":"I wanted seafood so my bf who does not like seafood decides on this place.  I went in with an open mind but was sorely disappointed.  We ordered the app sampler and two other shrimp entrees.  The problem with all of the food was the shrimp seemed old or about to go bad.   The service was great no wait.  We walked through the door downstairs and as soon as the elevator door opened we were greeted by hostess with our table.  I still would not go again."}
{"text":"I wish I could review the food but since we could not get anyone to wait on us ( not even water ) I cannot. I will say that when I told the hostess others had been visited by their wait staff two and three times since we were seated she was unable to get anyone to take our table. I think we were in the middle the wait staff squabble and we were the recipients. Can we give a restaurant a negative number?"}
{"text":"Yay i'm a fan is true. We were delighted to try this place was little taken back by the name didn't think the food would be great but it was. I am glad I loss the coin toss and ended up here."}
{"text":"Great view overlooking the strip way overpriced got two non alcoholic drinks a shrimp cocktail and a side Caesar salad and the bill was $37"}
{"text":"We had no problem with the food or the service, the drink menu made it difficult for the server, I just wanted a draft beer, but there were no prices on the menu, the beer menu had the prices with the souvenir glass included with the beer, when I asked about the price without the take home souvenir, I was told if you want the 16 oz, take off $6.00, if you want the bigger beer take off $4.00 from the listed prices, why not make it easier and just have those prices on the menu. And a message to our server, it is not necessary to crouch down when taking our order, I worked in the industry and I am not a fan of that practice, you were not 7ft tall and we were not little people, just saying"}
{"text":"The badest Bubba restaurant I were.  Dry and tasteless fish and shrimp were which too much lemon. The garlic bread was not crunchy. It was just soft."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try Bubba Gump for the last 4 years but just haven't. My husband and I finally did last night. It was great. We had the Forrest feast which is fried shrimp, fish, fries and hushpuppies. The hushpuppies were a little meh but everything else was pretty good. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. We had a coupon for free appetizer and that's the only reason we went. We didn't have a choice of what appetizer we wanted and had to get the spinach dip which was the worst spinach dip I've ever had. My husband had the seafood feast and I had the shrimper's heaven. We spent about  $40 which was way too much considering the quality of the food and subpar service  The portions were decent but I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Super disappointed and annoyed with Bubba's!!!! First off, I had to send 2 drinks back because the soft drink was just nasty, and my mixed drink was watered down and had no taste at all!! I ordered Bubba's After The Storm \"bucket Of Boat Trash\", and let me tell you, I should have put it in the trash because it was garbage!!! Why were there 2 COLD snow crab legs sitting on top of my hot shrimp, fish, and fries!?!?! The taste was not good! I'll be honest, I ate maybe half of it because we ended up paying almost $100 (including the tip) for 2 meals, 2 beers, and a soft drink!  I don't mind paying for some good food, but this... NOT!! Where are the annoyed emojis when you need them?! Ugghhh!! Oh, I had a Caesar salad too, it was OK. I can't even remember what my husband ordered... a bucket with steamed shrimp, corn, potatoes, and other veggies, but he said it was tasteless! Also a side of coconut shrimp, that was actually pretty good. The ONLY reason I gave this place 3 stars is because the of that shrimp and staff was very friendly and our waitress was awesome..thanks guys! Sadly, I left this place and still hours later pissed about the money we paid for what we got! UGGGGHH!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this 1 star is because the guy by the elevator was very friendly but we were there for 15 min before we walked out. No one helped us at all. People that sat down after us were helped before we walked out. Sucks because it was a place we were looking forward to eat at but because of this, we don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty typical fried American food. It was exactly what we needed: filling and delicious. The service was a tad slow, and it didn't seem like there were a lot of people dining, but we weren't moving very quickly after a crazy Friday night out. My po'boy wasn't the most memorable of the foods I ate while in Vegas, but it was tasty and I was sad that I couldn't finish it all. One of my companions got a recovery burger and fries and she basically moaned the whole time, so I think it worked. My other companion got a shrimp and rice dish and I think she probably won best dish on the table.   It was a nice experience going to such a touristy-chain and just enjoying ourselves. But, if I could rate the view, this would be a solid 5. It was so awesome to be looking over the city and getting some fresh air fairly early in the day before the blistering heat took over. I'd probably come back here just for that."}
{"text":"It's a little hidden, so people seem to not notice it as well, so there was absolutely NO WAIT! It's a little bit of a hike up the many stairs, or you could use the elevator if you need (or are lazy). Service was quick, our glasses were never empty, and the food was fast and delicious. Our experience couldn't have been better."}
{"text":"I've tried and tried but I just don't know when I am going to learn my lesson to just stay away from chain seafood restaurants. Bubba Gumps is great for Forrest Gump memorabilia but not so great for the food.   The portions are small and very overpriced. I have been to numerous Bubba Gumps and they are all the same. No happy hour specials, no food specials, just an overall average dining experience.   I would not recommend Bubba Gumps if you are looking for good seafood, I would recommend it if you are looking to purchase Forrest Gump memorabilia.   I really really wanted to like this place which is why I have given it so many chances. But afyer going back 3 or 4 times it is safe to say three stars is being nice!   My recommendation is to find a real seafood place by the actual sea!"}
{"text":"Good food but horrible service! They aren't attentive at all, once we sat waited 20 min and we had to ask for a waiter to get our drinks. For refills we also had to ask different servers that were passing by because our server wasn't really around, it seemed like they kept getting upset about us asking to be helped...."}
{"text":"I had the stuffed shrimp and my mom had the New Orleans shrimp. Our meal was fabulous with a great view of the strip outside. Got the Raspberry smoothie and it was delightful! Great meal and service!"}
{"text":"Definitely 10 starz! Who hoo! Always satisfied with the food and the servyis excellent!"}
{"text":"OMG....THE worst ever. I came here because we went once  to the one inMaui Hawaii , I had the teriyaki burger best ever. Now we live in Las Vegas and I wanted to re-live the Maui experience. ....Well so said No teriyaki burger on menu NO shakes either. So I get the ribs with maui maui shrimp..So big and delicious on menu...actually very small dinner and as I write this I am waiting  for my dinner because ribs were Ice cold...wife had shrimp app just ok, and a root beer float they made special...she had to put my root beer in it cause it taste awfull....and son had pizza he's happy.....still no meal for me....wait..wait...wait..."}
{"text":"I happened to find this place on its opening night in Vegas. The staff are exceptionally friendly, from the host at the front door to the bartender and other waitstaff. Felt right at home for this Mississippi-born girl. I ordered a bowl of the gumbo and was greeted by a wide bowl with two perfect mounds of rice surrounded by delicious sausage and shrimp gumbo. Spicy, but not too much for me. I also had a Delta Sunset margarita, which has a bit of a raspberry taste. Tasty! The drink is mixed right in front of you if you sit at the bar. There's great decor from old license plates, film stills from the movie Forrest Gump, and other reminders of Southern culture. Also, a gift shop on the lower level with elevator access to the restaurant for those who cannot walk up the stairs. Smiles all around!"}
{"text":"Summary: Every time we visit Vegas we always walk by Bubba Gump but never stop in so for this trip my SO decided to drag me in. I like the setting, kind of remind me of Boiling Crab (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-boiling-crab-garden-grove-2?osq=boiling+crab+restaurant) minus the sharpies on the wall.  Food: Base on yelp review, we decide to try their Hush Puppies first to see how it is before heading in to the main course. Luckily that is all we tried. The hush puppies was bland and very oily.   Service: 5 STARS for the staff members, from entrance to exit, the whole staff was cheerful and friendly.  Overall: We should have kept walking. We should have stick to, \"hmm maybe one day we should try this place\" and just never try it so it could stay mysterious. But we tried it. We didn't like it. End of story."}
{"text":"Ate at this location for the second time last night. This time we sat on the patio overlooking the Strip and City Center. Terrific view, perfect weather. Our server, Bobby?, was very friendly, attentive and helpful as well as being very knowledgeable with the menu. My wife wanted to upgrade part of her entree to crab legs and Bobby didn't know what the upcharge would be so he checked with the manager. In a few minutes the manager, Bud, came personally to let us know that the upcharge for that would bring the dish to almost $40 and asked if we she still wanted to upgrade it.  We thought it was very thoughtful and considerate of him to come over and let us know personally."}
{"text":"Came in and were immediately seated. Our food and drinks were awesome. We had the best server ever. She was bubbly and just plain awesome!!!  Love the decor and gift shop at the bottom."}
{"text":"Stopped here while on the strip because they had seating outside with a view of the strip! The view was nice. The food was delicious and very prompt! What made our visit even better was that our server Charles was awesome and attentive as well as friendly!! Overall we'll probably come back."}
{"text":"The food is bland, overpriced, and bad service (although our server was sweet) everyone else was rude. I ordered a chicken caesar salad, my husband ordered the shrimp scampi. I didn't taste his food after he said it tasted like the smell of Raid. The chicken in my salad was so bland I had to pour a bunch of salt in it. Not to mention it took them forever to bring out our food."}
{"text":"One of the best Movie themed restaurants I have ever visited.. The whole place is warm and welcoming.. The waitresses and staff are attentive and friendly.. We went for a quick lunch and the order was quick too! We ordered Cajun shrimp and Jambalaya.. Two awesomely awesome dishes! I would live to visit again! Kudos!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this restaurant. The hostess gave us a warm welcome and we were seated almost immediately. We were seated outside at first for the view of the strip. However, it was a little too humid so we asked to move inside and was moved immediately.   The server was very friendly and attentive, she came to our table in less than two minutes after we sat. She gave us time to place our orders and was very thorough in Describing what to expect from the dishes.   Our food was served in a timely manner, however in between our food being served the waitress made sure we were comfortable. Our food was exactly as she described. I ordered the shrimp and chicken jambalaya, it was awesome! If you like spicy food I definitely recommend. My mom ordered a shrimp dish that she enjoyed. However my sister ordered the lobster salad; the lobster was overcooked. The manager immediately took it off the bill when he learned that she was not satisfied with her food.  Overall I had a great experience here. Nice family restaurant while in Vegas, I never fail to be amazed by the Forrest Gump memorabilia!"}
{"text":"Over priced and food was average.  I ordered the special which had broiled tilapia, grilled shrimp (Cajun), and shrimpy mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was ok but they could have kept the bread crumbs.  My daughter got the crab legs which was probably the best meal at the table.  My mom and friend got the fried shrimp and fish and they said it was just ok.  Well the bright side is that I can now say we tried it.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Best hush puppies I've ever had. High price for the food but the atmosphere is fun and the entire staff was very friendly. Had a large group 10+ and they got us in less that 10 min on a Friday afternoon.  Like that they treated the kids like a fun addition to the group rather than ignoring them and only speaking to the adults."}
{"text":"I will never come here again. Six people at dinner and not ONE person liked their food!!! Save your money and go someplace different!"}
{"text":"I love seafood but I'm usually not a fan of chained restaurants.  This place was good. I had the shrimp scampi.  It was a big portion so I saved some for breakfast.  We also had some type of soup with shrimp, very delicious also."}
{"text":"Came here after getting in late on a delayed flight. Talk about somebody being hungry. My friend wanted seafood and Bubba Gump Shrimp takes their last guest at 10 pm. So it was late when we went around 8:30-ish pm. Patrick our server was very nice and informative. I ordered the gumbo which was very good but has a nice spicy kick to it. Next, I ordered the coconut shrimp meal. Shrimp was very good, but honestly, I was full off the gumbo. So most of the shrimp back to the room with me. The leftover shrimp made for a good breakfast the next day."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on a wimp and ordered based on the pictures. The strawberry chicken pecan salad was extremely delicious and I'm not a vegetable type of person. Server was very kind and helpful as well. Definitely a must go if you're on the strip!"}
{"text":"Well, it's worth a try considering it's Bubba Gumps.    The service was quick and friendly.  Sometimes too friendly.  We were quite hungry and quiet at our table so the nice waitress decided to come over and distract us by doing a Bubba Gump movie trivia.  Nice, but weird and could have done without.  We are anti-social.. LOL  Now, the place and the food.  If you have ever been to the Joe's Crab Shack chain, this place looks and feels exactly like it without all the crab options.  Ordered the shrimp New Orleans which was okay but nothing special.  The hubs garlic shrimp were tasty, kinda small in my opinion.  Overall, the experience was decent however I would not go out of my way to try it again.    The End"}
{"text":"Went during lunch so it wasn't crowded at all. The food was fresh but the service was slow and terrible."}
{"text":"I love SHRIMP! ok... I love food in general.   Food was great! But trying to get service here, was like trying to find the right pair of pants (nearly impossible or quick).   Our table literally asked for a sharp knife to TWO servers. Let's just say, by the time we got the knife, we didn't need it. (I hope you stub your toe servers!)"}
{"text":"Thank you for giving me and my wife a nice time out in town. I have nothing bad to say. The food was good and sitting on the balcony watching people get crazy in Las Vegas was awesome. Thank you."}
{"text":"Came here last week for dinner. Came in through downstairs where we were greeted and the staff radioed upstairs to expect us. Was seated promptly and given instructions about the Forrest Gump licence plate signs for service. Cool touch I must add. More restaurants should implement something similar imho.  Flipped the sign to Stop Forrest Stop when ready to order and a server was with us within a minute. Ordered the Shrimper's Net Catch with half garlic and half Cajun. I personally preferred the garlic. I thought the Cajun was too saucy, but thankfully it wasn't too spicy.   Also had Forrest's Surf and Turf as my main. It comes with a 9oz tenderloin, shrimp, mashed potatoes, and onions. It was food a plenty for me. The shrimps were my favourite in this meal. The meal wasn't 5 star spectacular, but it was a solid 4 in terms of taste and value.  Service is definitely top notch here with a casual atmosphere. Servers are prompt and kept us up to date with the orders. To top it off, depending on what beverage you order, you can also take home a glass or shaker! Overall the food was 4 out of 5, but the service definitely bumps it up for the extra star! Definitely recommended if you want a decent meal in a casual setting with great service!"}
{"text":"Ok this review is based on dining by the bar and on one meal.  One meal we have each year and have tried at most Gump Restaurants in the US: the netcatch with Cajun and garlic.  There is only one way to have that dish- with garlic bread on the side. Peel em and layer them carefully on the bread.  Then dig in. It is the only way as I said and it is the Monica and Jonni way!   The waiter we had saw us doing this last year,  and he has adopted our style too! We met him this year too.   And those shrimps taste wonderfully. My favorite is garlic but always need a tasting of both.  So- two netcatch and garlic bread alla Monica and Jonni,  please!"}
{"text":"Had this restaurant bookmarked for some time now so we finally tried it for dinner last night.  Location - great view, but horrible to get to.  It is quite a far walk no matter where you are coming from.  You can either park in the garage in Miracle Mile shops, park across the street at Harley Davidson cafe (for a small price), or park at the Cosmopolitan and walk across the bridge.  The views, if you are sitting outdoors, is awesome!  The location is overlooking right in the middle of Harmon and LV blvd. which has the views of City Center and The Cosmopolitan.  Restaurant - Forrest Gump themed.  If you are a fan of the movie, you will appreciate the memorabilia all over the walls.  First floor is the retail area, Second floor is the actual restaurant.  Food - Overly priced small portions type of meals (what one should expect of a strip restaurant).  My boyfriend ordered 2 of what our server recommended which was the Georgia Sweet Tea (alcoholic drink) and the Shrimp New Orleans.  I ordered Lt. Dan's Drunken Shrimp.  I loved the sweet tea drink (again, it was a steep price for a small drink).  I didn't care for the sauce on the Shrimp New Orleans dish (even though the server raved about it).  All that matters is my boyfriend liked it.  The Lt. Dan's Drunken Shrimp dish was nothing out of the ordinary.  It was shrimp, sausage, mashed potatoes which shoestring chips on top.  I probably could have made this myself if I made the effort to.  Staff - friendly and attentive, but then again the restaurant wasn't that busy yet.  We did get a free glass at the end of our meal.  I didn't really catch the reason why, but I think it's because of the drink we ordered.  Honestly, I don't know if I can recommend this place mainly because of the price.  But if you are like me who has to try it just to say you tried it, live the experience..!"}
{"text":"Every time we are in Vegas we make a stop here for lunch. We always get the shrimp New Orleans. This time we also had the calamari and some drinks.   The shrimp New Orleans has this sauce that is out of bounds. It comes with a crazy amount of shrimp and is with every penny.   Service is great here. They have these signs you flip when you need service so it speeds up your experience and gets you back out quickly to enjoy Vegas/ or your travels."}
{"text":"Alabama Steam Pot - this is unbelievably delicious and fresh, thanks. And the spot is of course really good and fun both for adult companies and families. Will return for sure. And of course: Patrick - good job man, decent service."}
{"text":"This restaurant was awesome! The host gave us a seat right away. Our waiter Colin was very talkative and informative about the menu. He got us our drinks and appetizers very fast. I got the strawberry frozen lemonade and it tasted great especially knowing I could keep the light up cup! I also ordered the shrimp scampi and it was delicious.    This was a great place to come with the family. It was very quiet compared to other restaurants on the strip. Overalls great food, friendly waiters and great atmosphere!  Definitely recommend coming here with your family!"}
{"text":"We were nearby and decided to try out Bubba Gump's for dinner.    The dining area is located one level up from the entrance filled with memorabilia and gift items.  We were luckily seated in Chad's section for our meal.   He definitely provided great service throughout the evening.  He was fun and very friendly.    We started off with the Seafood hush pups that are filled with shrimp and fish.  Since we love hush puppies, this was right up our alley.   Very good with the remoulade dipping sauce.  For my entree I chose Jenny's catch.  This was seared tilapia over mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach covered with a lobster butter sauce.   Sounds good right? But it really lacked flavor.  The sauce was very mediocre.      I tried my husbands meal which was Lt. Dan's Drunken Shrimp.  This was lots of shrimp mixed in with andouille sausage in a bourbon sauce.  This was fantastic.  Spicy and so delicious!  If it wasn't for Chad, this would probably be rated 3 stars.  But I was so impressed with the service and most of our food, I had to go with 4.  If you are in the area...  try it out!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Wow what an experience for a shrimp shack.  The food was awesome and fresh, had the shrimp spectacular and it was.  The waiter was super friendly and had a great personality made you feel welcome.    Really like the idea of flipping sign to show you are ready for stop or go.  Really good cocktails and you get a fee glass with purchase, it is a new one from the store:)   Atmosphere and noise level were perfect lots and lots if Forrest Gump memorabilia on the was and slogans.    Recommend to everyone who loves shrimp."}
{"text":"I've been to this particular restaurant before, and enjoyed it. This time was no exception. The hosting staff quickly and easily sat us at a wheelchair accessible table.  Our server, Rafi, was an absolute delight and fun. She and her team were attentive without being obtrusive, and her playful banter just added to a very enjoyable late lunch.   We look forward to coming again soon."}
{"text":"Went here once with the family. The food is really good and we love the atmosphere. It can be busy sometimes. Also the waiters are really cool. They even quiz you questions from the movie which is really neat. It was a hard place to find though we got lost and had to ask people how to get there. Also the meals aren't cheap. My meal and my wifes meal were $20 each. Not bad but not a place we'd go to more than once a year."}
{"text":"We had a party of 33, so I called ahead of time. The person I spoke to on the phone didn't seemed too thrilled about a large party coming in. I was a little worried about that because we have been to restaurants where service was horrible because of large parties. However when we got there, everyone was really friendly. Our waiter we got on our end of the table provided excellent customer service. The lady I had spoke to on the phone stated that everyone on the same bill must sit together. Our waiter allowed for our kids to move around and said he will work with whatever we decide to do. He went above and beyond! The food was excellent as well! We enjoyed this location the best (we've been to three locations in California)"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner as the sun was setting. We sat outside against the rail and had a pretty decent view of the strip as the lights were just starting to come on. I got the delicious shrimp heaven dish and I must of gotten and 30 shrimp (coconut, fried, tempura battered, shrimp cocktail, and fries)  I especially loved the coconut shrimp. We ordered the lava flow drinks in fun light up glasses which made for some fun pictures. Very good drinks, but way overpriced. The waitress even asked us some Forest Gump Trivia which just added to the experience. It's right next to the balcony of the goretorium bar and we saw some zombies taking a smoke break! Great time!"}
{"text":"I love EVERYTHING in this RESTRO esp the bread pudding .. I love to sit outside looking through out the Strip .. KIds Love this place as well ... Everything in the menu is awesome with good price"}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????????????????? Bubba Gump???????????????? ??????????????????????? ??????????? ??????????????????????? ???????????????USJ?????????"}
{"text":"This place is funny. Went here with some friends for the first time, and let me tell you, the stop and go signs on each table is fun to use. We were seated in like 2 minutes during lunch time. They were a little under staffed that day so we had like 3-4 waiters. No biggy. Pricing was reasonable. We ordered our food with no problem and it arrived in a average time period. Everybody was satisfied with the tasty food. It's a little above average seafood. I say this because clearly I've been to a few top seafood restaurants where the seafood is absolutely and freshly define. But I'll come here before I go to Red Lobster."}
{"text":"First time here. Loved it! Kids had fun and loved their food. Courtney was AMAZING.. she was great with the kids and made sure our table with 5 kids had everything we needed.  Adults had a great time and loved their food too."}
{"text":"I just have to say that I have been a big Bubba Gump Shrimp Co fan since the restaurant first started in Monterey, CA.  I have been to locations all over the country, including Hawaii and I have only had one tiny food complaint once in all of those visits  I am so glad they finally have a Las Vegas, NV location and right on the strip is perfect!  I wrote Bubba Gump on their corporate website once a year for five + years begging them to come to Las Vegas....right after they do, I move away LOL!  I guess I better get letter writing again to get them to come to the North West ;)  I just LOVE LOVE everything about the restaurant!!  The food is always great!  The only problem I had this time is that I ordered too much food!!  I will be back over and over!!!!"}
{"text":"We had the best experience at Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.  Greeted by a smiling hostess and seated immediately.  Try the BBQ shrimp with potatoes and veggies.  The pop corn shrimp has jalapenos it without the seeds.  Well...there was a few seeds, which is fine by me!  Everything was beyond my expectations.  The shrimp has just enough Zest and spice. to make me want to return here, the next time I'm in Vegas!  Just like Bubba said it would be.  Plus the price is RIGHT!"}
{"text":"Fun place - fun vibe. Lots of memorabilia to notice! Also the service was friendly and a thumbs up.   I really wanted good shrimp out of this place but sadly the food was so-so."}
{"text":"Great location in the strip. Very nice food and drink menu. Fantastic dinner for both taste and size. They have a patio with a nice strip view. Well worth the wait and beats the heck out of a buffet      Wait staff was friendly, knowledgable  and  attentive. I would go back."}
{"text":"If you like fried seafood and Forrest Gump Trivia then this place is for you. We ordered a seafood platter, which included fried shrimp, fish, fries, calamari and different sauces.  My gf opted to order grilled shrimp entrée. The food was ok, nothing to write home about. The shrimp seemed frozen and the fish had no flavor. The batter used for the fried food was ok. The French fries were bit stale too.   I did score some good points on the Forrest Gump trivia. Overall it's an ok restaurant, given the choices for restaurants on the strip, I'd skip this one."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times for food and beer. The service here has been consistently good, especially for a tourist strip place. The beer selection could be a bit broader but is satisfactory. We have tried several items on the menu, my wife likes the hush puppies, and everything has been good each time, again unusual for the casual dining places on the strip."}
{"text":"I read another review about this place, and went in with some friends. My guy ordered the fish and chips and it was absolutely the bomb. We walked around the strip with this place on the mind. So we came back and order more shrimp, fish and andouille sausage."}
{"text":"It was our first time in Vegas, and we accidentally stumbled over this place. We did not have any idea about its food offering and how it rated with the gastronomic crowd. I'd say it was a pleasant experience for my group. Their clam chowder was good! I also liked their mahi mahi. More than anything else, our waitress named Amanda was simply amazing. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"At one time I really likes it here.  Now it's ok.. Very expensive for what you get.  The service was good and the food hit.  I had a salad and shared the popcorn shrimp with my grandson.   He also had a cup of the clam chowder.  It was very good.   I gave it an extra star for the atmosphere.  On par with Applebee's, Red Robin, etc..  Only way more expensive.  It was also clean."}
{"text":"OK Just We had a very mediocre meal, maybe we expected too much! Staff friendly. Unfortunately would not be returning! June 2016"}
{"text":"Very unique place themed from the Forest Gump movie. It's big and you get a great view of the strip if you sit outside. The food is surprisingly good and the fish and chips are highly recommended."}
{"text":"Every time I travel and there happens to be a Bubba Gump's in that city I make sure to stop in and have my favorite peel n' eat shrimp appetizer.  It was as yummy as I remembered it.  Our server Patrick was so nice and accommodating.  Due to my friend's allergies Patrick was very thoughtful and gave us alternative options.  We really appreciate him going above and beyond.  His service was prompt and seamless.    The manager Patrick also stopped by to check on us.  We always appreciate it when managers show that they care.   I highly recommend this location!  We will surely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this relatively new place on The Strip today after lunch because I had a business meeting nearby. I was shocked at how the interior space is utilized so well on The Strip in this location at the corner of Harmon Avenue. The entire place conveys a fun and engaging theme.   The view of The Strip from the outdoor balcony is sufficiently impressive to warrant your dining or drinking here just for that experience.  I had New Orleans Shrimp and a dark beer I'd never heard of with a marketing nightmare of a name, Moose Drool Brown Ale. Turns out the beer is excellent in spite of the crazy name, and I will order it again.   And oh yes, the New Orleans Shrimp was delicious and, to be honest, this dish exceeded my expectations because of the seasoning and presentation. This place comes across as well conceived and executed with smart management and an excellent staff."}
{"text":"Seafood is pretty fresh.  Food here is just as delicious as the one in the bay area. Drinks are yummy and with enough alcohol.  The thing that I loved the best was that we were able to keep the cool glasses that our drinks came in.  They were replaced by brand new ones of course.  Service was very good as well."}
{"text":"We had two very good meals here.  Yes it is a Landry's chain and as you would expect chain restaurant food but its still good.  We had one rather rude server the first night but everyone else was outstanding.   The bucket of Boat Trash with crab clusters, shrimp and fish with cajun seasoning was amazing..  Nothing tasted fishy.  Service was fast and the food came out hot.  Only other glitch was food runners brought out the food and apparently did not look at the ticket as we had to ask our waiter about my meal but he got it for us right away and it was still hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Fresh salads. Reasonably priced also. The pear berry salad had awesome raspberry dressing and the coconut shrimp are really good."}
{"text":"Came here late night after the McGregor and Diaz fight (3/5/16) with my husband. We were starving and it was our first time being on the Strip in Vegas. We love sea food so we decided to try Bubba Gumps. I ordered the Shrimpers Net Catch getting half Cajun and half garlic spice with a side of fries. I wasn't a fan of the Cajun spice but loved the Garlic spice. My husband and I LOVED the fries. He ordered the Shimp Macaroni and didn't like it. He also order Clam chowder and loved it. The service was awesome. We came back the next day (3/6/16) with our inlaws and kids and had our last meal in Vegas at Bubba Gumps then headed back on the road to SoCal. My daughter at all her pasta, some of my shrimp and everyone loved their food. Service was awesome as well."}
{"text":"If 0 stars would be available that's what I would give. This place had the worst service ever! We arrived late night and the place was empty. Our server took our order and never came back in to check on us. After 45 mins we decided to ask about our meal and they told us it was normal to wait a while. Shortly after our waitress comes to our table and states she doesn't know what happened to our order so she's going to place it again and asks what we're having. She didn't empathize or say she was sorry. We literally stood up. On the way out I saw another employee and asked to speak to their boss and she stated she wasn't sure where the manager was at. Do not recommend this place if you're looking to feel welcomed and appreciated as a customer."}
{"text":"Love it, came here to grab lunch with my boss.  Both got the seafood feast. The fish and chips portion was my favorite along with just the breaded shrimp.  Service is great, the girls that served my boss and I were very sweet and nice.  My only con is that i did not enjoy the fries too much."}
{"text":"After watching Forrest Gump and loving the movie, I had to try bubba gumps shrimping co. When I saw it on the strip I HAD to go there. This place is the bomb! Their shrimp shack pasta is my favorite dish; it has tangy, buttery sauce over a bed of penne, tomatoes, and shrimp. The workers also play Forrest Gump trivia with you. It's quite amusing! If you get all the questions right, you get some sort of prize. When I went to the one in San Francisco, they gave us free parking.  I live in Seattle, I wish I could take this place back home with me. It's a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Tonight's visit was a 10+ our server Jessie L was definitely on it he checked on us so many times during the meal I almost offered him a seat at the table. Waters and drinks were refilled quickly. The food came quick and everything was prepared perfect. Without a doubt one of the best dining experiences I've ever had at Bubba Gump."}
{"text":"If you are craving seafood in Vegas, you will not be disappointed at Bubba Gump Shrimp. Even in the middle of a desert, the atmosphere? makes you feel like you are near a body of water with the typical seafood decorations - hardwood floor, wooden walls, rustic decorations, big windows, and mismatched seats. There are a lot of positive vibes with the friendly? staff and delicious food.   I first had the jambalaya, which had chicken, shrimp, andouille sausage, bell pepper, onions, rice, green onions, tomatoes, and a decently spicy sauce. The jambalaya? was a savory dish, full of flavor and filled with tender meat.   I also had the shrimp scampi, which had shrimp (of course), capers, and linguine (duh). This dish was rich and zesty with the lemon garlic butter that covers it. The shrimp was tender and good in size. It also went very well with the garlic bread that came on the side. You definitely? cannot go wrong with the shrimp scampi here.   Additionally, I like how you can flip a sign indicating whether you need a waiter or you would like to be left alone. The sign worked well in the beginning, but towards the end of my dinner, it did not seem to do any good with getting help when needed. Maybe this was a one time deal, but it was still disappointing?. Now, the server did apologize when my table received? the check; ?so, I am appreciative? of that.   Overall, a spectacular atmosphere with tasty food."}
{"text":"First let me say shrimp is everything baby !!! Came here for lunch I had the \"I'm stuffed!\" Shrimp which was large shrimp, crab stuffing, jasmine rice with garlic butter topped with Monterey Jack cheese and my best friend had the \"Shrimpers Heaven\" which was coconut shrimp, chilly shrimp, fried shrimp and Japanese style tempura shrimp all with fries and dipping sauces. Let me just say they totally delivered we shared our meal and everything tastes good!!! Since it was our first time there the sign system was one of the first things we learned and it totally was the best thing as far as getting your servers attention or any server at all. Dominick was our server and he was the best! He even shared a convo with us about Vegas and living out there and different things about the city. He was a really nice guy and he loved the Patriots so that was a bonus since we were from Boston. They service and food were definitely 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I love Bubba Gump's! I'm originally from California so when I saw that they were opening a location here in Las Vegas, I was stoked. I finally visited over the weekend and my first visit to this location was great! At first we sat down at a table in the inside but we had been walking around prior to coming in so we felt too warm, we asked if we could be moved outside and without any hesitation, they said yes! The view is gorgeous from outside! All our food was delicious, I got Lt. Dan's Drunken Shrimp, it was seasoned just right! On the plus, I got a free Shaker with my drink purchase! I highly recommend them, our server was very attentive and everyone was friendly as well."}
{"text":"They don't make the clam chowder in the house anymore but the gumbo was made in house and it's quite delicious as always the coconut shrimp as always my favorite. Because the clam chowder is not made in house anymore I give it a four star rating but my coconut shrimp and the great service were provided really deserve a five."}
{"text":"Lots of fun , everyone is Friendly, Stephen our server was great. Food is good, fast . Atmosphere lively and upbeat . Lots of young people. Definitely will come again ."}
{"text":"Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.   My friends and I went here on our first night in Vegas and were starved for just about anything. We got seated quickly, which was nice but that was probably the only pleasant part of this dining experience.   My friend is on a pretty strict diet and asked if a certain dish could be made without butter, the server said she would go and ask and that was the last we saw of her. The next thing we know the runners were bringing us our food and the dish that she asked for without butter looked like it was drenched in it. We asked if we could ask the manager or anyone if there was butter on it and it took about 30 minutes before we got any kind of answer.  Finally, the manager came over and assured us it wasn't so she began to eat it. About 10 minutes later she came back and said it actually was made with butter.  By this time everyone else was done with their meals. All in all it was a headache of an experience and was handled terribly by the staff."}
{"text":"We had so much fun here tonight.  There was no line and we were served promptly.  Bryant S was our server and he was like a character straight out of the movie.  He really made our night.  The food was fantastic."}
{"text":"The view outside is cool, but overall im not really impressed with this place. I just had a grilled chicken sandwhich. The lobster mac in cheese my friend got was sent back. She probably couldve added salt and been fine, but as is it's pretty bland. Their drinks are decent though. Get the one that comes with the souvenior cup. It's pretty strong."}
{"text":"The bf and I were craving seafood on our last night in Vegas. Walking around the Miracle Mile shops, all the restaurants wanted to charge an obscene amount for seafood. In the end we found ourselves at Bubba Gump-- seafood craving satisfied, no wait time, wallet happy, and definitely buzzed.  I have to say Carlos really deserves this review. He was a great server, honest and to the point. For people like me who've never been to Bubba Gump, their menu is extensive and therefore a bit overwhelming. Carlos made some good suggestions based on customer favorites, as well as help us make a decision of Gumbo vs. Jambalaya. We went with the jambalaya. Best. Decision. Ever.  FOOD: - Deep Fried Calamari w/ Red Bell Peppers and Pepperoncinis. Served with Dippin' Sauces. ($10.29) : The Calamari was good. Could do without the additional veggies, and they need to give more tartar sauce! [3.5/5]  - Jambalaya (Blackened Chicken, Shrimp and Andouille Sausage, sautéed with Bell Pepper, Onions, and Rice in Bubba's own Spicy Sauce. Topped with Tomatoes and Green Onions. $17.99): The portion is deceptively a fair amount. Initially we thought it was a bit small on the platter, but even my hungry boyfriend couldn't finish it. And it made the best drunken munchies later that night. The rice was spicy and creamy, all it needed was some baby scallops! [4.7/5]  -Jenny's Catch with Lobster Butter Sauce (Pan seared Tilapia laid over Mashed Potatoes with sautéed Spinach and a creamy Lobster Butter Sauce. 19.99) : SO GOOD. The fish was cooked beautifully and not overcooked like in most restaurants. There were two good sized fillets served with this dish. My only complaint was the mashed potatoes were a bit lukewarm/cold. The lobster butter sauce was fantastic. [4.5/5]  Trust me, if you're looking for seafood this place has it at the best prices (unless you're doing buffets). The restaurants in the Miracle Mile Shops next door in Planet Hollywood were charging anywhere from $28-$50 for seafood, not to mention tiny portions.  If I'm ever in Vegas and craving seafood, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Chains aren't my favorite travel experience, but my SO lives Forrest Gump. The food is always good, not life changing, but reliably decent. Our service in Vegas was perfect, the food was fast, and the decor keeps fans amused."}
{"text":"I had higher expectations but it wasn't that bad. If you're looking for something affordable that's along the lines of an Applebee's or TGIF's then this is the place, especially in it's prime location in planet Hollywood. The view is great. And the servers are enthusiastically perky.   Clam chowder: not the usual creamy version but more of a thin stew. It was okay but just wasn't expected.  Forrest's Seafood Feast: A good amount as a sampler. Fries are decent, fish and chips were overly battered, fried shrimp was okay but the hush pups were good. Not the usual corn breaded hush puppies."}
{"text":"Should have known better and to eat at a bad chain when surrounded by all the great restaurants on the strip. Food basically had no flavor and was over cooked. I didn't even finish half of the plate. Server we had was a very nice guy and they all seemed to be working hard and trying to satisfy customers. Not sure what the issue is with the food but do your self a favor and if you go, know the history of the Tom Hanks movie so you can answer questions in their trivia. Just order drinks as they were good."}
{"text":"I have been to Bubba Gump a few times in other states and have always been pleased. This visit was the same. We had a long day of travel and preferred a casual meal over the Vegas glitz.  We wanted seafood, so even though we don't typically do chains we gave it a try. The food was really good. I had Mahi with vegetables and rice.  I was hungry and it hit the spot. The wait staff was fun as usual. They were efficient and friendly. One of my favorite things about this place is the Forest Gump Trivia. So if you are going brush up on your movie knowledge. The prices for food is what is expected in Vegas, really not too bad. Located on The Strip about midway down makes it an easy stop in if you are out walking."}
{"text":"The food was good and our server was too funny. Great attitude and even played Bubba Gump trivia with us. Kind of pricey for a $$ place but we will go back some day."}
{"text":"If you love shrimp you have to come to bubba Gump it is tender the calamri isn't chewy the seasoning is perfect and dipping sauce to die for all the flavors work so well together and service is awesome had the shriper's heaven and for appetizer the fried calamari and popcorn shrimp spices are great and the coconut shrimp red lobster could definitely learn a thing or two a must go when I come back to Vegas again"}
{"text":"Ugh! What can I say? Out of all of the eateries in Vegas we ended up here. Save your money, save your time. Nothing to write home about..... one of my guests had to send her entire entree back. Why? ICE COLD! Another member in my party wondered why her gumbo was warm on one end of the bowl and cold on another. I ordered an appetizer and was presented with an entree ($8 additional dollars). Overall, the experience was not the greatest. No rush to return."}
{"text":"On my most recent trip here, the food was good and the same as usual, but it was the service and management that really pissed us off and now I don't know if we will ever return...at least to this location.   Our server was alright. There was a couple times where we couldn't find her but I'm thinking they were just understaffed that evening; it was during the holidays after all. When we were done with our meal, she seemed a little pushy on getting us to buy desserts even when we told her we were way too full and just wanted the check. She asked us to think about it and she'd come back. What the heck? Why can't you just bring the check? It seemed like she wanted us to give a definite answer of no before she was willing to print the check. Strike one.  When we finally received the check, we attempted to pay with an e-gift card that had $100 loaded on it and our meal was $91 including tax. When she brought the receipt for us to sign, she told us that we couldn't tip with the gift card and that we still had $8 or $9 remaining on the card, awesome...where's the gift card, could we have it back? The server refused and told us it was policy to keep our printed gift cards whether or not there was a remaining balance. WHAT? How does that even make sense? I will never be able to use the remaining balance then! We asked her to make a copy for us but she refused and told us to simply re-print one when we got home...problem is how do you do that when it was a gift and I already deleted the original e-mail?! No other business I've frequented has ever asked to keep a gift card, remaining balance or not without asking first if I wanted it back. She told me this is what her manager told her to do, which didn't really help the situation. I considered not leaving a tip since I just lost 9 bucks but ended up leaving a decent one and decided to take it up with management at a later date since it wasn't her fault and she was just doing what she was instructed to do.  I e-mailed the company about a week later and complained about my remaining balance that was lost because I was unable to get my gift card back and 2 days later received a phone call from one of the managers of the Vegas location. She stated that it was company policy to do this and the server indeed followed protocol. I was really angry and got in a heated argument with the manager about the policy since it doesn't really protect them from anything, while making it super inconvenient for customers and discourages them from buying and using gift cards. It wasn't the 9 bucks that I cared about, but the principle of what was going on that seemed fraudulent to me. I got nowhere with management and she continued to tell me that it was corporate policy. Ok, I guess I'll have to contact them to get more info then.  Then we contacted corporate customer service and was told that this was NOT corporate/company policy in any way, shape or form and that the store was mistaken and they weren't sure why. They ended up sending us a new link to re-print our gift card with the remaining balance and informed us that we would be receiving a phone call apology from the General Manager once they contacted him about the situation.  All in all, Bubba Gump Las Vegas is run by liars and they did nothing but inconvenience my family and then lie to me about it to back up their side of the story. It will take a lot for me to come back here in the furture, if I ever do. Just thinking about it gets me fired up and angry. I really hope they go out of business some day when this all catches up to them!  UPDATE (2/12/14): Well, it's been over a month and still haven't heard from the General Manager of Bubba Gump or received the apology I was promised. Worst customer service of any restaurant chain I've been to! Would never recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Excellent food, quick and friendly service! Those combinations always make for a great lunch stop."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience ever at this place!!!!! Service was horrible and the food was not great to make up for it either. I heard soooooo much about bubba gump shrimp and was always really excited to try it, and finally a group of friends and I did. Sadly the server we had was AWFUL!!!!!!!!! I had never in my life seen anyone hate his \"life/job\" more than our server, he was talking to us like we were \"annoying him\" for just being there it was ridicules. He would cut us off in the middle of ordering, and talk to the other waiters around him, and when we asked for recommendations he just simply told us \"that it all depends on what you like\" in the tone of voice saying (just pick darn it!).  The food was not great and the portions were SMALLER than expected but the service did not help, it made us just want to get out of there, without even getting a dessert (this pretty much never happens in my book so its serious! lol)  and when we finally got the bill he asked us to pick up everything off the table put it in the plates and pick it up and hand it to him, (if you ask me, he pretty much made us clear our own table for him! lol and we tipped him after! haha) overall horrible experience but gave for conversation at dinner and after! lol"}
{"text":"Amazing time!! Service was great. I don't remember our servers name, but he was so courteous and personable. He asked my friends and I trivia questions about the movie while we waited on our food. That definitely helped the time pass. Which wasn't long, because the kitchen was very fast. When the food did arrive, we didn't talk AT ALL. The seafood gumbo was melt-in-your-mouth delicious!! I was just very curious as to why there are no pictures of Bubba in the areas of the restaurant that caught my visual field (and I saw the whole place)."}
{"text":"The patio was so nice on a beautiful day! The service was great as were the drinks! They will have a couple on special each day. We just had a snack of shrimp (half cajun, half regular (I think soaked in beer)  DELICIOUS and not too busy for a late lunch. Everything was clean, even the washroom. Ya, it is a chain but an interesting one, I recommend it. You will know what amazing shrimp cookery smells like as you climb the stairs to the bar area!"}
{"text":"Pricing wasn't bad at all for a strip side seat watching above the blvd. Shrimp (of course) was great, Sampled all of them (I think)...Good mixed drinks, with a lot of their creations. On the sweet side, but alcohol that tastes like candy is really good when you've been drinking ETOH like H2O...Calamari was unique with fried peppers, jalapeno, and some other stuff in it. Super service, great ambience, and everything was a la Forrest Gump...Fun place that wont brake ya!"}
{"text":"Excited to finish my trip to Vegas on of my favorites restaurants but it was below my expectations. So so service with a so so food..."}
{"text":"This is more about their corporate side of things... First of all, they don't follow through with what they say. They had called me but I wasn't able to take their call since I was in the shower but they said they would call back in 30 mins... It's now been a week! So I see that this particular corporation doesn't care about what customers really think as long their pockets and wallets stay full. Anyone that knows me knows that the cost of food isn't an issue but more of the quality/quantity of what I'm paying for and in this case I received neither. If I'm going to pay $20+ for a \"feast\" I expect to get what I pay for. I'm sure they could really care less whether I ever go back to anyone of their establishments since I'm only one person but I won't take one step on their sidewalk. Thanks for your \"professionalism\" Bubba Gump Shrimp..."}
{"text":"Came in here for the very first time after seeing some good reviews but I was sadly disappointed. We ordered jumbo shrimp appetizer, soup salad a bucket of fries.  The shrimp was overcooked and gummy no flavor . When I asked the server is that generally how they cook shrimp she seemed a little confused and told me she actually never ate there which was a little odd . We had it boxed and gave to homeless guy won't be surprise if he toss it in the trash . It was not worth what we paid for and it will be my last time there ."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. Tried the Shrimp New Orleans dish. The food was very tasty, but it was our server, Keisha, that made the experience a step above great. She was very patient with us while we were trying to decide what to order for our drinks and entrees. She made some suggestions that were really helpful. Keisha, keep up the good work ! In the words of the Terminator,  I'LL BE BACK !!"}
{"text":"We all know how amazing the food is at BubbaGump Shrimp is but I think one of the best things they do at this restraunt is they have a sign. If you need something for the table you put up the stop first sign and any off the waiters near by will stop and help you. It doesn't just have to be your waiter. Is wonderful to get fast and friendly service when you go."}
{"text":"First time for me and my dining partner. No waiting for a table at 6 pm on a Tuesday evening. Service was prompt and the waitress was patient with our orders. She offered a few drink suggestions to my partner, one of which was taken. Turned out to be a good choice. We both had the gumbo shrimp soup and shared an cheese dip with shrimp as an appetizer. The dip was very good with lots of shrimp pieces. The soup was appropriately spicy and filling. A good meal for $63."}
{"text":"First time eating at this franchise.  In town on vacation and friends recommended. I can see why they wanted us to stop. If you love shrimp this is the place to go. So many options to choose from that it is hard to nail it down.  We were able to sit outside and enjoy the Vegas Strip. The drinks are a little spendy but unique and you get to keep the souvenir glass. The waiter was friendly and even offered trivia questions about the Forest Gump movie. Would gladly stop at another location."}
{"text":"We went here to sit on the balcony over looking the strip. It has a great view!  The food is ok.. The hush puppies are the best I've had. Bubba Gumps is a fun experience but way over priced..We split an appetizer, meal, dessert and 2 beers for $75! It was worth it for the view. I wouldn't go there if you're on a tight budget."}
{"text":"Get the spicy jambalaya! And shrimp Mac and Cheese! Melt in your mouth delish!"}
{"text":"Being in Vegas most of us carry around a big slushie drink (mine from Fat Tuesdays) & most restaurants knowing this willingly accommodate you bringing your drinks into their establishment so you can enjoy a meal. They realize you can't pound back a yard long alcoholic drink so quickly. Well upon entering this restaurant I was told I needed to finish my 3/4 full drink or I couldn't enter. I haven't had this problem with any restaurant on the vegas strip. I'm sorry I won't order your $6 drink but would rather order your $25 entreé. Will never return to any of their restaurants due to the way this was handled. I was told to finish my drink before they closed in an hour & would be served then. Well my drunk self would probably not want to eat at that point. Off to La Salsa Cantina we went in Planet Hollywood where we received amazing service!"}
{"text":"Had Shandi as our server and  she was great! We did the trivia game which was actually fun. We never went without drinks and our food was actually really delicious. I got my usual Shrimp New Orleans and the spice to it was perfect.   We got a chance to talk with one of the managers. His name was Matt. He was very personable and gave us great tips for shows and places to get massages. Overall we enjoyed our visit!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Vegas Bubba! This now means 2 things, I can no longer eat you in Cali, because it's against the rules being that you're an official Vegas restaurant now. Second, you decorated well, but maybe you should have stayed in Cali. I liked you better there.  I was super hyped up when I heard the news that my city was getting a Bubba Gump. I have dined at both the Santa Monica and Anaheim locations in the past and always loved it. Fried Chicken, shrimp bloody marys, and cajun shrimp. YUMMMMM! My boyfriend and I waited to go with our friends Mario and Sonya. They were always who we went with in Cali so it just made sense that we check out the new location together. I am in there looking like a tourist. It is set up so you enter through a gift shop, go up stairs and wait for a hostess. It looks just like all the other locations with great Forrest Gump decor. Everyone was super welcoming and friendly. 5 stars for service all around. Again as a tourist I asked to sit on the patio. It was about 9:30pm so the heat was dying down. We ordered a sampler appetizer that came with seafood hush puppies, chicken, fried shrimp, and shrimp cocktail and a pound of cajun shrimp. To me, the cajun shrimp were the highlight of the entire night.  Mario and I ordered the bucket of trash which is a little of everything. Crab, fish, shrimp. It was average. Not amazing but not bad. My boyfriend had fish and chips which he didn't like, and Sonya had fried chicken, which again was average. Disappointed in average fried chicken because I know its above average in Cali.  Now I understand when going to a seafood restaurant you should expect to pay $20 a plate. Especially on the strip. But oh boy do they rape you on the drinks. $4 sodas and $9 lemonades!?! And they charge for refills?! $160 seemed a little rough for 4 people. But maybe I am just not use to paying attention to the price cuz I am usually on vacation while dining here. But unless its a special occasion or a friend in town, I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"First time here, service was great as soon as we walked in the door. I had the Shrimp and Grits, very very good! Our server Rikki was very nice and attentive. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed when eating at Bubba. If you've read my past reviews, we discovered Bubba while vacationing at Disneyland. The whole family loved it. So when we got a surprise visit from my husband's cousin, we decided to take her here. I also had a gift card given to me for my bday so why not use it. I've seen pictures of friends that have eaten here before and the view when seated outdoors looked amazing. It was! They had heaters  which kept their customers comfortable. The server was attentive, no problem with the customer service. We were also seated right away, no wait. If you've never been, try it and sit outside."}
{"text":"Food was great- Service was deplorable - 6 minutes for a waitress and then only because I flipped to the sign to Stop - it was April 20, we were the because of the LSC menu, she was clueless - ordered an Onion Ring appetizer, was served with no plates, server said he would get some, he goes right back by us with no plates. The waitress stops by on QC check 10 minutes after the main course was served. Complete management failure as the manager was watching all of this. We are not difficult to please, just do your job."}
{"text":"My first time here! The portions were decent, not overly priced but nothing special. A tad salty for my taste but filling."}
{"text":"I love the story behind Bubba Gump, I mean who does not like Forest Gump?! Along with atmosphere the bartender was phenomenal! I hated to see all the people who didn't tip him because he definitely deserved big fat tips! I wish I remembered his name! My meal and that day was only made better by sitting at that bar 3 years ago, yes I still remember."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. ! Service was excellent ! Went with fellow yelper Dodi b. Waitress asked us trivia. It was fun. The Mac n cheese I didn't finish. The macaroni was tiny and the cheese was watery. Tasted like a water cheese packet mix poured into more water with cheap macaroni. But other than that we're definitely going back ! A+ atmosphere and food. And u get free buba gump  Souvenir glasses"}
{"text":"This was my first and will very likely be the last time to Bubba Gump Shrimp. This chain restaurant was so well-known that some friends and I stopped here for dinner as soon as we found it without a second thought. But it turned out to be a great disappointment, as the food was not that delicious and was unreasonably expensive. It was so ridiculous that the Shrimper's Heaven only had a few shrimps on the top with the rest of the boxes filled with french fries! If you're a big fan of Forrest Gump, then this would be an interesting restaurant for you. But if you're not, then perhaps it's better to make another wise choice."}
{"text":"After posting my review the manager of this establishment did contact me and apologize for the service I received. He stated he would add credits to my loyalty card. That was 5 months ago. He never added anything or followed up with me. Way to go Landry's Bubba Gump - Vegas. Still love Saltgrass. Bubba Gump is horrible from bottom to top management. Hard to believe an establishment under the Landry's brand operates like this."}
{"text":"Nice to see this restaurant make its way to Vegas. I have never been to one so I ventured in here during lunch over the weekend. As expected, since it is located on the second/third floor of Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops, the location gets great foot traffic from people on the strip or those coming from the bridge from the Cosmopolitan or Crystals/Aria. The retail store has all sorts of neat shirts, accessories and souvenirs and you have to go up the stairs to access the restaurant section. My eye caught the Stupid is as Stupid Does Shirt!  Since I was on a lunch break I did not take long and went to the bar.   The only TVs I saw were at the bar and I did not see any in the regular dining area so I for now, I do not believe this is a good spot to try to catch any game; only come for the fish and shrimp dining!  I asked the bartender's recommendation and went with a cup of Mama Blues Shrimp Gumbo. He explained the gumbo as having worchestire sauce in it with a little kick and I like that sauce in my marinades so I was sold.  Surely enough, there was a little spice but   The main course I ordered was the accidental fish/shrimp. This was a broiled mahi mahi with jasmine rice, grilled shrimp that came with a side of lemon butter with roma tomatoes. I've had freshly caught mahi mahi in Hawaii so I have a high standard when it comes to this fish. The one they served came very close but not quite that standard. It was a generous portion and came with some shrimp which I thought could have been bigger.   The price of the meal was kind of high as well but that's what's expected from restaurants on the Vegas strip. This was a great experience and hopefully I'll buddy up with one of the staff there to come back in and get a discounted hookup. lol."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of Bubba Gump's ever since I was introduced to their location in San Francisco and ate there a few times. So when my hubby brought me to Las Vegas for our first wedding Anniversary, and for my first time ever in Las Vegas, we debated a TON on what to have for dinner. As we ventured out on our night which he had decided on walking around and eating to wherever calls us...he said...\"Hey, there's a Bubba Gump's here!\" I look over to see he's on Yelp!  I said, \"You know what, I could go for some Gump's!\" And away we went! The line was non existent and the restaurant had some open tables. We were behind a larger group, both of us asking for outdoor seating... Without asking if we wanted to wait, we were immediately sat in the dining room while the larger group was taken outside. When we arrived at our table I asked the host, \"Um, was there no seats outside?\"  He said \"There's a ten minute wait.\"  Ok whatever... We just took the booth.  Our waitress came quickly and was great the entire night! My hubby ordered the Burger and I ordered the bucket of seafood at Market Price. Food came fast and my bucket of seafood was amazing and so was the extra garlic bread we ordered. We love this place so I know we'll be back."}
{"text":"First time trying this place, was kind of skeptical at first but I had such a good time! From the trivia game to the \"free\" cup, I can say that I will be going back! We had Charles & Rey as our servers and we couldn't be any happier! They were attentive and they answered all our questions. Will be going back for the food and the staff!"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to this restaurant back in 2005 in Cali. Glad they finally made their way to Vegas. Bubba Gump Shrimp Co is located ON THE STRIP. Tourist central. Nothing wrong witth that. But just be warned of the strip traffic especially if you go during peak hours.  Everytime I go to Bubba Gump, I ALWAYS...and I repeat, ALWAYS get the SAME appetizer and the SAME entree.  For the appetizer I get the Cajun Shrimp. Let me tell you, THAT stuff is delicious!!!!!! The spices, the dipping oil, the garlic bread that comes with it....ohhh man. Excuse my TMI but it's like an orgasm in the mouth!!!!!!!  For my entree, I get the Shrimp Scampi pasta. The sauce is light yet flavorful. The bowl is big enough for me to have leftovers for the next day.  Welcome to Vegas, Bubba Gump!"}
{"text":"Good location to watch the cowboys/packers game and watch the strip. Had the cup of Gumbo and Pear and Berry Shrimp Salad with moscato wine. Our server Stacy really made the experience worthwhile!"}
{"text":"Very fun and delicious place on the Vegas strip that will forever remind me of my wife and I's first day in Las Vegas.  The shrimp is the best I've ever had and they make it many different creative ways. You might think it's just a seafood place, but you're wrong.   A fun family atmosphere for a casual price. They have surprise trivia mixed in and the staff is fun. Awesome vacation stop for a family or couple."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and I love it! The staff is great they know good customer service! I love how they ask you quick trivia questions about the Forrest Gump movie it's pretty fun. The food is great I ordered Mommas fried chicken and it is delicious, especially the mashed potatoes they tasted homemade. This is one of my go to places when I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great location, great shrimp, horrible service, and horrible management. We waited 15 minutes after being sat then asked to be waited on. The food was served fast after it was ordered. The waitress never came back. After 45 minutes and asking 3 different wait staff, we asked to speak to a manager.  He couldn't find our bill. Finally the waitress came with a $250 check.  Our bill should have been $70. Finally they fixed it with no apologies or even discount. It totally ruined our night!"}
{"text":"I had the best experience at Bubba Gumps with some of my friends!!! The food was amazing and the drinks were great!!! It's not cheap but the experience makes up for it!   We had an amazing server (Lexi PLEASE request her!!!) and she made us feel so welcomed!!! I'm living in Vegas and this place was very comforting!!! The view of you are by the window is great and the Forrest Gump trivia is hilarious!!! I loved it here and will definitely go here again!! Especially if Lexi is there!!! :-D"}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner on our last night in Vegas during our last trip. We just wanted to sit down and relax, we had had a LONG day. So when we saw Bubba Gumps we just said what the heck and got in line! We had a wait of maybe 30 minutes or so, not too bad. We were seated at a table and our server immediately took our drink orders. Our waiter was very nice, we liked him a lot.   We both ordered massive amounts of food haha, we were so hungry! We started with the popcorn shrimp appetizer which was surprisingly great. I had some huge platter of fried seafood, I loved it all. And my boyfriend had something similar which he also liked.   This place is a lot of fun, I bet kids would really like it. They also have these awesome special cups that you can take home.. They light up! Of course I had to get one:)  I would absolutely come here again because it was great and we had a fun time!"}
{"text":"Ohmigosh!  Fly here just for this!!  I love seafood and I make my own incredible Jambalaya. . .but I have been defeated and rendered helpless for any seafood place I have ever been to.  Just pay the airfare and get here. . ."}
{"text":"Good choice for a quick bite. We ordered the seafood platter. The hush puppies were to die for! It's different than others I have eaten. These contain chunks of corn and I believe crab meat."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday @ 11:30 a.m or so. So it was good I beat the crowds.  The first thing I noticed was the smell and look of a new building, thats always a plus. They have plenty of space there and the design worked with the location hovering over the strip. The interior stayed true to the theme of the restaurant.  We had a great waitress, I forgot her name but it was evident she enjoyed her job and was truly happy to work there.   The gumbo, EXCELLENT. Even the waitress said \"Bet you wish you ordered the large\". LOL. I had the cup. Beautiful arrangement and quite a bit of sausage and fish. I destroyed it in about 5 minutes. I recommend anyone reading this to try it.   Had the seafood feast, The fish and shrimp, very tasty. Light and with flavor and not that heavy grease aftertaste as you would have in some places. Seasoned just right. Now some would say that it didn't have enough seasoning to the batter but I think it is just enough to where you don't overwhelm the taste of the actual fish and shrimp.  Try it. I would recommend trying every incarnation of shrimp they serve. I have my sites set on the Shrimpers feast next..  Cloe slaw- cut fresh as you order it, not drenched in mayo. +5  Only thing the jury is out on, and probably because of my own tastes...the hush puppies. I like the more flavorful ones,like at Long John Silvers...if you try both you'll know what I mean. But not work deducting a star, When your main course is good, who cares about the side piece.    My biggest endorsement is that Gumbo, TRY it....You wont be disappointing. Well done Bubba!"}
{"text":"It was a Bubba Gump. Everything on the strip looks fancy and this was no exception. Our server Luke was very nice and took good care of us. He even entertained us with a little Forrest Gump trivia contest, which was fun. The food, was not bad, but that might hold true for all Bubba Gumps. This was our first time and we were fairly if not absolutely impressed. Luke's service though was exceptional. He was caring but not overbearing. He checked in on us on a regular basis. He made good suggestions on the menu too that helped us navigate the formidable menu well."}
{"text":"i am such a HUGE fan of forrest gump! it's one of my all time favorite movies! :]  so this was my first time eating at a bubba gump and i've got to say, i fell in love with the theme. it was so interesting! there were so many signs and there were pictures and newspapers. there were also these adorable little signs that said run forrest run, and stop forrest stop!  the prices are were high but i thought it was fun. my friends and i were sat at such a bright room, and it was spacious and white! i think it was meant to resemble forrest's home since it seemed like it was back in the day. it was decorated with plates and pictures which i thought was extremely cool!  the waitresses were the nicest people i've ever met. they came every time, just to check up on us, which means, drinks all day every day!  anyways, loved the place and i'll come back next time when i go back to vegas!"}
{"text":"I have experienced better but it was at the Chicago location..maybe because this one is located on the strip they assume people are just drunk and hungover so they will eat anything.. for the most part that is accurate. Especially if they have been smoking cigarettes butt to butt (\"butt to butt\" sounds funnier than \"chain smoking\") all night..  I ordered the Cajun shrimp with Garlic toast..super buttery and garlicky and you could tell the shrimp was frozen. My mom got the grilled fish sandwich.. and frowned the WHOLE TIME.. I knew it was over when she asked for tartar sauce..  The server was great.. she kept calling me \"baby\" though and I don't know how I feel about that.. I'M A GROWN A** WOMAN.. just kidding..but it did get a little annoying..She was prompt and courteous though."}
{"text":"Ok so the drinks were good. Had the lava flow and margarita. The dip was good but greasy. Loved that it had shrimp tho. Ordered a po'boy. I asked if it had some kind of sauce and they said yes. When it came out no sauce . Just mayo on a huge piece of bread I could barely stuff in my mouth. Definitely for a mans mouth. So dry. Had to ask for thousand and just skipped eating the bread. Shrimp alone were good. The service was also good as well as the view."}
{"text":"This wasn't my choice since I lived in New Orleans for ten years and have had it several times.  The group I was with wanted to eat here so I didn't put up a fight.  It was eight of us and the waitress was great at taking the orders and answering questions.  Some had specific requests and that was handled well also.  I split the Shrimper's Heaven and Bubba's After the Storm Bucket of Boat Trash with someone.  The food was cooked well but not very well seasoned.  It was ok.  I also tasted the potato cakes which were average.  The Lt. Dan's Pomegranate Punch was tasty though.  Average seafood.  Nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"If you like Forest Gump, then i would recommend you stopping at Bubba Gump. They have good food and trivia durning your meal. Im sure there is better seafood in vegas but since i have been to other location we decide to stop! Even if you don't like seafood, this is a place to stop because they do a phenomenal job on seasoning.  They also have good Specialty Alcoholic drink with a souvenir cup."}
{"text":"Neat atmosphere. Our server Danny was good spirited and energetic! He definitely helped make the experience fun. My fiancé and I both had the Fried Seafood platter. Good food, and big portions!"}
{"text":"Fist time at Bubba Gump's even though there is one near Houston. Bianca was our server and she was very polite and informative since it was our first visit. The food was great, try the jambalaya. A little pricy, but worth it in my opinion. The drinks are tasty as well, plus you get to keep the glass with most of them. Landry's does it again!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed.   My shrimp showed signs of freezer burn.  Not up to the standard i expect from Bubba Gump."}
{"text":"I am giving them 1 star because I have to give a star. This was the WORST service I have ever experienced at a restaurant. The service started out good but was progressively slower and slower and one of party didn't get his food for 20 minutes after the rest of us were served (we had to wait 5 minutes after we were served for someone to \"stop, forest, stop\" at the table so we could inquire. The appetizers were good and my garden salad was fresh and very tasty. I had the coconut shrimp and I enjoyed it very much. 3 of the others in our party had a sampler of shrimp (I don't know the name of the exact dish). The tempura battered shrimp was soggy and tasteless and went uneaten. They reported (I didn't taste it) the seasoned shrimp was over seasoned and cold but the grilled shrimp in the plate was excellent.   Drinks were VERY SLOW to come out from the bar. One of our party ordered a whiskey based drink and felt the whiskey taste was too strong. Several of us ordered top shelf margaritas and they were okay, but didn't taste too shelf. The plastic shaker they were in leaked and our hands were sticky, so the design wasn't good. 2 members got a \"free\" cup with their drink, but it wasn't explained they had to take their receipt to the lobby to get it, so that took time waiting for the cup that wasn't coming (check your bag they hand you if you get this because one of the gals only got the shaker lid and not the actual cup.   Our main complaint was that management didn't seem to care about the \"missing in action\" food and wasn't proactive in letting us know it was being taken care of. When we complained, management (?) sent us a beautiful complimentary dessert tray. Unfortunately we had already said we did not want dessert. We really wanted our check and to leave because we had been there for so long. It took forever to get the checks (the checks were split. I honestly don't know if the server was told when we placed orders we wanted to split the checks and I understand it takes longer to do that after the fact, but 30 minutes? We were sitting outside freezing. It took a good 40-45 minutes from the time we said no dessert to the time we got our checks and got out of there. I believe they took an appetizer off of someone's bill and took something else off another persons bill (I don't know what).  The \"missing meal\" should have been free and a free appetizer and no dessert should have been sent (a nice gesture but we honestly wanted to leave and it just extended the time we were sitting there waiting for the checks, so it wasn't something that made the situation better, unfortunately).  Food was generally decent, drinks were overpriced for what you got but the service killed the experience. The \"run forest run/stop forest stop\" plaques sitting at the table that indicate to servers and management something is needed did NOT seem to help in getting service. The concept that if ANY team member sees the \"stop forest stop\" at ANY table, they stop and ask what is needed is a great concept and I have eaten at other locations where the service was excellent using this model. Perhaps it was an off night or they were short staffed, but the service failed miserably as did managements handling of the situation."}
{"text":"\"The food is great, but the portions could be a tad more\". I recommend the Jumbalaya and the Cajun style bucket of shrimp! Cocktails here are also good. If you are going here on a weekend (I have not been here on a weekday) get there early because the line will fill! Lol."}
{"text":"At all California locations I've have a wonderful staff interaction with trivia and explanation of table service. This location lacked that. It changed the experience for my guest first time visit. All in all everything else was up to par!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has good tasting seafood the price is a bit high for the portions you receive great view  a good atmosphere service is friendly food is like I said good but small portions the wait sometimes takes a while depending on what time of the day you go and what day of the week"}
{"text":"Our visit didn't start out well.  We waited in Landry's VIP line only to be told to move to the regular line by Patrick.  After move lines i noticed someone else in the VIP line and they were seated immediately.  I asked Patrick what the VIP line was for?  He said it was for members.  Once i showed Patrick my member # he thought nothing of it.  If it wasn't for Frankie, our awesome waiter, i would have given this place 1 star.  The food was delicious but Patrick ruined it for us.  We will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Seafood is my weakness and to find bubba Gump shrimp was like finding treasure for me. I loved the whole concept of the place. Photos of Forrest Gump, artifacts, benches and decor is just mind blowing. This place was connected to a bubba gump giftshop too. If anyone were interested to get little something , they had that option.  We were sitted very quickly as we walked into the Restaurent. our server was nice and knowledgeable . She suggested how much bucket shrimp should we order for two people and if it was too much food for us or not. Which helped us make decision.  We got a bucket of cajun and garlic shrimp. Cajun was our favorite because of its unique flavor. Also got a shrimp scampi pasta. It was very light and tasty. Not too much added thats why it was nice to eat. I really liked the place."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dinner after a long flight. Have heard about it but never been. I ordered the dish with 4 different shrimps and a margarita. Enjoyed the shrimps and like the concept. They have nice belcony seating overlooking the Strip. Service was fast and they dont hassle you. They come when you want them to. A bit pricey. Food - 5 Service - 5 Atmosphere - 5 Value/Price - 3"}
{"text":"The place was empty when we arrived at 11am. The waitress seemed dull and unhappy to be there until the time to pay came around. Maybe she was having a bad morning? She explained to flip the sign over when we needed something. My friend said \"why wouldn't she just casually check in every once in a while, instead of needing the sign?\" Good point. We did not see the waitress in the quiet restaurant until the sign flipped for a refill. My friends all LOVED the food! I had the fried chicken breast with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. The breading was crispy and the chicken was juicy, although no flavor or seasoning to it. I dipped mine in the gravy from potatoes to give it something. The potatoes were great and portion size was huge. It came with 2 breasts stacked. I split the meal with a friend, and glad I did when we saw it arrive with 2! Fun atmosphere, but I felt like the Chicago location's wait staff were more fun and friendly."}
{"text":"Forrest Gump is one of my favorite movies so I was so excited to come here!   To sum up in a word: disappointed. The food had no flavor whatsoever. I think I added the entire salt shaker to the bucket of shrimp we got. It's \"spiciness\" is comparable to celery. Also, my brother got the seafood pasta. Waaay too overpriced. The wait was pretty long too.  One star because our waitress was nice."}
{"text":"We came here for a late night dinner and it was a pretty average experience. Food took longer than we liked/expected at 10:00pm. The waiter seemed visibly annoyed when we didn't purchase beverages and the food was okay. I didn't like the gumbo at all but the New England clam chow Eder was tasty. Coconut shrimp were okay when hot but cooled fast and weren't as good then. I don't prefer chains and this is a situation where I'm like this is why! The NYC location is much better."}
{"text":"No, no, no. I know Bubba Gump's is a tourist trap but we were in a rush, so we settled on Bubba Gump's. Big mistake. Our server was nice enough and explained that the \"STOP FORREST STOP\" and \"RUN FORREST RUN\" signs were used to call over the wait staff when service was needed. OK, gimmicky and kind of cute. We never ended up using them, though. I went for the Shrimp Scampi and my husband got the jambalaya. Our food came out within 10-15 minutes, pretty quick. My husband liked his jambalaya but also commented halfway through eating it that it got old pretty fast. As for my scampi, it was very lemony which is not my preference for this dish, but it was fine. What was NOT fine was the fact that the shrimp was most definitely overcooked. Ugh. You'd think a seafood restaurant could saute shrimp and not overdo it. Not only that, but I felt the overall portions were pretty small for what you were paying.  To make things worse (considering I was in a hurry to leave the restaurant), the computers went down after our server took our card. I think we were waiting 20-30 minutes for that to pass before she was able to swipe the card. Bah!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. Good food and great service. Will eat here again. We had the special meal along with the special cocktail and got to keep the glass. Really feel the atmosphere picks up the spirit of the movie."}
{"text":"Great food great prices. We ate here on vacation our waiter was awesome. It was a fun place to eat with friends. You also got big portions for the price will be going back again."}
{"text":"This is the worst meal I've ever had at a restaurant and it cost a small fortune. We went for my son's birthday because we love shrimp and we love Forrest Gump and have always wanted to try it here. The fried shrimp tasted funny. I ate one and didn't like it at all but figured I'm paying for it. So I tried to eat a second one but gave up, so they were wasted. We ordered dessert because I was so disappointed with the meal I figured at least the cookie sundae would be nice. Nope. The cookie was completely over baked and super dried out. Everywhere else I've had one serves it kind of gooey and delicious but this one was awful. What a let down to have bad shrimp at a shrimp place!  Also, the \"garlic bread\" didn't taste much like garlic. More like buttered bread. You'd think when the waitress took away my plate & saw all the shrimp still on it, she would have asked if something was wrong but she didn't. So I told her the shrimp wasn't good and she just said sorry and walked off. Didn't offer to do anything to satisfy us or correct the situation. I will NEVER go back. $65 down the drain.  (Also having some serious intestinal issues today. Gee, I wonder if that has anything to do with bad shrimp???)"}
{"text":"Danny was hands down the best server! His attention to detail was great and he was overall just very pleasant. I will definitely come back here after this experience! The jambalaya was also bomb, 5 stars no doubt!!"}
{"text":"Me ganó el turista y me tenía que dar una pasada para la foto. Es un restaurant de comida de mar como cualquier otro, con el agregado de la marca. La atención es buena, y es un lugar muy amplio. Cuando lo visitamos estaba casi vacío, y nos pudimos sentar en una de las mesas del balcón con vista al Strip, que le suma muchos puntos!   La comida esta buena, son porciones abundantes. Probamos unos Shrimper's Heaven con salsas para \"picar\" y de principal probe un Texas Cajun Chicken Sandwich que era una locura (bacon, guacamole, pepperjack cheese, y muerte (?)).  Tienen muchos tragos propios, y aunque algunos parecen más jugos con un toque de alcohol, otros son apropiadamente refrescantes y valen la pena (Alabama Southern Punch), además de que todos vienen en vasos diferentes. Detalle medio vendehumo, pero en la carta algunos tienen una marca al lado del nombre, y eso significa que te regalan el vaso en cuestión, lo cual es un plus pavote pero que suma.  El servicio muy bueno y rápido. El sistema de poner el cartelito para que el mozo venga cuando pueda es copado. En la planta baja del local tenes toda la sección de souvenir donde retiras el vaso de tu trago y podes comprar otras pavadas de Forrest Gump."}
{"text":"I recently went to the Bubba Gumps restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip near Planet Hollywood and the Shops.  It was great!  We loved our waitress who was very attentive!  It is pretty cool that they have license plates on the table (red and green) side.  This will either bring the nearest Waitress/Waiter to your table or not.  Our regular Waitress still stopped by but that was more for immediate service.  Our waitress also quizzed us about the movie Forest Gump which was pretty cool!  I would definitely go back!  I had the Shrimp Mac and Cheese and it definitely didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is 3.5 stars, perhaps a lot of people get peel and eat shrimp (which I hate, regardless of the quality). I would go with the momma Gumps southern fried shrimp it is the second best I have ever had behind Florida seafood in cocoa beach Florida. Price wise this place is comparable to red lobster, but the quality far surpasses red lobster. Defiantly worth having, my wife and I loved it."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Little pricey, but unique, tasty dishes.  We have always wanted to try them out and were pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Giving this 4 stars because my family really enjoyed the food.  We followed the server's recommendations and none of us were disappointed.  My daughter had the fish and my wife shrimp while I had the Jambalaya.  No complaints from anyone.  Service was excellent - we were actually served by a guy named 'Bubba'  :-).  A little of the pricey side though."}
{"text":"I've been to a number of Bubba Gump restaurants because my husband is a huge fan of the place for some reason.  I find the food to be pretty consistent no matter which restaurant we go to.  This is the first time we visited the one in Vegas.  I'm the one who spotted it and pointed it out to my husband.  He said he wouldn't have noticed it had I not pointed it out.  I mentally kicked myself for being observant after eating here.  The food was pretty standard Bubba fare - the best ever popcorn shrimp was still pretty good, the fish and chips still average.  My issue with this location is the service.  Our waitress came to our table all of twice - once to take our order, once to bring the bill.  At every other Bubba's I've been to the servers have been really friendly and they always come and quiz you on Forrest Gump trivia while you're waiting for your food.  I don't know if this is just something they don't do at this particular Bubba Gump location or if we just had a really lousy server but I don't imagine I'll be dining at Bubba Gump in Vegas again when there are so many other good places to eat."}
{"text":"This place gets a one star and the number 1 reason is because the hostes/manager Sarah. She was extremely rude and disrespectful. She did no care about our service and basically denied our service into this restaurant. I am a visitor here and I never dealt with such foolishness and disrespect. Beware of her. As the face of this restaurant she is awful and mean."}
{"text":"Came here cuz of course we love bubba Gump but being to a lot of bubba gumps I have never experienced such great customer service from a gentleman named Chris. I really hope your boss sees this & you get awarded somehow. This experience just made our weekend a whole lot more enjoyable. People should learn from this guy what it is to have customer service. Thanks for taking a picture of us to Chris!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a whole lot of really cool movie memorabilia decked out all over the walls inside from the film and to be fair it was pretty cool to see that stuff.  We decided to share a few appies and got some peel and eat shrimp and some other spicy shrimp dish. The food was just OK considering the fairly inflated prices. It wasn't any better than anything one might find at Red Lobster, and given that RL is the Walmart of seafood establishments it wasn't that great. I enjoy good seafood, the like of which one might find at The Fisherman's Restaurant on the Pier in Seattle, or Captain John's Seafood Buffet in Kitty Hawk NC on the Outer Banks. I had a margarita with a baby Corona dumped into it which was decent.  I think if you are into film nostalgia, for THAT one film, and like shrimp go for it. Just don't expect to come away raving about your out of body seafood experience."}
{"text":"We had such a great time. Kristin was a fantastic server and the food was on point. I might have to come here every time I'm in Vegas. Better than the hotel restaurants!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of people last night before closing. I am four months pregnant and asked for a well done burger as I have to eat throughly cooked meat. My burger was burnt to the point that it was inedible. Didn't want to make a fuss so I didn't eat it. Waiter charged me for extras I didn't purchase. Hesitated to fix. Ended up double charging my credit card. Let him know and he became upset and started to sigh. Didn't tip him for his rude service. Checked my balance again, a third charge has come up. Very dismal, horrible service. First time and last time I will eat here."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Had dinner here before a show we were seeing at the Aria (which is right across the street).  They do NOT take reservations, do call ahead seating, etc., so I was slightly concerned about getting a table, but since we were willing to sit inside (the outside deck is very popular), we got a table after waiting in line about 10 minutes, so not bad at all for a Vegas night.  Drinks were awesome, service was very good and quick and the food was very tasty.  Was really glad to see a Bubba's in Vegas, and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional. Takes them awhile to get the food ready but it tastes decent. Kinda pricey for the portions we got. Rowdy environment. Nice view inside and out. I'd recommend the lobster salad. Burger was not worth it. Bubba gump bubba bubba bubba gump!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying  I DON'T LIKE SEAFOOD. I wish i was so enamored with it that I could destroy a bucket of shrimp and be happy about it, but I cain't.   I just cain't.  Okay -- now that that's done, I can confidently tell you that the solid 3 stars is only based on the service. The food left a bit to be desired. WIth all of the seafood buffet opportunities, I think that this BG cannot afford mediocrity.   We were greeted on the first floor by the hostess, who ushered us into the store and up the stairs. There was a short wait, then we were seated. I can imagine this place when it's busy, and I definitely do NOT want to be waiting on the stairs, my man.   Our waitress was entertaining and gregarious. She was also very attentive to our table and got us whatever we needed, which was nice.    My friend had the fish and chips. The chips were good. Not many places can ruin fries - no worries there. But the \"fish?\" Boo. WAAAAAAAAAAAY too much breading, she could barely find the meat!  Fun fact: you tell the waitstaff that you need help by flipping over the license plate signs to the RED side. This lets your waiter know that you are ready for service or you have a concern/question. They'll tell you that, \" you're in the drivers' seat.\"   I see what they did there.    I got the burger. It was really good, but nothing spectacular. It kept well, but I was not too happy about the price tag. I believe there was only one option for a burger, so I was sour that I felt overcharged to add cheese to the burger.   And what is a burger without cheese? WHAT. IS IT?  The outside seating looked pretty appealing, but it was definitely chilly considering the temperature had dipped down into the 50s. and for the desert during midday, that was a little too CRISPin Glover for me.    If you know you're about to get the chili's rate seafood experience, then you will not be dissapointed. As my friend pointed out, she would have liked more fish with her breading. From what I saw her pick off, it was an accurate assessment of the FISHuation.    ...that kind of worked."}
{"text":"Bubba's is a decent place to go with decent, Vegas priced fish and burgers.  If you haven't been to one of these chains before, it's worth the visit. They're known not so much for their food but for their Forest Gump themed decor. Every inch of the walls, down to a separate room in the joint wallpapered to look like one in his famous house. They've got a license plate system on the tables, a blue Run Forest run plate for when you and yours are doing fine and a red Stop Forest Stop plate for when you need a napkin or a drink. Any waiter nearby will be there to help.  They've got a big menu that encompasses many different items that are sure to satisfy any picky eaters needs. There are a few Forest-themed drinks, but, being in Vegas it's really not much.  I've been to a few different Gumps in my days and the food is always pretty good. This place was no different. I devoured most of the hearty helping of fish and chips in front of me. Our waiter was friendly, joking with us and quizzing us on our Forest Gump knowledge.  This location is nice too, right off the walkway across from The Cosmopolitan. There's also a terrace to sit outside if it's not as chilly as it was when we were there.   This is a nice family place to eat on the Strip with the slightly over priced grub you'll find all over Vegas. Yum."}
{"text":"Expensive for a chain restaurant. The manager who took our reservation and our server both had great customer services skills. Food was okay, not great for the price we paid."}
{"text":"Tried the shrimp New Orleans and the stuffed shrimp both were delish!!! Wanted to try some of the drinks but it's 113 degrees and I want to see/do more"}
{"text":"Never coming back to this place ever. Might be the worst seafood I had ever had. Ordered a shrimp heaven and a shrimp came out looking like someone ate the shrimp and threw the tail back in the batter. Completely lost my appetite. But the manager completely swear that that is not the case and the chef is always on the line and watches everyone cooks move. So it is impossible for that to happen. So she walks away and does nothing to help or correct the situation. SORRY BUBBA GUMP LIFE IS LIKE A BOX OF CHOCOLATES AND YOU FOUND YOURSELF A LEMON OF A MANAGER."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed. Look at it, does it look appetizing. NO!   The food lacked flavor and service was meh. I tried one of their shrimp pots. Which were undercooked. Potatoes were undercooked and overall, it was just nasty. The seasoning wasn't even right. They used way too much paprika. Do yourself a favor and find \"real\" seafood elsewhere...off the strip preferably."}
{"text":"Omg the service here is incredible. Every time our sign (that indicated we needed service) was turned, someone appeared. Not just our waitress...whoever was there! We have eaten at some of the finest places in Vegas, and yet I was blown away by the people and atmosphere here.   Oh, and the jambalaya  was phenomenal!   Thank you, Recee, for serving us one of the best meals we had in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's fun and quirky and if you're a Forrest Gump movie fan like I am, this is a must stop!  The waitresses will come and play trivia with you and test your movie IQ.  I love all the  movie memorabilia and I always check the clearance section in the store downstairs, you never know what cha gonna get! lol   the only thing is the food is just ok, I don't think I've ever eaten here and wanted more.  but I love the experience! and they do honor the troops by doing events and offering a discount in the store & restaurant.  Gotta love that!"}
{"text":"Overall the food was really good, I was impressed with the food, even though it was pricey. But your in Vegas you have got to eat good food and that costs $$$. Waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"Outstanding, friendly and fast service. My wife and I had the Cajun shrimp appetizer. For dinner we had the shrimp pasta with capers. It was outstanding. We ate every bite. We also had a few beers.  Our server even offered us to go cups for our beer. Gotta love Vegas."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner since we wanted some seafood for dinner.  Parking was hard to find but that's everywhere along the strip.  The restaurant was easy to find thanks to Yelp.  Upon arriving at the restaurant the line was fairly long.  We just sat at the bar so we didn't have to wait to be seated.    Upon sitting the bartender was very knowledgeable of the menu and drinks came fairly quickly.  We ordered the Run Across America Sampler for our appetizer which included the Bubba's Far Out Dip and Chips, Chilled Peel 'n' Eat Shrimp, Spicy Chicken Strips, Seafood Hush Pups and Mama Blue's Fried Shrimp.  The Spicy Chicken Strips were great.  My girl liked the shrimp on the appetizer.  Overall, being from New Orleans I have had better fried shrimp.  For our entree, we ordered the Soup & Salad Combo which was a house salad with Gumbo and the Shrimp Po' Boy which consisted of a Fresh Toasted Baguette stuffed with warm, hand breaded  Shrimp, Tomatoes, Lettuce, Pickles & Mayo, Served with Fries.  The food came out quick and that was a huge plus saying that it was packed.   The food was ok.  The shrimp Po-Boy could have had more seasoning to make the food more enjoyable.  I have had better.  My lady didn't like her salad and she said the gumbo wasn't good.  Overall, this restaurant was ok.  Would have gave them a 1 if it wasn't for the service.  Probably wont be attending this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Ummm half empty restaurant and we walk in with a party of five asking to eat appetizers and drink. They said sorry the patio is only for people who eat food. As the saying goes, \"stupid is as stupid does\". Happy 50th birthday to me. Just not at this place.  We ended up at another patio and dropped about $250. They welcomed us with open arms."}
{"text":"I hate to give a bad review but there is simply nothing much to brag about I've tried this location 3 times and only came back for the second and third time hoping that it would get better but it just doesnt do anything for you right, the food isn't very well seasoned the only  only thing that's worth even bragging about is the strawberry shortcake everything else is just plain humdrum nothing special doesn't leap out at you it has a name & catchy touristy gimmicks but other than that it's not worth the price"}
{"text":"My boyfriend has had Bubba Gump in California before & wanted me to try it. I was not disappointed! We were greeted and seated right away. We ate on the balcony/patio overlooking the strip, which made for a lovely view. They had heat lamps on to keep the guests warm outside. Our server, Jon, was friendly, attentive, and quick (without making you feel rushed). I ordered a pineapple margarita and my partner ordered the frozen mango margarita. They were delicious. For entrees, I had the shrimp po boy, which had a ton of shrimp & a generous portion of fries. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp scampi, which was served with a piece of garlic bread & smelled heavenly. I wish we had room for dessert! At the end of the meal, our server told us that we get a free gift because we ordered a frozen margarita. We went downstairs to the merchandise area of the restaurant and were given a Bubba Gump shaker. Awesome! If you love seafood & great service, come to Bubba Gump's!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, shrimp boaten captain extraordinary.  I can't wait to go back.  The Shrimp Heavener is heavenly."}
{"text":"The shrimp here was average. I went with a healthier option on the menu and did not get my shrimp fried, I got the kabobs. There was nothing special about the dish BUT the shrimp were cooked properly. I would go back here and try something different. Also great decor from Forest Gump!!!"}
{"text":"Sam: our waiter is amazing! Super sweet and friendly young man. Very informative on not only the restaurant but Vegas itself. The food on the other hand was the worse Bubba Gump I've been to. My husband's dish has so much Cajun seasoning we had to use a napkin to wipe off the excess in order to eat it. My shrimp po boy was nothing to write home about nor the spinach artichoke dip. Kudos to the bar tender and Sam only"}
{"text":"While Forrest Gump may be one of my favorite movies, this spot is not one of my favorite places to eat. I got my order to go, the seafood platter and everything tasted overly salty, like the batter was made that way. The dipping sauces that came with it were too spicy for my taste, so the too spicy too salty combo guaranteed the hotel sold some extra bottles of over priced water that night. Maybe I just caught a bad night, so I'm giving it a three star chance since it seemed to have some promise. ...meh"}
{"text":"I love shrimp,  so when my husband suggested Bubba Gump, I was surprised.  We decided to make a u-turn on the Vegas strip and get SOME SHRIMP....   As you walk in your in a novelty store with lots of Forrest Gump paraphernalia.  It's like being on a movie set. This is fun.....   You walk upstairs and their are more items all on the wall, hanging from the celling.... this is so cool.  As we are seated on the table, their are questions and answers about the movie.  I wanna play...  Our waiter was a bubble guy named Charles. He appeared with a warm smile and  trivia questions. I don't think I'm ready. LoL...  First questions, nope I didn't know the answer let's just say I needed to see Forrest Gump again...  Now it's time for lunch... I ordered the filet in a garlic butter sauce. Wow....delicious! I was truly surprised that I enjoyed it that much.    Dessert was banana bread.... HELL NO.... dont do it! It was watery and mushy.  Listen not everything is worth the money this is one banana bread I wouldn't order again, ever.   The waiter was so nice he removed the banana bread from our bill, so I decided to make his tip worth it.    All in all its a fun place to walk down Forrest Gump memory lane. I would give this place another shot....."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to eat here and it was the worst decision ever, I order a jumbo shrimpers net catch. I first noticed it had no sauce, and when I took the first bite, the shrimp felt dried and it tasted a bit odd, \"not like Cajun\" I ignored it but almost halfway I had to stopped because I was just in shocked of how flavorless it tasted. When I got up from that seat I felt a bit weird, so as I was heading towards the parking lot, it hit me, \"did I just get food poisoned\" next thing I know I'm on my knees puking everything. Worst place I have visited and I have never gotten food poisoning. They don't deserve a single star."}
{"text":"Fast perfekt :)   Mit hungrigem Mägen Warteten wir ungeduldig in der Warteschlange ,die recht zügig voran kam ...  Endlich an unseren Platz (leider mitten im Gang) war David direkt da...der Herrgott unter den Scampis  (nein er war einfach schnell und wir hatten Hunger )  Top Service !!!  Es gab Pasta mit Meeresfrüchten. für knapp 20 kein Schnäpperchen,aber yummi (!)  So ,wann kommt es nach Deutschland ? Am Besten Hamburg Hafen !"}
{"text":"My server....Tammy...she was awesome sauce!!!  Her demeanor was pleasant.  She had good recommendations.  The girl who sat us down was nice too.  She made suggestions and I tried it...(I can't remember the dish) but it was good & I was pleased.  I wanted shrimp and that's what I got.  It wasn't busy.  We were seated immediately.  I am pleased w/ my visit.  The manager was funny and kind and when I visit Vegas I'll be back!  I bought stuff from the gift shop downstairs...the tall chocolate guy downstairs....very pleasant as well....I'd buy sweatshirts from him any time...   Bad part - the nasty little greeter outside who was picking her nose and face when we came up and offered us a place to eat??  It made me nervous to go inside...and she needs to put that ponytail up in a net too!!"}
{"text":"Each draft beer is $15? Ridiculous! Food was decent... im seriously disappointed... I have eaten in other places in the strip and this is insane"}
{"text":"Coconut Shrimp and Shrimp Mac and Cheese were really good, would defiantly recommend those. The restaurant also has a great view looking over the strip."}
{"text":"Really good service and, well, it's Vegas so everyone's in a pretty good mood.  Wasn't crazy about the food but it's what they advertised.  Fair is fair."}
{"text":"The theme of Bubba Gump is from the Forrest Gump movie - our server told us to flip the sign to get other waiters/waitresses' attention, cute concept. Speaking of our server, BIG shout out to you, Shan! He gave us great recommendations for places to go, things to do in LV - so helpful, thank you! :)  MANGO SHAKER [No-alchy] So yummy! Since it was like a sauna outside, this drink was thrist-quenching. Tasted like a mango soda.  FORREST'S SEAFOOD FEAST (Hand Breaded Southern Fried Shrimp, Seafood Hush Pups, Fish & Chips) Loved the shrimp.. was very delicious - especially if you add the tartar sauce with it! (sauce boss here..)  SHRIMP + FISH + SKEWER [I can't remember the name they had on the menu -_-] The title says it all. The shrimps were once again marinated deliciously! Comparing the two mains that we've ordered, I'd prefer the fried foods :P"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here, so wasn't sure what to expect. Service was a little slow for it not to be crowded. I orederd appetizers as my main meal, and it came out cold. New order still wasn't as hot as I like, and food was just OK. Not sure if I'll go back."}
{"text":"This was not a great experience. The service was solid, but nothing special. The food was lacking. The jambalaya was worse than cheesecake factory. The salads did not have fresh ingredients. Also. Lt. Dan's sausage dish was small. Nothing was really filling."}
{"text":"Stopped at this Bubba Gump location for lunch my first day in Vegas. For a table 6, we were seated quickly. We had a awesome waitress, told us little about Vegas. We had visited a Bubba Gump before so we knew what to order. Shared seafood platter, bowl of gumbo and buckets of shrimp. Drink specials was good. Nice clean restroom. Nice view of the strip, we were seated right across from Crystal Shops."}
{"text":"The food was just what you expect from a Bubba Gumps, but what was really great about this location was the service. I had one of the best waiters I have ever had! Hopefully all the staff is like him. Quick service as well."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally try Bubba Gumps finally. We ordered two appetizers. They were terrible. The spinach dip should say that it is mostly onions. It was awful. And the hush puppies weren't hot enough and they were just okay. We had the bucket of shrimp and fish. It was okay, but nothing to write home about and it won't bring us back. Our water was great and doing his best."}
{"text":"Everyone was sooo friendly. From the gentleman at the front door who answered all our questions, to the employees we met on our way up.  We were sat right away and our server was awesome and provided us with great service, I just wish I remembered his name.  The food was excellent as well. Between four of us we had a little bit of everything, shrimp scampi pasta, mahi mahi, BBQ ribs with fries and a burger.  All was delicious.  If I am ever in town again, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is just so, so. Service was good. Chain restaurant food that is just nothing special. It tastes and looks the same wherever you find this restaurant."}
{"text":"Stop Forrest, stop. I have somehow amassed a ridiculous amount of Bubba Gump glassware over the years. My one goal going in here was to leave without another one.   If they can train a bit more and improve on their accuracy, I know this place could move up to a 4 or 5 star.  My daughter insisted that we dine here, so she could get their hush pups. We were seated instantly. Most importantly and first thing, my daughter excitedly requested hush pups.  I selected a glass of Pinot Grigio for $8 and my daughter wanted to try the Blue Hawaiian at $15. Average drink prices for the strip.   After our drinks arrived, we made our dinner selections. We were told our hush pups would be out shortly.   Our food was served after awhile, still no hush pups.  Our server apologized and said our pups went to the wrong table and they would make some more. At that point, I wanted to cancel them but my daughters puppy dog eyes wouldn't let me.   My clam chowder was pretty good, served with a very basic green salad. My daughter said her shrimp po boy was average.   A server tried to deliver some sort of shrimp tower to our table that we didn't order.   Stop Forrest, stop.  Then, after another 10 minutes or so, our hush pups landed. My daughter was full from her drink + dinner, she ate...  one. It was gummy inside. Sigh.  No offer to take it off the bill for us.   We were handed a receipt and told to turn it in downstairs for a souvenir glass. Oi"}
{"text":"First time at a Bubba Gumps. Won't be the last. The cajun flavor added was delish. Staff was super friendly. When you flip your sign for something, they are there so fast-its like magic."}
{"text":"The staff was very attentive and engaging after the little incident.  Food was awesome! Drinks crazy good."}
{"text":"the food is good, & the service is EXCELLENT! our server stephen went above and beyond his job!! HE kept us entertain while waiting for our food to arrive...(which didn't take that long)   it's my mom's birthday.. aside from the desert we ordered, they gave us something on the house too as well!!   the manager checked in on us if we are having  a good time. I'm telling you guys, if you want a good food, and service matters to you. check this place out! it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Had to send the food back because it was cold, however the manager was extremely helpful.  The Forrest Gump trivia was funny, so brush up on your Forrest Gump trivia.  I didn't realize I know so much about the movie."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Similar to the Orlando location but more spacious which gives it more of a cafeteria look and feel. While their food can be fun to eat, they fall short on healthy choices at all locations, so not unique to this one. Doubt we will be going back because of that. But if you like fried stuff and are looking for a low key place, it's not bad."}
{"text":"The food is not seasoned. Not even close to edible. One star is too many I would give none. I am from the south with no high blood pressure and not over weight. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been to two bubba Gump locations one in New York and one in city walk both have been great. So my boyfriend and I were in the mood for shrimp after going to a day club when we spotted  bubba gump. The food was delicious and it really satisfied our cravings. The Cajun shrimp and shrimp Mac and cheese was delicious. The plate with corn, sausage and shrimp was really good as well."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Bubba Gumps but I would have to say, this location was my favorite!!!   We first wanted to sit outside on patio  and let me tell you... the view of the strip at night was so breath taking. Before we could order, it got a little windy and asked if we can go inside.   Our server was GREAT. She sat us inside and it was way bigger than the other bubba Gumps I've been too. This location is great for big parties.   Our food tasted fresh and very yummy! I can't wait to go back!   O-yeah and since I came in to celebrate my birthday, the whole staff surprised me with free ice cream and sang happy birthday.  I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I don't even remember the meal. It's Vegas FFS. The waiter was awesome though, and I wish I was a billionaire, so I could afford to tip that dude. They gave us 2 free glasses after the meal, which instantly won me over. Cool place. Go here if you're looking for some fishy fishy . BTW I did tip the waiter... 15%, which is a decent sum IMO"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and ordered the heavenly shrimp and it was just okay nothing to really write home about! The service was okay, our waiter had a really thick accent so it was hard to understand what she was saying at times. The food was okay it was just your normal fried shrimp and fries. I wasn't all that impressed!"}
{"text":"First time at Bubba Gumps and it was quite an experience. I really enjoyed it, surprisingly. They have a ton of chachski on the walls.. You never know quite where to look but the staff is exceptional. We had a small wait and to keep the patrons from getting antsy they quiz you on Forrest Gump trivia. I'm a quiz/puzzle person so personally I had a bunch of fun.  I felt their pricing was a bit over charged but its on the heart of the strip so its too be expected but otherwise.. all was good.. If they had a more convenient location I could see myself as a local going more. The food wasn't bad not was it exceptional so it isn't a restaurant I would go out of my way for but if im in the area again, i'd go back..."}
{"text":"Having lunch at Bubba Gump in Vegas! Awesome people specially Jason our server. He is friendly and hospitable."}
{"text":"Decided to try them and was a big let down. Ordered the Shrimper's Net Catch made with the secret cajun spice recipe for the app and the Dumb Luck Coconut Shrimp as the main. The main came out long before the app and it was a bland soggy mess. The coconut shrimp was ok and definitely not live up to the Bubba Gump reputation! My wife had the Old Fashion New England Clam Chowder and salad. She didn't even finish the clam chowder because it was so bland and not tasty at all. Got a 10% discount because of the snafu of getting the main before the app, but we will definitely not be coming back to this location. May give another location an opportunity for redemption in the future."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever to this restaurant. The food was okay. I had the Shrimp Po Boy sandwich. I wasn't to keen on the fact the sandwich came with mayo (which I had withheld) and I couldn't replace that with a different sauce. The bread was kind of thick, which I didn't care too much for. I asked the server if I could just get popcorn shrimp with fries and he dryly replied \"no\". The drinks are good, but for $14 you would make out like a bandit at the Rock Bar or Evening Call size wise. The server never said his name, which was the first step to informing me the service wouldn't be superior or close to it. I saw him sitting in a booth with two of his other female customers as cozy as ever. Yeah, no bueno. If I try this place again, they'll have to drag me there."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a Bubba Gump Shrimp Co restaurant open its doors here in Las Vegas. I've been to the one in Long Beach, Monterey and San Francisco so finally I got to check this one off the list.  Lots of walking to get here-it's located inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino near the shops with an outdoor patio as an option for dining. Not convenient for locals who have to park and walkkkkkkkkkk.  We were seated right away and our waitress was very cheery and service was great.  I love using the signs at the table so you can easily flag a server down when you flip the sign over to STOP.  We had three servers stop at once-so service was perfect.  A nice kids menu offered favorites like pizza, hamburgers, macaroni and cheese and of course shrimp.  We started off with a refreshing margarita which my only complaint was the small glass that it was served in.  It took a while to get the drink at a perfect cold temperature.  I ordered a variety of shrimp...boiled, coconut and panko fried.  It came with a few different sauces (cocktail, sweet and sour, teriyaki).  Shrimp was cooked perfect and it was a yummy comfort food indulgence.  The shrimp macaroni and cheese was also on item we ordered and it had a nice smoky flavor.  Really good!  The hubby ordered the tilapia and it was served with creamy mashed potatoes and spinach.  Overall I don't think I'll be running back just because of the convenience factor.  Off the strip the elevators and escalators were both not working so if you're on crutches or a cast, or just getting over a foot injury like I am it doesn't really make it easy to get to."}
{"text":"Great location! Just walk up the link bridge btw Cosmo and planet Hollywood there it is. Friendly waitress and once a while will play trivia about forest gump while we waiting for our food to come. Highly recommend shrimp heaven baskets! 4 ways shrimp with crispy flavorful fries, suitable for seafood lover like me."}
{"text":"Ate here last night, we were seated immediately and decided to sit outside to people watch those along the Las Vegas strip. The waiter was pleasant and everything went smooth. I enjoyed my choice of fish, shrimp and jasmine rice which was all in a tasty sauce. My husband had mashed potatoes, fried chicken and corn on the cob. He said he has had better but nonetheless, I was pleased."}
{"text":"The girls had to eat here just to say they did, it was on the bucket list of places to eat , I really love the location and the atmosphere , the adults ate at the steak house the girls wanted bubba gumps , but overall the experience was great"}
{"text":"Great service!  We got to sit out on the patio overlooking Las Vegas Boulevard.   Reasonable prices and no wait.  The calamari was REALLY delicious.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Family with teens ate here.  Food was great.  Server, Cat, was super.  Each of us picked a different dessert and tried each of them.  They were amazing.   Wish we had a Bubba Gump near where we live.  We try to eat at Bubba Gump when on vacation where one is near."}
{"text":"The food was good the service not really, why use a system with plates when the employes don't care at all, I switch to red plate and after over 10 minutes some show off to take care, draft beer in plastic glass no bueno"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice. View of strip is amazing if you sit on the balcony. Food is good for the  $$, but the service was horrible. Probably won't be going back to this one."}
{"text":"First time here and I already love it! I had an appetizer called the shrimp net catch and got half Cajun seasoning and half of their own special seasoning. It was fun and delicious to peel the shrimp. However, the Cajun flavor lacked the spiciness of other Cajun seasonings I have previously tried. I also got a linguine pasta with capers which added a lot of flavor, topped with shrimp. Though it was a bit oily, I would definitely recommend it. Seafood wasn't my favorite, but this place made me love it! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Usually love Bubba Gumps but NOT this location. We were there on 3/5. We sat for 15 minutes in a restaurant that was not even half full (1:30pm). Not a single person came by to even offer water or take drink orders let alone take our meal order. Others were seated and waited upon. They literally walked around us to the other tables. It was as though we were invisible. After 15 min we asked for the mgr, told him what happened and left. Spoiled it for us to ever go to another Bubba Gumps.   Even 1 star is too generous but have to rate it something to get it published."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere but it's all novelty. Waitstaff was great, got in quickly. Was funny when our plates came out and there was only 1 shrimp on the plate, not sure how that made it out to us like that but I have to admit it was funny. Waiter quickly fixed it and brought out the rest of the shrimp, haha still makes me laugh thinking about it. Was a little strange but hey like I said it's novelty."}
{"text":"Been to this place twice in one day, only because Krystian was a great waiter, and my water had the lemon I asked for.. other than that it was an okay experience.  The peel and eat shrimp had the smaller shrimp size, that sucked.... the garlic sauce sucked, it had this sweet sort of sugary taste to it, and the Cajun sauce was weird too, I can't really explain it, however it was not the old bay type of taste I expected. The shrimp PoBoy was more bread and sauce than shrimp and bread. Basic.... honestly the good thing that I liked about this spot other than my water with lemon had to be the fries that came with the PoBoy and the garlic bread that my waiter asked me if I wanted and me saying \"yes\", not knowing I was going to actually have to pay for it. But welcome to Vegas people! Lol, oh and 3 stars are for the price, if my shrimp was bigger with better sauce it would've been 4 stars...."}
{"text":"Food was ok, not as great as the one in Anaheim. Service was ok, nothing great. Went unnoticed for about 10mins until someone approached us to take out order. Food was dry and salty but eatable again nothing spectacular. Probably won't come here again."}
{"text":"My order: gumbo (so good-flavorful)  PROs: +FOOD: very delicious food. Inexpensive drinks. Sometimes you get to keep the cup:) + DECOR: Loved the bubba gump merchandise and decorations. They were adorable. I'm usually not one for franchised restaurants but this one in particular was done very well.  + SERVICE: Amazing. I loved that they have movie themed signs which direct the waiter's attention your way. How nifty!   CONs: - there are no bubba gumps in the east side!!! Come to Toronto, NYC or even Niagara Falls :(   Gotta love bubba gump. I will be back here the first chance I get ;)"}
{"text":"Love the food and the sexy service, i will total be eatting here again when i come back to Vegas"}
{"text":"Si vas de noche pide una mesa exterior para que disfrutes de la vista al Strip mientras comes tu comida. Bubba Gump Shrimp como siempre delicioso!.\""}
{"text":"For me good as any other location. Staff friendly. Only issue is that it's difficult to find."}
{"text":"Ok Ok, at first I was bummed about going to a \"chain\" restaurant in Vegas but I was wrong, it was pretty darn awesome!  I'm a tourist, I bought the Las Vegas Bubba Gump glass my drink came in, it came with a plastic cocktail shaker too!  Ok, onto the food  Fries were Awesome, with the sauces. The Calamari lil soggy. Shrimp Gumbo, Yum! Seafood Paella, Wow! Delicious! PACKED with seafood and packed quite a punch! Spicy! But not too spicy so you can't taste, but pretty close, Mmm! Loved it!  And that drink everyone talked about - Great! Bit sweet but that's to be expected, it's a fruity frozen cocktail. I don't know if I'd run back here given all the other choices in Vegas on and off strip, but i would definitely not be disappointed if this was the chosen dinner venue again."}
{"text":"First visit our server Jessie is awesome. He made excellent recommendations. The drinks are good. The menu presented some interesting food choices. So I ordered the shrimp mac and cheese(tasty), seafood hush pups(tasty), Shrimp New Orleans( over cooked shrimp and the rice tasted like it was old, it was hard and crunchy) I sent it back and my check was adjusted appropriately. The service was so good I gave 4 stars. I would return on my next visit to Vegas & try something new from the menu."}
{"text":"Average food. Average presentation.  Good service. No wow factor. And overpriced. I would consider this a strip tourist destination. No return trip for me."}
{"text":"While visiting LV from California, we were in the mood for some good shrimp and fries. Much to our delight, this Bubba Gump's location was just as good as the San Francisco one, which is excellent. Good service, good food and decent prices (especially for the Strip). It's a MUST."}
{"text":"Our waitress was AMAZING. Her name was  KEISHA. She got us drinks quickly and the food was amazing. No wait at all and she even quizzed us about Forest Gump the movie. Awesome service from all the staff. Great atmosphere and decent prices for the amount of food you get. Definitly recommend."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if possible. Very first night in Vegas we stopped in this place. Hostess was incredibly rude, just dumped us off at a table without saying anything at all. Apparently she never told anyone she seated us. No one came to get our order for 15 minutes. Then a waiter who was not ours finally came up and said he saw us just sitting there so he came to take our order. We told him how long we had been waiting and he said he would get the manager. Waited 10 more minutes and still no one showed up. No manager. No drinks. Nothing. They were not even busy. We left without anyone ever acknowledging we were there. Worst restaurant experience of my life. Would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Every times I visit a new city I make it my business to eat at a Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. Every experience is usually pleasant and having me desiring my next experience. Well my visit to Bubba Gump in Las Vegas in April was the worst that I've experienced. Normally, their warm hospitable experience is consistent nationwide. Well this experience started with being set and not being greeted by our server for 15 mins. Upon experiencing it to our serve Matthew, he said \"owww, I didn't know.\" We decided to talk to a manager and all the manager Bud said was, \"let's see if we can speed it up.\" It took an additional 30 min for my food to arrive to the table, after being told by a support staff that my food had been dropped on the floor. When my food finally arrives it's cold and I'm left to deal with it. I boxed my food up to take back to my room. I felt that there would be no help if I requested a manager, so I simply sucked it up and took my cold food back to the room. I would not recommend eating at this location. Not the true experience that I have come to expect from a company that I love."}
{"text":"This is my favorite theme restaurant everywhere- been to the Oahu (the most visited one), Maui, Anaheim, and San Francisco locations, and finally here! I was wondering when one of these would come to town- what took so long?! I'm a Landry Select Club member, so I can easily rack up more points for rewards (spend $250, get $25 in card credit).   This one is located next to the Miracle Mile Shops, so here are your options: park at Valet at Todai or park at the Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops parking garage- enter the shopping center but exit out of the Todai side, and take the escalators or in our case, the elevator- we're parents now, so we're pushing a stroller. From here, a host will direct you. You will go through the store, into the elevator and up to the 3rd floor. From here, the host will seat you. It wasn't that busy, for lunch on a saturday, but then again, it's still new.   New, clean, featuring memorabilia from the movie, seems a little smaller compared to the other locations, but the ambiance feature is this one is overlooking the popular Strip. There were some patrons outside, but it was too cold for us, plus, our two-month old baby. There were some tables  with chairs and booths (the booth was too small for us- we had a stroller). I can't comment on the bathrooms since I didn't leave the table.   On to the food, the \"Run Across America Sampler\"- hush puppies, artichoke dip and chips, spicy chicken, fried shrimp, and peel 'n eat shrimp, is our absolute favorite. The price was $15.99, slightly higher than the last time but maybe the prices have gone up since then (last year- Oahu). This one never disappoints- we always split it. My husband really loves the hush puppies, it's his favorite. Mine is probably the chicken. I got the strawberry speckled lemonade at $5.99- refills are 99 cents. (Similar to Red Robin's lemonade.) The Ice Cream Caramel Spice Cake was phenomenal! This was $8.99, but well worth it. We've had the other ones in the past-  the bread pudding, strawberry shortcake, and the cookie sundae, but this one is specific to Las Vegas- it's new. I'm pretty sure we are getting this dessert again. It seems like a seasonal flavor combination, but really, you could have this all-year round. The server was really nice, and the service was pretty good, too. We got to ask the server questions about the movie. The manager stopped by to see how we were doing. He even changed out my wobbly chair.   My husband thinks that this takes away from when we go out of town, because we always include this place in our must-haves/must-eats, but I really like that it is finally here, where we live. I hope that this place does well. Las Vegas and certain restaurants do not always mesh (except mexican restaurants seem to pop up when space opens up). And I intend on getting a shirt at some point, even though I live here. We were pretty stuffed and needed to walk around the mall to get a little more comfortable."}
{"text":"I loved the theme of this restaurant, as a big fan of the movie Forest Gump I marveled when I walked in and felt I was on the boat they used to capture all those shrimps.   The service at this restaurant was great and everything we tried at this restaurant was of great quality.   I'm a big fan of sea food and if you are too ten definitely try this restaurant and get their halibut. We will definitely go back to this place. They all so have a fried combo basket with shrimp and fries which was amazing. As always I added the pics, so try this place and enjoy the fresh sea food, you won't be disappointed.  Also it's not extremely pricey as some of the joint in Vegas can be."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  We were out one night on the strip and needed some place to eat. In our family we are all fans of seafood. I am personally a fan of Forrest Gump so this was a natural choice. As you walk in there is movie memorabilia everywhere. It makes you feel as though the events, and characters in the movie are real. It's a lot of fun. They have an awesome balcony area that overlooks the strip, or you can dine inside. Everything as far as food is fantastic. I can't elaborate on it too much because their really isn't any other way to put it. We were very pleased with everything. The service was awesome. Everyone involved was super friendly and attentive. One thing that we loved about this restaurant was that they have a little sign that you can flip when you need service. Then anyone walking by will stop and help you. It's awesome and super efficient."}
{"text":"The food was ok here. If you are a seafood lover this is not the place to come to. It wont be as good as you would expect a shrimp restaurant to be. I thought the kids meals were pretty cool though. The price here is ridiculous. Probably because they are on the strip. They had seating outside on a balcony which I would have liked to sit at but I had 3 kids with me so that wasn't really an option."}
{"text":"Closest parking is in Planet Hollywood. Too bad you have to walk all the way through Miracle Mile and then around the outside of PH and up the stairs, since the elevator was down, to get to it. There is a Walgreens close by that may let you park there, but I was not able to confirm that. I had the grilled seafood trio. My friend had the shrimp combo with grilled shrimp, tempura and coconut shrimp. Our server was very nice and attentive and had some funny trivia to ask. I don't like how they ask you to buy their gift card for all the other bubba gump's in the US. It seems like they have to go through their whole sales pitch before leaving. I would prefer if they said \"Hey check out this pamphlet it explains our gift card, let me know if you want to purchase!\" I am a local and it seems like the majority of the people were tourists. I had a good time. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Really can't comment on the food here... But I can comment on the service around 4:30 pm on 7/16/16... Would give a half star if I could and that would be only for the girl that greeted us...  It was FUC'n horrible!!! We walked up, we were sat down next to the windows on the strip, and handed menus. And we sat. And then we sat some more. And then even more. Damn near 20 minutes of this $hit went on. Servers, (and when I say servers, I mean 4-5 at a minimum), walked by us, more than once, clearly saw our menus, (either open or after we had \"made our choices\", closed on the table top), without glasses of water in 105 degree heat. And not even a single one of them said absolutely anything to us like \"Oh have you been helped\"? \"Would you like a glass of water\"? \"You're butt FUC'n ugly\"... Something... Anything!!! THE only reason we waited as long as we did was because we were famished and felt like some Bubba Gump... We love the Shoreline Village location in the LBC.  Now, I have never been in the business of serving folks in a restaurant, or waiting tables for that matter, (unless you want to count working at Jack-in-the-Box as a teen), BUT I will say one thing... If I DID work in a joint like Bubba Gump AND saw patrons sitting for even 5 minutes without water, I would do one of two things:  1). Either offer them water, and get it to them myself, (even if it wasn't my table), or; 2). Tell the lame ass who WAS responsible for that table / area to get their $hit together and tend to their customers.  The place wasn't really even that busy.  Will never, EVER, waste my time and give that Hell Hole a shot at my dolla again."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular at all.....  First after being seated for about 20 minutes we were finally greeted by our server who had walked past us several times already. We were then advised if we needed her assistance we needed to have the sign on red. Okay... How were we supposed to know. The food IMHO was okay but a bit expensive for what you get on your plate... The tea and fountain drinks were horrible as well...."}
{"text":"Ok so! It was my brother in laws 30th birthday and I had never been to this restaurant and was so excited to try it! It was freezing cold outside and the strip was so so busy! It took us forever to find a parking spot which is fine we grew up here in Vegas so we are used to it but then walking through the entire casino/strip in the freezing cold it took us a good 45 minutes to locate the restaurant from the car. We were so incredibly excited when we saw the sign and realized that we were so close to some yummy shrimp and I was so excited to try this restaurant that everyone raves about, although it wasn't on a pier I was still super excited. The restaurant was due to close at 1am and we got there at 12:25, we had called earlier that day and asked if getting there by 12:30 would be okay because my husbands shift was not over until 11:30. We got there and the greeters immediately. with no smile at all, said we are closed. I actually laughed because I thought she was joking when she said that they were closed. Her face did not change so I know she was serious and we had just wasted all of our time, I asked her I thought you guys don't close until 1? and we even called and whoever we spoke with said it would be fine. She said \"yeah we decided to close early tonight\" She literally looked satisfied with disappointing me. I work in customer service and this is not okay. You are a business, and at that a BRAND NEW business on the strip! You cant just decided to close early unless an emergency and she said nothing of the sort. I really just couldn't believe that had just happened. Disappointed and doing everything possible to keep my mouth shut and keep my anger inside, we just walked away. There was also a gentlemen there too and he said \"Come back and see us again soon\" and again I laughed! I had such a ad experience that I honestly would rather drive 5 hours to the one in Santa Monica then go to this one!"}
{"text":"Went here on a very nice day so we decided to sit outside. The patio view of the strip is awesome. What bothered me a little was how sticky the table was and the food was okay. I had the appetizer sampler that came with chips and dip (hardly ate it), buffalo chicken bites (alright), peel and eat shrimp (very bland), and fried shrimp which could of used a little more seasoning. My boyfriend had the lieutenant Dan's shrimp and that had well seasoned grilled shrimp. Overall, okay. Better shrimp at Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Bubba Gump shrimp is great. They have delicious varities of shrimp. Ribs are delicious, good drinks, friendly staff, great environment. yea buddy."}
{"text":"I live in the SF bay area but oddly enough I've never been to Bubba Gumps in our area. We were getting desperate and everything had a pretty long wait so we peeked in and there was no wait. The elevator was broken but one of their staff members helped us carry our stroller up the stairs. I got a seafood entre and the honey got ribs. He said the ribs were amazing. Mine was tasty but small portions. Our waiter was sweet. He checked on us constantly to ensure we were happy."}
{"text":"Ok this place is ok, just ok. The food is fine and the servers are very friendly. So here is what happened, the last tin=me I was there, there was a table of people clearly from their corporate office. All the staff were falling all over each other to wait on them hand and foot. The problem was that it was at the expense of the paying customers! (Yes I know all about the Stop Forest Thing) know let me be clear, I put the blame on the corporate people for fostering a culture where the staff felt they had to act like that. If the corporate people were there to check out the restaurant they should have lifted their heads out of their plates for 2 seconds and view the sight of all of the servers at their table and nowhere else. So stop there if you must but if you see a large table full of people with the entire wait staff around them: Run Forest Run! Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"I'm not normally a big fan of chains, but I have to admit that I liked this restaurant. The theme is pretty cool if you've seen Forrest Gump and it's fun when they come around and ask trivia questions from the movie. The hushpuppies are my favorite item because they have seafood in them. I had the Shrimp New Orleans which was very tasty with the perfect amount of seasoning and tasty sauce. The portion was very generous as well. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the chocolate chip cookie sundae because it didn't have a rich chocolate chip cookie taste. If you must get it at least share with someone else because it was way too much dessert for one person. They also have a cool gift shop with Forrest Gump merchandise."}
{"text":"The food was good, and the server got an A for effort. He was sweet, but he seemed a inexperienced. They do offer military discounts! A big plus was the bathrooms were really clean! Always good to find a clean bathroom in such a high traffic place."}
{"text":"We got the soup/salad combo (around $12), New Entree Catch, Coconut Shrimp and the Jambalaya dish; the latter three dishes were around $17-20 each. The presentation of the dishes had us salivating, but the food was just not it. It lacked flavor and freshness.   I personally love the movie \"Forrest Gump\", so I was really excited to try out this restaurant. But, the food fell way below my expectations. I don't know if it was just an off day for the chefs, but all the dishes were mediocre.   The restaurant is located on the second floor. You have to go up through the Bubba Gump merchandise store on the first floor to get to the restaurant. There wasn't much of a wait. We went on a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Always has great shrimp but the reason I'm giving this 5 stars is our waiter. I believe his name was Charles or Charlie? He was an Asian guy. I want to be specific because he was absolutely fantastic. I wish I remembered his name because it was some of the best customer service. He checked in frequently, very nice, seemed nervous, and very apologetic when he forgot something or the wait. I payed with a gift card from my work that covered my meal but I wasn't able to tip. I didn't have cash and he didn't take my card. We tried waiting there for at least 15-20 min, we asked someone if they could find him, but after a while we left. If anyone sees this and knows who I'm talking about, I'm so sorry. You deserved the best tip. Thank you so much. You were fantastic. If we ever come back I hope you're our waiter again."}
{"text":"Came here to try the place for the first time.  I was disappointed in myself that I didn't get the reference to Forrest Gump right away...  I gave this place a 4 star because the food was amazing.  Each of the shrimp had a different texture.  Out of all the dishes though, the Jambalya was the best dish.  I like the amount of shrimp they provide as well.  I would have given the place a 5 star if not for the service.  The service was amazing before the food came, but as soon as food was on our table, we were just ignored.  We even tried to make sure to have the sign to indicate we needed service.  F.Y.I. They have a sign that indicates to \"any\" worker that you need service.  Our server said any worker will come and assist us, but in the end it was only that one server who kept coming.  I don't know why they say that any person will come and help when they clearly won't.  We had 2 or 3 workers not even turn an eye towards our table even when we needed help.  The only real downfall of this experience."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to try this place as \"Forrest Gump\" is one of our favorite movie.  We went there for dinner and although they were slightly busy, we were seated immediately.  Our waiter, Terry, gave us the menu and took our drink order right away.  We ordered the calamari and shrimp appetizers first.  The calamari was really good but the portion was not that much, the shrimp, however was of decent size.  We didn't wait long and our main entrees arrived.  The food was really great.  The staff were friendly and the place clean.  A lot of Forrest Gump memorabilia hung on the walls.  Terry was great, our empty plates were cleared immediately and he'd ask if everything was okay.  When we were all done eating,  we played a trivia about the movie, of course we answered all the questions correctly. Our overall experience at the restaurant is A+++.  We went to the gift shop afterwards and purchased some souvenirs .  The young lady who helped us was great and friendly as well. We will definitely eat at this place again and would recommend it to friends and family."}
{"text":"We were at Bubba Gump on July 3, 2014.  I thought it was pricey.  I think I paid $17 for a Creole shrimp dish but it was yummy!!  The service was excellent  and they were very nice.  If I go back to Vegas I would go there again."}
{"text":"First timer. Great Food! Got a bucket of shrimp that was delicious! Very noisy. Ordered a rum and coke from the bar and it was basically a cup full of ice. A little pricey. I was considering giving this place 3 stars but the shrimp was sooo damn good."}
{"text":"There is a true lack of customer service and tact at this restaurant.   We had an issue and asked to speak to a manager. Bud Koelle came to our table. We were using our golden nugget comps from Atlantic City. He said the system was unable to process the transaction.   I asked if he could call the property.  His comment was \"I can't and won't call Atlantic City\" I said you don't need to be rude. He said I'm not being rude you are rude.  I said wow so you insult your guest also. I handed him my credit card.   I noticed Bud Koelle copying information from my credit card.  I confronted him about this he said he was writing my name down I asked for my card back and he said he had not run the card yet.  It seems to be a security risk when an employee copies information from your credit card.   I have no clue what he was writing down.     I received a one question survey and comment box about my visit in an email.  I was truthful in my survey and received a phone call from the restaurant Asking me to change my score.  I was told that my score was based on my server and not management.   I was told that if I didn't change my score my survey would go into the servers file even though I had no issue with the server."}
{"text":"Me and my daughter went last night and the food was ok the service was different but what got me was they charged for drink refills !! Really?? It's not like its a cheap place to eat let's just say I won't be going back anytime soon maybe never"}
{"text":"Alright drinks, good food & awesome bartender! Never been here before so wanted to try something new in Vegas. Menu has alot of options. I ordered the shrimp stuffed with crab and it was pretty good. Even the jasmine rice was delicious. My husband ordered the Catch entree and that was delicious! Well worth the $25! I ordered 2 diff mixed drinks and they both were weak :( My husband ordered the Metal margarita and that was weak too. The bartender Andrew started to chat with us for a while and he later made my husband a stronger margarita and that was a hit! Andrew kept checking up on us and chatting with us about everything so this made our dinner so much better. Taking off a star for the drinks being so expensive and weak but definitely worth trying out!"}
{"text":"Good food and service. Very dependable although missed the trivia questions by server."}
{"text":"Before going to Bubba Gump, we read reviews to see how the food and service was. There were all sorts of reviews from five stars to one. We decided to go for it and we went. We sat on the balcony over looking the Las Vegas strip. Our server Charles attended to us. We had a great time and the food was delicious. We plan to go again in the near future. Don't forget to ask for Charles"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting! I ordered one of their most popular dishes (shrimp New Orleans)  gross! It had a taste of dirt! I took my family here for their first time in Vegas and honestly I think there are much better places at a  fraction of the price! I was so disappointed and I wasn't the one paying a nearly $200 Bill."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! We had the peel and eat (spicy) shrimp... OMG!!! I wanted to eat my fingers because they had that sauce on them!!! Soooo yummy!!! We also got the cocktails that came with the souvenir glasses, a good deal... And I was in a weird mood for a cheeseburger.... One of the best burgers I can remember having!!! Great food and drinks, great service, great location and great ambiance!    Go, go, go!!!  OR 'Run, (insert your name here), RUN!' to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I ate here last night with my family and had a fantastic dining experience!  First off, there are a lot of stairs up to the restaurant (we didn't know at first that we could've taken the escalator from outside). We told one the employees that one of our family members couldn't make it up there that easily. So without hesitation, one of the waiters met us at the Bubba Gumps gift shop and led us to the employee elevator then escorting us past the kitchen (kinda cool to see) to our table.  Loved the vibe of the restaurant plus we had an awesome waiter too. It was cool the waiters play trivia with your table even though I haven't seen the movie myself. I ordered the appetizer, Cajun shrimp with garlic bread, and a side of fries to share. That ended up being the perfect portion size for me. The shrimp was delicious in the garlic sauce especially once you add the hot sauce for some spice! Fries were good as well.  I definitely would recommend this place and will be back!!"}
{"text":"Bubba Gump Shrimp and Co. did not disappoint. The \"Standing O\" cocktail was great, the food was great, and the service was amazing. Our server Colin was very knowledge and gave some great advice for drinks and food. The shrimp Mac and cheese was really good. I am usually very critical of this dish and it satisfied my palette. The Forrest Gump memorabilia was awesome and fun. It is a little pricey, but the food and great service made it worth it.I would definitely return!  PS - correction \"Shrimp Mac and Cheese\"...my pic says lobster"}
{"text":"Great place to eat while in Vegas! It's affordable, service is fun, and the food is pretty good for what it is!  I recommend coming here before the turn up! Go for their popular sampler which has fries, shrimp, and these hush puppy type fried balls. It's legit for $18."}
{"text":"I try to avoid eating at chains while on vacation, but I was in the mood for shrimp for some reason.  No wait. Awesome server who also worked in the bar. Ordered the Coronita Rita. It was so good. Not a fan of the sweetness of margaritas, but the mini Corona really balances out the sweetness. I ended up having 2 of them. Ordered the shrimp New Orleans. Thought it was delicious. Almost went back again during the trip"}
{"text":"The owner emailed and the Manager called me.  Hopefully things will get better.  It has potential, i believe customer service is everything."}
{"text":"I'm familiar with Bubba Gump Shrimp Co., particularly their Makati branch. The decorations and designs are pretty much the same sans the UNLV memorabilia near the bar. Walk past the Miracle Mile shops and Planet Hollywood until you reach the staircase at the intersection (next to the Cosmopolitan if you're on the other side); you will see the BG entrance at the top.  Watermelon Lemonade ($10): Easy, breezy, lemoneezy. The drinks are currently being served in light-up glasses that you can take home with you. I couldn't really taste the watermelon, as it was more tangy and lemony, but it was good. I'd probably order a strawberry lemonade next time, though.  Hush Puppies ($10.29): Chunks of shrimp, fish, and corn mixed, battered, and deep fried served with their house remoulade on the side. Each hush puppy was bite sized and quite flavorful with or without the sauce.  Cup of Gumbo ($5.99): I found the gumbo to be pretty flavorful; you can taste the andouille sausage, shrimp, green onions, and spices all blended together. It isn't too thick, but it was definitely not watery either.   Shrimper's Heaven ($22.99): This was my choice, and I found it to be pretty good. You get four types of shrimp--tempura, golden, coconut, and grilled--with fries in each basket and three sauces--Tangy Asian, Cajun Marmalade, and Zesty Cocktail. Of all the types of shrimp, the grilled one was my least favorite; it is flavorless even with the sauces. Speaking of sauces, the Tangy Asian flavor doesn't stick to the shrimp.   We also ordered a bowl of Clam Chowder ($7.99), Bourbon Street Mahi Mahi ($20.49), Captain's Fish and Chips ($16.99), and Strawberry Lemonade ($5.99/ea and $0.99/refill). I did not try the Mahi Mahi, but it was said to be flavorful. The fish and chips were good--the fish was nice and flaky--but at its price, the serving is too small. As for the clam chowder, it was nothing special; it's not bland, but more of a \"light\" chowder. I forgot her name, but the waitress that was in charge of my group's table was awesome; service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Bubba Gump Shrimp has arrived in Vegas! Last Saturday, I arrived on the Strip to dine in Bubba Gump.        I have been to Bubba Gump Shrimp as a tourist in New Orleans and Chicago. I had been waiting for the grand opening of their Las Vegas vacation. Last Saturday the wait was over.      Bubba Gump Shrimp is located in the new mall that opened up on the northeast corner of Las Vegas Boulevard at Harmon Avenue in the shadow of Planet Hollywood. It is a second level tenant with pedestrian traffic from  two strip pedestrian overpasses. Currently it is easy to find because a lady is advertising it to passersby. At the entrance is the menu. I appreciate it when restaurants have the menu at the entrance. I prefer to have an idea of what I want to order before I step inside a restaurant. Once we decided what to order,entered through the edge of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Gift Shop. The woman greeter nicely directed us upstairs. Once upstairs, we were directed to stand on a cue of circles in a waiting area of the restaurant proper. If you have waited to ride on Disney Land's Star Tour's ride, this is a similar arrangement. Inside the restaurant, there is a spectacular view of the Cosmopolitan. When the weather is nice, the balcony seats overlooking the Cosmopolitan is a prime dining spot. The weather was cool and we sat in the general Forest Gump themed dining area.     If you have never been to Bubba Gump Shrimp, they have a neat gimmick. On the table is a sign that you flip. If you want service, I believe you set it to \"Stop Forest\" and if you don't need service, I believe you set it to \"Run Forest Run.\"     If I was in vacation state of mind, I would of spent $21.99 on the Shrimper's Heaven. I was in a budget state of mind. Bubba Gump Shrimp is a reasonable option if you are on a budget on the Strip. I ordered the Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich with fries and bottomless Coke. After a tip, the dinner came to $22. Not bad!     I have a minor complaint, which is the waitress up selling a restaurant card. When the waitress sat next to us, my instinct was that she was not a die hard Forest Gump fan that wanted to share with the world that Forest Gump played football and that he was from Alabama. When I am eating out, I do not care if Forest Gump was wearing no sneakers in a scene or that football was a sport he played. I want to relax! By the time I am eating I have passed enough people in the hotels trying to sell me time shares. Fast forward to when we were walking out, they were advertising sales at the gift shop. In other respects, the waitresses were friendly and served with an urgency.     Most likely I will return to Bubba Gump. If I am in a tourist state of mind, I will relive my past vacations with Bubba Gump's Shrimper's Heaven."}
{"text":"Go for the food and service...stay and drink looking at the incredible view.  Bubba's is a casual dinning experience with a Five Star view adding the feel of a very special experience.  My Cocount Shrimp could not have been better and my husband ate every piece of his Gumbo.  He said the spice kick was just the right amount.  When the dish came and he saw how much was there he thought he could never finish -- but kept playing the \"just one more taste\" until it was all gone!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Had a nice Cesar salad with grilled shrimp and a refreshing frozen margarita. I also tried the finger licking Cajun shrimp very delicious."}
{"text":"There are a ton of places to eat in Vegas, Bubba Gump happened to be on our list because they have an outside balcony patio that we could sit at and look over the strip and my sister has never been here before. When we first got here the customer service was fantastic, everyone is smiling as they greet you and show you the way to be seated. After hiking up some stairs and walking for a bit, alas the hostess to seat us! We were sat within 5 minutes and greeted by our waiter. The drinks here are WAY over priced and the food was bleh....... the drinks were very weak and cost us about $16 each for one regular mixed drink in a regular sized glass, a beer was $13...... ouch! The food was very bland and just...... well bleh. No taste, no flavor, no yummy to it at all. I remembered the Bubba Gump in SF being WAY BETTER! Definitely disappointed in this visit. Along with the cheap food and expensive drinks came panic at the end of our meal. I paid with a $100 bill and made sure I told the waitress it was a $100 bill, she brought be back change as if I paid with a $50, then disappeared. After talking to 2 other waiters, they finally found my original waitress and she pulled the rest of my change out of her coin purse, her actual personal coin purse and said \"oh im sorry I must have counted that wrong, let me get you change from my tips\" its ok to miscount money I understand, but why would you have put it in your personal bag and not in the cash register, and why would you be paying me back in your tips!??? I didn't say keep the change and leave you a large tip..... so why wasn't I given exact change? So that was weird and not fun, the whole dinner was just disappointing, time consuming (for service was super slow) and having to hunt for my money back is just a pain.  Spend your money and time somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Had it not been for the amazing customer service, this place would have had three or four stars. However, our server Carlos earned them a top rating.   I don't eat shellfish of any kind. But my husband was craving shrimp and we'd been wanting to check this place out since the \"coming soon\" sign first appeared. I wish they had more variety to choose from for non-shellfish eaters. But our server not only made suggestions of what I could eat, he went out of his way to modify one of the dishes for me, making sure to substitute the sauce for one that wasn't shellfish-based. The food itself was pretty tasty, but nothing extraordinary. If it wasn't for the best customer service Vegas has to offer, we would keep this on our \"maybe return to\" list. But it will definitely be one of our go-to spots now."}
{"text":"Would never go back do to the rudeness of the management had to wait for drinks do that one employee didnt come to work. Not my fault then a mistake an the check when you get your glass was getting refused to get the glass and when dont eatting but the sign down to stop.  And ask to clean the table so we could drink are drinks person was very rude and rolled her eyes at us for the cost and the rudeness i never go back here in vegas  Now san fransco i go bact to that one stay away from the one here in vegas"}
{"text":"Good, but not as good as the hype. Still, the service was excellent and the pricing was more than fair considering the location on the Vegas strip. The air condition was good also, a big heal when it's 109 degrees out."}
{"text":"Love Bubba Gump! I have been to multiple locations, San Francisco, Santa Monica, Las Vegas, Laughlin, you name it. No matter where you go, you get the same excellent service. Jumbalaya is a must. Great selection of food. Their drink \"menu\" is not something I'm a fan of, just too fruity and sweet. I stick to my regular drinks off the menu or beer. This specific location has a great seating outside, literally on the strip, just beautiful."}
{"text":"If you ever wonder what Forest Gump did after his military tour you need to check this place out. Interestingly quirky with license plates with \"Run Forrest Run\" or \"Stop Forrest!\" that you show to get the waiter's attention.   Gulf coast style cuisine with more types of shrimp than I knew existed. Tasty food with eye appeal that is served hot. Large assortment of alcoholic drinks to chose from."}
{"text":"Came her on my fist visit to Vegas in February and I gotta say I expected waaaay better. I got the salmon and it was he worst. My fiance at the time now my husband, got the something (i cant remember) that was just as bad. Bad choice and wont visit again."}
{"text":"My family and I were greeted by the hostess and seated immediately (there was no wait, which was a plus because we were very hungry after a long morning exploring the Strip). Our waiter was very friendly. He took our orders and our food came quickly. We ordered the Accidental Fish & Shrimp, Net Catch Entree, and an extra order of fries. The food was tasty but the portions were a bit light for the amount of money you pay. As we were leaving the employee in the gift shop was also very nice. He asked us how we enjoyed our meal and made small talk with our family. So great customer service there as well.  As far as the establishment, the  it was clean, including the restrooms. Overall we had a great experience here and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I really like the SF one, the service was boring and the salads were bland. Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Always a full house. If you utilize the \"Run Forrest\" or \"Stop\" signs, it can be hit or miss depending on the servers. I've noticed service is getting better at this location which I totally appreciate. The food is flavorful. Not too many healthy options, mostly fried options, so if you're watching what you eat or on a diet, be prepared to be let down or tempted. There are a lot of fun drink options if you want to hang out at the bar."}
{"text":"Love the gumbo and skewered shrimp , our server Bryant was awesome!   Will stop by next time in town."}
{"text":"One of the best bubba Gump places! Fast and warm service, attentive servers..-:) food is great and I always love their Forest Gump themed interior...amazing!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre food for being so pricey. A 2 person meal will run you about $90 for 2 entrees, appetizer and 1 drink each. We could've ate at a nice steak restaurant for that price. Also $15 for a cocktail that tasted watered down. I ordered the chicken. Nothing special about it. KFC style."}
{"text":"I took a trip to Las Vegas,  for a few days,  and let me say this.  If you do not have a Bubba Gump's near you,  then this a must stop!!!!   Let me start off by saying their drinks are A1!  I mean I can not complain at all.  I ordered a Peach Colada which I believe is off the seasonal  menu,  one item that seemed like a shrimp ceviche,  for me dinner I order a shrimper's heaven,  and a sampler dessert.  I really wanted to try some of the best of everything.  Now I must admit this dinner did cost a bit more than what I was expecting to spend but was it worth it absolutely.   Now my waitress was definitely fun,  we had a few laughs,  We never went without anything.  I will definitely eat here anytime I am on a trip due to the fact we don't have one here in Dallas."}
{"text":"Craving seafood and we decided to stop in here .. I'd been before so I know it's a chain but this visit the food wasn't great..   Service was great.. they explained the run & stop signs on the table and the one time we used it a server stopped right away to answer our question ..   We got our drinks right away and our orders came out pretty quickly..   My food looked really good .. small serving size but that cheese sauce on the bourbon Mah mahi dryed up and resembled cheez whiz (no bueno) the crispy fried chips were cold those were definitely sitting out and added to the plate as a decoration.. shrimp was good (I could've eaten a plate of those and been happy!)  My bf ordered Jennys catch with lobster butter sauce .. that sauce with potatoes was delicious!   Overall service was a great.. but food was a miss on this visit."}
{"text":"I'm not a seafood person but I tried some of my friend's shrimp and fries and it was really good. Great flavor, not too bready. Good."}
{"text":"First time with my sweetie in Vegas without the kids and we choose this restaurant because of its location and we were not disappointed!  It was beautiful!  Our waitress rocked it and took great care of us.  Food was to die for!  We will be going back on our next get away!"}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp and grits very attentive staff. My wife had the mahi mahi very tasty"}
{"text":"Drowsy.com . . . Nothing to brag about here folks. This is your sub standard chain restaurant. The hostess was rude. I had to speak to him twice before he acknowledged our party of 6 standing at the hostess stand. I ordered the Alabama steampot. My potatoes we undercooked, shrimp was over cooked, and apparently Cajun means dump paprika all over the food but no salt. Blah. Save your time, money and calories. Not worth it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not open until 1am on Friday as shown here.  The manager said the kitchen closes at 12, so if you are looking for a late night place to eat, go elsewhere.  I told the employees at the front about it being advertised on the web site as being open until 1am and they said \"We have a web site?\"  Stupid is as stupid does!!!"}
{"text":"The first night we were in Las Vegas,  my husband and I had dinner here.  Food was reasonably priced. There is outdoor or indoor seating.  I had the Shrimp stuffed with crabmeat and my husband had Shrimp Scampi.  Both were excellent and reasonably priced. Servings were very filling. It was also nice to be able to sit outside and be able to have a view of Las Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"Incredible experience! I absolutely adore all the detailed decor!! The mason jars were the coolest souvenir ever in addition you can receive a new cup in exchange for your used one when exiting the resturant! The food was okay and the service was excellent! Highly recommend for a dining experience! Thanks Abby for all your recommendations and personalizing our experience! 8/20/13"}
{"text":"Great location, glad this place is finally open.  As a single diner, I sat at the bar.  I ordered a shrimp po boy with the fries.  This sandwich was huge.  In fact, the sandwich was served open faced as it was so large. The shrimp is deep fried and good, though not great.  Could use some southern seasoning. The fries are just typical.  I figured, if I am going to get full eating this meal, I am taking down the sandwich and avoiding the fries. Glad I did, I was stuffed by the time I finished the sandwich.  My waiter/bartender was Korey. Very nice guy. Good service and friendly. After my meal, I took a walk around the restaurant.  Great decor of Forrest Gump memorabilia, as in all Bubba Gump restaurants.  Went out to the balcony and there is a nice view of the Strip."}
{"text":"Good service, horrible food. Fried chicken had NO flavor, gravey not good, and corn came out with silk all over it.  Spinach dip was good.  Not worth the money!"}
{"text":"Today my friends and I decided to eat here as it was my friends first time to Vegas.. unfortunately my first five minutes in this establishment were completely ruined by the hostess or manager Sarah. Before arriving I had purchased a Slushy type drink at the Paris hotel.  As my friends and I started to walk up the stairs to enter the restaurant Sarah just pointed at me and basically says I can't come in with an open container. I understand that this is the restaurants policy but her entire approach made me not even want to come back. She was very rude and dismissive. As a former manager I wouldn't dream of speaking to anyone like how she did today.  First impressions are everything , especially if the first person you are interacting with is rude as hell. Won't be visiting this establishment, I'll go to one back home Thanks."}
{"text":"Bubba Gumps is one of my favorite seafood restaurants in Vegas if I want something on the strip with friends.  I love, LOVE, love shrimp and can't get enough of it here.    The casual environment is great for a lunch spot and I've even came here just for apps and drinks.  In addition to seafood, they have a great variety of salads, deserts, and awesome style baby back ribs.     My favorite is just the traditional margarita and they will even hand-shake it right at your seat. Bonus :)"}
{"text":"I've been to this particular restaurant a few times and i always seat by the patio, the view is really really beautiful specially at night. I always order the BLT shrimp salad! OMG its soooo yummy!"}
{"text":"Honestly not good at all. Was cold when I got it and didn't taste good at all. Everything is fried and the batter isn't even good. Won't be going to Bubba Gump's again any time soon."}
{"text":"Ok... The shrimp and fries were ok but the fish was not cooked all the way. The batter that they used wasn't even done all the way. The hush puppies were rather Interesting because they had corn and shrimp in the middle of them. It's was new for me and it was great. The service was outstanding because they had a License plate on the table that indicated run forest run, for the waiter to know that we didn't need anything. The other plate indicated stop forest stop for the waiter to stop at the table to see what we wanted.  Overall, I should of found a chicken joint to go to in Vegas. I would of spent less and and been  more happier. That meal I got with two soft drink was 30 bucks. I  Took a financial hit going here."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this location a lot. You can request to be seated on the balcony (if weather is nice) and watch the craziness of the Las Vegas Strip. Our food was pretty good, the clam chowder and the shrimp pasta. The chowder has nice flavor and plenty of chunks of clam. The pasta was done perfectly with lots of wonderful capers for every bite. Prices were not too bad considering it is on the Strip where they want to charge you $20+ for a hamburger. The real treasure of our visit to this restaurant was the service. From the time we were greeted until we left the staff treated us like friends. Our server, Zuri, might be one of the nicest people in the world. I would go here again, absolutely. Menu has a lot of fried and high carb dishes but also some more sensible fare."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place but was not impressed at all. Perhaps it's what I ordered ( stuffed shrimp) very mediocre served with white plain bland rice. Pear strawberry salad was better. Very meh. Waitperson was very nice and upbeat."}
{"text":"Randomly came in for dinner and couldn't be happier! The food was great and my server \"meshell\" was great! Really funny girl and was always making sure we were ok. Coming back soon"}
{"text":"Glad they finally have one in Vegas!  So when you get to the hostess, they ask you \"So what did Jenny tell forest to do? RUN FOREST RUN!\" I thought they were going to make us run to our table..So that was uncomfortable, not expecting pop trivia. So after we get seated they explain the stop and go sign to us. Love it, because EVERYONE stops to help, not just waiting on your server..  So server comes back with food and before we get to eat, we have to answer 3 more questions about the movie.. I was a bit annoyed because if you don't know the answer you kinda feel stupid.. even with trick questions like \"What was the name of Forest's dog?\" He didn't have one..  I think next time, I am going to lie and say I never seen the movie.. Less questions. I am such a party pooper I know.   Food is what I come for, which is always good. I walked out like I just ate a buffet, which only was the Shrimp mac and cheese lol."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a couple times when in Vegas and this last time was the best.  We had Forrest's Seafood Feast and the New Orleans Shrimp.  The New Orleans Shrimp is best if you mix everything up into the sauce when you get it.  The pineapple margarita was great and they give you a shaker to keep re-filling so it makes 3 margaritas total.  Service was great and we were seated right away for a Thursday evening dinner."}
{"text":"Perfect view on the patio, located near Planet Hollywood.  Had a signature drink that was  good and came with a souvenir shaker. Shared appetizers and especially loved  the \"Run Forest \" on the table."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to any Bubba Gumps, and we loved it. Great portions for price, perfectly seasoned!  Wish there was a larger selection of fish options, without the shrimp.  Beautiful strip view outside, we were lucky with cooler weather on our visit. Wait staff was friendly, quick, and reliable.  Will defenitely return again!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere, the food, and the service was excellent. Everything I could have ever wanted in a themed restaurant."}
{"text":"If I could give ZERO STARS, I would. If you absolutely love seasoned salt (I mean not being able to discern fries from seafood by the taste), this is the place for you. I was wondering why this place had no line/no wait on New Years Eve! I found out after the first bite. This place is the worst. The service is really sad as well. You literally have to wave down people to get their attention. This place can be compared to a franchise Applebee's at best! Save your time and money and stay away from here!"}
{"text":"It's basic. Nothing super special but it's a good lunch or dinner if you know what you want. No surprises. Although I guess if you're in Vegas you might wanna try something special to the place rather than a chain"}
{"text":"Food was excellent I got the crab stuffed shrimp.  Bar tenders were more than helpful, friendly, and personable.  The strawberry lemonade thing I got was outstanding.  It was a tad pricey, but not that bad.  Bar booths were missing seats which looked really tacky. Nice souvenir shop down stairs."}
{"text":"I was fooled to think that this place is just for tourists. I was so wrong! If my German cousin wasn't visiting Vegas with me I'd never step into a Bubba Gump. But man I missed out!  The restaurant is very themed and staff is friendly. Now their food - definitely exceeded my expectations!  Of course we have scampi - one of the best scampi dish I've tried in my life. And I've been to 12 counties in the world including Italy.  Jenny's Catch - the tilapia melts in your mouth! The butter sauce is so (fat) but good! With some spinach and mashed potato to top it off.  Gumbo - the only thing I didn't like at this dinner. Strangely this is one of their customer-favorites. Just isn't for me I guess."}
{"text":"The service was AWESOME!!!  The food was superb!!! We had the shrimp scampi, dumb luck coconut shrimp, and shrimp mac & cheese. Everything arrived promptly and tasted perfectly. I really recommend this place.  Our server was Lydia and she was extremely pleasant."}
{"text":"This location doesn't carry the same atmosphere as other Bubba locations primarily because it's not on or near a beach. The food is similar and staff is friendly but awesome that they have one in the desert of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Wenn einem die Warme Luft nichts ausmacht, dann sollte man sich auf den Balkon setzen, dort hat man dann einen schönen Blick auf den Strip!  Das Essen dort ist nicht gerade billig, aber dafür bekommt man was sehr leckeres!  Das Team von Bubba Gump dort ist sehr nett und nicht zu aufdringlich!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I'm from the south, but nothing was seasoned, Shrimp was disgusting.... Would never recommend this place. We had to send 4 meals back and my friends steak was not medium well...he received a new one and it still was not up to par.... Will not be going back.  -Janelle"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time. We were seated right away, my son picked outside. Nice view of the strip. Our waiter was very attentive and the food was amazing! Very family friendly."}
{"text":"Frankly, I can't rate the food because after twenty (20) minutes of waiting for someone to take a drink order, or even be welcomed, we walked out.  There were at least a dozen empty tables in the restaurant.  Do yourself a favor, go to any of the 15 restaurants nearby who want to earn your business."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place because I love shrimp and I loved the movie.  When you walk it, it's just the gift shop. You have to walk up a couple of flights of stairs to get to the restaurant.  Here's what I liked about this place. The ambience. Great service and helpful staff. We got seated on the patio which had a great view of the Strip. Really cool idea to have signs on your table to let staff know when you need them: Run Forrest Run or Stop Forrest Stop. The waiter asked us trivia about Forrest Gump, which kinda stumped us. Here's what I didn't like about this place: The Food.  It sucked. We ordered the Frizzled Onion Rings for an appetizer.  Frizzled is right; the breading came off easily, it was just skinny onions. We both ordered Forrest's Seafood Feast, which were told it was the most popular. It consists of Fried Shrimp, Fish and Chips with their special hushpuppies. The shrimp was average at best. The \"fish\" was awful. Very thin strips of heavily breaded fish.  I've had better fish sticks.  The hushpuppies were ok, they had corn inside, but they were small. Considering the price of this menu, the food does not reflect it. The only thing that prevented me from giving one star was the \"experience\". If you are a Forrest Gump fanatic, you'll love this place. Maybe just stick to drinks though."}
{"text":"great service. if you're looking for shrimp this is the spot! Po boy is a solid solid sandwich! shrimp n grits or also excellent."}
{"text":"I ordered two different entrees and really wasn't satisfied with my meal. The food wasn't nasty or anything...just wasn't satisfied. Overrated and overpriced. I was also expecting shrimp and grits and it wasn't on the menu."}
{"text":"I never saw Forrest Gump so this place was sorta lost on me.  I've seen it in Orlando and New York but never ventured until this las Las Vegas trip.  The restaurant is peppered with movie paraphernalia and the waiters engage customers with Forrest Gump trivia, it was fun and the answers were all around you.    Ordered shrimp macaroni & cheese - very salty, probably the breadcrumbs. The pasta was cheesy and shrimp spicy.    The grilled fish and vegetables was tasty and the fried fish, shrimp and seafood/shrimp hush puppies were crispy and good.    Watermelon lemonade was refreshing.  Received Bubba Gump souvenir glasses from gift shop - added treat."}
{"text":"Las Vegas! Great service I had the fish and chips it was excellent the waiter was great, very courteous.  I also had the bread pudding it was outstanding!!! I had the blueberry lemonade......very good!!! Everything was good , very delicious.  So I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I was warned that this restaurant wasn't the best, but my guy and I were hungry so we decided to try it out anyway.  Big mistake...I wasn't at all impressed!    I ordered from the menu (take-out) the \"Net Catch Entrée\" - Beer steamed Peel 'n' Eat Shrimp, along with Carrots, Celery, Corn, Potatoes and Andouille Sausage all steamed and tossed with Garlic Spice or our Secret Cajun Spice recipe for $22.99.  I chose the Cajun spice seasoning without the Andouille sausage.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly, but it didn't have the Cajun flavor I was expecting and was use to and the corn on the cob were hard as a rock, so I couldn't eat them.    My babe ordered the \"Forrest's Seafood Feast\" - Hand breaded Fried Shrimp, Fish & Chips and Seafood Hush Pups. Served with Fries and dippin' sauces, Tartar, Cocktail and Remoulade for $20.99.  He said he enjoyed it, so maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.  Overall, I was disappointed.  For the price I expected WOW...but, instead got BLAH!"}
{"text":"The manager, Sarah, had attitude and a fake smile... She was very concerned about respecting restaurant policy. We were two who arrived early out of a party of 6 and everyone was on their way. She would not seat us even if the restaurant was EMPTY. I pointed out to her that the rest of the group was minutes away, that the restaurant was empty and that we had come early because my mom wanted to eat right away. She said no because of POLICY. At this point, I would have left but the rest of the group were almost here. Terrible customer service... Please note I rarely complain about service, but this was unacceptable... To be left waiting in an empty restaurant on a weekday afternoon!  As for the food, bad tasteless greasy chain food. And they charge for bread. Please stay away... So many better options on the Strip. On a positive note, the staff in their store was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"For starters the welcoming staff was very  friendly! My server was friendly and attentive as well, the food had good taste nice and fresh, nice presentation. Strawberry lemonade best I've had. I gave it four stars for the friendly attentive service.   I was  also impressed by cleanliness of the restroom. This was the cleanest bathroom I have ever seen in any restaurant, BIG UPS HIGH-FIVES TO THE STAFF AT BUBBLE GUMPS LAS VEGAS STRIP LOCATION..."}
{"text":"Service here is really bad here tonight we are here still  waiting on service. The servers are off near the washroom arguing in the open at least 6 of them."}
{"text":"Never disappoints!  No matter what location you go to.. good food, good drinks, good service.. GREAT MEMORIES!"}
{"text":"My partner is a huge Forrest Gump fan so I knew I had to take him to this place! I was a little worried looking at the reviews, but I had nothing to worry about!   The service was great and fast. We ordered the popcorn shrimp, shrimp salad and the shrimpers heaven. Everything was cooked to absolute perfection!   Next time we'll definitely just order a heap of the coconut shrimp and we done with it!   Expensive but tasty, not a complaint of the entire meal!"}
{"text":"Food was alright and very very very overpriced. It was ridiculous. I am still shocked that I paid $6 for a non alcoholic beverage, their strawberry lemonade! Its a nice atmosphere and our server was very nice and attentive but the taste of the food and the prices just don't add up. I will go back though to try their shrimp po boy which I saw someone else get. It was pretty big and only cost $13. Other than that they wouldn't see me there for awhile."}
{"text":"Love the awesome interior design!  The service was just okay.   The food was just okay.  We orders garlic bread and fried shrimp and fries.  You cannot go wrong with fried stuffs. LOL!!    Garlic shrimp was too salt but good salty.  Garlic bread $5.99.   Fried shrimp $21.99.  And garlic shrimp $14.99"}
{"text":"I've been to Gatlinburg and New Orleans but had Bubba Gump in Vegas. It was ok. I thought the decor was very well done and the Run and Stop signs work really well.   The food wasn't anything spectacular, but my boyfriend's food was better than my choice. Process are decent and service was good. Our waitress came over and gave us some Forrest Gump trivia questions, which we got all right. I thought we were going to win something though, lol.    I wouldn't make any special trips back to BG, but I wouldn't oppose to going of anyone wanted to try it."}
{"text":"We loved coming here when we used to live in HI. Just that Bubba Gump vibe and decor, open air, looking towards the Pacific ocean, and the smell of.food being prepared as Tradewinds brush through.  Crap, we aren't in HI. This location lacked, alot. Our server was lousy, unattentive, and you could see him by their register thingy playing as if it's social hour. The Bubba Gump we once loved and wished we had out here, had arrived, minus the Bubba Gump.vibe we are acquainted with.   My husband always gets the Shrimp New Orleans. I'll usually order a Caesar salad (surprise surprise), their salmon, or their ribs. I will say I have always loved their Caesar salad. Their Caesar dressing and croutons have always been on point, so I can't critique that.  I feel like their ribs for $24 is not even worthed. It isn't even that great. It's good, just not 24 bucks good. On this particular evening I ordered salmon. Can we say, dry! DRY! Look, I am those weirdos who actually can bare through dry food, love my steak charred and well-done...chewy? No problem. If I accidentally overcook my salmon at home, I can bare with it. BUT when a restaurant serves you a dry fish at 20 bucks....grrrr.   It isn't a bad place to try. Maybe it's a hit or miss. But I just think they are way too steep for what you are getting. Also, the service we received was pretty lousy. I can seperate lousy service and good food or vice versa. On this night, wholly cow. I mean, from the long anticipated wait just to get our name called, to the walk uo the stairs just to stand in another line to get seated...It just all sucked.  Our waiter got no tip whatsoever and I seriously regretted going there with the whole brood.  Oh, forgot to mention..the husband enjoyed his dish (surprise surprise).   I came in with a stroller and had no problems. Just the part where we had to carry the stroller up the stairs. I could've swore I seen an elevator, so it would have been customer service friendly if someone mentioned it. However, my husband and I like to move quick...so carrying that bad boy up the stairs toddler strapped in was the only option even if there were other options.  Definitely kid and stroller friendly! I won't HIGHLY recommend it. There are other GREAT restaurants in the area to spend your money where you will receive better service and a well-worthed meal. But, I don't like my isolated experience to deter other from trying it out.   However, because of the service we received that night, quality of food, the price...only way I'd come back to THIS Bubba Gump is if someone gave me a gift certificate...only then will I give it another shot and only hope to up its ratings."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and service. The environment is very fun and lots of cool memorabilia from the Forrest Gump movie. The servers also come up and do movie trivia and quizzes  while waiting makes it fun and interesting. I have the Alabama steam pot Cajun style and it was DELICIOUS. Lots of shrimp and other delicious seafood. Very reasonable prices and lots of food."}
{"text":"After receiving an extremely rude \"compliment\" on my yelp review from employee Jessica L., I would like to repeat it was closed at 3:30 PM on a Saturday, for absolutely NO reason. WE EVEN ASKED WHY they were closed, we were answered with \"I don't know, I'm really sorry\" They didn't say one word about it being veterans day (the reason Jessica L. Gave me via Yelp 3 months later) So your rude employee can keep her yelp responses to her self! I was in Vegas specifically FOR Veterans Day, with 4 Veterans! We would have said ok great, had we been given an answer! BTW miss priss I came in the next day and spent 120$ on 4 plates so f*** off!"}
{"text":"From the outside it looks like is a great place to eat and dine at but in reality it was not all that great, overrated. Horrible customer service took about 20 minutes to get our table some drinks. Many employees walking around and was never asked if everything was ok or to take our order and took about another 30- 45 minutes to finally get our food. Definitely not going back to Bubbas when I go to Vegas again.  Oh and did I mention the forks were dirty?. had to ask for CLEAN set of utensils smh"}
{"text":"I went here Sunday afternoon. The decor was nice. I love the pics and movie phrases and a lot of other stuff. The food presentation was nice. My friend ordered the gumbo which she enjoyed. Also the peel and eat shrimp. Which she didn't like. I tasted one and let me tell u it was bland. I am a Cajun/creole sauce fanatic and this was not. Bubba is turning over in his grave. I had the spinach artichoke and shrimp dip which was awful and bland. I took a few bites and they happily took it off my bill. I also had the shrimp skewers that were beautiful but bland. Service was outstanding. Hostess very nice and welcoming and waiter was very attentive. I live in L.A. and go to the one on the Santa Monica Pier. The food is better there"}
{"text":"The food was great, we had no wait time on a Friday night and our server jayson was entertaining and kind. Other team members step in the assist servers if the restaurant gets busy and you can tell its customers are a priority. A definite must if you adore Forest Gump!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit to a Bubba Gump, and my 1st visit to the Vegas location.  First of all, kudos to the servers. They were certainly on point! Everyone helped out each other and were very professional. Thank you for our awesome customer service!  The restaurant is located on the top floor of where the Miracle Mile shops are. Very easy to get to and accessible from the strip.   Our table of 8 (gratuity already included) placed different orders, but I made out with the cup of gumbo and the Stuffed Shrimp (stuffed with crab). My gumbo was OK. I haven't had a gumbo as good as the gumbo from NOLA unfortunately.   My shrimp entree ($20) was soooo rich and buttery. WOW, such great flavor! I also tried my Dad's jambalaya and it was spicy! Drink lots of beer!!! I also tried the coconut shrimp, which I enjoyed as well. I had a tempura shrimp and I didn't care for it. There was a weird taste that accompanied it.   The drinks/cocktails are expensive so expect to pay an arm and a leg for them! I had a Corona and that went well with our savory entrees. We were all so stuffed for dessert.   Fun place to catch a meal. I love all the Forrest Gump memorabilia!"}
{"text":"I feel robbed. Everyone had a decent experience.   Tuesday night with my stepson and boyfriend in July for dinner. We were seated in 10 minutes which wasn't bad. It was inside even though we asked for outside, since we wanted the great view. Then our waitress started off strong getting our order & answering menu questions. Then we never saw her again!! Thank god for the stop and go sign or we would have just sat there. I ordered a drink and had to remind them twice to bring it. And never got it. The food wasn't that great and over priced for the small portions, which is typical of the strip. No trivia which I was looking forward to since my stepson just saw the movie.   I am a local and my boyfriend works on the strip and we both will never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Get the shrimp basket! It is a bit pricey ~$21 but I think you get a good selection of shrimps that they offer. It comes with coconut shrimp, tempura shrimp, cooked cold shrimp, regular fried shrimp, and some French fries. Also, my favorite sauce is the pineapple sweet and sour sauce! Try to ask for more sauce because I felt that you need more.   I also got the shrimp gumbo for ~$6. It was really spicy and had barely any shrimp. I honestly don't recommend it because it was spicy and hot.   The place is also on the second floor because the first floor is their gift shop.   Overall, I feel that most of their food was pricey for shrimp but if you want to taste good cooked shrimp the. Go here! Also, the gift shop is a good souvenir place for tourists!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop by becuz we were craving seafood. Since we were walking around the strip, we had our drinks with us (just like everyone else lol) When we walked in the bubba gumps, the hostess told us we couldn't walk in with our drinks. We told her \"really? But we're in Vegas & everyone has drinks!\" She said that's policy. We asked to speak to a manager & when he came out he right away said sorry we can't let you in with drinks. I said it was ridiculous & i guess we'll take our business elsewhere. He just said...ok thank you! The customer service  (or the lack of) is the worst ever! We are in Vegas after all & the fact that they wouldn't accommodate us was unacceptable! We will definitely not ever go back to any Bubba Gumps again! I wanted to rate them with zero stars but had to give them at least one. Soo disappointed!"}
{"text":"We're this location first time, I like there , nice view, my husband got the build your own plate, that was delicious, my clam chowder just ok , the service was very friendly,"}
{"text":"This Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. was fantastic. It was pretty expensive (as expected on The Strip), but besides that everything was cooked beautifully and service was top top notch. Tried Bubba's \"Bucket of Boat Trash\" and also shared the shrimp appetizer. Would highly recommend! Vegas has practically every restaurant you can think of so you never know where to go, but this is a good option."}
{"text":"The fish and chips were pathetic. They were the size of large sardines, not exaggerating. I've had this dish before at another bubba gumps so I asked if it was a mistake and the waiter was so rude about it. He made it clear he disliked me. But the drinks were yummy, I had the hurricane I believe. I won't go back to this particular store but I do like the chain as a whole. Usually really good calamari and the big sampler is what I always get."}
{"text":"What can I say about \"Bubba Shrimp Co\", we had a good time but the food was just okay, I had never eaten there before and wanted to try it out, it was just okay, nothing to write home about...  I know its a big chain restaurant but I was expecting a little more out of the food..."}
{"text":"Had this place really late, not sure why... Went ahead and are the coconut shrimp and the New Orleans shrimp... Both were average at best. I do feel like this place is a bit overpriced for what you get and there are plenty of other options around. However, if you want shrimp, they have plenty of it. Just don't expect to be \"wow'd\"."}
{"text":"Let me say this first....I loooooove the movie Forrest Gump.  I could NOT wait to try Bubba Gump Shrimp....  Hard swallow (drinks water)....  BUT....this place...NO ma'am!!!!  Customer service is horrible, food is not southern, my group felt we were treated different (I will use that word), AND to top it all off, there is no mention of BUBBA!!!!  Well, as I stated, I am a fan....I went to see memorabilia and that I did.  There was \"Forrest\" memorabilia everywhere, from downstairs to upstairs.  The decor was nice, hence my one star.  I can say that part of the experience was nice.  However, as we looked in the store downstairs, on the walls, upstairs in the restaurant, we noticed there were lots of mention of Forrest, his extended family, Jenny, LT. Dan but no Bubba Gump.  I didn't see his extended family nor pictures of him.  Definitely left us ALL confused, but we climbed the stairs to the restaurant.  Now, to the Restaurant.  When we were seated, we opted for the patio, but as we sat there for 30 minutes with no drinks and watched others being served, it was decided that was a bad decision.  We moved ourselves to the inside.  It was comfy in both spaces.  We just wanted fresh air and scenery.  The patio offers a nice view of the strip.  Great for people watching while you wait on your food.  BUT....inside we were met with annoyance and poor customer interaction.  I opted for the fish sandwich,  as a look on yelp offered some nice looking fish.  I am southern, so my expectations were high.  When the food arrived, I must say, I was looking very sad. I probably should have ordered shrimp since it's in the name.  The sandwich was Cod.  I am not a fan of Cod, I expected something else.  It was thick cut Cod with heavy coating, more than needed in my opinion.  But, it was bland coating so it was just useless.  The fish wasn't seasoned either, so blah!!!  I won't speak on the rest of the food since I only \"tasted\" the sandwich.  There was enough food on the strip that I didn't need to eat something I didn't find great.  The plated food was a bit warm rather than hot so the group sent back a few items.  This didn't turn out well.  As new items were ordered and we were still charged for items sent back.  Well, that definitely made for frustration on  both sides.  When a manager was asked for, 30 minutes later, no manager.  We agreed to just pay and leave.  Never Ever again.....  Not worth the hassle.  Please change the name.  Bubba is no where in the building...."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and when you sit outside you have a nice view of the strip. The food isnt anything spectacular and the service was lacking. I probably wouldnt return but I am glad i checked the place out."}
{"text":"This review is about a month old. But anyways, I went to Vegas on a Monday and really didn't know what to eat so I pulled out my phone and started yelping. Bubba Gump came up so I told myself thats what i will have for dinner. I walked in and noticed this place is very big and very clean. I was seated right away. I ordered Forrest Seafood Feast! AND DAMN WHAT IT GOOD! It didn't look like a whole lot of food but it filled me up, The service is very good as well. All n all when i'm in Vegas again I would most definitely be back."}
{"text":"The bartender served us a hard as a brick bun (you can hear the hardness when you tap it with a knife and when you run your fork over the inside of the bun) for the mushroom burger. I demonstrated how hard the bun was since the bartender didn't know what to say or do. I stated I'm hungry now and she wanted to take the burger back versus having the manager come over or put in another order.  Given my condition, I need to eat now not later. I told the bartender I'll just got somewhere else to eat.   Well my partner stopped eating so we can get something else to eat. I wanted to leave (and did leave) everything else unfinished so I can go. Our entire order was this awful mushroom burger, water (for 1 person although we asked for water for starters), an adult beverage (the bartender had to make two different once but they still wasn't good) and calamari. We asked to speak to the manager and Bud, shift manager or whatever he is, waltzed over and with a nasty attitude and said we have to pay for the unfinished items versus offer a solution. Bud claimed him and the chef were sitting and watching us. They didn't proactively intervene.   Forget customer satisfaction or service, we paid for the unfinished items cash (surprise surprise Bud we had money for our meal and then some) and walked out. Matt Stensrude, general manager, needs to work with their poorly trained chef, unskilled/inexperienced bartender and definitely Bud with his customer service, managerial skills. I hope they are happy with this $23.56 cash they got for poor service and awful food; I knew Bubba Gump restaurants to be so hard up for cash to treat us as such. No tip for poor service and food!   This location will not receive another penny from me and I generally love Bubba Gump restaurants; I have been to several from Hawaii, NYC to Miami plus a few in between. This place and the management sucks to no end!"}
{"text":"We were shown to our table and after about 15 minutes without being waited on at all (and asking a nearby employee if they could find us our waiter or bring some water) we left."}
{"text":"We came here4 for lunch & just love Bubba Gump's.  Our waitress, Eva, was very friendly & attentive.  I had the appetizer sampler with chicken strips, hush puppies, cajon shrimp, spinach dip, & tortilla chips.  The chicken strips are tender with a lite badder, the hush puppies have the right corn meel badder to shrimp ratio, the cajon shrimp have a kick, & the spinach dip is cheesy spinachy goodness with fresh tortilla chips.  For dessert, the bread pudding is a great way yo go with soft bread & a warm filling.  Round it off with a Long Island & you will not be disappointed.  My mother, aunt, & uncle enjoyed their food & drinks alike.  My uncle even got a free glass which he loved.  I loved the upbeat atmosphere & mix of pop music going.  So, for wonderfulo southern fare with friendly service in a casual upbeat atmosphere, Bubba Gump's cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"WTH? It's Tuesday, there are seats outside. oh, thanks for not seating me out there, why do you have propane heaters blasting? OH, everyone in this town is a whimp..... You're fish is overcooked like the regulars only, rubbery not leathery. Sad, don't bother, you're in Vegas and this place is too corporate with employees expecting and making more than they're worth off of sucky food."}
{"text":"I worked at the Bubba Gump in Kailua Kona, HI; so I have been in love ever since and was Extremely happy they opened one in Las Vegas, NV. So my husband and I went for dinner on Friday evening.   Location:  Is perfect if you ask me, the outside balcony seating that over looks the strip is great. They have the same Forrest Gump memorabilia everywhere. Only thing I didn't like was the entrance to (well all the people), you get to the front where there is a booth and the hostess radios how many (fine) they direct you through the gift shop up the stair (OK) there is a guy that tells you to enjoy your meal at the bottom of the stairs (nice) then you get to the top of the stairs where a person then tells you to follow the yellow smiley faces to another set of hostess. (at that point too much) which from there you are finally seated. I think they should have the booth out front and then one at the top of the stairs.   Food & Service: Our server was amazing and very nice, while we waited they did the traditional trivia of the movie Forrest Gump. The food we got the Crab Stuffed Mushrooms for an appetizer, they were good but the pan was hotter than the inside of my crab. It was tasty but could have been better, next time we'll get something different. I got the Jambalaya (which the server tells me its the spiciest thing on the menu) of course I'm like that's fine (thinking everyone has their own version of spicy) it was spicy but it wasn't too hot where I couldn't eat it; YUMMY! I wanted the Gumbo but didn't see it on the menu and over heard another waitress say they didn't have it. My husband got the Accidental Fish and Shrimp (the fish is Mahi Mahi) it was delicious as well, the fish was cooked perfectly. We ended up splitting each others dishes (half and half) that's how good both were."}
{"text":"Bubba gump is always a reliable place to eat. You know exactly what you're going to get. This one is without Forrest's favorite drink Dr Pepper. Of course they don't have it so I really want it."}
{"text":"We arrived around 9pm. Not a huge line and we got a table quick. We decided to sit outside- best decision ever! It was a wonderful night and we could see the whole Strip lit up. I ordered something off the seasonal menu. Essentially it was 4 different formats of shrimp (bacon wrapped, grilled, crab stuffed and sauteed), jasmine rice, spinach and grape tomatoes. Portions are important to talk about, it was good (dare I say even a bit more than you should eat in one seating lol) My favorite was the bacon wrapped by far. If you love crab then the stuffed ones would make you happy since they really do have the crab taste (have had those in other places and the taste of crab has been weaker). The rice was not as loose as I like but it wasnt bland nor too salty. Both of my other friends ordered a sampler of 4 different formats of shrimp (3 fried and 1 grilled). They came with fries. They liked the Coconut ones best by far.  The restaurant has a lot of cool Forrest Gump memorabilia and spots to take pictures. All three of us were happy campers."}
{"text":"If you want a good experience, avoid Bubba Gump Shrimp. Terrible experience with a poor management team. Our server Jon was wonderful and did as much as he could possibly do within his authority. Unfortunately, the managers Bud and Dennis were awful. I'm writing corporate tomorrow."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here a few times now I am a local here in vegas. More locals should visit. The first time the homie Carlos was a great waiter and then Amanda was awesome the next time around. Still Carlos was more awesome not that Amanda was bad or anything. Then Q from down stairs acted like a fairy and made our experienced incredible. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try Bubba Gump's to see what the hype was all about. It's not hype! The food was amazing. I had the \"I'm stuffed\" shrimp. Hands down the best seafood dish I've had in a while. I would definitely recommend if you're looking for an affordable seafood restaurant in the strip."}
{"text":"My wife and I hag dinner on Sunday night. Food was good. We sat outside on the balcony facing Las Vegas boulevard and the view was amazing. Service was fast and courteous. It's a good place to eat. Nothing different from other Bubba Gump restaurants. Same menu. I order a burger I was so hungry after running a. Half marathon and it was very good. Will come back mostly for the view."}
{"text":"Ordered the  shrimp scampi and Stuffed shrimp. The shrimp in both dishes were over cooked and the crab was in indiscernible. The service wasn't any better. We ordered an appetizer which was good, but the salad came right after and then main course so the table was filled. We needed water but could not get waiter attention because too busy flirting. Will not go to another Bubba Gump."}
{"text":"This is our 3rd time going to this place and it never lets us down. The food is good, the drinks are little pricey but you get a souvenir cup with most of them. Love the atmosphere and the staff. On our firs trip the manager himself came and helped us when we had a question. This most recent time we went, we seen the manager actually pick up the broom help really quick. great place!"}
{"text":"I was curious to check this place out because Forrest Gump is one of my favorite movies. I stopped by on a sunny afternoon and the hostess took me to my table facing Las Vegas Boulevard. The food was fantastic. I got a shrimp sandwich and French fries. The portion was huge and the prices for food and drinks were very reasonable for a restaurant on the strip. My waitress Cara was adorable and stopped by a few time to ask me if everything was ok. The service was pretty fast too. I loved every bite and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my Delicious meal! We had the accidental mahi mahi fish and shrimp and seafood feast! Food was well prepared and staff was friendly. For a Sat. Night the restaurant was not busy like other Vegas restaurants."}
{"text":"It was a great idea to go to Bubba Gump for dinner. We had table outside with a perfect view!! Shrimp were great and special thanks to our server. Unfortunately don't remember his name but he was working with trainee (around 8 pm on 27th of October). So professional and friendly! We had a great evening!"}
{"text":"the experience was good, good food and laughs. I do think it is a tiny bit over priced... $6 for a side salad..and about $16 for a pilsner beer. But overall it was good"}
