{"text":"Wow, what a sweet little find near Phillips Industrial park. Great menu, a little pricey but high quality ingredients. Will be back for lunch or an afternoon beer (lots of locals on tap). I think they are just lunch and breaky place so they close at 4ish. 

*update went back on the following Wed to take my wife for some Bennies, arrived at 8:30 and nobody home??! Lights off, doors locked? Went to Ricky's down the road instead."}
{"text":"Chicken pot pie, excellent kid one
Shepard's pie really good kid two
Corn bread thingy, really good kid three
Dad one maple bacon Benny really good.along with two ceasers(excellent)
Steak and eggs with a wonderful variety of fruit,  awesome!!
Down side, egg shells in my poached eggs, service a little slow, 3 staff and only one doing everything it seems. Portions seem a little small as two of the kids needed to order a cup of soup each and two more strips of bacon."}
{"text":"I work nearby and have been waiting for this place to open.  I had the burger and fries with a side of gravy and it was outstanding.  Great service and quality food.  My lunch date had the eggs benny and was also impressed.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Ended up here by accident because I meant to go elsewhere but it was amazing! The smoked salmon eggs benny was delicious. The photos don't do justice to the hash browns which is why I wanted to go somewhere else but glad I ended up here. They were phenomenal!!! And the place is conscious about sourcing locally and being environmentally conscious as well! Ex, the chairs are \"rescued\"."}
{"text":"Cast iron cafe has one of the best selection of Bennies in town. I would recommend getting the Traditional, and the Maple smoked bacon bennies. Combine with its rustic ambience, its a great place to brunch and chill with friends.The service was great, and the staff were very nice."}
{"text":"Best brunch spot I have ever visited. I am more of a lunch person than breakfast but they have delicious and creative lunch items, as well as breakfast. A nice touch is the Cast Iron blend coffee from Kensington Roasterie which might be some of the best coffee I have ever tasted. 

Cast Iron Cafe is probably not the most inexpensive restaurant, however, all the ingredients are locally sourced. You can't pay enough for quality, especially since all the food is made from scratch. The house made biscuits on the bennys are to die for!

Another great perk of Cast Iron Cafe is the copious free parking. If driving isn't your thing, Chinook train station is maximum 2 minutes walking distance. Also, the classic rock playlist is absolutely amazing! Lots of Bowie, Led Zeppelin and The Tragically Hip!

I will be back to Cast Iron Cafe many times."}
{"text":"One of the best bennies in town! I had the caramelized onion and mushroom benny and it was delicious! The service was great, the staff was so nice and the cafe was so cute! I want to go back soon."}
{"text":"Man, you gotta love this place! The vintage decor is great (they literally traded the newer chairs that were there with older more antique ones at Good Will). Accenting that is the eclectic vintage tunes (50's soul to 90's hip hop). And the food, truly the most important part; both meals that I've had there have been quite good. Their hash is nicely seasoned, and the first time they were perfectly creamy (the 2nd time they were fine, if slightly starchy.) The eggs were always done nicely, and the biscuit under the benny & croissant under the scramble pleased! The best part is how local and quality it all is though, which is exactly what I look for in a meal out. The coffee, while local, was a bit too bitter the 2nd visit (maybe they used less grounds the 1st time?) I've found OEB suffers from the problem too; even though it's well sourced beans the cup itself is quite bitter. Maybe they're using too many beans per batch? Whatever this, 4 creams per cup made it drinkable. 

Truly the highlight was the service though. Both times I've been there we've been the only ones there, but the management went above & beyond. The 2nd time they opened 45 mins early just for us! Super friendly and eager to make our experience great, so far they're doin all the right things! I just hope that when they become more popular that they can keep up the high standard they've started with.

It's a great new breakie joint, get out there & try em!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a new breakfast spot and stopped in here since it's in the neighborhood. It's tucked away in a more industrial area attached to a car sales lot, but is easy to find and there are both some parking stalls and street parking available. When you walk in, the place is decorated a bit like a vintage country home style. It's spacious with a nice atmosphere and really great mix of music. 

My husband ordered a benny and I made my own omelette, but the menu looked fantastic with locally sourced ingredients and a made in house approach... I'll definitely be back to try more! Coffee wasn't very strong, but had great flavour (you can buy their beans) and they carry a lot of good local beers! There is a bar, but they're so new that their liquor menu hasn't been printed yet, so can't really speak to that. 

My husband liked his breakfast a lot! My omelette was on the salty side but thats my own bad! I ordered a lot of salty ingredients like feta and bacon - they're not stingy with their omelette ingredients either which I much appreciate! 

The hash browns were nicely spiced, sauteed with onions and peppers, and I like that they weren't very salty - after all you can always add salt but you can't take it away. It allowed me to add however much hot sauce or ketchup as I wanted without it turning into a salt bomb, which is a problem I find at a lot of breakfast joints. Instead, they concentrated on good flavours!

Their homemade nut butter and wild berry jam are were awesome! Way less sweet than most jams and very fresh tasting! I met the GM, Johnny, who was friendly and accommodating. The service was on point and super friendly. Definitely got the local neighborhood feel :) I would recommend you check this place out and support a new local business that also tries to keep their business local! 

Great experience at a great price!"}
{"text":"If you are looking to try an amazing hand made burger come here! The cast iron sauce and red pepper relish between the buns go amazing with the fresh arugala! I could eat 3 of them!"}
