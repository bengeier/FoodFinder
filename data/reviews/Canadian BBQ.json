{"text":"Nasty food did not enjoy my food had a hot dog and it looked days old and the person serving me was not very nice at all"}
{"text":"Food truck in front of Canadian Tire store. Have always wanted to stop for fries. Today was the day. Got poutine. Healthy portion. Only $5.75  truck was very tidy. Clean. Quick. Fresh. Friendly. Reasonable prices. Choose from hot dog, sausage, fries, poutine  & drink. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is the little hotdog stand outside of Canadian Tire. Normally you can't go wrong with places like this. But this woman continued to talk on her cellphone DURING the taking of my order. I asked for a jumbo chicken hotdog as per their menu, and she paused for a moment confused but then said \"chicken dog?\" So I said yes. Obviously the person on the phone made it hard for her to hear me clearly. She continued to stay on the phone talking while cooking my hotdog...or I should say burning the skin of my hotdog with the dirty grille they use. Then when done she handed me my food and held her hand out without even telling me a price. Good thing I saw the sign and gave her the $3.50. Again she paused confused, then pocketed the change."}
