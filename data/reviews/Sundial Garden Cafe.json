{"text":"Delicious food, great patio and service!  The owners are awesome and support local charities!  My kids loved the pancakes!"}
{"text":"This is a really great restaurant. My wife and I had lunch. The grilled chicken ciabatta had a \"to die for\" honey mustard sauce, the French onion soup was freshly made.  The owners provide excellent service. The setting is awesome and the musician just added to a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"The food was terrible.  The meat smelled funny, think it was old."}
{"text":"Rhonda was an incredibly sweet and attentive hostess and the food was good and flavorful. We caught one of the last nice mornings before summer and really enjoyed sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"Was at the sundial garden cafe yesterday and the chicken ciabbatta was amazing the salad was very fresh . they are now serving dinner and the dinner menu looked very appealing. I will surley be back to dine with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, sleepy surroundings, beautiful view, old school attentive dining experience. We had the Rhonda Renee, it was great. Fresh herbs lite sauce, very good. Looking forward to coming again and seeing what else is in store."}
{"text":"Very nice setting, very good food, fresh ingredients.  We had lunch there with our kids, perfect.  The owners are very nice people."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this lovely cafe tonight for dinner. What a treat! Everything about this cafe and the patio area is perfect. The dinner was fantastic, beautifully prepared and we enjoyed dinner outside on the patio. We were able to meet chef Shawn and thank him for the delicious meal. We will definitely be back and highly recommend. Next time, we'll try the breakfast. This would be a great place to enjoy my morning coffee!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning while visiting the enchanted pumpkin garden.  It was absolutely horrible. I had a breakfast burrito and it was greasy and flavorless. My mom had the eggs benedict and the hollaindaise sauce was chunky and greasy and tasted just odd.  We waited over 30 minutes for the food and they were not even busy, as there were many open tables. Not even sure who our server was because only saw someone when they took our order and a different person brought the food. Many hours later, the food is still haunting me."}
{"text":"I have ridden by Sundial countless times, either while cycling or on the motorcycle over the years and had never stopped here. I frequently grab some coffee and a bite on my days off in the early mornings, hitting a few favored spots regularly. This morning my buddy Jim and I decided to hop on the bikes and find a breakfast spot. Our original choice was undergoing renovations so we popped in to Sundial, drawn by the need for coffee and the prospect of a nice patio setting in this mild weather. We arrived maybe 30 minutes after opening; the staff was finishing setting everything up and in the midst of decorating for the Holidays. We were promptly greeted and found a spot on the patio, which we basically had to ourselves. It's a nice, cozy spot with plenty of shading and a good view of the town sundial, now accompanied by a large Christmas tree. Our server immediately offered some coffee and we checked out the breakfast menu.   I opted for the \"Eggcellence\", a basic dish of 2 eggs any style with choice of 4 slices of bacon or sausage links, with potatoes and toast. Jim got the more basic \"Daybreaker\": egg, 1 slice of toast and, I think, a sausage link. The food arrived in timely fashion without a long wait. The concenus was that, for what we got, it was a tad overpriced but still a good, basic breakfast. The potatoes were  nicely done and tasty, the bacon equally good. I'll need to return for more samplings of the menu but I can see coming back. There is a bagel breakfast sandwich and a breakfast burrito on the menu as well, among other items. I'd like to check out the lunch and dinner selections as well.   Service was quite good, attentive and friendly. Our young waiter made sure to check if we needed refills on the coffee ( we did ) and took the time to see we were doing ok. The ambiance is easy going, though I can only speak of the patio. The restaurant looks to be a nice place to spend some time while hanging out in Carefree / Cave Creek. Long overdue, I enjoyed this morning's visit to Sundial. I'm looking forward to another visit."}
{"text":"We frequent the town often and just found out there are new owners! Stopped in for breakfast and it was great.  New menu items including pancakes.  Nice friendly owners.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Just had dinner with my husband and we had a great time. Normally they are open for breakfast and lunch so catching them for dinner was a treat. Chef Shawn Jaynes and his wife Rhonda visited their guests table to table chatting about the Holidays, family, and interests. We had angus elk meatloaf with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The dinner was delicious and light. The gravy was one of the best parts of the meal. Desert was a pear brûlée. If you are looking for a quiet evening on the patio with good food and great friends then this is the place for you. Thank you Chef Shawn and Rhonda for a lovely evening. We are looking forward to our next trip to Carefree."}
{"text":"Went for lunch; very disappointing. Cobb salad might have been good if the lettuce had been fresh. And even more disappointing, they did not reduce the bill even though I was unable to eat half the salad.  I received a comment from Shawn after posting my review stating the server offered to remake the salad. However, this is not true; the server simply apologized but never offered a fresher salad. Consequently, I piled up the brown lettuce on one side of the plate and I ate some of the remaining salad."}
{"text":"Bang bang shrimp was bangin ! And the mahi mahi salad was beyond fresh, healthy and delicious! My bf had the crab salad and he said it was fresh and delicious as well, adding a bit of Siracha sauce to it give it a little touch! Met the chef Shawn himself and he was very friendly. His wife Rhonda was on her game and super sweet ! The staff was very attentive ! Definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"Service was nice, ambience was basic. The cafe was pretty popular even on a weekday when we came. We came as a party of three, two of us had the burgers, while I had the mahi mahi salad. Not many vegetarian options.  The salad included sliced strawberries, a mahi mahi fillet, walnut brittle, spinach, cucumber, tomato, red onion, and a strawberry honey vinaigrette. The food was pretty basic and average. Not terrible, but wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch after visiting the town. Split the chicken ciabatta sandwich with my husband and it was delicious! My daughter had the veggie burger and enjoyed it as well. Sat outside and service was prompt and very nice.  Would go back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a new owner and chef. Unfortunately they decided not to have the French dip sandwich and many other salads that made this restaurant so popular. The outdoor seating is very nice but I think you also have to be open for dinner in order to make this place work financially. They are still open for breakfast and lunch only at this time.  Please bring back the French dip.......it was the main reason we ate here!  We are still waiting for a menu to view online! I think you should be more open to adding new items on your menu."}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch at the Sundial on their cute comfortable patio!! The food was great, staff was really nice and helpful.  Also witnessed the owner/chef doing random acts of kindness while I was there!! I loved that....! A sweet little surprise! Try out this hidden jewel in the desert!! Lots of other things to do in that area, so very worth the trip!!"}
{"text":"Discover this hidden jewel in Carefree Gardens...the Chef is so personable, his waitstaff is the same.  The fountain and comfortable chairs and tables AND DOG FRIENDLY patio are just the best. BUT the best part is the food...OUTSTANDING.  I asked the chef to make me a vegetarian dinner, even though it wasn't on the menu..and he was SO accommodating and the dish was beautifully prepared and presented.  The vegetables were done perfectly.  We love being able to walk over here for breakfast, lunch or dinner (dinner is served on Thursday, Friday and Saturday).  DON'T PASS UP THIS GEM."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a bit on the pricey side, however the bacon cheddar burger was really good. I shared with boyfriend, beware there is a split fee. Overall the staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice!!!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this restaurant this past weekend. Went in with a group of six of us and the service was very good. Food was excellent. It was breakfast fare but still everyone remarked how tasty everything was. They were very busy with a pumpkin festival going on and yet the food arrived in a timely manner so that was a pleasant surprise. The outside patio was wonderful. We're going to have to return and check out the lunch (or coming soon dinner) menu."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this place just changed hands, but our experience was disappointing.  Hope they can turn things around soon."}
{"text":"Wow.  Went with my wife for their reservations only, Chefs choice 4 course meal. Everything was truly phenomenal. Prosciutto wrapped Scallops were amazing, the lemon rice and orange sauce were epic.    The bison was delicious, and I was truly a little nervous never having tried it before. Berry red wine sauce was delicious and excellent paired with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. The salad, served after the meal(traditional in France, or so my wife told me) was fresh, crisp and all the flavors really popped. The Creme Brulee finished everything off nicely.   Truly excellent meal all around. Great service, and the live music was excellent.  Even got a dance with my wife in on the musicians last song. Wonderful food, service and environment.  Not an experience or meal I will forget anytime soon.  Definitely in for the next time around they have the four course menu and anxious to try their regular menu for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"The venue is inviting on the patio overlooking the sundial in the heart of Carefree, but our food was less than ordinary.  We want this place to succeed as we're locals and could use new eateries in the area.  However, we ordered two \"Starters\" ... \"bang bang shrimp\" and \"spinach/artichoke dip\" for lunch.  The 6 small shrimp came with an orangy-colored liquid (like a French dressing) drizzled over them served along a non-descript coleslaw.  The spinach dip was extremely disappointing and nothing like one expects ... ample amount but texture was \"soupy\" and the taste flavorless, served with a dozen or more toasted bruschetta-type bread slices.   Along with ice tea and tip, $40 seemed pricey for what we got.  We wish them well ... but won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast and service!! My new favorite place for breakfast.. the signature breakfast was out of this world delicious!! My daughter and I just happened to stop in after our jog and were blown away by the friendly owners and beautiful food! You can't go wrong with this lovely place.."}
{"text":"Great location, very good food and a staff that can deal with New Englanders. We had the breakfast burrito that was the best we've had, pancakes were sized perfectly and cooked till they were crispy at the edges and the Eggcellence meal is a solid choice for the \"bacon and eggs\" customer. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"When looking for a breakfast spot before golf,  came upon this gem.   Try the Ronda Renee.   Clean surroundings and inviting staff.   Great way to enjoy the scenery while sitting outside."}
{"text":"First time visit Sundial Cafe. The food was pretty good. Little over priced but it is in a upper class area so... It is refreshing to report that they properly mitigated an issue with my meal. Too many places will just make you a new one but still require payment.  I even tried to insist that they ring me up for something so that I could leave a tip as I do not carry cash and they wouldn't. Bravo"}
