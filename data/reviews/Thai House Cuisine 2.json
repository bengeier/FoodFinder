{"text":"Delicious food, good service.  Probably the best Thai food I have ever had.  Fresh ingredients, yummy sauces and perfectly spiced!"}
{"text":"We had spent the afternoon at the Mississauga waterfront festival. Needless to say we had stuffed our faces with fries, hot dogs and many other tasty but bad for you treats. So we decided on something more light and healthier for dinner. We arrived at around 8:40, the restaurant was at 70% capacity. But most were finishing up their dinner. We were greeted and seated right away. We ordered beef salad, chicken and shrimp pad Thai, pineapple fried rice and tamarind fish. The service was fast and friendly. The food came out quickly. The portions were all fair to generous. The beef salad was on the small side for 4 people to share. But it's a great portion for a single serving. Which it was probably meant for. Definitely a miss for me. It consisted of ice burg lettuce and a few prices of tomato and even fewer pieces of cucumber. Topped off with very thin slices of over cooked tough beef. The pad Thai and fried rice were standard. The fish by far was my favorite. It's what all Thai dishes should be. Sweet, savory and spicy. Overall a good experience. Both in food and service."}
{"text":"Really love the Thai food here. I'm a vegetarian and always get the drunken noodles here. It's pretty amazing. I've also tried the green Thai curry and loved it too.
The best part is they have Singha beers which go perfect with my meal."}
{"text":"Oh my God, I'm so glad we finally caught on to the fact that there is a 2nd Thai House Cuisine.  We've been eating at the Beaches location for years, despite having moved from the Beaches to downtown, and then from downtown to the west end.   So it's been a bit of a trek for the past few years!   But I honestly think it's the best Thai in the city, so I haven't minded travelling for it. 

But I only just recently learned that there is a Port Credit location, and the food is identical!!  In fact, the restaurant looks and feels very similar too.  Favourites include Cashew Nut Chicken, Green Curry Chicken or beef, Drunken Noodle chicken, Hot & Sour soup, and definitely the vegetable spring rolls!

We did takeout, so I can't speak to the customer service.  But the food is delicious as always, and I'm sure we'll be back soon to report on a dine-in experience."}
{"text":"In a word, decent.

I'd walked by Thai House Cuisine several times over the past few years, and was put off by how cold and quiet it looked from the exterior. I finally went a few weeks back with some friends, and it was an okay experience.

It's pretty hard to screw up Thai food, and in that regard, Thai House Cuisine was average. I had the lunch special (chicken pad thai) with the coconut soup, and the people I was eating with hated the latter so much that I took their portions for them. We also had to request some additional spices, which complimented the dishes quite well.

The portion sizes were okay, but smaller than my usual haunt (Thai Signature down the road). The ambience was decent, if bland, and the service was very good.

I am somewhat irked that I had to pay $2.50 per soft drink refill, which wasn't communicated on the menu. Imagine my shock when my assumed $10 order came out to nearly $20 because of a couple extra refills.

Thai House Cuisine seems like a solid place to go, but considering how many other competing restaurants there are in the village and surrounding areas, there are probably better locations for your time and money."}
{"text":"Food was really good here considering I ordered delivery. Probably the best delivery food I've had in years.

Ordered the Green curry chicken, Spicy Shrimp, Veggie Pad Thai and Coconut Rice

Green chicken curry: now..I'm always on edge when I order green chicken curry from Thai restaurants..everyone has their own variation..I find majority of Thai restaurants put way too much bamboo and basil in the green curries. Doesn't mean it's not tasty, but I prefer a thicker, darker green curry with no Bamboo and a deeper spice profile. This one was the latter, lots of bamboo and basil. I know people like this version, it was still tasty though and absolutely nothing wrong with it. 

Spicy shrimp: also very tasty. Had red and green peppers, carrots, green beans, a sweet and spicy (no msg, thank god) sauce. It was delicious. Shrimp was fresh and perfectly cooked. My only complaint is that it was $14.99 and it only had about 6 shrimp in it. Usually I would deduct a star, but it was actually so tasty and fresh, it was worth it to me.

Pad Thai: probably one of the best pad Thai I ever had. Ordering noodles in delivery can be pretty iffy because they can become mushy and very sticky and gross. Not the case here. It was loaded with veggies like broccoli, bok Choy, carrots, tofu etc. it had a charred sweet and savoury tang to it. Was really nice, I can never go back to the crap I was eating before. Also came with crushed peanuts. 

Coconut rice: was amazing. Rice was perfectly cooked, with a nice rich creamy coconut flavour !

All in all, I would order from here again! Really great delivery place! The food wasn't heavy, oily and greasy like so many Asian spots. I tasted the freshness, it tasted like home cooking. 

But I would actually like to go to the actual restaurant even more !

Definitely check this place out"}
{"text":"Came for Saturday dinner with my family, ordered drunken noodle, tamarind beef curry, Pad Thai, basil chicken and cashew chicken. The drunken noodle is the best as it tasted really unique and flavourful. I haven't had this anywhere else even Though I ate at a lot of Thai restaurants. The tamarind beef was very good, mixed just right with the curry. However, the cashew chicken tasted like something out of a healthy steamers microwaveable box, the basil chicken was made with too much salt and the pad Thai was over sweet. In addition, the water they provided for the table was not cold and had a strong taste of chlorine. Not only that, they got our order wrong, replacing the Drunken noodle seafood for seafood soup. They then had the audacity to declare that we ordered wrong."}
{"text":"We have always been in search of authentic Thai cuisine. Our family acquired the taste during various visits at the Oriental  in Bangkok and other popular locales.
Our litmus test of authenticity is how a Candian resto makes and serves Tom Yom Goong the shrimp soup and a salad like Papaya, Mango, or beef 
for example. And also as to what the various curries taste like. Pad Thai for us is not really a discerning feature on which Thai food should be selected.
We can with all integrity say that Thai House is among the top  five Thai establishments in GTA. We tried their Shrimp soup, coconut soup,  Beef salad, and Drunkard fish. We specifically asked that  we need the Thai taste and not  that made for FARANG. And we were not disappointed. All spices were so balanced tht we did not need any condiments. Service was superior and our server Sarina was so humble and polite, a real Thai. We will keep repeating. Their drunkard fish demands it.

This location was closed and has re opened with the same great taste (Updated April 5/15)"}
{"text":"The server was excellent. She was really polite and helpful.

The place looks classy and the prices were pretty good too. 

We got the chicken wings as an appetizer and that was really good, I was eating it until there was really nothing to eat left lol. 

We both ordered the Pad Thai and we agreed that it good but not amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic dishes along with clean and friendly service. The restaurant (and washrooms) are very clean. Priced really well. There are a lot of Thai restaurants and this one stands above the rest. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I 100% recommend. Best Thai cuisine I've ever had. We had the spring rolls, drunken noodle, and the shrimp fried rice. Everything was incredible, amazing mix of flavours. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"A good lunch option near where we were working.  It was empty when we arrived for lunch, but the nearby options weren't any busier.  So, we were a little scared at first, but it turned out to be pretty good.  They offer a short lunch menu, at lunch prices, and it's worth it.  The spicy beef, though not the spiciness I expected, was good.  Perhaps you need to request extra heat.  Pad thai was reportedly right on as well.  You get soup and a spring roll to start.  We left satisfied, thinking we couldn't have had a better lunch.

Cough drop mints at the end were a little weird, but I expect no less weirdness from any Asian restaurant.

4 stars for a perfect lunch option.  Come on Yelpers, get in on this."}
{"text":"Our go-to place for Thai food in Mississauga. My family and I have been going to Thai House 2 for maybe 5-10 years now, and the waitress knows our order by heart, even if we haven't gone in a while. It's changed ownership a few times but the food and service have always been consistently great. 

Our go to orders are
Mango Salad
Chicken Wings - normally I would never order chicken wings at a Thai restaurant, but we ordered them once and we get them every time now! They are so crispy and they usually only give you the wings. 
Drunken Noodle - rice noodle with lots of heat, but it's also very flavorful and better than pad Thai IMO 
Green Curry 
Basil Beef
Thai Eggplant - definitely packs a kick of heat with the chili peppers, but again very flavorful and delicious with the drunken noodle and some rice! 

Mondavi red is also reasonably priced here!"}
{"text":"The pad thai here was amazing and the prices were very reasonable. The place was very nice. However, the two people tables are very small. The service was good and they were very fast. i would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"The best Thai I've ever had. If they had delivery we would probably order from here on a weekly basis. The restaurant interior is a little lack-luster, but the food more than makes up for it. We usually grab take out twice a month from here. Some of our favorites include green mango salad, chicken/shrimp coconut soup, green curry chicken, basil beef and pad thai.

If you pay cash on pickup they give a 10% discount ;)"}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior restaurant front fool you. This is well worth the visit. We have been going to this restaurant for close to 20 years. The flavours are incredible. We usually have thick chicken curry, drunkard fish, glass noodle, a vegetable dish and have never been disappointed!  Monica is our favourite server there and always gives us great suggestions to try something new!  Five thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Little pricey but it's always worth it. I love the eating environment, decor and the calming music. Their pad-thai is absolutely amazing. All the components (salty, spicy, savory and sweet) are all there. Their appetizer platter is very promising. I probably go here whenever that craving for some Thai food pops up!"}
{"text":"This is our go to for Thai food in the area. 
They are super accommodating of gluten free requests which we really appreciate. 

Favourites:
Roasted duck curry 
Lemongrass chicken soup
Drunkard fish 
Pad See Eu 
Mango salad
Shrimp chips

It can be tricky to get through for a pick up order at peak times so call early or just stop by to place your order."}
{"text":"Who knew there'd be a pretty decent Thai restaurant in Mississauga!?! We ordered the phad Thai which had a generous mixture of tofu, chicken and shrimp. Taste was pretty authentic though a bit sweet for my tastes. Also had the red curry duck. Sauce was nice and creamy (could be spicier though). Duck meat was ok but lived the pieces of lychee in it. Best part of the meal was the mango and sticky rice. Mmmm, sweet mango and savory rice was spot on and brought back memories of Thailand."}
{"text":"Their Thai food is so far the best in Mississauga. I loved their pineapple chicken fried rice and pad thai chicken, it is fresh and juicy. The saltness is right on the scale and not too powerful or bland. I also love the atmosphere and the services here, it kinda bring me to a short trip to Thailand for an hour or so. Would love to come back again."}
{"text":"Tried this place for dinner last night.  The outside doesn't look like much but once you come inside it's warm and inviting.  This would be a nice place for a date.  Decor is nice with wine glasses and table cloths and the food is reasonable in price and delicious.  We shared a mango salad which was refreshing and a great start.  I ordered pad Thai and my partner ordered shrimp yellow curry.  We ended up switching our meals (not because we didn't like it) but because we were eyeing each others dish! Lol portions were great, I even got to enjoy some leftovers for my lunch today

Service was great and the owner even came by to ask how our meal was - great touch. 

Will definitely come here again- I have my eye on that duck curry with lychee"}
{"text":"3.5*  I thought this place was a-okay.  Pumped up for its friendly wait-staff.  It didn't blow me outta the water or anything, and there wasn't really anything wrong about my experience at Thai House Cuisine 2.

Atmosphere was bright and contemporary, painted out white.  I did spot some pen marks on the white vinyl of the chairs though which stood out like a sore thumb 'cause the rest of the restaurant was a stark white, but I'm just being picky now.

Service was very friendly and food came out quickly.

I ordered the Basil Spicy Noodles (beef) and it was definitely spicy, no holding back, but it was also heavy on the sodium.  Perhaps I didn't quite know what I was ordering, but the \"sauce\" was the juices from stir frying the slices of beef.  Meat was not overcooked/dry, so that was good!

It was a solid place, but nothing really STOOD out, re:  nothing would draw me back / make me order alcohol / apps."}
{"text":"Coconut Rice!

You have to try it! 

I went here twice!

A definite staple is the coconut rice. It was a sweet and salty taste to it. Mix it with anything you definitely wont go wrong.

Another must try is the spicy fish. I still love red curry on it but their sweet and spicy is great too."}
{"text":"First impressions were great! Great decor, warm atmosphere...then there was the food...and the ANTS.

Once seated no water was brought to the table, and we had to wait quite some time before someone came to take our order (we had to ask for water). We ordered a vegetable coconut soup that was barely warm (could have been hotter) and VERY salty! Our main meal was a mixed vegetable stir fry. It was okay- more on the bland side. The best part of the main was the Siracha hot sauce we had to ask for! 

Dessert was quite nice to be honest. We had a deep fried banana with ice cream! Was a great treat after a very bland meal.

Food aside, I was very disappointed with the ants crawling around (surprising considering the restaurant boasts great decor and ambiance). Initially I noticed one crawling on my napkin, then proceeded to look over to the wall and noticed a large number of our tiny little ant friends crawling over the walls and behind the mirror. We pointed this out to our server. She walked away. After noticing us eyeing the walls uncomfortably she finally asked us if we wanted to move. We obliged and moved...one table over. No apology. 

Quite disappointed with this. Ants crawling around a restaurant is just not acceptable. What boggled my mind was that a few minutes after we moved we noticed her setting up the table again for another customer....really? 

I really hope this review comes to the attention of public health inspectors and to management who hopefully will make some changes and get the ant situation under control. Cheers and happy eating!!!"}
{"text":"Had take out - lemon grass seafood soup had 1 shrimp 2 mussels, 4 squid - for two people really?
Very tough chewy Basil Beef - sauce good
Lots of red curry sauce 3 slices of chicken - sauce good
Smallest lettuce filled fresh roll
Typical spring roll 
Mango salad good

Over all cheap servings typical flavours all for 60$. 
Not impressed for that pricing they should take a look at the Queen Mother for inspiration

Do not recommend and will not return."}
{"text":"We were first timers to this place. We tried the duck salad, spicy beef, and pork noodle. All were delicious. My SO likes duck so really enjoyed the salad - it's  a better choice is you've already tried duck as you taste more of the dressing/extra ingredients instead of the duck, but overall a good choice.

The beef had coconut milk and curry - very delicious and the pork noodles with Chinese broccoli was very good.

The service was prompt and polite. The restaurant itself was clean and appears more upscale with wine glasses for water. Will definitely visit again and would highly recommend."}
