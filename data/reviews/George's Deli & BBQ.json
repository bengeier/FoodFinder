{"text":"I refuse to go to the Hero Burger or the ACME up the street and support their sassy staff who don't give rats ass, when there's this little gem around the corner. This particular George's chain is far better then the one on the east end by a landslide. This is the cheapest, best greasy spoon in the annex, and they don't mess around. Chicken, burgers, spaghetti, souvlaki, poutine, salad... whatever you're in the mood for, Sam will make ya' something nice, with all the fixings."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery a few times from here via Justeat.com
The smoked meat sandwhiches are okay but make you feel slightly sick afterwards because of the amount of grease.
My problem is with the service. The restaurant always calls asking me to come down for the food when the buzzer number is on the label- buzzing and coming up in the building seems to always cause confusion.
The last 2 times the driver was extremely rude, had long nails and smelled like urine. It makes me question the cleanliness of the restaurant and food."}
{"text":"The portions are very generous and the prices are very cheap considering your getting fresh chicken at any hour of the day or night that they're open. Not a fan of the spaghetti and meatballs, but you might be. I stick to the timeless classic - half chicken and fries."}
{"text":"I eat here rarely more out of a sense of nostalgia than for any epicurean reasoning. There's something about their quarter chicken with fries (don't forget the gravy!) and a pop that harkens back to the \"good 'ol days.\" A time where everything was simpler and you figured that the way things were would be the way that they are for the rest of your life.

Above all else, this place is consistent. Those fries taste like fries always did in your childhood. That gravy could very well be the Platonic ideal from which all other generic gravies are produced. And that chicken? Slightly crispy skin with meat that isn't really dry but isn't really moist either. Merely a decent rendition of rotisserie style chicken. The comme ci comme ca of chicken, if you will.

I always feel a bit depressed after eating one of these meals. Maybe it's the feeling that what once was never will be again. Maybe it's because the chicken I just had was boring and I could have spent the money on better things. Hmm yeah, on second thought, the chicken is just that boring. Sometimes old habits die hard."}
{"text":"Great value for money. Not the healthiest but great for what it is. A quarter chicken, fries, gravy and salad plus a drink for under 10 bucks. Cant be beaten."}
{"text":"Sandwich was fine decent fine but not the best smoked meat I've had. Potato salad good texture but taste was blah maybe some salt will help. Ribs stewed meat was cooked well but not overly tastey. Just kind if watered down BBQ flavor."}
{"text":"diamond in the rough,  walking through crackheads to this late night  take away culinary oasis., dont for get to try the gravy."}
{"text":"Great chicken and fries and good customer service.  I have never been disappointed!  I hear that the cheesburgers are good too but I've never had one myself."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and consistently good. Love the chicken sandwich and the burger. During the day its super rammed with students from the high school next door. I usually stop by evenings or weekends."}
{"text":"I usually came here to buy take out.  I find the bbq chicken to be well seasoned with slightly crisp skin.  The price here is very reasonable as well.  Obvious you'd get better value than buying bbq chicken from let's say... Metro... I haven't tried their other items such as burger but I probably will next time.  This is very family run business and the service is always warm and courteous.  3.5 out of 5 overall."}
{"text":"Friendly, very simple burger joint. I got the cheeseburger and it was juicy and tasty, and most importantly, topped with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"To me, George's represents the perfect Toronto food experience. The food is not only extremely tasty but pretty cheap and generously proportioned. Also, there is always the chance you could get shot, which I think is the most important part. 

Based on the activity inside the restaurant, you'd swear that George's was a front for some kind of crime-based operation but all I can say is, if it is, it's a hell of a front. This food is great.

The best deal on the menu is surely the 1/2 chicken spaghetti, which is literally a huge take out container filled with a 1/2 a chicken and a ton of spaghetti. The chicken is rotisserie and predictably delicious. Greasy, tender and incredibly flavourful. I think it's about $10. What a deal!

If you're either not as hungry or just in the mood for a sandwich I'd recommend the chicken sandwich. Simple, delicious. Very similar to the chicken sandwich at Kathy's Corner."}
{"text":"If you can ignore the sketchiness of this neighbourhood you will find that this place is a great deal for a filling meal!  Wait wait let me try again...

There is a little dive gem in this colourful neighbourhood were you can buy half a chicken with spaghetti in a large container for around $10!  You get a generous portion of rotisserie chicken with another generous portion of spaghetti.  I'm pretty sure you can get fries and gravy instead of spaghetti but I've never got anything but the spaghetti when I get the chicken.  The chicken is solid, the spaghetti not so much but very filling.

The BBQ chicken sandwich and the roast beef sandwiches are ok but I've really only stuck to the chicken meal for the sheer value!  If I don't finish it I have another meal later!"}
{"text":"Great rotisserie chicken. Fast family dinners: Great tasting chicken, amazing fries and awesome Greek salad.  Always a great family treat.  Fast friendly service in a family run place.  Must try."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in an interesting neighbourhood.  I love the quarter chicken with fries, smothered in some of the best gravy I can find in the city.  The corned beef on a Kaiser is also an amazing sandwich from here.

Staff is very friendly, the food is cheap, and it tastes amazing. Some of the best comfort food!"}
{"text":"I have walked past here I don't know how many times, so last night I decided to give it a try. Right away I knew I was going to like this little place.  It has a super friendly family owned atmosphere and the customers were really friendly as well. I ordered the burger and fries due to the fact there were signs everywhere saying it was the best in Toronto SO naturally I was attracted to that. My boyfriend got the chicken leg combo. While we were waiting for our food my boyfriend noticed that the owners were Greek and so he started talking to them and told them he was half greek. They loved that and they began to talk for the entire time while we waited for our food. It was really cute. 
The food itself was so worth the money. We paid under 20$ for both with tip and we were extremely full and satisfied. It really was a great burger!

We might just become regulars here!"}
{"text":"For a somewhat healthy meal late night downtown Toronto george's chicken is great. The only flaw is the location and outdated interior. Other then that its well worth the $"}
{"text":"Not in the best area of town..especially at night but the bbq chicken is good..if you're really hungry.try the chicken rib combo"}
{"text":"Pretty poor. We went on the basis of these reviews and they let us down. Soggy fries, unappetising, fatty ribs, with the rotisserie chicken being the best of a lousy lot. On the upside, the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Good, home-style cooking and fair value for chicken, burgers and typical Greek diner food. Friendly staff. Not exceptionally clean but good enough for cheap eats."}
{"text":"On your way to George's you get a little worried based on its neighborhood, and then you walk up to the door and something tells you not to go in, but once you do you quickly re-learn that saying your mom used to tell you-don't judge a book by it's cover. The best roasted chicken in the city, by far. Also, they deliver and they are fast. Prices are very reasonable. The family that works there are very humble and you can tell by their food that they love cooking chicken. Do not hesitate to try this spot."}
{"text":"I've been here lot of times. The spaghetti and meet sauce are pretty good. Chicken and ribs are not bad. The service are pretty good too. Although the locating is ghetto and people around the area is ghetto. It is pretty good for its priced."}
{"text":"Its a friendly Mom and Pops greasy spoon that serves value.
They have old fashion combos that  remind me of my days during high school and university. 

George's Deli & BBQ is bot bad."}
{"text":"their chicken and fries with gravy is the best and the staff are friendly. will keep coming here even though its in a shady part of T.O. The best time to go is during the day because not many shady characters there then. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"**Delivery review so interpret it how you like**

Firstly, the delivery man was unusually grumpy, didn't say a word just shoved the bag into my hands and left. Now this is not the restaurant's fault still not a positive note to start the meal off on.

I ordered the chicken and rib dinner as it was on the popular items page. The ribs were not very good, a poorly selected piece of meat, the sauce was strange and tasted like old BBQ, and the ribs were very small. The chicken was a little bit better kind of tasted like the ones you get from Loblaws but not worth the price. As a side I had fries which were soggy and not flavorful. Comes with a dinner roll like the ones you get at the grocery store. Gravy was okay nothing to write home about and the coleslaw was thrown out after one bite.

Would not order from here again, I would rather eat at the grocery store and could probably do it for less."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. The amazing burgers are homemade like those of childhood. But this time, on the recommendation of the server, I had the chicken and spaghetti. Wonderful tender juicy chicken and great pasta. Great independent 'hole in the wall'."}
{"text":"This place is great for late night delivery only (till 4am).  The only thing decent to order on their menu is the 10 wing dinner that comes with fries, bun, gravy and coleslaw.  Everything is not worth trying.  I've tried their spaghetti and meatballs which is very sweet and just a massive amount of pasta with awful tomato sauce and yuck meatballs.  Again only good for late night delivery and their wing dinner.  I'm not saying the wing dinner is amazing, but what do you expect for ordering food past 1am."}
{"text":"I should know her name (?) the lady who runs it is SUPER friendly, polite, genuine.  I like her a lot.  Similar to the George's on Dundas it's been sold and George has moved on (Greece I believe!?).  The name remains, cool sign, etc.  This location could use some renovation, it looks pretty rundown.  Chicken is good; fries, gravy... YUM."}
{"text":"A bit of a downtown institution.
Great chicken, fries, gravy, spaghetti, burger, wings...  The place would be an interesting documentary, the area is rundown and the constant flow of people is 'interesting'.  I used to love the 'photo' wall back in the day; customers eating their food (I was on there! alongside Master T and other huge celebrities ;)  I also used to like the photo of SHAQ in his long fur after an early in the franchise raptors/magic game.  George the owner (gone now; back to Greece I believe) was an interesting man, hard worker.  George's has fed a lot of homeless people in their day, no uncommon for them to cut deals for homeless/addicts, or free fries, etc..  George's adds character to the neighbourhood and most importantly; adds very good chicken/fries."}
{"text":"I absolutely love George's Deli & BBQ! It has been a place I frequent religiously over the years, always coming back to their delicious homemade food. Ever since I found the place back when I worked in the area, and had a sampling of not only the chicken but the burgers too, I have never looked back! You have to go here, and try the rotisserie chicken, its delightful. Not only are they known for the chicken, but in my opinion the burgers are top-notch just as well. Personally...I find it a toss up between the burgers here and Burger's Priest...Such a hard choice. Now I'm just spreading the love, and I seriously think everyone needs to try this place, if not the burgers...then at least the chicken, because I'm sure you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am a bit of a gutter pig when it comes to good, greasy food, so this place suited me right down to the ground. In my hood when I was in the Regent Park area, it was a fairly regular stop on the way home from late drinks or just for after work. I always got the double leg dinner with fries. Ask for salt and pepper on the fries and gravy on the side. It's heaven on earth. Also check out the fish and chips. Very good for pre-made. The only complaint is the chicken can be kind of dry on occasion, but it's more than compensated for by the fact that it's open until 4am almost everyday and the prices are oh so reasonable. Skip Swiss Chalet any day for this place. Slumming it never tasted so good!"}
{"text":"Had a quarter chicken dark combo with fries, gravy and cole slaw. Wasn't bad but wasn't great either. Small piece of dry chicken that I had to dunk in gravy to enjoy. Wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"I've been coming to George's on and off since I was told about it in the 90's and after grabbing a bite last Friday night, I decided to finally write a quick review.

You're up and haven't eaten and its 2:00am.  You're hungry and  you something other than the usual Golden Arches and you think 'chicken and spaghetti'.  'Healthier' option, right? lol

The great thing about George's chicken is that a quarter chicken dinner with spaghetti is filling.  Pasta is filling period let alone a half chicken dinner with white meat.  No dining room here though but there's a small standup counter ledge that you can use if you have to eat it there.

Having said that....................the last few times I've been there, I've noticed that the chicken no longer has that 'smokey churrasqueira bbq' flavor that it used to have.  Its just a bbq'd piece of chicken that you pray isnt undercooked.  I've had to peel away pieces of rubbery fat that are simply unappetizing.  Mind you, if youre a 'soldier' like myself, you simply peel away the rubber and dig in.  

As of late though, there's been too much peeling away before I can start eating...

The spaghetti noodles weren't soggy which is all I ask so no issues there plus you get a nice large portion.  The sauce won't knock your socks off but for take-out with some chicken, its more than adequate.  You can get fries instead of spaghetti if you like which probably means a fresh batch if you go at the right time but spaghetti is much more filling if you're starved.

I just wish they'd get back to that original smokey churrasqueira chicken flavor that made them famous.  Its almost like now they're riding on the name.  Conclusion - if its late hours, its a great option but if you're within regular dinner hours, id shop around."}
{"text":"Fries and gravy are pretty good but the chicken was way too dry.  Get it covered in gravy and it is a bit better.

I would almost rather get one of those pre-cooked chickens from a grocery store."}
{"text":"While this place is probably incredibly popular among Central Tech high-school students. I feel sorry that George's is within walking distance not only to them, but also within the Annex community. 

Walked in and ordered their chicken and fries, sat down to eat because we were in that mode of starvation. And what does one of the owners do? She whips out her Oven Cleaner and proceeds to spray the oven, to clean it. Yes, that's right!!!! 

While it may have been nearing the end of the night, therefore certain cleaning tasks need to be done, this is unacceptable! No matter how far away from the kitchen we sat, the fumes of that cleaner spread so far back into our eating area, that upon consuming the food, it was as if we ourselves were ingesting those fumes. We were, and we did, regardless.  

Thankfully, scratch that, unthankfully, prior to her spraying the oven cleaner, we managed to take a couple bites, but to no avail. This food is flavourless, bland, putried! UGH... And here is what else... 

1.) HOW UNINTELLIGENT does one need to be in oder to spray the oven cleaner while patrons are still in their establishment, eating!!??! THIS is something done at the end of the shift, ONCE THE STORE is CLOSED for the night, not while customers are still in their trying to enjoy the food that you essentially just poisoned by the toxic oven cleaner.  

2.) Once we sat at the back their seemed to be a greasy film on the table, on the backs of the chairs, that couldn't be wiped down even if one tried. 

3.) The seats are filthy....especially the cushion & the cloth. They look like thousands upon thousands of trucks have driven over them and have then subsequently been selected as the fabric for the cushions on these chairs. DISGUSTING! 

While regrettably, choosing to stay here while we ate, we were getting pretty pissed and rightly so, we said, \"this is disgusting\", during the time the woman \"wiped\" and \"cleaned\" the tables around us, the woman heard us, and got offended, \"WHAT, WHATS DISGUSTING\" She pretty much yelled at us. HA! 

At that point (much before then actually) it was time for us to leave! 

NEVER AGAIN!

if you venture here, you are eating at your own risk!"}
{"text":"I'm hungry just writing this review.

I lived 2 blocks north of George's.
The first time i went in, i found home.

The place is most memorable for their chicken. 
The burgers and everything is good, but the chicken - mwuah, to die for.

The place is owned by a greek family (the father and daughter will often be found working together) and it's a piece of history. Don't know why, but they used to have the entire wall covered with their local press coverage, but no more....

But back to food - it's so good, that i ordered the family meal for myself. I can never have enough left over of george's, but there's nothing like it fresh though all the same.

My staple order was the family meal ($25) which came with a huge crispy moist rotisserie chicken, a huge salad (not special, but my dog always enjoyed it), a huge plate of white rice with their special tomato sauce, and a huge huge plate of freshly deep fried amazing fries. I always got hot sauce on the side. On other days, it was the double leg dinner (i'm a dark meat kinda guy really). 

The point really is, go to George's for comfort food and a piece of history. If you're feeling like a pizza night, or a shawarma night, consider George's first. 

George's is just one of those places that can easily become a staple meal in your home."}
{"text":"They have there good days and bad I've been going here since I was a kid. I've lived in the area my whole life.  It's not as scary  or bad as people on her claim in to be. As long as your aware of your surroundings  and avoid the end/begging of the month time. The lady when cooking will make your order to the exact liking. 

I always get my fries crispy because I ask to keep them in longer. As for the rostied chicken  the dark meat is always moist. Great without adding anything to it. The white meat I find I have to have gravy with it. 

There wings are really good if you want to spend a bit of money. ( less than $20 full meal). 

I personally avoid the fish because it is frozen and cooked to order. 

My daughter loves there speghtti plain. Not there sauce said it's like ketchup ( I don't eat tomtatoes).

There burgers you can not have lettuce on them because they don't have any (disappointment).

But over all in the last 15 years the food hasn't changed to much and is really good. 

There are some employees that are more friendly than others but great place to pick up and go home with on a late night. And forget my crock pot meal.

This is a cash only business too."}
{"text":"George's chicken at this location is in a sketchy neighborhood, with sketchy people on the street corners and no place I would feel comfortable leaving my car.

That being said, no matter how you get to this corner and through the doors (you're on your own for that buddy) the people inside are extremely friendly.  The food is cheap, delicious and plentiful.

I want to try their Beaches location because I really don't see myself going back to this intersection (and I would NEVER go there after dark), but in a purely review-the-food kind of way, this is pretty good chicken dinner takeout.

PS... You have to take it out - there is not a single table or chair to be had here.

I think I would rather try a different rotisserie chicken than go back here, but it was okay."}
{"text":"This place is a staple in my house.  While I'm not a big fan of much else on their menu, their rotisserie chicken is brilliant - always moist inside with a delicious crispy skin.  We served George's chicken to friends of ours who live at the end of the Danforth and they now drive all the way over to buy the chicken.  It's that good."}
{"text":"I'd never really thought of George's BBQ as a dine-in type of establishment, but what is a girl to do when she's really hungry and the smell of food circulating in the car just might drive her insane? Have a double-date with doubles of her and her date apparently! 

The mirrored wall at the elevated back seating area of George's which has only a thin enough counter to fit your tray on allows you to eat your dinner right in front of your reflection. Never fear again that you've got a streak of greasy chicken skin across your cheek or ketchup splatters across your chest. You can now check yourself out unabashedly throughout your entire meal. 

Tender juicy skin on BBQ'd chicken, too greasy fries that always somehow still manage to hit the spot, curiously square and no-doubt frozen for too long fried fish filets, and sticky food court trays. Hurray!"}
{"text":"Ordered double order hot wings and 1 lb ribs through Foodora.

The wings were crispy and delicious, just the right amount of spice, however it wasn't the juiciest and the size left me feeling unsatisfied (see picture for reference). 

But, the saved themselves by giving me three bonus wings, bringing the total wing count to 29. 

Ribs were BOMB, on the sweeter side, no bbq taste, cartilage cooked to perfection.

Try their gravy too."}
{"text":"I love this place, been coming here for years, even when it used to be north of Bloor. 

You can get a great, juicy burger with a big helping of crisp fries with gravy for under $8. 

Or you can go to Hero Burger or Burger's Priest and pay twice as much and wait longer for something not as good or filling, it's up to you."}
{"text":"Meh, take it of leave it. If you're looking for cheap, late night eats then go for it. I had the wing dinner which came with 10 wings and a hefty portion of French fries. I asked for medium sauce on my wings; I think I'll go for the hot next time. The wings arent seasoned so they're pretty bland even with the sauce. The fries were pretty good. I got gravy on the side; which was nothing special...little watery for my liking. I'll go back. The price is right and the food is okay."}
{"text":"Had the poutine here. It was the worst poutine I have ever had. The fries were absolutely tasteless. The gravy was gross and the cheese was just shredded cheese (not cheese curds) and did not taste good either. Will not order here again."}
{"text":"Come here pretty much every week. It's a classic ma and pa restaurant that has great deals and amazing chicken"}
{"text":"Hidden gem of hearty, if slightly greasy, BBQ chicken and fries.

Yes they have sandwiches, and burgers. But this place is known locally for it's rotisserie chicken. I have been coming here for ages and though it totally looks rough around the edges  (especially in evenings) the food is filling and tasty with good portions, prices that haven't changed in forever, and friendly counter staff. 

A go-to spot for after-drinks meals on a weekend, or even a quick lunch stop passing through the neighbourhood. 

And yes there really was a George...super nice guy!"}
{"text":"We were on our way to a picnic in Christie Pits with some buddies (free baseball on Wednesdays and Sundays... so fun!), and we forgot to bring picnic snacks. What the cluck. The idea of pizza pizza or hero burger made us feel gross, so we popped into George's. The man behind the counter was super sweet and quickly assembled a stellar picnic basket (plastic bag) for us. 

Their chickens are juicy, with perfectly crispy skin. Really stellar bird. However, their sides (fries, rice) are both highly meh... but it's not called George's Fries & Rice... and they were cheap, so we didn't let the extras ruin our super sweet picnic."}
{"text":"Ok. First things first. The other reviews both bothered to point out the sketchy location of George's Chicken. It's true, it's on one of the bad corners in Cabbagetown -- but that's the beauty of this hood: where millionaires and crackheads collide in a perfect (and SAFE) harmony.

The chicken is good, the fries and gravy are great, the sides are cheap and average. Basically, you can get something here that is WAY better and half of the price of Swiss Chalet or KFC. 

I'll be back! Cluck cluck."}
