{"text":"Overpriced, unspectacular food, $7 bottles of beer, and shoddy, inattentive service...   But man, you're not gonna find too many places to sit under an umbrella, in the sun, on the water in the city, couple beers, and some peel and eat shrimp... Rode my bike out to meet my old man. Bike path comes directly to the dock   Definitely don't stop here if you're in a rush, or on a budget.  Almost left it 3 stars... But seriously, there are still restaurants that allow smoking?!  Thankfully they weren't next to our table. 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Awful service, overpriced food. Don't waste your money! On arrival, waitress seemed lost.  Ordered food for 3 adults, one kid, food came for adults, after a couple of minutes my mom asked when my sons food would be coming, waitress said she would check, came back and said his pizza hadnt been cooked yet. Cancelled the pizza, paid $4 for a little bowl of white lettuce with some cheese thrown on it, fried shrimp was expense, but looked like cookie cutter frozen shrimp. Spoke to manager, who had a horrible attitude and found out that the waitress never put the pizza order in for my son and then lied and told the manager he wasnt at the table when we ordered our food. If you give these people your money, it would be foolish!"}
{"text":"the setting of redfin blues is supreme. in just a short drive, you feel like you're not in the city anymore with the water views and breeze. you can watch the more-well-to-do folks on their motorboats and listen to the lounge singer.   the food is good, but not superb. but nothing can really compete with the surroundings anyway, so good is good enough in this case.   the best part? you can take a walk around the beautiful trail on Washington's Landing after your meal to stretch your legs (and your stomach), and to catch a gorgeous pgh skyline view."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh restaurant that opens \"for the season.\"  I went to Redfin Blues with a family member recently, as she recently moved to Pittsburgh's North Shore.  This establishment is not new, but definitely picks up in business when the weather is nice.  Redfin Blues was packed around 7 PM on a Sunday night (it helped that the weather was gorgeous). We only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, relaxing and sipping on Corona's with lime. Upon being seated, we decided to split some appetizers (chicken quesedillas and peel-n-eat shrimp). The cocktail sauce for the shrimp was amazing and shrimp was plentiful. The quesadillas were hot and filled with hearty ingredients of cheese, meet, sour cream and salsa.  If anything, check this place out for the deck.  Was I in Pittsburgh, PA?!  I was proud of my hometown for its uncanny way bringing opportunities of discovery to a hometown resident."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would, but since there  is a minimum of 1 star it will be for the potential this place has based on location. This might be the worst restaurant that I have ever been to. I've had better food in hospital cafeteias. I had the fish tacos. It tasted loke the fish had been thawed and refrozen many times. I didnt eat it. The only edible item was my 1 year old's grilled cheese. The ambiance is very nice sight wise, but is destroyed by the music played by the staff. There is no excuse for Willow Smith I whip my hair back and forth to be played in 2016. I'm pretty sure the staff played it so that they could whip their hair around rather than wait on any table. I think this could be a really great place on the water but ultimately fails in every way."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday after a day boating.  Peel and eat shrimp were dry and tough, not fresh.  Ordered crab cakes, they were dry and the crab tasted old as well.  Might be good for a place to have drinks, but their overpriced old food was not enjoyable. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Totally underrated by the Yelpers!  I freakin' LOVE Redfin Blues.  I'm kind of glad it had a low rating previously to keep y'all away while I was living in Pittsburgh!  The only reason I'm even reviewing it now is because I have moved away and I'm not at risk for losing my table to a Yelp reader.  Also, I feel guilty at not letting people in on this gem.  To be clear, I LOVE Redfin Blues for a very SPECIFIC purpose: sitting outside on the patio by the water on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon drinking the bar out of Red Stripe and white wine and eating peel and eat shrimp by the 2 pound bowl with B, Ems, Boyfriend, and whoever else is so lucky.  It is a hidden gorgeous Pittsburgh oasis under the 31st bridge near Washington's Landing (note: the Yelp map is wrong) where you don't feel at all like you're in Pittsburgh, but instead on vacation.  Disclaimer: I have heard that at night it is full of strange frat boys (from no actual fraternity), Cougars, tramps, creatures of the night  -- or undesirables.  I don't go at night so my credibility wanes here a little.  I basically only ever eat the peel and eat shrimp.  It's just cooked shrimp - sometimes it's big, sometimes it's little.  But it's $17 for TWO pounds which isn't too overpriced especially since it can feed a tableful of friends.  Ask for extra old bay if you like it spicy and salty - yum! I've also had the fried cod sandwich - the fish is crisp and flaky and darn good!  I always take it off the bread to keep it as crispy as possible but those who know me know I have an obsession with fried crispy-ness.  The breading isn't too too heavy so that is a plus too.  I've also had the crab cakes which are meh  but fine for Pittsburgh standards and I would definitely steer clear of the crab legs.    Ok, so really you should go to this place - if you like peel and eat shrimp, cold drinks by the river, and occasionally a keyboardist who plays and sings in the background pretty quietly.  Some of my favorite Pittsburgh moments happened here and that's saying a LOT.  Redfin Blues makes me miss you Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Redfin Blues is great for what it is.  It's a hopping summer-joint with an excellent bar-staff, and food that's actually improved since we started coming here a few years ago.  As a choice for a place to grab a drink and maybe get some steamed shrimp, or a sandwich and a couple of beers it's an easy choice.  It's not fine dining, and you won't have anything here that you've not had before, but it's a favorite place that says \"summer\" to us, so yes, we're fans."}
{"text":"Ate this yesterday and was very impressed with the atmosphere and scenery, but that was about it. The wait staff is incompetent and the food is grossly overpriced with zero flavor. I figured seafood would be their bread and butter but their Ahi tuna was tasteless. The salads you get with an entree is the size of a dixie cup and the lettuce is cheap iceburgh crap. If I go back again I will def just order beer and appetizers as the Buffalo shrimp were pretty good. If showing someone the city this is a good place for atmosphere but if you're a food critic check your taste buds at the door."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday for dinner with 3 other couples.  We got there early (4:45) and pretty much had our pick of tables on the deck.  It is self-seating, but we couldn't have the 2 open tables next to each other we wanted because they were in 2 different sections.  So, they pushed a round and a square table together for us.  Sat there for 25 minutes, never had a server come to take a drink order.  But, 7 servers were all standing at the entrance talking because almost all of the tables were empty.  We moved to a different section in the shade...still no offer for drinks so we had to get them from the bar.  Their only happy hour special was the 5 Miller Lites for $15 and other domestics started at $4.50 per bottle.  We got the pound of eat and peel shrimp as an appetizer to share - the shrimp was good and had some type of seasoning on it.  Service was slow and inattentive all night.  The server was polite and made recommendations from the menu for us, but he was not around very much.  Food-Wise, we tried a lot of things from menu.  I started with the Redfin Bisque.  Described as having crab, lobster and shrimp.  The flavor was not bad, but it was just broth with 1 tiny shrimp.  No crab or lobster.  Seared Ahi Tuna Sandwich - 2 people in our group got this.  It is supposed to be served rare - both were completely overcooked at medium-well.    Shrimp and Crab Pizza - 1 couple shared this (for $21) and left half of it there.  It was completely soggy to where the crust just tore off from the rest of the slice.  Fish Tacos - 2 people in our party got these.  Good portion sizes, but it was served with a 'lime' sauce that was overpoweringly sweet - it was compared to the flavor of icing from a cake.  The flavors on different dishes just clashed instead of complimenting each other.  Long story short, we won't be back.  Overpriced beer and overpriced, bad food. Dinner conversation on a Friday night should not be about how bad the food was.  Epic fail, Redfin Blues, epic fail."}
{"text":"After reading old reviews I figured that some change had to have occurred over the last year and gave it a shot. Went with my boyfriend after biking along the north shore trail, and didn't tell him about the negative reviews since I REALLY wanted to sit along the river. The view/environment is still very pretty, but we both found ourselves displeased with the food and the service. We both got the beer battered cod sandwhich (convinced him to go basic after reading bad things about the food) and although he enjoyed it, I thought the batter was very doughy and uncooked on the fish, and the tartar sauce tasted grainy (any giant eagle brand would have been better). It didn't seem like others were too crazy about the food as I heard the woman behind us complaining that her dish wasn't cooked and would like a refund. The beers were bottled and cold, so couldn't complain there, but the service was still poor as we were rushed to choose our drinks/dishes and given a second to pay. Would have thought after all the reviews that they would have changed employees. Overall, I would come here again only for some beers and nice seating, but would eat dinner beforehand."}
{"text":"After waiting FOREVER for our waitress  to come over ... she finally showed up at exactly  6 to tell us ... its 6 oclock so you can't order beer at the happy hour price. The view is great service not so much."}
{"text":"Possibly a 'trifecta of bad' with surly waitstaff, crappy food (coconut shrimp burnt, romaine lettuce core left in the salad, pizza charred, $7 for a bottle of beer) and smoking being permitted on outside deck.  The view is nice, but you can get the view for free by walking on the trail."}
{"text":"Completely chill environment. I pretty much always get the chicken quesadilla which is awesome, so I really can't comment on anything else. The prices are good and the service is quick."}
{"text":"I would only return here for drinks only and for the great outdoor setting on the river.   I paid $21 for ahi tuna dinner. As I was ordering, the waitress even warned me 'this is served rare\" and I remarked that it better be!  Over cooked tuna is no good.  Well, guess what I got?  Overcooked tuna.  Even the broccoli was tough.  The rice was obviously some kind of box mix; it was soooo salty.  Comparing our food after dinner, my husband and I came to the conclusion that all seemed to have been cooked after having been frozen.  The vegetables, the fries, my tuna, his fish.  They tasted as though thawed from frozen then cooked.  I wonder if my tuna was thawed in a microwave first then cooked.  Because it wasn't just overcooked but chewy.  If there were any specials last night, our waitress didn't bother to tell us any.  And when my husband asked for a full bottle of ketchup, she took the empty and never came back with a new bottle.  We had to get one from the table next to us.  HOWEVER the location is wonderful!  So for drinks only and hanging out on the river Redfin Blues gets 1 star.  This place would be jamming if they had even decent food."}
{"text":"As far as all you can eat crab legs go.. This is THE place to go.. Price seems a little high until you realize that the crab is so much better than usual AYCE deals.. And they keep it coming if you let them know you are there playing for keeps!   Atmosphere is great.. Right along the river.. I feel like it's pittsburgh's best kept secret.. I almost don't want to write such a good review! Go on a weekday night to avoid potential crowds.. But if you like crab.. This is a must try!"}
{"text":"The owners of this place must be idiotic and computer illiterate.  It boggles my mind how so many bad reviews can be received for years on end with no changes made.  The amount of money they are losing by being disorganized must be staggering.  It is only worth going if you ride your bike to Washington's Landing and want a drink.  Otherwise you may request a table and be told that it is a 30 minute wait while 20 tables sit empty.  Those 20 tables, by the way, will continue to remain empty while you wait for one.  Parties that just arrive will seat themselves and be served, or will get immediately seated.  The bar is always surrounded by groups waiting with table-buzzers that are looking around perplexed at all of the empty tables.    I ordered food and the shrimp was still frozen.  Straight out of a precooked frozen bag from CostCo, I presume.    They have a good location and are abusing it.  This is a poorly run business that could be turned into something great.  From the reviews I've seen, I guess this is how it has always been.  What an incredible travesty."}
{"text":"Dear Redfin Blues,  I can't begin to express my disappointment in your establishment. Such high expectations were set when we were greeted at the host stand and sent of for cocktails on a 20 min wait list (which apparently never existed). After 30 mins and seeing literally 4 parties that noticeably came in after us be seated, I reminded the host who directed us to the bar that we were still waiting. After 20 more minutes and 2 more parties getting sat (one who sat themselves) I approached a blonde woman seating and cleaning tables to let her know that we could be removed from the \"list\". To which she replied \"what list?\" And didn't even bother to apologize... nothing was offered to assist us in our search for sustenance nor was there anything offered for our inconvenience. Fortunately, for us, the disaster at your restaurant lead us to discover a new place, that we have decided to frequent. So, thank you for f**king up."}
{"text":"Saw the bad reviews and was wary. Worst part was certainly slow service but it was a busy night. I am vegan and ordered the vegetable pizza without cheese but didn't say vegan/allergy. The chef could have just made the pizza but he made the waiter double check that i didn't want the sauce as it also had 'a little' cheese. This might seem small to some but to me this means everything. Sausage pizza was very good from brother. Red Fin Sandwich from my other brother was the best sandwich he's EVER HAD. The buffalo shrimp and loaded fries from my mom were decent. Bleu cheese/caeser salad from my dad was decent as well. The view is definitely nice and the prices weren't terrible."}
{"text":"I want to like this place. Sitting outside near the river, the potential for the smell of flowers, great drinks, decent food, friendly staff, but they throw it all away to cater to smokers. So at some point or constantly, depending on who's nearby, you'll smell cigarette smoke while you eat, drink, and \"enjoy\" the outdoors. I get that it's outside, but skunks are outside, teargas is outside...in other words, it doesn't matter if it's outside. Go non-smoking and cater to the 95% of people who enjoy the outdoors without smoke. You'll gain customers and only lose those who aren't willing to walk 30 feet to leave the restaurant grounds."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times over the last 6 years(here visiting family) and I think because I'm so distracted with the view, the company, and the people watching I don't really notice that the service is sub par.  They are friendly, they are accurate and they are BUSY.  Food is always amazing! \"Yay, I'm a fan\""}
{"text":"4 stars for the atmosphere. There are not many places in Pittsburgh to dine along the water and the outdoor seating at Redfin Blues is fantastic-huge outdoor deck with lots of tables under umbrellas. It was the perfect venture for Sunday Funday and I don't know why I have never been here before-well it is pretty hidden. They have a large parking lot and the outdoor seating was seat yourself.  It wasn't crowded so the service was fine but I could see on a busy Friday or Saturday the service would be less than stellar. We drank a beer (they only have bottled beers) and sat by the river to watch the boats go by.  The beers are pricy as our Curious Traveler Shandy was $6.50 each but it was a perfect drink for a hot day!  The menu is mostly seafood and pricey-the buffalo shrip where you only get 5 was $11.  It was only 3pm so we went with an appetizer of cheese fries with bacon and ranch-delicious and how could you go wrong! The fries had a tasty seasoning on them."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday evening with a group of 5. We were seated immediately but all the tables filled up soon after we arrived. The location is definitely the best part, with a nice view of the river and city. Our server was clearly rushed and trying to hurry us along to place our orders but I understood that they were busy. The food was good but nothing special and the menu was pretty limited. And yes the prices were a little high for the serving size you got but not outrageous. Overall it's a nice place to get food on a summer night and I will go back but not in a hurry"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a waterfront spot that serves primarily seafood. I'm not going to lie, I was really excited to try this place but was let down. The food is a little below average and the service was alright. The scenery of the water front was obviously something you can't beat and it was comfortable for the time being.  We ordered the crab cake and nachos for an appetizer and the crispy shrimp, fish tacos, and chicken sandwich for entrees. In the appetizers, the nachos were similar to what you could get at a sporting event and the crab cake was priced high but was not good and actually had a few shells in it that I tasted. What we also found unattractive was the pre-packaged sauces that they put on the plate in plastic containers. Makes us wonder the date and freshness of the ingredients. The entrees were alright but as I said, nothing special.   I most likely won't go back, and probably wouldn't recommend to others."}
{"text":"Good fare, reasonable prices, great atmosphere and probably the best restaurant river view in town. The deck is fabulous. Very casual. Owner is currently dealing with a pest problem, but seems aware and concerned. Will check back regularly."}
{"text":"This place isn't good. Been here quite a few times just because it's right on the river and a place to grab a quick bite when you're boating but I continue to be disappointed. The big draw is \"all you can eat crab legs\" every day but only 2 out of the 6ish times I've been here have they been decent. Most times they are overcooked and rubbery which is unacceptable for how much they charge. They also serve soggy canned green beans as your dinner side with these- no thanks. Seen brown lettuce in the salads plenty of times too.. They give you dirty plastic cups to drink from too that have grime ground into the plastic from god knows when. The service is subpar also and the music they play is bizarre. You'll have hard core rap one minute, then metal, then country..really weird ambiance. The only good thing about this place is the river views and if you're lucky to get the crab legs once in a blue moon when they're actually cooked well."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Simple food you can make at home for well less than they charge. Buffalo shrimp $11.00 you get 5, barely enough to share. Shrimp tacos were ok just on a basic bed of slaw for $16. Beers, even the domestics will cost you! Got a Budweiser made beer at $6.50. No drafts or specials on a Friday when we got there at 7. Better choices people."}
{"text":"Had a very pleasant lunch here on a Sunday. Not busy, service fine, food fine. Nice setting. Great for a nice relaxed time."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before with a smaller group. I enjoyed the outdoor seating with our 15+ group. The overall service was good. I was seated immediately with the group. Drink orders were taken promptly and food orders arrived within a half hour. I had the fish tacos and corn. It was a unique combination. I also learned that there's no dessert in the menu which I did not think detracted from the place. On a warm sunny day, I would enjoy coming back here again."}
{"text":"I kept thinking what a squandered opportunity this place offers. It's a terrific location with a great view of the river and boasts a nice sized deck and patio area. The food and drinks are such a letdown though and the servers drag themselves around like we're doing them a favor being there.   We tried the peel n eat shrimp which was more like a salt lick of tough, over cooked shrimp. The cleanse drink tasted like weak sugar water with a hint of cuke. The Bloody Mary was okay but totally Mrs T's or some other bottled brand with very little doctoring of flavor other than three olives, a thick slice of cuke, and some celery with a slice each of lemon and lime.   $45 for this experience won't call us back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great place to get a drink on the deck and watch the river traffic, but that's the only good point of the place.  Food's okay - nothing to write home about; service is pretty average and a bit unfriendly; decor is a little too \"tacky nautical\".  Prices are pretty average, but too high for the quality and service levels."}
{"text":"Dog friendly spot right on the water. Great views, a nice beer selection, and the food is real good.  It's located right on a popular running / biking trail so is a great spot to stop at after a jog or bike ride."}
{"text":"My husband & i were looking for a place to enjoy the first nice day in Pittsburgh & he wanted to go here. I was hesitant because of my experience last time but i decided to give it another try. I was actually pleasantly surprised. We were sat fast & started with long islands. They were delicious. My husband got the margarita pizza he tried the 1st time we came & said it was equally as good. I decided on a side salad & a bruschetta app so i could save room for drinking (because, priorities right?) both were great & the bruschetta was DELISH! The music & atmosphere were great. I'm glad i listen to my hubby, sometimes..."}
{"text":"The location is perfect, we parked our bikes and grabbed a seat. We've been here before for drinks, we tried a cider on this last visit, recommended by our waiter, and it was perfect, not too sweet. We also ordered French fries to snack on which were perfectly seasoned. Our waiter was perfect, very attentive and engaging. There is ample outdoor seating, tables, high tops and seating at the bar as well as indoor seating.   Try it out, great views!"}
{"text":"I had the Buffalo Shrimp, which we great. The view of the river and boats coming in and out of the marina were the highlight. I brought my two kids and they were entertained for hours while Mom and Dad dipped on beverages and enjoyed some early summer sun. Beer list was average."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Redfin Blues, and I was underwhelmed.  While our server was quite nice, she wasn't very attentive, long waits for everything were the norm - drinks, water, finally placing our order, getting the appetizer, and eventually getting our entrees.    We ordered the Chips & Dips to start, which included a large plate of tortilla chips and two immensely small servings of dips (you had your choice of dips, we had the artichoke dip and the pineapple salsa).  The dips were tasty, but there was only enough for about 1/3 of the chips.  That was grossly overpriced at $10, which would have been reasonable if there was more dip.  I ordered the fish tacos.  There were three small tacos, loaded with lettuce and topped with very small strips of fish, no side dish, all for $16.  It was worth about $6.  I won't speak for my friends, except to say that no one raved about their food.  The river view from the deck was nice, but the smokers were not.  While I would give Redfin Blues one more try in the event that this was an off night, I doubt it will be any time soon."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere have definitely improved over the last two years! It's such a great environment. The food seems to be fresher and well better prepared than my first experience. Still not amazing but not bad! It gets super packed in the summer so utilize the no wait app or go for a walk while you wait."}
{"text":"This is a really nice place to hang out during the summer and while the weather is good.  Coming from a sunny country, with lots of coastline and having lived for many years in California as well, this place gives to me \"some\" of the same feel.    However, having said that, the restaurant itself it is extremely purely run.  The service seems to be in a hurry (even when there are not many people really in the place).  The menu has different details from what the chef is preparing (e.g., one item we order was supposed to come with potato salad based on the menu but it came with fries).  We also heard people at the nearby tables complaining about their orders being mixed up.    With respect to the food it is nothing spectacular, but it is not bad as well.  I would definitely like to try more things on their menu.  I will certainly give it a try during the summer time for sure, but I think the owner needs to re-consider the management of this location because it could really be a gold mine!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh has a shortage of riverfront dining, so this place wins points for ambience on a nice warm day. Have a drink and enjoy the deck, but save your dining budget for somewhere else.  The menu is blah and the food is also.  I recently had lunch here, and the waitress first forgot my meal entirely, bringing food to everyone else at the table.  When I reminded her, she returned with my clam chowder, spilled it, didn't apologize, and didn't clean it up.  All that would have been forgiven if the soup had been any good."}
{"text":"I love the location, and I keep trying to give Redfin Blues a chance, but the food is always average at best and the service is less than mediocre.  The setting is fabulous, there's a bike trail that runs right through the middle of the restaurant and you can sit right along the river and feel like you are in some exotic location.  I still enjoy eating here on occasion, but I always keep my expectations low about the food and service.  Maybe one day that will change."}
{"text":"I stopped here for dinner with my boyfriend after an evening exploring and photographing Washington's Landing.  I've dined at Redfin Blues once before, but it was several years ago.  We are always up for some good seafood and figured Redfin Blues would be a good choice since we don't really get out that way all too often.  Lately, we've been hooked on oysters, but I was disappointed to find that this place doesn't serve them at all.  I was willing to look past it after seeing plenty of other seafood items on their menu, and we settled on a cup of the Redfin Bisque each  and decided to split a large shrimp and crab pizza.  The Redfin Bisque was absolutely delicious... my only gripe is that it's a VERY small portion for the $6 price tag.  For that price, I expected a large bowl of soup, but instead it's just a small cup that I downed in about 2 minutes.  The flavor was great, it was the perfect temperature, but the portion size for the price might make me hesitant to order it again next time.   The seafood pizza came out shortly after and it smelled heavenly.  Even the waitress commented on how good it looked.  We ordered the large pizza but probably could've gotten away with the smaller size, since we ended up taking about half of it home.  The portion of the crust that wasn't covered in toppings was yummy and cooked well, but the crust underneath the toppings and olive oil sauce was a bit too thin and soggy - definitely couldn't eat the pizza without a fork and knife.  The quantity and quality of toppings was great for the price and the flavors were great, I just wish the crust had been a little more consistent throughout the whole pie.  Overall this is a nice place to grab an outdoor bite along one of our three rivers, but I wouldn't necessarily say it's somewhere I will go out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"Pricey. $6 for House vodka. Disappointed. Great waitress Missy. Decent Caesar salad hard to mess that one up. Nice location on the river."}
{"text":"average at best. Best view of the city by far though. Go in summer or no point in going.   The beer battered fish is good, yet there's much better in the city. It's nice and crispy, served on a fresh roll, tartar, lettuce, all that jazz. However again it's not worth venturing over for unless weather is perfect for an evening outside.   Chicken quesidilla, same thing. Average.   I've went for 6 years now waiting for it to become something good. It's not going to happen. But I'll keep trying hoping."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and had over and hour wait but it was worth it cause we lucked out with wonderful seats. Towards the end of our meal when it started to get dark the bugs started to become an issue. We both got the crab legs and they were just average. It's a cool place to go one time for like a birthday dinner but after that I won't be back."}
{"text":"It's hard to beat the atmosphere of this place in the summer. It's outdoor dining is right on the river, hovering above Washington's Landing Marina. However, the service is seriously lacking. With my parent's boat docked right below Redfin's, we frequently dine here before headed out on the water. The service has always been very slow. I understand that on a typical Friday or Saturday night it can get rather busy, but they should anticipate the crowd and be able to plan accordingly to accommodate! Luckily, the view is so nice that most of the time we're left waiting....and waiting....and waiting....it isn't too big of a deal because we're enjoying the outdoor space.   The food is average. Nothing I've had there was to die for, but on the same token, nothing was awful either. I'd only suggest this place to marina-goers or those looking for a nice outdoor dining space. Oh, and only come if you have lots of time!"}
{"text":"Fantastic outdoor seating area along the bike trail on Washington's Landing. Food is good but not great."}
{"text":"Nice venue and all but the service is horrible. Was treated nasty on the phone and the manager did not care at all. The food is not worth the wait due to the tiny kitchen. Also they are too lazy to put in take out orders and when you go up they still are resistant to put it in for you."}
{"text":"I had always heard good things about this place, so I was pretty excited to give it a shot. Total disappointment.  As usual, I was craving a crab cake but also Caesar salad. I was sitting at the bar with a friend, so I asked the bartender about the crab cakes specifically I wanted to know if it was heavy on the breading and filler. He told me it was almost identical to another restaurants recipe (which tells me it's the same), but I had never had it from the other restaurant, so I asked again. He assured me it is fantastic and suggested I get it on the salad, thus killing 2 birds with 1 stone.  Sounded perfect to me.  I wish I had taken a picture of the crab cake because quite frankly, I'm not sure there was actually ANY crab IN IT!!!!!  It was like eating a crab flavored ball of dough. Possibly the WORST I've ever had to date. The fact that they charge $16 for it is insulting to truly delicious crab cakes.  I guess at least now I also know not to waste my time and money at the \"other\" restaurant also.    Aside from the food sucking royally, the atmosphere was unexpectedly not great. Maybe it was the day we went. It just didn't feel like a place I'd ever want to return to. I mean, you park in a boat docking area and walk around to the bar. It's just weird. I prob won't go back."}
{"text":"Stellar view of the city and river and potential to be the hottest spot in town with only a little bit more effort.  Food is average and drinks need to come up a notch."}
{"text":"The location of Redfin Blues is great! It overlooks the river, and makes for a lovely place to hang out and have a few drinks... However, the food and service is sub par. Each time that I have been here, whether it be an extremely bustling Saturday evening, or a slow weekday afternoon, the service has been poor. The food is average, and is way overpriced. There are many other great places in Pittsburgh to go if you want a yummy fish sandwich.   Redfin Blues has the potential to be such a great restaurant! But with the poor service and average food, it has a lot to yearn for."}
{"text":"In the running for one of the worst restaurants in Pittsburgh. If it's your first time in the city, please don't go here. Looks great from the outside but everything else about it is terrible. As a group of four we waited over an hour for a table even though we saw multiple tables left vacant. When we approached the host about it, he lied and claimed he had texted and called us to notify us our table was available. We received no such calls or messages. This is 2016, that \"oh I tried to call you\" excuse doesn't work anymore. Bar service was terrible but our server Amy was actually great. Food was decent view was alright. Bottom line: believe all the bad reviews on here and don't waste your time on this place."}
{"text":"The only reason anyone goes to this restaurant is to sit on the deck and drink.  I want to like this place so badly I keep coming back and hoping that it'll be awesome and it just never is.  Like dating someone who is very very hot but also very very stupid, it's amazing how much patience one can have if there's a really good atmosphere.  One year I took my father here for his birthday.  I don't usually call people names but our waitress was just a complete idiot to the point we felt bad for her and that was the ONLY reason we didn't freak out on her completely.  She forgot my dad's food order.  She brought out mine, but then neglected to notice that my dad was sitting there with nothing.  The manager came out and took our drinks off hte tab, btu that didn't help very much bc we'd only been able to order one round in an hour of waiting bc the waitress had only come to our table twice.  Then when they brought my dad's steak out, the waitress dropped it (I felt bad for her), and apparently that was their last steak.  I just paid the bill and we left and went to Eat n Park.  The second time I came back the service was equally as terrible, but also it was late summer and our table was literally attacked by wasps.  Seriously, attacked by wasps.  My friend got stung.  Another time I'd made a reservation for my friends 30th bday and they said htey didn't do reservations but could put tables together.  When we showed up, it was like I'd never called.  The last time I was there it was ok, but after being attacked by wasps my friend and I opted for the patio and only ordered burgers.  The service here SUCKS.  Getting attacked by bees and then having to wait for your server to bring you ice sucks (holding a cold beer bottle against the sting helps).  It just sucks here.  But the atmosphere is fantastic!  When your waitress comes ot hte table, just order a whole bunch of bottled beers nad you should be ok."}
{"text":"We went to Redfin Blues for Lunch from work on a Friday. It has a really nice location right beside the river. I found out that this restaurant was built as a sort of a stopping destination for all the boats out in the river. People would just stop by for lunch and refuel, and soon it became a full fledged restaurant.  I ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with Cheddar cheese and a side of fries. The chicken was really juice. I mean \"really juicy\". I had been eating at the Irish bars in downtown and the food here was different and more fresh. It isn't too bad on the wallet also, 12 bucks for a meal including drink. My co-worker ordered the fish sandwich and he really liked it.  I must add that the lunch menu is kinda small, about 10 items in all I would say. They did have a couple of salads though. Those of you who like to order from huge menus with pages after pages, might be a little disappointed with the choices available.  The waitress wasn't the most friendliest we have seen and all of us agreed on that one. She did come in towards the end and said she wasn't having the best of days as a lot of people had decided not to show up for work.  All in all a nice place to visit for a meal by the river."}
{"text":"Hello Redfin blues ! It's was my friends 50th birthday a few weeks back. She contacted the management a few days prior to let them know that a limo full of women (approx 25-30) would be arriving to stop for some drinks and food. She was told they don't take reservations but we will try to accommodate. We arrived. Manager greeted my friend. Said happy bday. There were about 7 tables open near the bar. No other guests were waiting as we confirmed with the hostess. The birthday girl asked for small bottles of prosecco for 22. We thought it would be easier than asking for individual drinks. Bartender appeared with the prosecco. Manager appeared and said that a server named Abby would be waiting in us. Bartender said we needed to go the bar and stand ... manager was gettting a server. Manager then asked all 22 of us to stand up and stand back at the hostess station to be seated. The birthday girl felt that they were not interested in serving us. So we left. Many of us were so disappointed. We love it there but this experience has left a bad taste."}
{"text":"The great thing about Redfin is the riverside outdoor seating.  We had the lump crabcake, margherita pizza, and salad.  The crabcake and pizza crust (although the pizza itself was super greasy) were quite tasty.  However, the downfalls for Redfin (during my first experience) were the lackluster service and absence of draft beer.  My second experience there was much better in terms of service.   In short, would recommend this place (and will definitely come back) during the summertime to grab drinks on their outdoor patio, but not recommended if you're looking for a good food."}
{"text":"I have really enjoyed this place each time I have gone.  I would recommend going during the summer so you can get the full experience.  It is a great atmosphere to be sitting outside at the marina overlooking the river.  You also can bring your dog here which is plus for any restaurant that offers this in my book.  On top of the great atmosphere, the food here is delicious.   My favorite appetizer is the Thai chili shrimp.  The shrimp are cooked perfectly and the sauce is a great combination sweety and spicy.  My favorite entree is the crabcake sandwich.  While it is a little pricy, you definitely get what you pay for and it is one of the better crab cake sandwiches I have had."}
{"text":"I waffled a lot between 2 and 3 stars for this place.  I would say it's a solid 2.5.  This place is consistently mediocre with poor service and somewhat high prices.  The food is edible, but not outstanding.  It's also consistently crowded (last time we waited 40 minutes), due to the lovely location on the river with a beautiful view of the 31st st bridge.  It's also pretty fun to watch the boats being taken in and out of the warehouse.  I will continue to go here from time to time when I visit my parents as they live very close by.  I enjoy their pizza.  I have had the ahi tuna sandwich several times... it's ok.  On my most recent visit, my parents and I all got the all you can eat crab legs for 36$ each.  The portions are generous and the meal was a lot of fun fun, but good luck seeing your server to get crab refills!  Their beer list is pretty pathetic."}
{"text":"For arriving at 4:45pm on a sunny Saturday evening, I was surprised that we were seated within 5 minutes of the hostess taking our name (although there were only two of us). The hostess told us 15-20 minutes, so my sister and I went to the bar for a quick drink. There are no beers on draft, and the bottles are a bit pricy. House wines are $6, which is normal. The bartender was probably the worst part of the entire experience -- he just stared at us without saying anything for a good half a minute, then he said, a bit rudely, \"do you need something?!\"  He gave us our drinks and our checks without a word, then walked away.   By the time we paid for our drinks, our table was ready. Our waitress, Missy, was very attentive, funny, and nice. We came for the all you can eat crabs, and she never let us run out. She brought us water without asking, and kept checking in on us.   My sister is what I would call a crab connoisseur, and she said they had the best crab legs she's ever had. Instead of boiling them, they use a $25,000 steamer, so it's worth the extra money!  For $36 you get (all you can eat) the best crab legs, fries, a salad, and veggies.   It's a wonderful view of the river, but it is kind of weird that they allow smoking when most people go there for the deck. I can't speak for their other food entrees, but it is definitely worth the price to go there for the crab legs!"}
{"text":"It was a really nice day out so my boyfriend and I wanted to go somewhere where we could eat outdoors. He had never been to Redfin Blues, so we decided to go there. It was Memorial Day, so we expected it to be busy, but when we got there they said there was only a 30 min wait. That was definitely not the case though.  We sat on some rocks nearby and waited for our buzzer to go off. We waited, and waited, and waited. There were many tables open, which I think was also confusing people that were coming in after us. We waited about 40 minutes and then overheard the hostess telling someone else the buzzers weren't working. So we turned in those. Even though there were a ton of tables open, we weren't allowed to even sit at them to get some drinks or eat chips, etc. We were told that they were pacing the flow of people because the kitchen was backed up, and that was the reason for the empty tables. ??? We were both amazed that we were not even allowed to sit down to get some drinks, it's their money that they lost I guess though.  After waiting about 45 - 50 min, we overhear a tablet nearby asking about their food. The waitress tells them the kitchen is really backed up, so their food isn't going to come for about 40 more minutes but she could get them some chips, etc. (They had already been seated and placed their order about 20 min prior) After hearing that, we bailed. I sadly can't even review the food because the wait was so unacceptable, especially since we couldn't even sit down and get water or drinks. When we told the hostess we were just leaving, she didn't seem very apologetic either, all she said was a quick sorry.   I really liked to stop at this place and get some lunch when I was riding my bike on the trail, but my boyfriend said he'd never go back."}
{"text":"The location is nice, with plenty of outdoor seating on the river. The food is not that great.  They have an all you can eat crab leg dinner.  My husband thought that the crab was bland and overcooked.  I had a crab cake sandwich in which I could not really taste the crab.    Prices:  Sandwiches ~$10, Entrees, ~$18, Crab legs, $25."}
{"text":"In the warmer months it's always nice to be by the water so a couple of friends and I checked this place out recently.    The food was so-so.  I got the seafood pizza and while there was a decent amount of crab and shrimp, flavor was missing.  It needed something besides the pizza crust and some crab and shrimp...some sorta sauce to complement the seafood would have been welcomed.    We had the buffalo shrimp as an appetizer and those were really good.  But everything else that I had was mediocre at best.  The service was great, or I should say our waitress was very patient with us considering we were a bit rowdy from drinking earlier in the evening.    If you're in the area or are looking for an outdoor venue, I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"Has gone downhill over the last few years. Servers are actually rude. I asked to sit at a table near the edge of the deck toward the water and the server said \"you pick\". I pointed to one that looked like it needed to be cleaned off(ok, big deal). She said \"oh yeah of course the ones that need to be cleaned\". No she wasn't kidding. Rudeness continued...  We've been going to Redfin for years and this was the worst experience by far. We keep going back periodically because of nostalgia from when it was good back in the day. I think this may have been the last time. Asked for extra cheese on the nachos and that we would pay for it. Came out literally with less cheese than if we had ordered as usual. Drinks were watered down. Could barely taste the ginger in the Moscow mule. Pretty sad, guys. I'm sad for you and for us. Used to be an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Thursday night with three others for dinner.  We arrived shortly before 6 PM and with the nice weather we chose to sit on their patio.  Their patio is rather nice because it has an ample number of seats and looks out over the Allegheny River.  What wasn't so nice about the table that we were seated at was that for a while it was literally the only table out of about 20 or so that had the sun shining on it for about 30 minutes.  That may sound nice but it wasn't really as the sun was in some of my dining companions eyes the whole time.  For dinner three of the members of our party ended up ordering the all you can eat crab legs.  Our opening plates consisted of 2 crab halves (each half was 4 legs and a claw), butter and side orders of french fries and broccoli.  The french fries were actually pretty good and had a nice seasoning on them.  I rather enjoyed picking out some of the crab meat and putting the meat along with some butter over my fries and eating it all at once.  The broccoli on the other hand wasn't to my liking and seemed overly mushy.  As for the crab, well, it was pretty good.  The first couple of halves that they brought out to us were probably either not that fresh or were overcooked.  The reason that I say this is that the meat was hard to get out of the shells and more often than not you were left cracking and picking them.  Later in the evening though the crab seemed to get better (fresher or cooked better?) and was more easily pulled out of the crab without nearly as much cracking needed.  Throughout the night the three of us ended up eating 56 of the crab halves.  What was odd to me is that when we started they were only bringing out 5 or 6 to the table but that by the last two batches they were bringing out 12.  It seems like it would make more sense to do it the other way around as in the end we ended up leaving three of them.  Service of the crab was fairly consistent and it seemed like they were always putting in more orders for us.  However, the smaller amount of crabs meant that there was often waits of up 15 minutes between us finishing the crab and getting some more.  During one of these periods and having already been at the table for more than 2 hours I asked if I could get a refill on the fries.  I wasn't sure if they were included or not but figured that I would give it a try as the fries had to be cheaper and more filling than the crab.  The waitress told me that she would do what she could but never ended up bringing them out.  We finally ended up finishing out meals just before 9:30 PM and they quickly cleaned off our table.  At that point I was pretty antsy to get out of there since we had already been there for 3 1/2 hours.  That wasn't to be though as it took over 35 minutes for us to get the check and then another 10 to get it paid.  So the total amount of time spent at the restaurant was a ridiculous 4 hours and 15 minutes.  Yes I realize that eating a ton of crab legs is a labor intensive activity but I would like to think that we could have been in and out of the restaurant in 2 and a half hours or maybe 3 hours tops.  The bottom line for me is that I don't know if I would be back again in the future.  While the food itself was decent, the total amount of time that I spent here for dinner was absolutely insane."}
{"text":"We were hesitant to visit Redfin Blues after reading the other reviews. But I am glad that we went! The view from their deck is amazing. Our waiter was very fast and attentive. Our food was simple but good. And I thought the prices were reasonable. This is not a gourmet foodie restaurant, but the food is good and it is definitely worth it for the view! We would definitely go back on a sunny summer day."}
{"text":"We heard the food was not good, we came for the view. Lunchtime tuesday not crowded. Good service A+ Salmon salad B Cheese pizza A Spring Greens Salad B+ (i liked the sweet balsamic vinger, my sister in law did not) Price B- overpriced."}
{"text":"quite possibly the worst place i've ever been to. Do not get the lobster roll. It was imitation crab meat on a hot dog bun. It's a wonder to me that this place is still in business"}
{"text":"Starting off with the good - the shrimp nachos really were great. However, the joy in our visit and the delight in our nachos was robbed from us by the obnoxious guy weed-whacking for over an hour during lunch, the terrible entrees, and the rudeness of the staff.   When we walked in, the employees who eventually greeted us made us feel like we were interrupting their conversation to seat us. Upon leaving the restroom, one of the waitresses came running around the corner, ran into me, and never even apologized. I actually held the door to the outside for another employee and he just walked through like I owed him something with no acknowledgment or common curtesy at all. Then came the entrees...yikes. We paid way too much for a terrible cheeseburger and the blandest fish tacos ever. And thanks to the weed whacking, we couldn't even hold a conversation.   I admit that I don't even like this post because it makes me feel over-pretentious and I'm not, but all of these little things made for a very unpleasant experience. I wish we would have gotten our shrimp nachos to go, taken a nice picture by the river, and rolled out of their fast!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this establishment is their location. I love a good patio, especially with a nice view of the water and they've got that down. I would come back here just to sit on their patio and have a drink on a beautiful day. I also liked how the bike path by the river went right through the middle between the patio and the restaurant, so travelers could stop in conveniently if they pleased.   However other than that, I'm in no way rushing back based on their menu or anything else. The food was pricey for the quality and the options offered. I ordered the coconut shrimp salad, and it was just okay. My friend ordered a chicken sandwich and felt the same way. I felt that with such a cool and unique location, the place could be very good but it just didn't reach its potential."}
{"text":"Not impressed. We arrived at 5:30, ordered an appetizer and beers as we waited for the fifth and final member of our party. Ordered dinner at 6 pm. Some of the members of our party ordered crab legs, which came out of the kitchen in a timely manner. The rest of us waited an additional 45 minutes until a manager came over to explain that a pizza we ordered was taking longer than expected and would be out in \"4 minutes\". 15 minutes later half of our party needed to leave. They went home hungry and very unhappy. Luckily it was a beautiful day outside. Good luck Redfin blues. It's not even summer yet. Yinz got some learning to do."}
{"text":"I've eaten here probably 10 or so times this summer. Service is always good and a great place to grab a drink. The food however.. I would just stick to something safe like pizza or French fries. Something you can't really mess up."}
{"text":"Perfect night for an outside event.  Enough shady areas that made it comfortable.  Wait service was nice but felt slightly like they didn't want us lingering at the table all night.  We were there for a charity happy hour.  Ordered drinks - buckets of beer and some appetizers.  The peel and eat shrimp was great - one whole pound. A little messy - but really tasty. Their artichoke dip was good too.  Ordered the lobster roll.  It came with two rolls.  The meat was okay - would rather have one sandwich with fantastic meat than two with mediocre.  Fries had bay seasoning on them.  Yum.  All in all.  We'll go back."}
{"text":"Great location! Love biking through here and stopped for drinks a few times. I have to say the service and some of the guests give off snobby vibes. Good wine list, have not tried the food. Live entertainment a plus. Feels like your on a beach vacation when you're here!"}
{"text":"View and atmosphere are def the highlight of this location. If I return it will be to sit outside and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"Okay so based off the reviews on here we were not going to come but it was a nice day and a good atmosphere to have lunch so we decided to go.   It was actually pretty good! My mom said she heard good things about it from friends at work. I don't know if they got a new cook or what, but for the time we went it was actually pretty busy and the food was great!   We are definitely looking forward to visiting again!   Get the shrimp and crab pizza"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great atmosphere and view right on the water. They've got tiki torches and beach drinks, and it doesn't even feel like you're in Pittsburgh anymore. Great indoor outdoor bar too. The food is just ok, nothing extraordinary, and sometimes the wait is long. But I just grab a drink at the bar while I'm waiting, and enjoy the atmosphere. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Finally, the beer battered fish sandwich I had been looking for (I'm starting quite a few of my reviews off like this lately. Hmm ... )!  Somehow, even though I had been living in Heinz Lofts for a year, I had never heard of this place. It's literally a two minute drive from there or a great bike ride, but whatever. That mistake has been rectified.   I went for lunch last week with my boyfriend and one of his coworkers. Anyone who knows me knows that I love the outside. Sitting outside and eating and drinking, not really being active outside. So this place is right up my alley.  When we were first handed the lunch menu, I thought, \"Eh.\" It's short and seemed really random. I settled on the fish sandwich as it was cheap and I still wasn't 100% sold on this place. They do have Heineken Light, which I am a big fan of, so that was a plus. For me, at least. I think I am alone in this city with my love of Heini Light.   My fish sandwich was so, so tasty and what I had been looking for since I went to Penn Ave Fish Company. Perfect breading and the bun did not conflict with the taste. I slather on the tartar sauce because I'm that kind of gal. I had fries as a side and they were tasty.  Great lunch and great location for relaxing. I could have stayed there all day."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner on a Sunday, put our names jn for a 45min wait, and sat at the bar until our table was ready. My husband ordered a beer and asked for a water, the bartender delivered the beer and no water. My husband asked the bartender THREE DIFFERENT TIMES for a water the bartender proceeded to roll his eyes each time and ignore the request.  On the fourth occasion of getting his attention and asking for a water he delivered a cup with no ice or straw, clearly inconvenienced by us."}
{"text":"Very average  Food kind of sucks and is priced on the higher side for bar food. You're paying to sit along the river."}
{"text":"It was my Anniversary tonight, a Tuesday. I was so excited to get All You Can Eat Crab  Legs!!! My favorite food of all time!!! But when we arrived at 8:20pm, the very unfriendly waitress said that their kitchen was closed!!!!! BOOOOOOOOOO!!!! Their website, as well as Yelp, states that they are open until 10pm!!! We would've been long gone by then! Very disappointing. Well, we ended up driving a lot farther than we intended, but had a wonderful dinner at Joe's Crab Shack in Station Square. I got my LEGS!!!! And they had $2 Hurricanes to boot!!! Ended up eating a better meal, with cheaper drinks, and we ended up tipping our waiter 30% because he was awesome!!!! Should've just gone there in the first place! I will know better from now on!!!"}
{"text":"The place is perfect for summer weekend lunches. The view outside is great as you sit by the river. The food is not that good but if you stick to simple sandwiches you'll be fine. Don't try to order anything sophisticated, even the pastas aren't that good."}
{"text":"This place is so cute- I honestly don't know why there aren't more riverfront restaurants in Pittsburgh. My boyfriend and I met another couple here on a gorgeous summer night for dinner and drinks. It is definitely has an amazing atmosphere and is perfect for groups. The wait sucked (45 minutes but we expected that) and they don't take reservations, but we enjoyed a drink at the bar while we waited. The food was average but good-- definitely nothing over the top and obviously not exceptional seafood since this is Pittsburgh. Overall it's a great place to go and relax, but don't expect anything extraordinary aside from the location and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cool setting but for me that was about it. The menu was a huge let down. Not much fresh seafood. Battered and fried. Very dark outside as well. We didn't care for the atmosphere and didn't actually eat anything. Just a glass of wine."}
{"text":"The perfect places for views and food.  It's stationed in the heart of Washington's Landing along the river.   It's the perfect outdoor summer spot for some pub food.   The service can be slow, but with its worth it for the ambiance and view.   It's an especially great spot to bring your dog. Check in, go for a long walk around the island, and return just in time for some dog-friendly seating. They even bring out a water bowl filled with water.   Price is moderate."}
{"text":"The setting is very nice, and its relaxed and chill.  Go for that and don't have great expectations about the food and it will be a (little) better than you think.  The island its on is a beautiful place for a walk after you have had your fill -- go upriver to the end and there is a historic park with signs about Washington.  If you are patriotic you will love it because its where he dug deep and became a great leader.  He literally swam across the river right by this restaurant, in January, pulling someone who could not swim, after being shot in the face by an Indian."}
{"text":"The \"All You Can Eat Crab Legs\" seriously drew my mom & I in and we couldn't have been more disappointed with our experience. First mine came out on a dirty plate. I only know it was dirty bc under my cup of broccoli there were dried ketchup smear stains. A little horrifying but I transferred my food to another plate and moved on. The crab legs were wonderful (which is the only reason this is getting 2 stars instead of 1) but they brought us out our second round of crab legs which my mom& i couldn't finish. We picked at one on top each removing a leg from the main chunk and put a few scraps back on the plate when we were stuffed and proceeded to asked for a box. The waitress told us she couldn't do that and that boxes for half eaten crab legs isn't allowed. My mom explained that we literally touched all of them and she wasn't sure why they couldn't let us keep the food we touched and the waitress said \"Sorry that's the rules \" and grabbed the plate and walked away. We stayed to finish our wine only to watch them bring the EXACT SAME PLATTER with our half mutilated crab legs on top out to the table next to us for their second round. I am completely horrified & probably planning on calling the health department. My mom and I are clean & healthy individuals but if we weren't the innocent family next to us would've been exposed to god only knows what. Literally appalling."}
{"text":"Better than some reviews.  Guess it depends on the night.  Went late evening after kayaking on the river.  Sat outside and waited....Waitresses both thought it was the other's table.  After that, service was good.  Was crowded.  Had the crab cake sandwich, which was pretty good...better than I expected from this type of establishment and not to much breading.  Pizza was good, the pasta dish was OK.  Beer not draft//why??? Wines were below par//Why???  Was pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"This place sucks- the host is a jerk and we waited over an hour for our table with the no wait app.  They turned no wait off and said they tried to call me.  They lied.  The food sucked. Basically don't come here...ever"}
{"text":"The food can be ok.. So can the service.. If you come by boat or bike make sure you are fully clothed.. They may look at you like you are nuts if you show up in a bathing suit.. For every 2 bad waitresses there is 1 good.. I like the beer battered chicken sandwich.. The shrimp quesadilla had weird textured shrimp.. The peel and eat shrimp are pretty good.."}
{"text":"Great location and fun for drinks on a beautiful day. If their food quality was better it would be worth the price, because it's just OK at best. That's the only thing missing from this place which is too bad cuz other than the food I love it."}
{"text":"I have lived in Pittsburgh for 4 years and I have never heard of Redfinns. I saw it online and given it was a nice night, I wanted to give it a try. I went with one other person and we arrived at 7:30 on a Tuesday. When we walked up it looked really nice. There was a nice patio right on the water and to the right there was a bar and indoor seating area.   There was a sign that said \"seat your self\" and we saw a waitress clearing off a table and asked if we could take it as there was no obvious line and didn't appear to be people waiting. She immediately yelled, \"NO!! THIS IS FOR THE PARTY OF 6,\" who were apparently waiting at the bar for a table. I asked if there was a wait and she said \"I don't know. I think. There is no hostess today and were really busy.\"    So as weird as that was we went inside and asked 3 other people if there was a list and everyone said some variation of \"I don't know. Yea I think there is a list somewhere.\" An older women wearing a white polo who was what I can only assume was the manager just stood there and watched us walk around the small indoor area like we were lost looking for someone with the elusive list. Eventually we went back to the deck area and there were at least 3 empty tables one of which was being cleaned by the staff. We asked if we could have it and she said no because someone else was waiting for it.   At this point it we had been there for a total of 15 minutes with no one from the staff asking if we needed help and despite Asking at least 4 people for a table and/or where this \"list\" was, we decided to leave.   Worst service experience I've had at a restaurant ever. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Good service.  Ordered all you can eat crab was so good and they kept them coming.  Wife had fish was soo good. Would go again. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Wow. Bad food, just overpriced bar stuff and last night we saw the owner running after and screaming at a poor couple whose dog had come off its lead.  Will never go back, his behavior was disgraceful and totally unprofessional."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for the All You Can Eat Crab Legs. We got a perfect spot right by the water, under some shade. Our waiter kept the food and drinks coming, and was very attentive. The food was really good!! This place is one of the few places to get all you can eat crab legs that is not a buffet, and the location is really nice. Will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try forever because of the pretty view but unfortunately I'd suggest skipping it. Food was ok, service was poor. We sat for 10+ minutes before anyone looked at us, drinks took forever, had to ask for straws and the waitress barehand stuck them in everyone's drinks... there were a couple gross incidents like that. No idea who our server was because we had to flag down anyone who would pay attention to us. Didn't give it one star because of the nice ambiance and the staff wasn't rude, just totally inattentive and didn't seem to have service training. Also two of us got the same thing and got really sick :("}
{"text":"Excellent drinks, appetizers, and service. The all you can eat crab legs are amazing. Such a great view, and we even got to see them putting boats into the water from storage. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A little pricy for food but not too bad. Sitting above the little docks there is nice on a hot day. When they put the boats in the water it's a little noisy but entertaining. I had a fish sandwich and it was a little greasy and bland and the tartar sauce was also bland. Iced tea was good. This is not the place to come to have a good meal, but a nice view and a breeze then it's ok. Next time I think I will just get drinks and an appetizer and enjoy the view. Other people I see complained about the service but our waitress was really good and took care of us without hovering."}
{"text":"The only reason I really go here is when I'm on my boat and get hungry, and this is one of the few boat-up bar/restaurants in the city.  The complete lack of boat+drink+food spots in this city should be the subject of another post.    Although this place has a lot of potential, the beer list is lacking and comparatively expensive.  The food is mediocre generally, though I did get a pretty decent fish sandwich last time I was here.  I've had several of their apps, and none of them were worth writing home about.    Come here if you're looking for a \"chill\" environment, good patio dining, and a nice view of the river.  If you're only looking for a good meal, I definitely don't recommend it."}
{"text":"It has all been said before--it's a great place to settle in for a beer.  The night I was there a couple of guys were performing music.  We had the wings--I would not call them memorable.  Again, a great view of the river and the city."}
{"text":"The only nice things about this place is the outdoor seating on the water, it's convenient for hikers/bikers and it's dog friendly. The food, however, is EXTREMELY overpriced for the quality and quantity!! Probably won't be back. Such a shame, a place like this in the Burgh could have great potential!"}
