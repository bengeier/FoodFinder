{"text":"The food here is decent, however they have a completely false menu on their website which does not report the prices which they actually charge. They charged me more than double the price on their site, and I paid thinking I had misunderstood what I read. I checked when I got back home, but there was no mistaking it - they charged more than $20 for something which is only $9 on the menu. I have tried repeatedly to contact them, but they are unresponsive - and the menu has yet to change. So not only have they not fixed the mistake, but they aren't making good on it either. I used to be excited to bring people there, but never again. At least not until they make good on this issue - if they do, I will update this review."}
{"text":"Food was delicious as the restaurant itself is nice and clean.  I would definitely recommend this place.  Not sure if it was just that they were short staffed on the night that I went, but service was kind of slow and the sushi came out in stages, like 2 rolls every 10 minutes.  However, tasted amazing."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming to the restaurant for the sushi tonight and we ordered the crispy trio (taste good, small portion) and bazara (we thought it was bazara when we ate here the first time, when the dish came.  It didn't look like that or taste good)  My friend told the waitness that we made a mistake that we ordered the wrong dish and we think it was volcano with black rice that we ordered last time.  This bazara dish doesnt taste great, she asked if she can make a new dish for us and take barzara off the bill.  The waitness wouldnt budge at all saying that it wasnt her mistake and she can pack it for us to go.  She was saying that the bazara would come out of her pocket.  I said no since none of us would eat it, she took the dish away.  She asked if we wanted to order the vacano roll and we said no.  We just want to hurry and finish the rest of the sushi and leave.  It really left a bad taste in my mouth of how the crappy service is.  I heard the waitness was speaking Cantonese to her colleague after she left the table, saying how stubborn we are.  I have been to other restaurants of when a food item doesnt taste fresh and good, I sent it back and I can order different items."}
{"text":"I came here last night with friends and consumed the most delicious sushi I've ever eaten - and I've eaten a lot. 

We had the fire crab roll and gold dragon roll. All other sushi that I've eaten, the rolls that have tempura bits inside are always just a little soggy. But the tempura bits here are large, crispy, and add a really great crunch in your bite. In fact, it's only after tasting these that I realized the other sushi I've been eating have all had soggy tempura bits. 

Also, I don't particularly like salmon sashimi (I know, I know), but the pieces of salmon they had on top of the Gold Dragon Roll were really buttery, soft, and really high quality. 

Their appetizers are also really creative and unique. They have sweet potato shrimp and almond shrimp, thai dumplings, and seaweed wrapped cheese ravioli.

I've already decided to make a return visit with my parents barely a week later. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Well as a result of fellow yelpers, my hubby & I decided to try Bazara.  We arrived there around 7:30pm, Saturday, and we're received in a courteous and prompt manner.  

We ordered a ginger honey tea, which tasted like the \"real\" deal, a little too sweet for my taste  though, so I got another pot of hot water to mix.. Accomadating wait staff.

The appetizers ordered were Salmon Tartare, fresh and nicely done with a ginger soy, Almond Crusted Shrimp... yummy as well.

The sushi we ordered were the Volcano Roll with black rice, which was instructed by our waiter that it goes well with spicy sushi, and he was right.  The  tempura shrimp was CRISPY and fresh, as it should be, went perfectly with the slight nuttiness of the rice.
The Spider Roll.... the crab was done perfectly, again CRISPY!
The Rainbow Roll ....  All fish was fresh, that's all I can say!
Don't forget the hot sake with our meal, tasty as well.

Dessert. I had to check it out, even though my belly was almost to the max, I got the fried bananas with vanilla ice cream.  Ok, here's where the minor issue comes in.  Keep the ice cream separate from the banana .... Melts too fast on top of the bananas... regardless the ice cream tasted premium, scooped to order, not like those ghetto places that pre scoop and freeze their ice creams... \"blah\".  The green tea ice cream also nice.

To summarize our visit, very nice ambiance, clean everything, the food was well presented and fresh.  The softshell crab / tempura was crispy, rice to filling ratio was  right on for the sushi rolls, wait staff...polite and attentive, Susanne (sorry if I spelled your name wrong), thanks for the friendly chat before we left :).  Defiantly a return visit for us!.... gotta try the crispy beef and chicken dish that passed by us, looked and smelled Yummy."}
{"text":"Had honesty been avoiding for a while cause from the window it looked confusing inside. But on a friday night where we wanted a quiet dinner in the neighbourhood instead of a loud bar feel we decided to give it a try and were pleasantly surprised. Dinner was really tasty. We had the wonton soup, gyoza, the spicy tuna sushi pizza, the spicy beef, plus ginger tea and some sake. The sushi pizza had a crispy thin rice bottom which was nice. The spicy crispy beef wasn't really spicy, but still totally delicious and comfort food like. And the ginger tea was spicy with what seemed like real ginger - amazing, especially since I'm getting over a cold. The decor still seems a bit odd, but the service is kind and fast and helpful, the booths are comfy, and the music allows you to have a conversation without yelling. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in because I was craving sushi and happened to be in the area that day. Very fresh sushi! I also had the general tao chicken, lettuce wraps and spring rolls. Everything was good and our waitress was super attentive and helpful. I would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Just got back from sushi here. 

Nothing fancy but it certainly fits the bill for our new go-to sushi joint. We had a selection of their rolls and split a sushi pizza. Everything was great and not super expensive. 

Next time we'll try the sashimi. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why this restaurant gets such great reviews. The service was extremely slow. I ordered seared scallops and sushi roll for dinner. I made the order at 9:15pm. The mango juice and seared scallop were very tasty and good; but my sushi roll did not arrive till 10:45! We followed up with them multiple times, and everytime they said the order is on its way and the Chefs are making them. Even other tables that ordered the food later than us got their food first. For the longest time for 35 mins, we saw no server walking by our table to check if everything is ok.

For our very last attempt to track down my order at 10:30pm, the server did apologize and said sorry that they were very busy. We did not actually see a lot of tables with customers. 5-6 tables at most. So we don't understand why they were busy.


Eventually we had to ask for our bill as we had made a reservation at a club nearby and had to get there before 11pm. They then took the sushi roll off from the bill and still rush to make me the roll I wanted.

Overall I did not need to pay for my sushi roll which was good. However it was unreasonable that it took sooooooo long (one and a half hour) to make my sushi roll. Plus we had to remind them 3 times and for 35 mins no one actually checked on us to see if everything is ok.
I would have to say the food is good, but the service is definitely too slow and not organized.

Not something that I expect from this pricy restaurant."}
{"text":"We ended up here after trying to east across the street at pizza libretto (never again)...luckily it worked out this way.... what a fine Bazara is!!! This is hand down, the best sushi /asian restaurant Ive ever tried. Ambiance, service and food was great!!! Prices were very reasonable, 10$ for a dragon roll, 5$ wonton soup, 5$ spring roles, 6$ for dumplings, 14$ general tao chicken. This was not greasy, spongy food... this was fresh ingredients made to order. I would highly recommend this place... I hope there isnt a line up next time i go...which there may be as people leave more posts like this one."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi experience - the fish is very fresh, and the dishes and maki are creative; also, happy to find another place with good butterfish"}
{"text":"The best mouth watering sushi in town! Went into this place by fluke but will definitely be back! Gourmet sushi at its best.
The rice less spicy salmon and avacado melts in your mouth, the spicy salmon pizza is heavenly and the beef rolls as an appetizer were so good we ordered them twice lol
Simply- amazing!"}
{"text":"Had the fixed price lunch, which was excellent value at $15. Started with the miso soup, which was lovely and had bits of mushroom. Then moved on to the spicy salmon roll, which had a great crunch to it. Ended with the volcano roll, which was bursting with avacado and salmon. I went for the predictable boring dishes, but I was quite satisfied."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here and it was absolutely delicious! So good in fact that we are going out to the restaurant for date night"}
{"text":"This is the first time I give 5 stars. 
I had the Volcano sushi (black rice/tuna/ spicy mayo). They were from far the best I ever had. Even the tempura bites in the volcano were delicious by themselves. This is a Toronto hidden secret. 
It was so good I didn't even think about taking a photo. But I'll definitely go back and take a proper photo. 

The decor was fine (more work than other sushi spots in the city) and it played classical music. 

Oh, I forgot to mention I wasn't bug on sushi. This place make me crave it."}
{"text":"Finally! Sushi on Ossington. As expected, it's a little more expensive than the maki mile on Bloor or the sushi stretch on College, but worth it for a regular night out sushi place. Classier than most and some really creative dishes. Their spider roll with a chipotle ponzu is excellent. The black rice dishes are also great."}
{"text":"Tried this as it was featured on Dine.TO and have to say it was a winner, and will be a repeat for sure. WiFi would be nice, but probably also lead to more lingering meals.

Had the crispy beef lunch special and it was excellent. The soup was very tasty, and you could tell was packed with fresh ingredients. The roll was also very good, only complaint was that the seaweed was very chewy, and hard to bite into. Finally onto the beef - excellent. It was not overly sticky and fraught with loads of sauce. It was a good mix, and good portion. Overall good value for the lunch menu.

The décor is not what you would expect out of an Asian spot, but that adds to it. Surprising the server with the Dine.TO post was also nice (they didn't know about it). 

The booths are tight, but hey its Ossington, and not Mississauga."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for dinner with 8 friends at 6 pm.  It wasn't busy when we got there and it took about 10 min just to take our drink order.  The service is really slow which is very annoying.  The food made it worth the wait though.  The food was amazing. I would highly recommend ordering the Nori Seaweed wrapped ravioli with chicken and cheese filling, volcano roll, gyoza, and snow white roll.   Bazara just needs to work on proper food execution in a timely manner."}
{"text":"This was my second time here since August. The food is excellent, the presentation is very nice and the atmosphere is modern and romantic. Portion sizes are generous and ingredients are fresh. 

Now for the not so impressive portion of this review: While the server was very friendly, she was left as the only server in a packed restaurant. There was a full house and a line up at the door. She was serving about 40 patrons on her own. This is the second time that this has happened.

I figured I would return and give this place a second go since the initial waiter told us that another staff had called in sick, thus the slow service BUT since the food and atmosphere were so nice, I wanted to give it one more chance. I went back here last night with a group of 8 girls to celebrate a birthday. We were faced with the same scenario yet again. This place really needs to staff up and get an adequate amount of servers for the demanding hustle and bustle of this new (potentially fantastic) spot on Ossington.

Will likely not return as I can't wait 45 minutes for a menu and an additional half hour for an appetizer, no matter how delicious it is."}
{"text":"Another wonderful and tasty restaurant on the Ossington strip!

Been there 3 times and it seems like only 3 people work there.  But considering the number of tables, they are doing a great job.
A newer age take on some Asian dishes.  From Chinese Dim sum, to Sushi.
Sweet potato crusted shrimp with a sweet sauce! AMAZING! 
Inoki Beef rolls! I can't say I've ever tasted anything better PLEASE TRY IT!

Sushi was good and Dim sum is dim sum! Probably a little better than I've tasted...and I'm asian!

Prices are VERY decent and atmosphere is very nice if you don't get put in the back.

I have to say it is one of my favourite places on the Oss strip!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and was impressed. It was lunch and they offered a 3 course prix fixe for $15. I have to say the miso soup was the best I've had in a while! It was definitely worth it and we'll be back again to try out some other menu items."}
{"text":"Love this place. I'm upset that I did not know about this place until now. This is my new go to place for sure. The service was great the food even better. Price is reasonable decor is cute and I just love the black rice sushi. You probably should make a reservation it is tiny."}
{"text":"Very nice food but extremely extremely slow service!!! Completely kills everything. One waiter is definitely not enough for a busy place. Don't come here hungry."}
{"text":"4/5. This is one of the most unique and well-decorated sushi / asian restaurants we have been to. It has a very different setup than your traditional sushi places and a much larger selection of wines. I recommend the maki rolls, especially the volcano. I was not a huge fan of the riceless rolls- stick to the maki."}
{"text":"My first impression of the restaurant was that of relaxation. Dim lights, soft music and beautiful decor. Exposed brick, black ceiling blah blah blah. The sushi was f$&@?@ amazing! I had the Volcano roll explode my tastebuds. The Gold Dragon had a unique taste and the Ginger was crunchy and so fresh. If you are in the mood for Sushi...you need to try Bazara!!"}
{"text":"Made reservations several days in advance, on a Thursday. The restaurant was not busy. We arrived on time for our reservation and were seated promptly and given menus. We waited for 1/2 an hour before leaving. During that 1/2 hour, we were not acknowledged, we were not offered any drinks and we were not communicated with regarding a delay in service. We were only acknowledged when we got up to leave, and asked 'is there a problem'? WORST SERVICE ever."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. The fish is always fresh and everything on the menu is incredible! The one draw back is that since it's a small business the items can take a while to reach the table. But it is always worth the wait!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in town full of all u can eat sushi. Most review complained about the price, i dont see the problem with it. Yes the price is a bit higher than most of japanese restaurant, but you are not paying for bloor st japanese. Their rice is properly seasoned and their fishes are fresh!!! Service is a bit too slow...and our waitress is annoying (only because she wouldnt stop talking and let us enjoy our food), but overall i would come back because the food is amazing"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in town. Never been disappointed with the food. Usually do takeout but when I have eaten there I'll admit the service (very friendly) can be a bit slow at times. 
Their lunch special can't be beat."}
{"text":"Great three course fixed lunch menu with a lot of options. Great customer service with prompt attention and friendly demeanor. Definitely recommend for good Asian food on the Ossy."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the mains because they did not make it out of the kitchen. The wait staff were the void of personality and wait-skills. The soups came out with one of the mains, the rest of the mains did not come out for 40 minutes. When we inquired about the delay we were told that we would have to wait \"at least another 15 minutes\". They did not apologize for or explain the 15 minute delay for the waitress' first interaction with us (we had to ask for her), or the 40 minute + delay for mains which we cancelled. When we were seated the place was only at 30% capacity. The table next to us - a party of four - just got up and left. Every restaurant has a bad night, the good ones make it better by showing they care. The second star is for the awesome hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the neighbourhood. It just feels fancier then a regular sushi joint. The rolls are beautiful as well as delicious. The only thing that we wouldn't get again would be the almond shrimp. The General Tsao Chicken were big pieces of chicken instead of a lot of dough."}
{"text":"Good food, slow service.

Ordered a number of appetizers here with a few standout dishes: 
1. seaweed ravioli - tempura fried chicken and cheese ravioli for wrapped in seaweed. super interesting 
2. black cod with miso - excellent flavor but really thin piece of fish
3. Avocado salad - I think pretty much your standard avo salad, but lots of avocado and great ginger dressing!
Also got the tiger prawns (meh) and chicken lettuce wraps (fine but not too exciting). 

Friend ordered a glass of wine which she said was good; I ordered the lychee martini which was good while I was imbibing, but which later gave me a headache, ostensibly from quality of liquor used?

Service was incredibly slow (although I only saw one waitress for the entire dining room so maybe it was just that), so don't come here in a rush."}
{"text":"Felt like a 5 star experience. Amazing food. Try the fried beef strips and the large deep fried banana. Great date spot."}
{"text":"I am very particular about my takeout sushi. 

After moving from the Yonge/Eglinton area, we had been commuting north from WQW to our beloved Sushi Kai. For us it was worth it because we loved it so. Not like it was an every day thing, so we justified it. Sort of. We tried numerous places that were more local to us but none were up to snuff. Dry rice, skimpy fish, chewy tempura, bland, boring, bad... We felt like we had tried everything. Until we read the yelp reviews about Bazara. I was reluctant because the other places we tried had been highly rated as well, but went for it anyway.

Bazara. The fish is thick, cool and fresh, the eel warm and delicious, the tempura crispy and the option to switch to black rice is super. Even their ginger is fantastic! I thought I was going to forever be stuck with that ubiquitous atomic pink crap that smells strangely of bathroom cleaner. Not here. Bite after bite of sheer delight.

Maybe a little pricey (the only reason I docked them a star), but all-in it's easily cheaper than commuting to Yonge and Eg. I am a convert. Bazara sushi is terrific. I may never need to go north of Bloor again."}
{"text":"Have brought a number of friends to this place and responses have always been the same: Fabulous, relaxed, great service, very affordable and unpretentious. And...a best kept secret. It is so different than the overly \"hipster\" spots that are a dime a dozen now on the strip and in the neighbourhood.  So happy I found Bazara..."}
{"text":"The food is incredible! Tastes great and is wonderfully presented. Their innovation in the way sushi is made is relishing. Certainly a fresh sushi experience. 
The atmosphere is pretty cozy and intimate. Definitely a nice place to be. 
The scallop carpaccio is fantastic (although I wished the plate was a bit bigger since it was so good and delicately fine)."}
{"text":"Atypical ambiance for what seems like a run-of-the-mill Japanese/sushi restaurant (and their website doesn't help any!). The decor is beautiful and trendy.

Food was slow to arrive at our table, but when it did, it was superb! Black rice sushi specials were excellent, as was the hot & sour soup, and appetizers. Definitely a welcomed departure from the type of sushi you come to expect on every street corner in Toronto. 

Dishes are presented beautifully!
Highly recommend the Bazara and Kamikache rolls."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was able to take advantage of their 3-course $15 prix fixe lunch menu.  Great value and a good way to sample the selection at a new restaurant.  I had the mango salad, general tao chicken, and spicy tuna rolls.  All 3 items were very good.

Others in my party had the volcano roll and Bazara roll.  I like how they try to make their rolls unique and also have a wide selection of non-sushi fare.

Overall, everyone was satisfied with the taste of their food.

3 people in our party and it came out to about $50 after taxes.  Definitely pricier than the sushi shops along Bloor, but the fish was more fresh and dishes visually appeal.

Honestly, I'm like a sushi snob and still like the sushi places uptown better, but would be back here if I am in the area.

Tip: They charge for green tea."}
{"text":"Went for their pre fix lunch today with friends and it was so delicious and filling and the best $15 we ever spent! I love that they offer black rice and the portion sizes are extremely generous especially the lunch special. Got mango salad (amazing) veggie tempura (delish) and the yummy yam rolls with black rice (still dreaming about them)

Lovely experience with great service! Will be going back regularly!"}
{"text":"quite possibly the best spicy salmon I've ever had. rivals many of new York's finest. 
+ the warm snow roll which is god like 

only downfall is management for some reason unbeknownst to logic understaffs the spot on the busiest nights of the week, making the endeavour a couple hours minimum. frustrating but SO worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of fish and veggie sushi and Thai dishes.  Everything was amazing.  Love the location as well, Ossington is a great area."}
{"text":"Great food, but the worst service I have ever received. The restaurant wasn't very busy and I felt like I had to beg for water. It took over an hour for the server to come take our order...I think he was distracted with his son jumping from booth to booth in the back of the restaurant. 

Ordered 3 rolls between 2 people and our dinner lasted longer than 3.5 hours...."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Asian restaurant!!! I have never been disappointed in anything I ordered here. The chef is simply a genius. Even something that sounds boring as an 'avocado salad' has a spectrum of delicious flavours. Almond crusted shrimp was another pleasant surprise. Soft shell crab: Oh my! Their mango juice makes me think I'm on a sunny beach. It's so delicious! The service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed.

Came here for a birthday celebration and we were let down before we were even sat down for our meal. 

My husband booked reservations for approximately 20 people, 3 weeks prior to the actual event date. The week of the event date, we received 3 calls from the restaurant. The first to confirm the amount of people (ok, this is normal), the second, to ask \"Are you sure you're going to have 19 people?\" After responding, \"Yes\", they responded with, \"Ok, because we get REALLY busy at the time, do you know how long your party will take?\"... At this point, they are sounding like they can't accommodate us and putting a time limit on us almost. The third time they called, they asked AGAIN if we were SURE we were going to have 19 people. 
So at this point, we're feeling pretty unwelcome, but considering we only had a couple of days left before the event - we didn't bother to rebook as it would be difficult to get a reservation for 15+ elsewhere. 

We arrived the day of, most of our party was on time, with a few straggling along half an hour later. When we were seated, we had to wait about 5 minutes, and only then after I asked for a menu were we given one. The drink menu was only available with the regular menu so we ended up ordering all of our food together with our drinks. My two friends had ordered a bunch of apps/entrée dishes, and were also questioned in they could finish all the food. Absurd if you ask me, if someone is ordering food, why question what they are ordering and make them feel bad about their choices? 

Over the night, the service seemed to get worse and worse. The timing of the food came out randomly, there were a few people in our party who didn't get their meal until we were finished ours. Water and drink refills were not their concern, once they got our initial order, they didn't bother to come back and check to see if we wanted more drink. To get additional service, we had to wave them down - and it was reluctance on their end. 

The only reason I'm giving 2 stars, is because the food was decent. That was the only saving grace in the whole fiasco. 

Another upsetting place, especially this place being Asian-owned....they charged us a ridiculous cake fee. But the worse part was, they rushed the whole process. The cutting of the cake was a disaster, I felt like the cake got butchered. They gave us these small plates with uneven cake slices, and snarled at us when we asked for additional slices. 

And the worst part of it all. Getting the bill....simply PAYING for our meal with such a challenge. I think we asked 3 or 4 times before they gave us our bill. Other members in our party paid for their meals before...everything was staggered...but they simply did not give a sh*t after we finished our meal. They just focused on other customers and let us sit there, waiting for our bills, and shrugging off our requests. And that's because they already got their whopping 18% gratuity, which was so not deserved and it was also uninformed. No where in the entire process did they tell us, from the 3 phone calls to my husband, and neither did they seem to mention at the restaurant either. 

I honestly think that this restaurant, if you came with a group of 2-4 people would get a solid 3.5 -4 stars...but they simply cannot accommodate a group larger than 6, not gracefully at least, which is what their décor seems to present. This is what happens when business owners are greedy, they don't know when to say no to certain reservations and their service is the thing to suffer the consequence. We would have been happier if they just said \"sorry, we can't accommodate a group size that big\" and we would move on, as their is a plethora of restaurants in the area. 

Needless to say, we will not be returning to Bazara after our bad experience.
Do not book a large event here. You will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Arrived with low expectations and was blown away by the freshness and crisp preparation of the spicy tuna rolls. The soft shell crab curry and sticky rice was also a stand-out.  They could have a better beer selection, but overall, this place does a great job with the oft-tired asian fusion concept and is a draw even on the food hub that is ossington strip."}
{"text":"So... I was a bit skeptical going here for date night but I was really craving sushi, wanted to explore the area and after reading yelp reviews... Decided. 

When we arrived on a Thursday night, we had a 8pm reservations. We got the seat by the window overlooking Ossington and great for people watching. As it was a quiet evening in the restaurant, with it being at 60% filled, it was quiet and very romantic as it was dimly lit with the massive chandelier in the middle. I believe there is more seating in the back where the food is prepared but I'm not sure. 


After reading yelp reviews and looking over the menu all day at work (jk) I knew what I wanted. 
First we tried the soft shell crab with dipping sauce. This was good, the crab was as meaty as it could be. I probably wouldn't get those again just because I feel the taste was very basic and I can get the same effect from say shrimp or calamari. 

We ordered the sushi pizza, spicy salmon. This was very good. Fresh and not overly coated in spicy mayo. It was delicious. All the reviews said that the fish melts in your mouth with it being so fresh and I thought ew how is that possible. Well it actually is so tender and fresh that it absolutely melts in your mouth. It is delicious. 

We ordered the snow white roll which we'll definitely get again. the salmon priceless roll with was light and fresh. Perfect roll for the summer.

 Being used to AYCE sushi joints, I thought I wouldn't be full but with what we did order, I was stuffed!! 

Everything was really good. Great service, but not overly friendly. They were still nice tho. The decor is romantic. The location is convenient. 

I will be going here again to try some other rolls."}
{"text":"The food here is is so good that after eating there one night, I couldn't stop thinking abou the food and went back two nights later because I couldn't stop thinking about the spicy crispy beef, spicy tuna roll with black rice, black cod appetizer and red dragon roll.  So delicious!  The atmosphere is lovely as well; great date spot or place to go for dinner with a friend.  It's an underrated restaurant on the Ossington strip."}
{"text":"I come here a lot because the food is great. Fresh, tasty and beautiful presentation. They have nice fixed price lunch menu for $15.00 that is quite substantial in size with lots of choices. The service can be slow at times but for the most part is good. 

They serve black rice with sushi if requested and have a few riceless rolls that are definitely worth a try. 

A lot choices on the menu. If anything there may be too many choices. I get it though - they are trying to cover off some Japanese, Chinese and Thai dishes along with some fusion. I try to have at least one new dish each time I visit!

My favourites so far:
Sushi pizza
Salmon tartare
Seaweed salad
Black cod 
Bazara roll
Spider roll
Any of the riceless rolls


Don't wait! Get to Bazara today!"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant located on a street with a ton of other cool shops! They don't have many options for entrees so my boyfriend and I just got a bunch of apps and sushi rolls. For the sushi, the waiter gave us the option of changing all the white rice to black rice - however we had never tried black rice sushi before so we just got the Bazara roll which comes with it. There's not much of a difference taste wise but it did have a really grainy texture which was interesting! Really recommend:

The seared Cajun tuna - refreshing with a zingy edge! 
The crispy beef unagi rolls were also delicious - though we didn't taste much beef inside the roll 
The bazara roll - comes with black rice 
Kamikaze roll - this was my favourite! 
Wasabi roll - the tuna tasted really fresh 

We ordered 3 apps and 3 rolls and we were pretty full by the end. If you're in the area, or even if you're not in the area, would recommend you try this place!"}
{"text":"Fabulous spot!!
Two girlfriends and I stumbled into here after we were put on a wait list at Hawker Bar and we're surely glad we did. 
PLACE - The atmosphere is quite intimate which was perfect for a night of catch up for us. The layout also renders itself well to a group atmosphere as the table of eight ladies seems to be having a great time.
MENU - AMAZING. I am honestly thinking about who else I have made plans to have dinner with over the next while so I can go back and try the items I didn't get a chance to.
The menu is predominantly sushi; unique rolls, nigiri and sashimi, however their appetizers are what really tickled my fancy. So many fish tartare and carpaccio to choose from! For those that prefer their protein cooked, there is a section of curries and rice dishes to choose from and soups and salads to start with. 
FOOD -  I opted for the wasabi roll and my friends chose the chicken teriyaki. We all gave our stamp of approval on the presentation, portion size and most importantly, flavour.
DRINK - We each ordered a glass of wine, some 6 and some 9oz. Their 6oz glasses are $10-11 and 9oz are $15 up. In many cases you could spend more on a glass of wine than your meal, depending on how much food you order (we didn't get apps). It wouldn't hurt for them to bring it down a price point, but I also recognize their location and that does warrant them an inflated price point standing (sadly). As well, with sushi roll and rice dishes ranging from $10-15, they need to increase their bill sales somewhere and beverages are where to do it.
SERVICE - Service was more than adequate. He was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. Our bill had to be requested but it was no bother at all. 
Overall this is a MUST and repeat visit for me. Give this place a go and you won't be disappointed. The menu alone will have you  dancing in your seat.
Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Food is very good, service isn't. This is a good spot for getting a good quality sushi above the usual AYCE/cheap sushi joints, but without being super expensive and fancy. It's a quiet, intimate spot for a date. 

We ordered the ahi tuna app, green curry entree, and a couple of rolls. The grilled Snow White roll was the star, it was warm and very flavourful, so order this for sure. I'm addicted to the tuna - it's fresh and the sauce is amazing - but it's a very very small app. 

I just wish the service were better. It took forever to order, get our food, get our drinks, get our bill. The servers seemed unhappy lol."}
{"text":"Normally \"Asian Fusion\" places are big on ideas and weak in fundamentals. Bazara has great ingredients, simple yet delicious, and surprising in just the right way. 

It's open for lunch, which is hard to find on Ossington. 

Not crowded but it should be. Try it out, and try rolls with black rice instead of white. Amazing."}
{"text":"Interesting experimental sushi restaurant on the Ossington strip. Highly recommend the volcano roll and the shrimp dumplings. Prices are very reasonable considering the originality and quality of the dishes."}
{"text":"Dined here recently for a catch-up session with friends.  It was our first time here and boy were we impressed!  Lovely ambiance to start, definitely a notch up from the typical Asian restaurant.  Our booth near the window made for nice people-watching as well as great conversation.  We all ordered from the $15 lunch prix fixe menu.  I opted for the mango salad, Thai dumplings and yummy yam rolls.  Sampled my husband's General Tao chicken as well.  Dishes were artfully plated, such a treat for the eyes.  Most important, they were all delicious as well!   I would definitely recommend trying these dishes and would do so again in the future (it's earned new repeat customers here!)...although I would also like to sample the rest of the menu over time.  Great menu variety for those who are indecisive/eclectic in their taste buds.  Very decent pricing as well.  Great job!"}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars rounded up because the maki roll was so good. The rolls here are fantastic. However, I find the other menu items to be hit or miss. I love love loved the ambiance - it felt like we were dining in someone's living room. The chandelier and the decor in the main room are actually quite stunning. At first, we were seated in the back room, but we asked to switch to the front room (which was a lot better).

Food: Ordered the crispy beef wrapped unagi rolls, snow white maki roll with black rice, tuna and avocado riceless roll, spicy salmon pizza, and the general tao chicken.

Would order again:

Crispy beef wrapped unagi rolls - the name doesn't lie!! This is unagi (eel) wrapped in beef and deep fried to be crunchy on the outside. Really really good. 

Snow white maki roll - This is melt-in-your-mouth. It's a grilled roll, so is served a bit warm. (I've tried grilled or fried rolls before where it was served too hot, or the rice became mushy because of the heat). But Bazara's snow white roll wasn't like that at all. The rice kept its integrity and was a medley of delicious flavours. Add a dab of soy sauce and a bit of ginger, and you're good to go.

Tuna and avocado riceless roll - The beauty of riceless roll was the amount of tuna it had in it. Each roll (which was wrapped in thin cucumber slice) had a substantial amount of tuna wrapped around avocado. It really highlighted the taste of the tuna. However, note that this dish only comes with 4 pieces (not 8).

Would not order again:

Spicy salmon pizza - Too much sauce. I think it was some kind of light bbq type sauce that was incorporated into the pizza (spread on the rice and under the salmon). I would've enjoyed this dish much more without the sauce. But even still, I don't think I would order this again. Each bite was so overwhelmingly the taste of deep fried rice, that the salmon just got lost. It's also called spicy salmon but I didn't taste the spicy part.

General tao chicken - once again, too much sauce. The chicken was done well, and it was crispy. But drenched in sauce. And the sauce really wasn't that good. It doesn't come with rice, so we had to order a bowl of steamed rice for $2. You could get this dish for much cheaper elsewhere."}
{"text":"I just finished a delicious dinner with my fiancé at Bazara and I HIGHLY recommend it ! Everything we ordered was superbe. We had The lettuce wraps, crispy beef, and chicken gyoza. All A+++!! One of my favorite restaurants in the city. The waitress Suzanne is a doll. We are blown away Everytime we come by the quality of the food."}
{"text":"so good, everything is amazing. Only one server so be prepared to wait. food is too good to care about speed."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favourite sushi places in Toronto.  I love the ambience, the service, the variety of food and the quality of food.  All around 5 stars.  You won't be limited to sushi here, there is a little bit of everything for everyone, done in a classy way.

BLACK COD - amazing, this is almost as good as the one at Guu (which is my have black cod dish!).  It's so buttery and delicious, the flavours really worked with the miso - very highly recommended.

PAN FRIED GYOZA - this was a pleasant surprise!  It felt home made, the flavours were rich and it was panfried - nothing was hidden by being deep fried!

DIM SUM HAR GOW - hmmm being in the mood for sushi, sure I could have gone for dim sum as well!  That's the beauty of this place, there is a little bit some something for everyone.  The Hargow wasn't anything special, but it was a good touch because it satisfied all my craving and senses.

THAI TOM YUM SOUP (SHRIMP) - this was delicious, very fresh and filled with hearty vegetables, it was very refreshing.

VOLCANO ROLL - it was crunchy deliciousness.  I love sushi that is fresh and also not filed with a thick layer of rice.  This roll was all ingredient and very little rice, it tasted fresh and the presentation was beautiful.

GREEN DRAGON - very well done, classic and traditional, but it was very fresh and very nice flavours, beautiful layered with Avocado.  

Overall, it was reasonable priced, the service was very attentive.  This is a good mixture between quality food of homemade mommy goodness and Yuzu classiness without the pricey-arm-and leg experience.  A must go, everyone that walked by stopped immediately to look at the menu, this place will do very well."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday with a party about 20. It was about 6:30pm and the restaurant was happy empty. As soon as we walked in there was no one to greet us so we sat ourselves at the second table assigned to our group. 

As we were ready to order it took a few times to flag the waiter down. Clearly they didn't have enough workers to handle our group and other patrons. We ordered a few martinis and then our food: Beef short ribs, tom yum soup and a dragon roll. The soup tasted decent, full of flavour and spice. We waited about 20 mins for our main entree the short ribs which didn't taste $27 quality worth. The ribs were dry and lacked flavour. Also the purple rice it came with tasted u undercooked. The presentation was also lacking on this dish. For a $27 dish, I expected it to look flawless. After we finished this dish, I still haven't received my dragon roll and so 30mins later it came. This was probably the worst dragon roll i've ever had. Usually speciality rolls come in 8pcs but 5 pcs for $14?! Totally not worth it! The roll lacked flavour and had some weird nuts in the middle that threw off the whole overall taste. During the dining experience, the waiter didn't attend to us as we had to ask multiple times to have our water filled and for extra wasabi/ginger for our sushi roll.

So finally we were done eating we decided to ask for our bill. I think it took about 3-4 times to ask for our bill before it came. After reviewing the bill, we realized we were charged an extra 4 drinks which we did not have. Lastly, they did not inform our group of an automatic gratuity charge which we had discovered after leaving the restaurant. Not to mention a cake fee for each person. Talk about greed over service. I usually don't mind paying a 15-20% gratuity charge but for the service and food that we received, it was totally not worth it."}
{"text":"Pros: Speedy service, loads of menu options, amazing black cod, fresh Maki rolls. 

Cons: Very limited drink menu. Not a big deal, but some odd decor and ambiance was a little lacking."}
{"text":"Really great quality sushi! I was super impressed with the freshness and variety offered up here. The only thing bizarre about Bazara is the decor - it's pretty stuffy for an Ossington strip place. I think the decor could do with a bit of a face lift, but hey, that's just me."}
{"text":"Go here!!! Absolutely incredible... One of the best meals I have had in Toronto ... Everything was unbelievable. Even a simple spicy tuna roll was unanimously the best we'd ever had. The crispy beef was out of this world. The meso cod was phenomenal. Despite there being one waitress the service was not too slow, so I don't know why all he complaints about service. Go here."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi I've had in Toronto or anywhere. Not cheap but wow! Worth every Pennie.. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Very good asian restaurant. 
Went for lunch, had their 3 course deal.. Went with the mango salad which was perfect... Crisp, clean, fresh... 
Then had the spicy salmon rolls and crisp beef, everything I tasted was delicious..they've got a very cool menu, can't wait to try more stuff"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto from NYC for the weekend and didn't realize you guys were celebrating Thanksgiving!  Fortunately, Bazara was open on Sunday night, as not many other places were, and I got to have one of the best sushi dinners I've had in a really long time.  Granted, this is the kind of sushi that's catered to a Western hemisphere palate.  It's not totally authentic Japanese, as far as I can tell, so if you're looking for that, go elsewhere.  But for \"westernized\" sushi, it was about as good as it gets.  Definitely get the Bazara roll, made with black rice [!!].  I also got a roll with grilled red snapper on top.  My dad got shrimp and scallops in lotus leaf which was a perfect seafood dish for the person in your party who's not thrilled with raw fish.

I've been around the block when it comes to sushi, and I can say that Bazara was truly delicious, fresh, and worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I orderd volcano and crispy trio. They look amazing and taste delicious! Also, the atmosphere is really nice!! It's good place for a date. I think it's the best sushi place in Toronto!! I'm sure I'll come here again!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely incredible.  Unique, and the taste was on point.  Didn't think that sushi could taste so good.  My boyfriend and I ordered the crab curry on coconut sticker rice which was a show piece.  Portion could have been a bit bigger.  But it was, unique and the taste was memorable.  The spicy salmon roll although commonly ordered amongst many japanese restaurants, also was exceptionally good.  

It is also a good date place, fabulous ambiance, not too loud, and dim lighting with modern decor.  

However the service was incredibly slow, and awful.  Mind-you, the waitress told us, they had an extreme backlog in take-out orders that caused dining room service to be exceptionally slow.  Which i personally do not find excusable when you are running a business. I also found them to be understaffed, and unfortunately that does not make up for poor service.  However, in terms of food rating itself, it was absolutely incredible.  

Service 1/5 and food 5/5"}
{"text":"Great family owned sushi establishment. You must eat the different sushi and maki options they have available - one of the best sushi restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"I can see why people give this place high ratings. I'd personally give this place a 3.5 star (rounded up because I think I came at a good time and I could tell they put a lot of effort in the decor).

Bazara Asian Cuisine is a nicely Western decorated Asian Cuisine that serves Japanese maki, sashimi and sushi, Thai food such as red and green curry and also Chinese food such as dim sum. 

Entering in, the server kindly lit our candle and provided us with waters. We came on a Tuesday, so there wasn't too many people. I wasn't able to see the \"slow service\" that other people stated in their reviews.Prices are fair and closer to the expensive side - an eight piece maki roll is on average, about $12. The curries are cheapest at $14 each, with other mains at higher prices.

We got the snow white maki roll ($12), green caterpillar maki roll ($10), spicy salmon pizza ($9) and the green curry ($14) with extra jasmine rice being $2. 

Snow White Maki Roll:
(Grilled Roll) - avocado, crab meat, caviar, house sauce, scallion wrapped with snapper. This roll was delicious and nicely placed on a long plate. I could tell the chef spent a lot of effort in making the rolls beautiful, but if I were to be nit-picky, they weren't cut the same size. The rice was also a little soggy for my preference. The snapper was grilled very nicely though.

Green Caterpillar: 
Unagi, cucumber, pine nut wrapped with avocado. The avocado had beautiful fork pressed marks on it. The presentation was great - same thing, they weren't cut the same size. There was an adequate amount of unagi though and the taste was pleasant. I thought the seaweed was a little tough in some parts and the rice was again, a little soggy.

Spicy Salmon Pizza:
This was really good because a lot of all you can eat places don't spend a lot of time making this. This pizza was TOPPED with a ton of spicy salmon. Would recommend this dish.
 
Green Curry:
A petite size with a small cup of rice. I've never seen rice presented in that shape and I was definitely surprised to find out that it was $2 for something this small, especially eating regularly at Chinese restaurants. The green curry didn't have a lot of sauce, but it had A LOT of chicken and greens. 

Overall, a restaurant to try, come check it out especially for the nice decor, but expect it to be more expensive than your average restaurants."}
{"text":"Nous venons d'y manger et c'était un délice  dans un beau petit decor raffiné et avec un excellent service .
Je vous le recommande vivement"}
{"text":"Very good food; very slow, random service on a not too busy Saturday night.  Four of us ordered a combination of sushi and curry dishes.  Tempura came first, then 5 min later one person's curry dinner; then 15-20 min later, one sushi; then 5-10 min later the other sushi.  Hopeless.  Half of us were finished eating before other people got any food.  Servers seemed well-meaning but low-energy or only mildly committed to service."}
{"text":"wow, Wow. WOW! Is all I can say!

I went here with a friend the other day who swore to me that Bazara made the best sushi he'd ever had, but I remained pretty skeptical (I've eaten at quite a few sushi places around Toronto). 

However, I have to say that sushi here is unbelievable and one of a kind! The rolls are made precisely and the fish is incredibly fresh! It is 100% worth it to upgrade to the black rice for at least some of your maki. The black rice (which I had never tried) has a nutty flavour that balances the fish and other ingredients perfectly. Bazara uses what I can only assume are fried rice crispies as their crispy \"tempura bit\" filling, which elevates the maki to another level! We tried the spicy tuna, volcano and green dragon rolls, which were all great. My favourite was definitely the spicy tuna with black rice and if I get the chance to go back, I would consider just getting a heap of that one! We also started with bowls of their Hot and Sour soup with had a great depth of flavour and good texture as well. 

The only negative thing I could say about Bazara is that they only have ONE person making all the sushi and ONE waiter for all of the tables, which means when the restaurant gets busy, the service can be a little slow. That said, I would rather wait an extra few minutes for out-of-this-world sushi then get mediocre rolls very quickly.

All in all I would highly recommend Bazara - each piece of sushi is like a little gift that must be properly savoured. Anyone wanting to take their sushi dining experience to the next level must make their way here!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful and the food is equally amazing. The volcano roll is a must and won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Sexy and intimate atmosphere. Such a cool part of town. We walked in after a live show at the Lower Ossington and they gladly sat us at 10:10pm and didn't rush us out 2 hours later. Friendly, attentive staff who weren't overbearing at all. Creative Asian fusion that was delicious and beautifully presented. Will go back!"}
{"text":"Simply the best. The best roll in Toronto is the volcano roll with black rice. These are facts."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends yesterday. We decided we'd share our apps and mains to get a little taste of everything.

Apps we had: 
- Salmon Tartare: very fresh salmon mixes well with the mango
- Volcano Roll: also fresh salmon, really cruchy tempura bits, and thin layer of rice
- Gyoza: home-made and bursting with juicy flavour
- Seaweed salad: just the right amount of crunchiness and awesome dressing

All of the apps were great, but the clear winner for me was the Volcano Roll. I can't remember what was in the roll other than salmon and tempura but the flavours were amazing.

Mains we had:
- Green Curry with Chicken
- Red Curry with Vegetables and Tofu
- Fried Rice

The mains were a little bland, the fried rice was the best of the three I tried (there were more on the table). 

The atmosphere is really cozy and the decor is like stepping into a dim-lit, trendy home. The service was great but slowed down a little as they got slammed with orders. Overall a great place to go, next time I'll try some different mains or better yet, order more of their sushi!"}
{"text":"the best rolls in Toronto; a bit overpriced but it is worth it . My favourite roll is Volcano ;)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found this place on yelp and we were not disappointed. The service was great the food was awesome. Spicy salmon is my favorite roll so far. The daily fixed menu is a great list of options. I highly recommend giving this place a try. You will enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a spot like this for a long time. Best sushi spot in the city. Unbelievable quality across the board."}
{"text":"Best lunch deal on ossington 
3 courses for 15.00
And high quality ingredients & the ownership is"}
{"text":"Today I went to a sushi restaurant on ossington is call Bazara.  It was so amazing. I started with an organic miso soup.  I was the best miso soup I ever had.  It come with a few different kind of mushrooms and follow with a salmon tartare the fish was so fresh it was perfect match with the yuzu sauce.  For the main I had the volcano roll and crispy roll with black rice.  The black rice is their specialty,  it adds a better flavor to the sushi and it is healthier.  One thing I have to say the sushi roll has thin rice ouside and lots of fish inside which I hardly see it any where else.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in a while. A++++

None of the entrees stood out to us, so we opted for a few appetizers and rolls. This is a really great way to keep the meal affordable but filling. 

The menu is an amalgamation of different Asian cuisines. We ended up deciding on:
I) Salmon Tartare
II) Soft Shell Crab
III) Thai Dumplings
IV) Ha Gaow
V) Chicken Wonton Soup
VI) Snow White Roll
VII) Gold Dragon Roll 

Do check out the menu to see the great ingredients included in each of these dishes. Everything was presented beautifully. I'd say the salmon tartare and crab were my favourites, but honestly it was all delicious. 

The restaurant is definitely more put-together than the Asian places I usually visit, with a warm interior and large, comfy seating. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Yes!

Finally, I have found a sushi place that balances delicious sushi, ambiance and cost, extremely well.

FOOD: I have tried maybe 50% of the makis, and they are really delicious. The sashimi is killer. Have not ventured into their hot dishes, but have heard great things about the general tao.

AMBIANCE: Intimate and cozy. I would come here with 2-4 people. Last time I came with a rowdy group of 8, and I am pretty sure we were annoying others around us.

WINE: Good selection, even better prices.

I will be coming here again, maybe, this week."}
{"text":"One of my new fav sushi spots on the city.  Great service also.. keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat the heck is going on here? When I first tried it a year ago I loved it. Yes, the service was incredibly slow. We were in a huge group though, so we didn't really notice it. Every subsequent visit was slow. During my last visit, they took a whopping 2 hours to get us our aps. Then they forgot about our mains and asked us if we'd like the bill. 3 hours later we were out of there. No joke.

My interpretation of this is tasty food but consistently severely understaffed.

If you go there, try the rolls and get the black rice on your rolls. I miss the black rice, but I can't go back there. Fat pregnant lady is not happy."}
{"text":"This place has ruined sushi anywhere else for me. No place I've eaten in this city even comes close to how amazing the food here is, especially with black rice. 

Everything is incredibly fresh, expertly prepare and GEORGEOUSLY plated. Each dish can only be described as a complete work of art. 

My personal non-sushi favourites are the wonton soup and soft shell crab in yellow curry. Honourable mentions go to the black cod and salmon tartar aps. 

You know what? Everything is great. Just order everything. Right now. Just go. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal, and I loovveed the fact that they provide metal chopsticks instead of the splintery wooden ones most places use. 

I thought it was a nice touch that they bring out the rolls one by one because they can all be served at the optimum temperature that way, but I do feel like I ate less than I normally would have because my stomach had time to digest in between (good thing for my waistline, but probably not great for the restaurant's bottom line because I'll order fewer rolls in the future- especially since the bill for two people came to $60). Overall, though, I was very happy with the experience and will definitely be back.

One side note- in case you're curious, there are not free refills on drinks. Our waiter didn't mention that, so it was a bit of a surprise when the bill came"}
{"text":"Not the fastest resto, but get over it as its fucking incredibly delicious. The best sushi I've ever had. The salmon sashimi is also to freakin die for."}
{"text":"By far....best sushi place I've ever tried. And that's a big statement.

It's so fresh and UNIQUE.

The flavours are unbeatable! Yup, beat sushi I've tried in my life.

Must try if in Toronto! In a week, I've already been here 3x.

The staff is also very very very friendly!"}
{"text":"If you are hungry. Don't bother.  The service is very slow and there are far better places just next door.
I came because I love sushi and while there are so many amazing restaurants on ossington, I figured it would be nice to see how this one stands up. 
Not worth it. The prices are obscenely high and the portions are tiny, not fresh and the staff is less than friendly."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite sushi/Asian restaurant in town in terms of taste and value. 

The taste and presentation are exceptional and truly demonstrate the meaning of \"cooking with love\".  Well done to the chef!"}
{"text":"4.5 Amazing pre-fix menu for lunch!! Especially if you share some of the sushi rolls. I've been twice now and everyone has left full & happy. Fair pricing and good presentation."}
{"text":"The lunch is 15 dollars an comes with a three course meal. Awesome value.

Not only is the value terrific it has fresh, fantastic ingredients. High recommend for a great lunch in the ossington area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered the \"drunken\" garlic shrimp, the chicken satay, the bazara roll and the kamizaze roll. The shrimp was die for - beautifully cooked and served with sauteed vegetables cooked in a buttery garlic sauce (the sauteed mushrooms are really what took this dish over the edge for me). The chicken satay wasn't amazing, but we ate it without complaining. 

The bazara roll was very good - I loved the crunch of the black rice - but it was the kamikaze that ensured that this place was our new Japanese go to. 

The restaurant is also beautifully decorated. All in all, I really can't see anyone leaving here disappointed."}
{"text":"Slow/bad service but really good sushi! I had to ask to get a menu since they just showed us our seats and attended other customers. 

They also took 30 mins to serve anything which was weird. And the serving of food is random! Would rather go somewhere else for sushi!"}
{"text":"When you first walk in, you'll probably ask yourself if you walked into the right restaurant. It's a dimly lit restaurant with very classy decor, it's like you're in somebody's dining room because it has a chandelier, a huge mirror and the furniture, table and table cloths look like very classy and have a fine dining american restaurant kind of feel. It was a unique experience just entering Bazara. In the back, you can see the sushi bar and a small peephole into the kitchen.

The service was excellent and the rolls were absolutely delicious, the rice is more mushy than rolls at other restaurants but it adds to the texture of the rolls almost melting in your mouth. I didn't mind having the rice a bit softer. Their rolls are pretty unique and I haven't seen the ingredient combinations before, also they're really good. The flavours complement each other nicely and has great texture when you're eating the dishes.

The spicy salmon pizza was also amazing. It was very crispy, which I enjoyed and the mayo sauce mixture with the sweet salmon complemented the deep fried rice very well. You can tell the salmon was excellent quality because it was cut up salmon sashimi.

The green curry chicken that we had was average and came with less rice than we expected.

All in all, I'd highly recommend this place because the rolls are really good and is a must try! Also the prices are not that bad, spending around $25 / person which is less than AYCE but the quality is so much better and we were just as full."}
{"text":"A friend lives in this area and we wanted to catch up over some dinner so she suggested Barzara.  

It was already 7pm on a Saturday night and we had no reservations.  I called ahead of our arrival and was told the next available reservation would be 9:15pm.  We decided to chance it and wait to see if we could get a table sooner.  She arrived right at 8pm and waited only a few minutes before a table opened up.  A good start but that's about where it ended.

I arrived around 8:15pm.  Menus were already at our table so we looked them over.  We quickly decided to try a few apps and a sushi roll.  We closed our menus and waited.  No one came by to take our drink order or offer us water.  For the next 25 to 30 min. we watched as 2 servers ferryed food to all the tables surrounding us, while avoiding our gaze or even acknowledging that we were ready to order.  

Finally, closer to 9pm, a server came to take our order - salmon tartar ($8), the UFO ($10), crispy shrimp ($8) and volcano rolls with black rice ($10).  We also ordered a bottle of the cab. sav ($38).  He mildy appologized but even as he was taking our order his gaze was fixed on his other tables.  

Once the order went in, the food did arrive quickly at our table, everything but the volcano rolls which we had to enquire about after everything else had arrived and was eaten.

Food-wise, I thought everything was decent.  The salmon tartar was small but delicate and fresh tasting.  The shrimp was good and the UFOs were tempura sweet potato with spicy tuna atop.  The volcano rolls were also great, once they finally made it to our table.  

We saw many dishes go by and I can say the main portions look quite generous - large plates of crispy beef and General Tao's chicken for sharing amongst 4 people.

We weren't in a rush for dinner which is why we didn't just get up and walk out but the service here was definitely lacking on this night.  Maybe because I was the only Asian customer in an Asian restaurant (always a bad sign) or because we weren't like all the other clients who looked like they just read about Bazara in the most recent issue of Toronto Life.  Whatever the reasoning, I'll pass on coming back."}
{"text":"This place is a joke - we have been sitting here for an hour and still haven't received our appetizers. Yes I am sitting here writing this review and I can see that the servers are in the weeds. I wish that we had just walked down a few more steps and gone to any other restaurant on ossington. Its Saturday night and you expect these guys to be fully staffed. I should just pay for my saki and walk out. Don't fall for the reviews here. Review written and no sign of appetizers.

Update - food finally arrived and our order trickled in for the next 30 minutes. I finally found out why - there was one person preparing food for 12 tables (about 50 people) - that's a little crazy for a busy Saturday night. Food was actually good and on par with decent sushi places around town. Was it extraordinary..nope...will I be back...not a chance."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. When my dad visits me he lets me choose the restaurant and I choose a new exciting one every time, but when I took him to Bazara he wanted to go back a second time. The first time I ate there actually it was the kind of thing where I woke up the next morning thinking about it and wanting it. There are very few good sushi restaurants in Toronto so I was happy to find this place. It's weird that it's not a lot more busy. Perhaps it's because they are always playing Jack Johnson and other similarly annoying music. I really really really wish they wouldn't do that, but I'm not going to deduct a star for it, and it won't stop me from going back. They have a lot of delicious appetizers and a really good list of special rolls that are all really creative compared to your run of the mill sushi. My favourite is the Snow White roll. Some of their rolls are served warm and some are served cold. I recommend you try substituting with black rice, it is really satisfying."}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing food and ambiance.
This is a great place for a date.  My date was not into sushi before but definitely likes it now.
We shared the mushroom beef rolls and the shrimp for appetizers. And then we shared the volcano roll which was my favourite and another roll whose name I forgot. But it was all amazing."}
{"text":"The food here is actually quite good. Best sushi in the area for sure. But the ambience is beyond weird, and the service is absolutely god awful."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant with friends Saturday Feb 27th. The store front of the location is deceiving. The moment I walked through the glass front doors I had a great feeling about this restaurant. The seating was mostly in booths at the front and very intimate. The decor is outstanding with a chandelier and grey colours through out. You could be in your own dining room, it was elegant. 

We had sushi which was amazing .. spicy tuna, spicy salmon, tornados with brown rice and California rolls.We also had the crispy beef and curried vegetables and they were fantastic.

The food was a little slow to arrive, but we were not there to be rushed. The wait staff is extremely friendly.

This place is a must go to on your dining out list."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my wife and we each got the $15 lunch prix fixe. I opted for the hot and sour soup, Thai chicken satay and spicy salmon sushi pizza. The soup was well balanced and very good, not too spicy and delicious. Chicken skewers were ok, probably would have been better if they were grilled (or grilled more?). Sushi pizza was excellent, loads of salmon with spicy mayo and a sweet teriyaki sauce mixed with crispy tempura bit on a thin layer of rice. 

My wife had the same soup, vegetable tempura and yummy yam roll. Veggie tempura was very good with a thin crispy batter though the serving size was a little small. Yummy yam roll was a little odd for me, banana in a savory roll didn't work for me but my wife liked it. 

Overall good food and nice decor. We would come back again."}
{"text":"Went to pizza liberato and they were full so accidentally found this little gem.

Decent service as they were busy but food was to die for!

Had the black cod, salmon miso, salmon sashimi, volcano and snow white rolls. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Bazara is indeed a bazar, with a mish-mashed Asian menu... but it isn't bizarre, it's delicious. 

The ambiance at Bazara is equal parts adorable floral booths, sparkling chandeliers and easy listening. OK, the listening isn't actually that easy, it's a touch depressing... maybe go a little easier on the Bon Iver and Bright Eyes? No one wants to cry in their sushi. Their delicious, delicious sushi. 

I had the crispy rolls, and they were artfully presented and very, very tasty. Since they don't only specialize in Japanese food, my partner in noshing opted for Chinese, and had the wonton soup and General Tso. We both loved out meals, and this eclectic menu isn't intimidating, it's actually quite streamlined. 

A welcome addition to the strip."}
{"text":"wow. this place blew us away. everything we ordered was great. each dish grabbed our attention more and more. the hot and sour soup and organic miso soup were fantastic. the sweet potato golden shrimp, ha gaw and scallop carpaccio were all fabulous. i found the spicy scallop sushi pizza a little greasy along with the crispy beef wrapped unagi, but still quite enjoyable. the bill was around $80 for the three of us and he atmosphere was cozy, romantic and classy. for the quality and the experience, you can't beat the price. definitely my new go-to!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood, had a hankering for sushi, and took the advice of Yelp and tried Bazara. I'm so happy I did! It was a quiet Sunday night around 8pm and there were a few other tables eating, mostly couples or small families. It was by no means busy or packed and I had great, attentive service.
Atmosphere: Nice decor and comfortables booths. The style wasn't overdone or kitschy, just classic and simple. I was greeted right away and shown to a table. The service all night was fantastic and the wait for food was not long. I appreciated that they give you a fork with your chopsticks, as I'm sure some patrons require it, but I did find the metal chopsticks to be less effective than the wooden style I am accustomed to. AKA I dropped two pieces of sushi which basically never happens, so I chocked it up to the chopsticks. But who knows, maybe I'm losing my grip. ;) 
Offerings: I had water and two sushi rolls: the Volcano Roll and Gold Dragon, both with normal rice. I eat sushi incredibly regularly, at least once a week, and both of these rolls were incredibly fantastic. I wish I could add them to my repertoire of rotating sushi restaurants. Spoiler alert, I can't because I live in California. The fish tasted fresh while the flavor combinations of the rolls was complex and interesting without detracting from the quality of the fish. Some places overload their rolls with sauces, but these rolls let the natural flavors shine. I was incredibly full after my two rolls but still seriously considered getting one more just because I didn't want the taste to end. I thought both rolls were fantastic and couldn't pick a favorite. The Volcano had a slight kick to it, but I wouldn't go so far as to call that spicy, more like a warmth to it. The Gold Dragon was just an overall collection of great flavors, enhanced by the high quality of salmon on top. Very well done Bazara! If I'm ever back in Toronto, you're on my list!"}
