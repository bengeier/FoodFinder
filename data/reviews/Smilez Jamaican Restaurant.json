{"text":"Went to pick up a Stewed chicken dinner. The stewed chicken is not the best all things considered, has a heavy taste of allspice in it. Wasn't a fan. The chicken was okay, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Everytime I come home from university I make it a mission to come eat here. I have eaten at every single Jamaican restaurant in the area and I can say without a doubt that this beats all of them by a long shot. Food is always fresh and authentic and the prices cannot be beat. I always get their jerk chicken or fried chicken as well as the oxtail. Places like charlie's and granny's are no comparison to Smilez. I highly recommend you come if you are a fan of Jamaican food. They also offer lunch specials."}
{"text":"This place just opened up. Interior is small, bright, and quaint. The food is great and authentic. Prices very cheap, they have a great lunch special with jerk chicken and rice that my husband loves. I was blown away by how delicious the soup was! The owner or cashier (not sure) was very friendly and welcoming. They also have a loyalty points program! This place is like a little hidden gem, I'm sure it will be packed before long."}
{"text":"Excellent!
More people need to know about this HIDDEN gem. Came here for lunch yesterday and the owner was very pleasant to talk to. The food is authentic Jamaican and fresh. The seasonings and spice level was on point. I had the $5 lunch special which included stew chicken with rice and peas, coleslaw and a can of pop. I also added 2 pieces of plantain for .50 cents. Pretty good value. I'm planning on coming back to try their oxtail and fried chicken."}
{"text":"Got the Ox-Tail, Jerk Chicken, and their off-menu special sweet and sour fried chicken. All fall of the bone goodness. I got the small and still felt that was a generous serving. The jerk chicken had just the right amount of kick. The ox-tail super tender, and the fried chicken had all the crunch with a nice tangy flavour. I'll definitely be ordering this on #skipthedishes as this restaurant isn't too close to my vicinity."}
{"text":"TIP:  They have $5, YES $5, lunch specials!  See pic of menu.

Solid Jamaican home cookin' here at Smilez!  This unit is hidden in the same industrial plaza as Studio 89, so it's quite tucked away.  Due to the location, I honestly don't think any of these units would get that busy especially in the evenings or even weekend.

Price for a large Fried/Jerk Chicken with rice & peas, a bit of cabbage was $10.50 and of course, there were leftovers!  Large easily feeds 2-3 people.  What I noticed was that food wasn't doused in salt as I find with most Caribbean places.

Lady at counter was friendly when she came out of the back room.

Would be a nice addition if they made their own hot sauces &/or drinks like sorel, or even bottled ginger beer, but I only saw pop, water, & some other kind of fake fruit juice.

Cannot give them a 5 'cause even though food was good, the dine in lacks in atmosphere.  There are only 4-5 smallish tables, 1 wasn't cleaned off, no music playing (Lego movie blasting instead), so just a eat 'n go/takeout type place."}
