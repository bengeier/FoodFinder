{"text":"This is, by far, the worst restaurant experience I have had in my entire life. I have never written a Yelp review before, but was so taken with the terrible service that ruined Valentine's Day dinner I felt compelled to write about it. Waited almost 30 minutes to place our order, and then waited over 2 hours during which we received only 1 of 4 courses. Ended up walking out because the waiter and manager handled the situation in an utmost unprofessional manner. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this tourist trap dump."}
{"text":"With all  the hype that used to surround this place, I tell you what... just walk pass and cross the street to Queue de Cheval or go for the real top food experience in montreal and go to Europea. But this one is a pretentious place with quality food with no soul or creativity. Just cut and paste recipe with too much salt and spice to hide the bland execution. Wine list is good, and sommelier saved the night with perfect wine pick despite a wine list that looks amazing but just because wine that are out of stock are not removed from it.... Great unique champagnes."}
{"text":"Very rarely do I give a 5 star rating to any restaurant (let alone anything - I'm pretty picky)...however, Decca 77 earned that 5th star! The ambiance, to say, the restaurant layout overall, the distance between tables, service and the overall decor is lovely! The lighting is dim but not so much that you cannot see the person in front of you. It's rather romantic actually (so yes, perfect for a date night)! Now to the good part, THE FOOD! Every plate is made with care. The flavors are heavenly no matter what you order! The chef(s) have a talent for both matching flavors and presenting their meals in a way that's almost \"too pretty to eat\".   Not that pretty though. Simply too delicious not to take another quick bite!  Bonus: they offer coat check so you don't have to sit uncomfortably with your coat around you or sprawled on your chair."}
{"text":"Came here twice, both times for lunch,  The place is quite elegant and upscale... with price to match, it's a power lunch kind of place if you want to categorize. However there is a table d'hote for 25$ which includes entrée, a main and dessert, which is a deal in a place like this.  The first time i came here, i had duck confit, which was good, but again it's duck confit which is one of my favorite dishes, so it's always good. But it didn't stand out compared to all the duck confit I've had previously... this is one of those places where everything is done well yet the food lacks a bit of imagination...  This time i had pork, with mash potatoes and courgettes and carrots. Well cooked and nicely plated, but somehow, although it's good and I would go back with someone I'd like to impress, it's not a place that I find awsome in terms of food.  But I like coming here, more style than substance but it's forgivable...maybe next time I'll go to dinner."}
{"text":"Came here on 2013 New Year's Eve for their tasting menu with wine pairing. The food was ok, the waiters were not knowledgeable in the food they were serving, the wine was poured clumsily, not every dish was paired (not sure by mistake or intentionally), they upsold me a flake of truffle for an extra 20$ that had no flavor, and all this cost me more than the tasting menu with wine pairing at canoe Toronto."}
{"text":"Amazing food with creative presentation. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"We had a large group (18 people) birthday dinner here while visiting Montreal in mid January. I had worked with the staff (Marie) via email and phone to plan the meal which was prix fixe ($45 CAN) for app, entree, and dessert. They were very responsive and cooperative in planning everything. We got a long table near the open kitchen and it was a really cool space. There were a few tables nearby but we were mostly in a section alone which was great. The decor was modern and elegant.   They agreed to print a special happy birthday message on the menus for the table as well. The food was excellent and the service was great. No one rushed us at all. I think we actually were there a total of 4 hours! Given the great exchange rate for USD right now in Canada, the overall cost per person for dinner was extremely reasonable. And they agreed to print separate checks! This is the most annoying part of group dinners and they made it so simple which was awesome!   At the very end, we wanted some group photos and the server graciously offered to take them, she even was directing us to make sure everyone was in the shot.   Overall, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this restaurant, especially if you have a large group for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"One word-Amazing! Food was on point from start to finish, flavors popped creating layer upon layer of deliciousness after each perfectly balanced bite. Chef de Cuisine Nicholas Bramos created an amuse-bouche to die for and did not disappoint for the rest of the meal. We couldn't get enough and will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Our meal was outstanding! We had a 'mini' tasting menu of 3 courses + dessert and each one of the dishes was truly spectacular. The mix of flavours and textures made our dinner hard to forget. And the prices are very reasonable, considering the quality of the food. I was very impressed and will for sure come back another time for the full tasting menu with pairings!"}
{"text":"Very nice, very contemporary.   They have approximately a million bottles of wine all over on display, it seems like more of a place for a higher end business meeting than a romantic setting.   The food is a work of art, very talented chef, you notice it when the bill comes, it was over $100 for me and my wife to dine here for supper but I feel it was money well spent. I don't believe I could get this artistic culinary spectacle anywhere else."}
{"text":"Food was good, but there seem to be better places in the area at this price point. Judging from my experience I wouldn't splurge for the tasting menu, but someone in my party did mention that the appetizers were much tastier than the main dishes. Desserts were pretty, but nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful find near our hotel.  Nice selection of appetizers, dinners and desserts, and amazingly accommodating!  We had a member of our party that couldn't eat dairy, and the chef was able to make an alternative tomato sauce that was delicious! The duck confit was excellent, with a crisp outer skin while the meat was amazingly tender and moist with a wonderful flavor.   Also, we had a group of five people and asked to split several desserts, and they made a beautiful presentation with each of the desserts divided into portions to make it easier for us."}
{"text":"The stylish Decca 77 servers a great value luncheon - three courses for $25.  The strength of the lunch were the excellent main dishes - ours included perfectly cooked veal and a rich tasting steak.  The desserts were not quite of that caliber, still, the gimmicky macaroon, stuffed with all kinds of layers that made it look like a hamburger (with other sweet things resembling fries and a coke) was fun to eat.  The appetizer choices of a rich, coriander spiked gaspacho and a smoked sausage made for a good start of the meal.    The wine list did not have a separate page for wines by the glass, so I followed the recommendations of the waiter - and paid dearly.    One more thing:  for a restaurant that tries to be elegant, the dirty, smudged seat covers are a real turn off.  Replace (or wash) immediately!"}
{"text":"Swanky and upscale, but with waiters who are kind and patient, not snooty. The sommelier picked a perfect bottle of wine for us. But be warned: There's nothing cheap about this wine list. Our bottle was $70 and that was one of the least expensive options.   We arrived early on a Friday night so the place wasn't quite buzzing yet, but there was a nice vibe and the entrees were beautifully presented and quite good. They could have been a step more delicious, given the price, but all in all, the evening -- ambience, food, wine and service --was worth the expense."}
{"text":"Food is great, if you are a foodie like me, you will love it. Plates as very small portions tho. Have been 2 times. Got a salad and a main dish both times, and you still have space for deserts as I mentioned plates should be a bit bigger on my opinion, principally base on their prices!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner on a recent trip to Montreal, and it was honestly one of the worst experiences I've had eating out in a long time.  Our server was rude and took forever to bring us drinks. We proceeded to order, and our food took a similar eternity to come out (despite the restaurant being mostly empty). When it did come out, several people didn't receive their salads and others ONLY received salads. When we inquired, our rude waiter informed us that other people would get their entrees later (after everyone else had finished eating). I stated that I didn't want to receive my entree late, and they ignored my request and brought it anyway, forcing me and one other person to eat while everyone stared at us.   To cap everything else off, when we attempted to pay for our meal, our change was withheld as the waiter attempted to shame us into tipping. Then, when we demanded change, they informed us that they didn't have enough cash to break the bill. So, we ended up getting shortchanged.   Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a relative who lives in Quebec.  Nick, the chef prepared the most lavish 7 course dinner with pairings that was just extra-ordinary unbelievable!! The presentation was the eye-candy that was just as pleasantly tasteful as the food itself.  The ambiance was classy yet casual.   Great staff that explained each meal and wine description.  And Ohhhh, the dessert!  Speechless with the variety of sweet and semi-sweet pastries that was perfectly combined on a slate slab.  I have traveled and dined at very fine restaurants,  Decca77 dining experience should be a \"bucket-list\" item for those who can appreciate genuine find dining."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Sheraton in Montreal so I decided to get dinner nearby and was recommended Decca 77. The restaurant had two parts to it, the actual restaurant and the brasserie. I opted for the brasserie and started off with the caprese salad (which included some very delicious yellow tomatoes). I followed up with the gnochi dish which was very nice as well. Overall a pretty good experience, service was nice. If you are staying at the Sheraton it's a good place to walk to and have a bite."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for 21 last night.  these guys know how to handle large groups.  the upper floor had a huge long table that we fit around, and thwere was plenty of room to mingle in that area for an hour before we met.  atmosphere is very nice, dress/casual,and the service was fantastic.  i rarely had an empty glass.  quality of food was very good as well, pretty much up there with my other favorites in Montreal for the style of restaurant.  Takes Amex"}
{"text":"Very expensive and small portion sizes. Food was tasty, but don't go on an empty stomach. Classy place though to have a bite and drink before going home."}
{"text":"J'ai eu la chance de vivre des expériences exceptionnelles à plusieurs occasions pour des dîners d'affaires. Une cuisine raffinée, esthétique, avec des touches de moléculaires.   Malheureusement, à l'occasion du souper, j'ai vécu une profonde déception. Visiblement une cuisine qui manque de constance. Sans m'aviser lors de la réservation, j'ai du me contenter d'un menu restreint pour les événements (spectacles au Centre Bell oblige, il semblerait). Pourtant, nous étions disponible pour une période de 2h45.   Les huîtres étaient remplies d'écailles, mon filet de bar avait la texture d'une languette de caoutchouc et l'assiette était badigeonnée de purée de courge, une présentation répugnante sans ingrédients de qualité ni d'accompagnement gastronomique. Insultant pour un plat à 39$.   Ma conjointe et moi avons peut-être été malchanceux, mais attention, vous pouvez être amèrement déçu malgré une facture salée."}
{"text":"We got screwed over by another restaurant at the last second so we were left scrambling to book a restaurant for 11. Lucky, Decca 77 had plenty of room.   The inside is impressive with high ceilings, comfy booths and a huge wine glass cellar. We came on a Thursday for lunch and almost had the place to ourselves. Likely due to the huge snowstorm. Our waiter, the only one working the front was excellent and amiable.  The menu is short and concise. Oysters, tartares, appetizers and entrees.  - Fresh oysters ($34.00 for dozen) - we got a dozen to start and tried half with the gourmet option ($5.00 extra). We didn't expect them to be baked with cheese on top; we weren't fans. The regular oysters weren't bad but they were a little too warm. Odd that they don't bring them out with ice underneath. Skip them. - Soup of the day - soup was good and hit the spot on a cold winter day.  - Chicken schnitzel, aïoli, lime ($22.00) - they ran out of schnitzel after two orders, which made no sense given that there was no one in the restaurant. - Catch of the day ($35.00) - the special that day was an ahi tuna with seasonal vegetables. The ahi was seared perfectly medium rare and this was easily the best dish we ordered. - 8 oz flank steak and glazed vegetables ($28.00) - the steak was cooked to our liking of medium rare. There was a decent variety of vegetables. - Risotto, mushroom and tartufo ($24.00) - risotto was a miss. It was nowhere near being that perfect, creamy texture; it was actually undercooked. I wasn't a fan and the dish also lacked balance. Someone was way too heavy handed on the cheese. - Gourmet grilled cheese ($16.00) - one of the worst grilled cheeses I've had. The grilled cheese was plain and simple gross. It looks nice with the grilled marks but the taste, texture and flavour was very off putting. Shockingly bad. - Confit salmon, candied shallot and fennel salad ($25.00) - salmon was much better but the fish was slightly overcooked. The side salad was light and reminded me of spring. - Fries - we saw another table order fries which my aunt saw and her eyes lit up so we ordered one for her. I guess it's \"off menu\" so you have to ask for it.  - Creamy chocolate cake and vanilla icing ($7.00) - like a molten lava cake. Rich, creamy and piping hot!  If you like rich chocolate desserts, look no further.  - Lemon tart and grilled meringue ($7.00) - the lemon tart was the complete opposite. The side of raspberry sorbet and chocolate type crumble stole the show though. So light, slightly tart and refreshing.  I knew coming in what to expect and that's essentially how our lunch turned out. A couple good dishes but a lot missteps. This place screams suits/business lunch meetings spot and with a hefty price tag for lunch, one try is good enough for me."}
{"text":"Découverte pour le oyster fest de cette place visiblement très prisée mais expérience plutôt moyenne dès de départ. L'établissement, bien que possédant un bar n'ouvre ses portes qu'à 16h et l'accueil est plutôt froid si on a un peu d'avance, Fan d'huîtres, j'avoue que j'en ai mangé des meilleures, et avec des accompagnements bien plus exotiques. Pour ce qui est de la version curry, un goût bien trop prononcé qui cache complètement la saveur de ces délicieux coquillage. Un endroit où je ne reviendrai pas :("}
{"text":"Can't believe in a city filled with amazing restaurants that this place survives. The only reason this place continues to exist is because of their location facing the Centre Bell. Went there before a concert for supper. They had two items under \"Chef's Suggestions\" so I figured how could I go wrong. I opted for the mushroom risotto, which I figured even the sous-chef couldn't mess up, especially with the chef suggesting it. OMG it was horrible. No taste or texture. Should have been served in a soup bowl. On a positive note, the waitress was very pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"$5 cocktails (list of signature cocktails) mon - Fri 4@7.  The drinks are decent but pricey if you don't go with their 4@7 special.  Been there a few times and was honestly not impressed by the food considering the price. Expect to pay about $30-$40/person for lunch. It is not bad food but I had much better with a smaller price tag.  It is a decent place for business lunches since the restaurant is pretty nice. If you want to impress a date with food, lots of better choices elsewhere."}
{"text":"All 3 of us (including my 10 year old) went for the Chop - their 3-course tasting menu. It was exactly what it should be, the perfect amount of food, all delicious. Patrice was a fantastic server, attentive and helpful without being at all overbearing. They had different options for the courses and each of us tried different things. All of us were quite happy, however, the mushroom risotto stood out as the best of the entrees and the rabbit as the best of the apps. Great experience, right near Centre Bell."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. The restaurant is upscale.  It is very modern.  The food was amazing.  The escargot was tasty. It was prepared with Parmesan and garlic. The lamb chops were some of the best I've ever had.  They were lightly fried and yummy. The steak and fries were wonderful. The steak was perfect medium rare. Great experience."}
{"text":"Food here was honestly very, very amazing.  Went here for an after work event (our office is located in the same tower). We had the set menu. I had a mackerel dish for starters, a delicious braised lamb shank with white beans for my main, and an ice cream sundae for dessert. The food here was excellent and just really beautifully presented, absolutely A++ on the presentation.  Our server was very friendly, kept accidentally switching back into French which was amusing as only half our table could understand, but he quickly corrected himself and we all had a laugh about it!  Decor is simple and elegant. Because the restaurant is on the main floor of an office tower building, it felt somewhat institutional and was lacking warm and coziness, so I wouldn't recommend it for a romantic date spot, but it's definitely great for a group dinner/office function."}
{"text":"My friend chose this place for dinner and it was the perfect spot for us to catch up and enjoy a long, leisurely dinner. The place was empty for a Saturday night and we almost had the entire restaurant to ourselves except for a couple of other tables.   The portion sizes here are huge so I recommend you come hungry or order the plates to share. I got the pappardelle and was only able to eat a third of it. For dessert, I tried the panna cotta. It looked scrumptious but the flavors didn't match up to the appearance."}
{"text":"Les huîtres ne sont pas fraîches ni à bonne température et l'accompagnement est inadapté. Mauvaise cuisson pour les steaks. Mauvais management (en cas de problème, on ne vous propose rien). En résumé, produit de mauvaise qualité et présentation sommaire (mauvais chef) et mauvais management. La place est assez sympatique et calme pour prendre un verre et quelques trucs à grignoter mais bon. On trouve très facilement beaucoup mieux ailleurs. Pour le prix, vous payez la décoration mais oubliez ce qui se trouve dans votre assiette. Je ne remettrai pas mes pieds là bas."}
{"text":"Toujours un plaisir de goûter cette cuisine. A l'occasion de MTL a table, je recommande les baluchons de pintade... Délicieux."}
