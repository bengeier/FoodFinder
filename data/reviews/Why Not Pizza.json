{"text":"Best Pizza that I have been able to find since moving to NC 8 years ago from MD. Truly NY style Pizza. I cant wait to taste their other offerings."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to check out this place for a while because I've heard good things about the pizza. I called in for my order and the girl who picked up was so extremely rude that I didn't even bother ordering. Might want to consider hiring someone who better represents your company with some decent customer service!"}
{"text":"Delicious huge slices for reasonable prices. They bring the pizza to your table and they also have wifi."}
{"text":"Just moved from miami to charlotte. I didn't think I'd be able to find a pizza anywhere like what I used to eat back home. I moved 5 minutes from why not pizza and i decided to try it. I was so pleased to find that this is the perfect pizza for me. The 20in pizza is delicious huge and everything I'd expect out of a ny style pizza. I get extra cheese of course. I would give 5 stars to the restaurant though I've had a few things that weren't to my liking.. but as far as the pizza goes.. hands down without a doubt the best in the area and I am happy to be a repeat customer. Pizza... 10 stars..."}
{"text":"Most ridiculous  excuse for a pizza place ever. No menus no delivery. Over priced pour service. You would think for such a pour location they would make up for it with excellent service and good food but neither. Very rude and pizza is pour quality. But mostly the service. What's it going to take to get a few decent places to eat on this side of town. Will keep waiting for some one to understand customer service"}
{"text":"Excellant torpedo submarine sandwich enjoyed to the last bite. Carry out,ate 1/2 this evening, will eat other 1/2 tomorrow for lunch."}
{"text":"This was the best pizza that I've ever had. And the cannoli was DELICIOUS! I just moved to this side of Charlotte and it's so close."}
{"text":"Im from NYC, and this is the closest you can get to NYC pizza.  There prices are reasonable.  I always order cheese slices and they give you a huge slice that can actually be cut into two slices.  The crust is nice and crispy on the outside but soft and flaky on the inside.  I will continue to go when Im craving for a slice of cheese pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever tried ! I'm not a pizza person but something told me to try a slice of cheese and I'll seriously be back ! I live in Fayetteville and travel to Charlotte often . Glad I came across this place !"}
{"text":"Not much to rate, they had some good pizza. I had a spinach and mushroom pizza. Still haven't found a pizza joint in Charlotte that does beef pepperoni yet. But this place is good I rode by it all the time and finally stopped in to give them a try. Thumbs up.

This is an update review about the Chick-O-Philly. This sandwich is the damn bomb. I always get this when I get a sandwich here cause it's one of the best sandwiches in Charlotte. Now I didn't say, The Best but it's one of them. I got the 12 inch today with fries and it was good. I get it with Everything on it. They never disappoint me any time I come here to eat."}
{"text":"Very good food & service
The best pizza I've had in years and I've lived in Manhattan, Boston and Muami.
Stop going to the chain pizza places like PJ's (cardboard and dirt ) Domino's and PH, the smaller places are always the best and this one is one of those"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in Charlotte!!! Not only it's really good but it's huge!! Why pizza hut??? With this place available there's no way I am interested in anything else."}
{"text":"I decided to give them a try because they have a few vegan options, and whynot? The menu on the wall was a little confusing, but we figured it out. My wife ordered a meatball pizza, my daughter ordered a vegan with onions and black olives, and I ordered a white pizza with jalapenos and onions. After ordering we took a seat and waited. And waited. And waited. Since it was a Friday night, we expected to wait a little while. I was amazed at how many people picked up take out orders while we waited. Finally our pizza was brought to us, and the wait was worth it. Mine had a little bit too much cheese for my taste, but it wasn't too bad. My wife and daughter both loved their selections, which is all that matters anyway. My wife is a New Yorker, she complimented the crust, which she very rarely does South of The City.
The decor was kind of strange. Kind of like they were trying for a NY feel, bit also kind of like a sports bar. I don't know. Overall the pizza was good, not great. Seemed a little pricey for pizza, but not too bad. Clearly I'm on the fence with this one. If you're in the area, then whynot?"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the teriyaki chicken wings...yes, they are fried, but they were crispy deliciousness in my mouth. The meat was fall of the bone tender. The sauce was a leeeetle saltier than I'd like, but obviously not a deal breaker. 

Unfortunately, I can't say I absolutely loved the pizza. But WAIT! It's not necessarily their fault! I decided to give free range to my dining companions to choose toppings. We ended up with entirely too many for this thin crust pizza to handle (counting them now, I can recall at least 8). I'd like to go back and give it another try with 2-4 toppings and see how I feel about it. We also tried the jalape√±o poppers - I do not recommend them. Too much breading and bland (tasted like they came frozen from a bag). 

So, WHY am giving them 4 stars? FIRST, chicken wings!!! If anything I'll be back for them. SECOND, customer service (the cashier) was friendly and very helpful. THIRD, I can see the pizza has potential and as another reviewer mentioned, the prices are indeed pretty fair."}
{"text":"I have only one word to describe this place----YUM!!! Super nice girl works the counter and lasagna is wonderful. We eat there often. So glad it is just down the street from us."}
{"text":"The pizza is good and the large, really is LARGE.  The zeppoli, should be called pizza dough, fried and covered in powdered sugar, stay clear of them. Cannoli were good and yummy but the meatball hero sandwich was unimpressive, tasted like the sauce burnt and was WAY spicy, but the pizza is good."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for pizza, not only do they have vegan cheese options, they also have outstanding customer service!

The crust on their pizza pies is amazingly light and crunchy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza of all time! It is always hot and delicious and HUGE. Don't even think about ordering a large unless you're trying to feed a small army. I recommend ordering a side of their fried ravioli. Yum. Why Not Pizza is by far the best pizza you can get in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"If only they understood just how GOOD their pizza is for Charlotte. Cheese never disappoints. But we ordered a margherita once, and let me tell you they have no idea what a margherita pizza is. No fresh mozzarella, they baked the tomatoes and the basil onto it so it was just black. The craziest thing I've ever seen done to a pizza. And they have GOT to stop using canned mushrooms. Their cheese slices are the bomb! The effort and education is just lacking in their specialty pies and ingredients! Super easy fixes, and they could be the best pizza in Charlotte easily."}
{"text":"Love their sweet chili wings fried hard.. tried the honey bbq but wasnt impressed. Great pizza and good cheesecake. I definitely recommend trying. Wait times are around 20 minutes so would definitely call ahead! The only negative is they don't deliver!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today. Ordered a pep slice and 8 wings. The Cooked clearly prepared my slice first which came out almost cold once the wings were done. I began to eat the wings and they were fried so crispy not to mention they were bagged frozen wings. Not good at all. I then took the wings to the counter eating 1.5 of the 8 wings. She refunded me but actually have the nerve to charge me for eating two wings. I even ordered another slice.(which took 20min to receive). I was spending money and still getting a serious attitude like I had done something wrong. BAD EXPERIENCE!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the Best pizza in Charlotte hands down, the cheese , dough ,pepperoni, sausage, sauce is so freaking good, The slices are enormous..I will be making this my weekly pizza spot"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great hospitality. Food is always fresh and made-when-order. The staff take pride in the quality of their service and food."}
{"text":"I frequent this place quite often! Pizza is really good, as the sauce has awesome flavor! Their calzones are HUGE, and packed on the inside! They definitely don't cut any corners on toppings. I'm bummed they don't deliver anymore..... I'd order a lot more! Customer service is pretty good too."}
{"text":"I am always in search for a  good pie and for a while that's what this place offered me. However, I'm not sure what happen after Alex one of their best pie makers left. I've tried them a few time after but the taste isn't quite the same  nevertheless the pricing and size reminds me of pizza n the northeast."}
{"text":"This place has the best NY style pizza in Charlotte!! The pizza is super cheesy and great down to the last bite. They also have amazing honey BBQ wings. Their prices are always reasonable and they have wonderful employees!

Update: I had an unusually bad experience today. I ordered a pizza around 5pm and came to pick it up close to 6pm. When I arrived they said that my pizza had been picked up. I told them that I didn't pick the pizza up and the cashier made a rude comment saying \"the pizza would have been cold anyways\". Instead they gave me another customers pizza and seemed to not care that they sold my pizza to someone else. I've never dealt with such rude customer service. It would have been nice to just have received an apology and have my problem solved. Instead I received a rude attitude and a smaller pizza. Customer service is what makes a business. I won't be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area, just had the pizza but prob the best pizza in the area hands down!!! Def going back"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Why Not Pizza. I did not have any issues as I gave my order. The cashier was friendly and helpful. As I sat down to wait for my order, there was a customer who became irate due to feeling as if his order was taking too long. He continued to pace back and forth and threatened to get his money back. Although the customer was being very rude, the cashier did not let this upset him. He continued to be professional and courteous. After about 10 minutes or so, my order was ready and it was piping hot. Let me tell you, the taste was amazing. If I had to wait longer for this pizza, it would have been worth it. Perfection takes time. I think I will have to add this place to my rotation. Great pizza... Horrible neighborhood so take this in consideration."}
{"text":"Everything I have ordered is good- they have good pizza sauce! And they don't skimp on the pizza toppings either. They always have my food ready when they say it will be done. Customer service is very good and they cut my pizza the way I want it cut! :) I wish they would deliver, but it is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Uh OHHHH! Got some pizza and knots today. Neither was fresh and we got no sauce with the knots. This shouldn't happen."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, i have been searching Charlotte for a decent cannoli since I left Jersey 6 years ago. The only thing missing from these ,,,,, MORE CHOCOLATE CHIPS IN THE CREAM.  Other than that ,,,,Thank you!"}
{"text":"They have some great pizza however they do not serve water for free. If I'm going somewhere to spend my hard-earned money and I'm ordering food I expect to get a glass of water without paying for it."}
{"text":"Best New York style I've found in Charlotte and certainly beats out anything else you'll find nearby. Service can be slow but it's never bad. Only ever gotten pizza or wings and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in charlotte ! Good customer service and the hidden valley ranch they make is off tha chain!"}
{"text":"OK let's not talk about New York Vs Chicago style, who's got the best etc... These guys do it right! I been getting my pizza here since they opened and it is always the same, Awesome! They have a variety of salads, wings, and other choices, all good. Stop going here or there, when you want a great pizza at a great price, stop looking, it's right here!"}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza but staff has little to be desired. Tables are always dirty with trays left from others so had to clean my own table. No one is ever there when me and my son eat on Sunday afternoons so if you don't mind eating alone and fast unfriendly service for a great pizza then this is the place to be. I only wish the owners knew that customer service is the key to success :) great pies though..... Oh and be prepared for the thin paper plates, lol....."}
