{"text":"The food is fantastic! The environment is very cool! It's a small place, but don't let that deter you from trying them out. The people were absolutely fantastic in helping me order. Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  The owner is so friendly and attentive to customers and the food was great.  Had the Spanish Harlem and the Little Italy on our first visit.  Would highly recommend both.  We will be back often."}
{"text":"$10 dollars for a meatball sandwich with 3 meatballs... Less flavor than subway... New York delis are known for ample quantity that goes with the overpriced food... Here all you get is the overpriced food. To add to it they charged more than what was listed on the menu... Will not be going back... Worst dining experience in the Phoenix area yet... Stay Away.  Obviously they have a lot of friends posting on here as there is NO WAY this is worth more than 2 stars."}
{"text":"Good food and the people are great. This place is a winner!"}
{"text":"Basil Mascarpone Burger  1/3 lb. Caramelized onions, roasted portabellos, tomatoes, mascarpone cheese and basil chiffonade. Includes certified Angus beef and choice of side.   Ordered the burger medium with fries.  TO. DIE. FOR.  :)   I plan on returning just to order every burger off the menu.  They also have a great beer selection in their cooler along with some special soda pops.  Back to the burger, done to perfection, the bun was a buttery bun...and that complimented the flavors on the burger well.  Everything about the burger was heaven, the mascarpone cheese melted into the roasted portabellas, tomatoes, and caramelized onion...the fresh basil was cut fresh on top of the melt in your mouth extravaganza to tie the whole thing together.  I was stupid and put ketchup on it...no, don't do it...just maybe, maybe... a little mustard if you do anything, even then...it may ruin what is going on in that beautiful burger.  The fries....yes, perfection....fries that are real, that have the skin, and they are just to die for...and a good kind of greasy because they are the real deal.    This place was recommended by someone we met at Walgreens, she said that she goes here for lunch quite often and said the burgers are to die for.  Very happy we followed her lead and found a new favorite in Surprise to eat at.    The owner was the one who we ordered from and he is super friendly and lived in Brooklyn.  He said his daughter lives in Manhattan and he really brings his personality to Arizona.  He was really attentive and so was the rest of the staff in the establishment.  Very good stream of people coming in for lunch and there was also a live feed of New York on a big screen.  Paramount building with a circle of traffic of the famous yellow taxis going around...  Very special place and I will definitely tell everyone about it, because it is fabulous!"}
{"text":"We decided to try New York flavor on a whim. I went in and did a take out order. The atmosphere was nice. It was kinda cool to see the people on the live cam on the streets of New York!  My fiance ordered a New yorker. It was a 1/2 lb burger with pastrami and swiss.  He did not realize it was a burger but it was delicious. The menu was a little confusing seemed to be all over... but overall understandable. I did the build your own salad. I really enjoyed the option of sizes and toppings. The large option was great it was enough for dinner and lunch the next day! Cant go wrong there!  The prices were pretty decent, the gal behind the counter seemed a little irritated when i did not exactly what i wanted yet.... but there was no one behind me so its not like i was taking up valuable time.   Overall we will definately be back for another round. And there homemade fries are delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Found it on Yelp and was so happy that I did. Their sandwiches are outstanding! The whole place has a very hip vibe to it that you do not find in surprise, and I really, really, hope that they open another location in Palm Valley. Family run restaurant, great food, great service, must try."}
{"text":"Had the mascarpone burger today. Outstanding! Wonderful blend of flavors. Staff was gracious and attentive to our group of ladies."}
{"text":"Pastrami was soooooo good. I can't even fully say how yummy it was. Pastrami was made out of Angus beef, as is there burgers and a few other sandwiches, I believe. It indicates that on the menu. Very quality. I could have eaten two but didn't want to appear like an oinker. Haha.   We also tried the Chicken Parm sandwich. Also good, but I preferred the Pastrami. They also do breakfast which looked and smelled so good--I'll have to come back and try it next weekend.   The decor and ambiance is great, inviting, comfortable and interesting. They have this huge flat screen tv that projects a live feed from 48th and Broadway (I think that's what the owner said it was) so you get a live view of the happenings in New York City. Cool!  As a girl, I value clean and nice bathrooms. These are so nice and clean and CUTE! Chandeliers, nice fixtures, cute decor. It's obvious they put a lot of time and thought into the decor.   Prices were reasonable, about $8-10 for a sandwich and a small side. We got waters cuz we're drink-cheap. :)  Oh, and they do coffee drinks too. We got a iced carmel macciato after our sandwich and just sat and chatted--very relaxing and a nice after lunch sweet.  The only con is that it took a little bit of time to get the food. But after seeing and tasting the quality, I didn't even care. This place obviously uses top quality ingredients and is worth the wait.   I must go back soon!"}
{"text":"Very good food but even better service. They are very nice and so helpful.  Unassuming type of place that is very clean.  Loved it."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. I have the cheesesteak and it was very tasty. The chili cheese fries are awesome too. I will have to work out twice as hard now, but it will be worth it."}
{"text":"I honestly can't say enough about this place, this is amazing food and the staff is great. As a fellow person from the east coast I love the little taste of home I can get over here. Fair prices and good quality food. The burgers and sandwiches are delicious and I'm also a big fan of the breakfast here as well."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews of others who had eaten here I wondered if I had eaten at the same place. Being a lifetime New Yorker, is sound of this place attracted me. Took the plunge and wasn't impressed. Ordered the pastrami sandwich, my guests had vegetarian sandwiches. Reading other comments about the great pastrami, I now realize that these people have never had real NY pastrami !! This pastrami was NOT what I'd call authentic, microwaved dry corned-beef would be a more appropriate description served on institutional bread and ugh yellow mustard??. Fries ok, pickles ok. As far as my guests' meal, hard to ruin a veg sand, on institutional bread.  Chompies and Archies Deli need not worry, I'll burn the gas to enjoy quality. There's No Flavor of NY here."}
{"text":"Walked in for lunch, nice cozy little place.  Wasn't expecting much, but the food was so salty, I had to gulp it down with water after each bite!!  $10 for 3 little meatballs that seem to be made of fat!! was really not worth my trip.  Don't order the meatballs if you come here, but I won't be returning anyday soon!  and I don't recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"What a great place to have in Surprise! I finally stopped by New York Flavor yesterday and was greeted with the friendly staff. I ordered the cheesesteak and fries and it was fresh and delicious! The atmosphere was great and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast! Executive Chef Craig was very friendly and chatted with us about the food. Both his and others he recommended around town. Will be going back soon to try his burgers."}
{"text":"I fed 5 people on Wednesday for $30.  Since kids eat free on Wednesdays (kids menu) it wasn't bad at all.    We tried the basil mascarpone, the NY burger, and kid meals...  Burgers were delicious and the fries were good.  Kids meals are a bit small but you can't beat a free meal on Wednesdays.    I've had breakfast here and it's very good too.  My hubby is from NY and he really likes the attention and care the food gets.   Food is great!!!"}
{"text":"We have been there an embarrassing number of times over the last couple of months and have raved about it every time. I am now working my way down the menu of vegetarian items but my favorites have been the Basil Marscapone Veggie Burger, Vegetarian Lasagna with a gigantic side salad, Pesto Pasta with choose your own topping (eggplant, roasted red pepper and portabella mushrooms). The veggie patties are made there and is a heavenly pillow of goodness between homemade buns. My husband loves the burgers and amazing breakfasts. The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly, and everything can be customized. They have delicious blackberry iced tea and a selection of high quality/gourmet beverages, deli sides, desserts and breads available. I love the decor, and would decorate my house with the gorgeous chandeliers. And that it is counter service, so remember to bring some cash for a tip!"}
{"text":"I love this place for being VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY!!!   Stop the presses and don't cook dinner, just go here.  If you're living really far from here, fill up your gas tank and make the drive!  The Owner and staff are awesome. Food is some of the best I've had and it's good quality.  Yes, I'm a vegetarian and I also bring some of my meat loving friends who also enjoy it. I can't say enough about this restaurant and the only complaint I have is I can't afford to eat there for breakfast, lunch, and dinner."}
{"text":"Things I've tried and loved - Philly Cheesesteak - Reuben  Always ask for extra crispy fries. Otherwise they are kinda limp and undercooked."}
{"text":"They serve breakfast all day, lunch and dinner!  Excellent Reuben on toasted marble rye, with sauerkraut, Swiss cheese and thousand island dressing comes with one side for only $10.99  French fries are hand cut and delicious! Try their Sausage and Peppers with caramelized onions, Italian sausage on a half bread roll for $4.99. Very tasty!  Cole slaw is homemade for $2.49, OMG!  Quality food at a fair price!  Order meal at counter and they will bring it to your table.  Small place but very clean.  Can't wait to return. Awesome meal..."}
{"text":"Came here with the family.  Very nice huge wall pictures of New York City Time Square and flat screens that are live from NY.  What a great scenery for a little restaurant.  Owners definitely placed a lot of detail on the decor.  The food...had the hamburger and fries and enjoyed my meal.  The rest of the family enjoyed theirs as well.  It is great to see this restaurant in Surprise and I would recommend it.  Great alternative from those chain restaurants!  Give them a try!!!"}
{"text":"OMG try the Basil Mascarpone burger, best burger you'll ever have! need to go back ASAP"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time a few nights ago.  The dishes we had were very good.  Your choices are limited but what you get will be tasty.  Nice addition to Surprise."}
{"text":"New to Surprise, lived all over and the best breakfast sandwich i ever had was in NJ, I went to New York Flavor this morning doubting I would ever find somthing that good again, to my Surprise (no pun Intended) New York Flavor made me a 3 eggs, bacon, cheese on a hero. Amazing! I will go back every day."}
{"text":"When you walk in you see just a coffee shop but behind what looks like a barista station they create wonderful food. Friendly service, owner came by to ask if all was well, love that. We had The Central Park breakfast and an order of Banana Nut pancakes. Eggs were great bacon crispy,  and 9 grain whole wheat toast (which you can perchase a loaf) was fantastic. The best thing though were the Banana Nut pancakes. Can't wait to go back for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Imaginative menu with really good food. Friendly attitude and service. Locally owned with an on-site owner. Vegetarian friendly too. Need I say more?  Add it to your list - you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"New York Flavor rocks.  Chef Craig Emmons has created the best breakfast potato's I have ever had, soft, but not soggy, full of flavor and they can add caramelized onions to them too.  Plus the breakfast potatoes have been consistently good every time, so many restaurants are hit or miss from one visit to the next.  Normally I prefer a crispy hash brown so I was shocked at how much I loved his recipe.  Delicious fresh bagels, Nova Lox too and an assortment of high quality breads. They have great burgers and tons of sandwiches, of which I have tried most while never experiencing disappointment.  They use quality ingredients which really show in the finished product.     Bill, the owner, has clearly created a culture of meeting the customer's needs and their patience is legendary.  Sometimes I am eating lunch by 7 am, so I was shocked when I mentioned this to them and they replied \"no problem just give us a few extra minutes\" so at 7 am I am ordering chili fries and a burger ;-)  I have to mention that they pull high quality shots of espresso, with tight crema, and are happy to do it.  Don't get me wrong I hit Starbucks quite a bit due to time or location, but on Starbucks best day they can't compete, shot for shot, with New York Flavor, well Starbucks might be faster by a few seconds but I will trade speed for quality every time.    My only nitpick is that the fries don't do it for me in general, yet I know no matter how they make them someone will be saying this same thing, because fries are one of those individual preference things soft vs crispy, shoestring vs wedge cut kinda thing.  Around Surprise I still have not found a fry that is great.  My favorite fries are the Buffalo Shoestring fries from the Circle Bar Steakhouse in Bagdad, AZ."}
{"text":"Asiago bagel with vegetable cream cheese = best bagel I have ever had.  The owner is working the counter here and loves his job, cares about his customers.  The cream cheese -- which he told me was made right there -- was full of crunchy vegetables, something I've never experienced in a cream cheese!  Live feed from Time Square on the big screen and framed scenes of NYC create a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This little restaurant was seriously phenomenal! I stopped in there on a Saturday afternoon with my Mom & friend  without realizing it was closing time. We were ready to leave but the owners and employees insisted we stay, and when we offered to take our food to go they told us to sit down and stay however long we wanted. They continued to allow patrons in during the duration of our meal even though it was well past closing!  I ordered a NYPD burger (burger with blue cheese) and it was honestly cooked to perfection and the best burger I can remember having in...as long as I can remember. The fries were fresh and perfect-and I tried some of their from scratch carrot cake and it was -to die for.  I highly recommend this place the customer service, cleanliness, and food were all incredible! I'd give 6 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"I convinced the other half to forego the trusty Red Robin for a more unique burger experience, and we ended up trying a basil mascarpone and a De Niro burger.  We were thoroughly satisfied with our choices!  The burgers were cooked to order, and the unique toppings were perfectly complimentary.  As always, the folks there were friendly and cared about our experience.  I recommend the fries extra crispy, but if you're in the mood for less of a side, the pasta salad was small yet tasty."}
{"text":"I rank the Basil topped mascarpone burger right up there with the a burger from Fez as one of the BEST burgers in the Phoenix/Metro area. Oh my, what a great combination of flavors. This is a burger that is worth driving out of your way for. My husband got a sub, although it was just ok, the meat on the sandwhich was of very good quality. Next time he will get the burger! I don't know if I can ever try some other menu items as the Rueben which I want to, but the burger is just THAT good."}
{"text":"After a long time of driving by this place the wife and I decided to give it a try. Came in on a tuesday in between lunch and dinner and decided to get a late lunch. We saw they had a hot dog special and I remembered the old days of hot dogs on the streetcorner in manhattan. My mouth started to water in anticipation of a nice new york dog out here in surprise. What I received was what seemed to be a microwaved tastless hot dog on a stale bun. It was almost inedible. Instead of complaining about the cheap 6 dollar hot dog special i figured at least it came with a drink so what the heck ill just toss it and figure maybe they were running a special and just trying to get rid of some  excess kitchen items. So a sandwich named the Spanish Harlem caught  my eye. It looked good because of the chimiichuri which i absolutely love, and some seasoned steak. Maybe I got the wrong order which I doubt because I was the only one in the place but it seemed like just a plain cold roast beef sandwich with no sauce or flavor or toppings. I tried eating it and then just said screw it and got some fast food somewhere else. After about 25 bucks in with the wife and I we will never be back. Maybe we just ordered a few things that arent great on a bad day, maybe someone in the kitchen was new? I dont know but I feel robbed."}
{"text":"Delicious, clean, friendly. Small but good. Everyone was beyond nice. Chef and Baker produced amazing food and wonderful customer service. The Spanish Harlem is the best melt in your mouth explosion of flavor with the chimichurri sauce on jalapeño cheddar focaccia to create a wonder flavor and texture combination. My hubby had the pasta with marinara and the most amazing meatballs this side of Italy! Don't miss this great west Valley find!"}
{"text":"Brought the family in for a nice breakfast ordered up some pancakes and hash browns everything was hot delicious fresh The Kooks were awesome feel like you are in New York would always try it again"}
{"text":"New York Flavor is right around the corner from my place and I love going here.  They have the best food and the nicest service.  As many of the reviews mention, you must try the basil marscapone burger on your first visit.  It's what they are known for and is a great treat!"}
{"text":"Need a 4.5 rating!  In town visiting family and we stopped for an Early Easter breakfast--because of Yelp reviews.  Great choice!  My Eggs Benedict was a 5!  Spouse's omelette a 4.5.  Fresh hot coffee.  Enjoyed all while seated outside in the cool AM shade.  It was fun talking to the owners about NY, CA and AZ! Super local spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great place to ride and work up your appetite. Cozy spot & excellent atmosphere. Was happening on a Sunday. Alex the young man behind the counter is personable & polite. Awesome breakfast and lunch selection, espresso bar, and bottled beers. Who doesn't like coffee and beer together? ? My girlfriend had the Staten Island Sandwich and fresh cut fries, I made the sacrifice and helped her polish it off. The meal was delicious! Can't wait to come back again and try out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"We've been to NYF five times now.  I'm slowly working my way through the menu but I slipped and have had the rueben twice.  Make sure you ask them to toast the rye!  Their home made fries are terrific as well.  Breakfast is very, very good.  Wife thought the pancakes were a little \"doughy\" but I liked them.     Ruebens are terrific.  The little Italy is great but the chibatta bread is thick and dry.  Wife has had both veggie sandwiches (don't fret, she still loves meat) and has loved them both.  Met friends up there another time and one had the basil/mascarpone burger and loved it.  Can't wait to try that one.  But the best thing?  It's a local restaurant, not a chain.  The owner is very friendly as is the rest of the staff."}
{"text":"An absolute delight!  A very special place!  I am from New York and the food here is better than some of these New York delis and coffee shops!  All the ingredients are top quality and you can taste the difference!  I love all the creative sandwich names and burger names!  It so much fun to peruse  the menu!     I had the Reuben sandwich and it was by far the best tasting Rueben I've ever had!  And that's because the owner uses certified Angus beef!  I also tried the Southwest Caeser salad and the Basil Mascarpone burger and they were out of this world!  The Cheesesteak sandwich did not disappoint ether!   The ambiance is very authentic and the service is impeccable!  Every one is very friendly and wants to make sure you are satisfied with your food!    I love this place and I suggest you visit it!  Trust me you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"What can you say? This place is awesome and a local family owned business. We mostly go for breakfast which is awesome. It's not the typical greasy breakfast that you can get everywhere and makes me feel gross after eating it. It's a notch above. I love the cheesy eggs and their omelettes. Also unlike other places you can order a latte or macchiato with your breakfast in addition to regular coffee.   Their burgers and grinders are great as well. Can't say enough about this place. Try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place happens to be just down the street from me. Boy am I lucky! I have already been here several times. The reuben is out of this world! you can build your own pasta and it is incredible. they make there ricota fresh and goes great in the pasta. prices are very reasonalbe! Also serve breakfast and that is also very good. Highly recomend this place!! They also have a big screen with live feeds in New York which is really cool to look at while you eat."}
{"text":"Searched on Yelp for a place near Spring Training and this place didn't disappoint! Great food and atmosphere. Awesome breakfast. The live feed of Times Square was cool. Owner was super nice and affable--head and shoulders above chain restaurant offerings!"}
{"text":"Exceptional sandwich shop, Family run with great service.  Fresh bread and ingredients made to order. Mascarpone is Must try."}
{"text":"Delicious. Great menu. Much better than average ingredients. Great customer service.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It was good! Nice little neighborhood place. Met a high-school classmate there for breakfast and to catch up on 25-plus years. Food was good and reasonably priced. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars for sure. Yelpers led the way in my decision to come here. We were working in surprise and looking for someplace to go when this place was found.   Clean business, friendly staff, and since we were after the lunch rush plenty of seating. I ordered the bbq burger with a side of fries. I have zero complaints!!  Burger was cooked as requested and had great flavor. The star of the show was the fries as far as I am concerned. I could have eaten twice as many as I got, and I got plenty. They were great.   If I am ever in the area and need some food I am for sure coming back. Beats Buffalo Wild Wings or some other chain that is flooding our neighborhoods."}
{"text":"I was looking for a nice place that wasn't a chain to support in my new neighborhood.  I got the NYPD blue cheese burger.  It was good, nothing. To write home about, but prepared well and reasonably priced. The. Home cut fries were pretty tasty, you can tell they were fresh.  I was hoping they made all of their soups, but they don't.  Over all, I would go back."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast ! I ordered burger and salad ,tastes good ,and the price is OK, Yum.......:)"}
{"text":"I've been here once for lunch and the food was good. I felt it was a little overpriced for what was given. Overall, I would return to give it another shot, but it's been over a year and I haven't felt an urge to return. I believe I had a burger. I might try a reuben or pastrami if I return."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch (mid afternoon) today and ordered their reuben on rye with chips.....very deliscious and very friendly staff there welcomed me..The owner came out and even asked if everything was alright."}
{"text":"We  really enjoyed their sandwiches. I had a pastrami sub and it was delicious. We don't come here often but it is nice when we want to treat ourselves."}
{"text":"I love this joint. As a proud New Yorker this restaurant makes me homesick. Sandwiches are great . Service is exceptional. Trying breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Finally a great non-chain restaurant in surprise!!  Great food - we had an amazing veggie burger and pancakes (love that they serve breakfast all day). Food was delicious,prices are good - support an independent business and give them a try."}
{"text":"Great food, good drinks, awsome service, the best manager and employees ever! There corn beef is great, they got the best rootbeer!"}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service! Our family likes the pasta. Recommend you give them a try!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place! Very friendly staff too!  Less than 15 table seating. Love the NY photos and the TV screen showing Broadway foot traffic.  For the food. Amazing! Caramel macchiato - perfect temperature. Didn't burn my tongue and palate to enjoy the food.  I ordered the Central Park - eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast. Eggs were done to perfection. I'm not a potato eater but I finished the serving. Instead of the toast, I requested the Challah French toast. Nothing fancy but the challah makes a difference versus an old bread.   Definitely a must try! I'm new to the area and I wouldn't mind driving out here for breakfast once in a while."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great menu with unique sandwiches, burgers, and salads. I can't wait to try everything on the menu.  Also went there with my 4 year old and she was being, lets say less than perfect, and spilled her milk all over the floor.  The employee was super sweet and offered her a new milk which we didn't accept but the gesture was really great and also offered to clean up the mess. I am in customer service and I would have been annoyed.  Just being honest.  Also Nick who works there was very helpful and efficient.  Its a little pricey compared to McDonald's or burger king but I am more than happy to pay a little more for fresh, made by scratch food.  This is a great little deli in Surprise and hope it stays around."}
{"text":"Ordered online for pickup. Order was almost 15 minutes past pickup time. Not because they were busy, was only 2 in store customers with food, and 1 pickup.  Once all ready I was given 3 entrees when I purchased 4.  Chicken sandwich was cold chicken chopped up in cubes not easy to eat, nor much grilled flavor.  My husband took two bites of his burger and threw it out bc the meat was very red and extremely soggy bun.  All the fries in our order were very soft and flavorless.  So one star is being gracious! We'll stick to Jim's Burgers!!!  And this just in.... My checking account shows the original $41.77 charge for my order along with a second charge of $35.21!! So apparently instead of refunding me for the entree I paid for and did not receive I was charged twice! Called immediately to have this cleared up, but the owner, Bill, is far too busy and will call me later."}
{"text":"The food was amazing (try the de niro burger) and the service was wonderful. They were very nice and the potato salad was SO good!"}
{"text":"Killer food, good service but a little slow because its made to order, Ruben is unreal! Everything is great"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Surprise! I love the small diner atmosphere and the staff is always friendly and helpful. The Basil mascarpone burger is the best burger I have ever had....flavors are incredible! We have had the pasta and a few of the sandwiches also...everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"Mickeys cheesy eggs are the best!  Just been here for breakfast three or four time.  Food always good, timely, and the people are great!  I need to come back for lunch/dinner.   This is a good place."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast served quickly by the owner a New York transplant who we chatted with. Looking at the menu I think we might be back for lunch as well!"}
{"text":"Sooooo good!  Usually get build your own pasta or salad... Always the way I like it and delicious!  Still need to try their burgers but I'm sure that will be just as good."}
{"text":"Recently got reacquainted with this gem and have fallen in love all over again. The prices are much better than most sandwich places on this side of town and the flavor and service are always amazing. They have vegetarian options that are actually good and the fries are always cooked fresh and perfectly salted. Also the cheesecake is AMAZING. Reminds me of the famous cheesecake from Juniors in New York. Do not pass this place up for the chain sandwich shops."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Surprise!  Love their veggie burger and fresh cut fries!  I have also had a salad, which seems like a great idea because  you get to choose from from a large list of ingredients, however many of the fresh veggie are parboiled for pasta and are unappealing in a cold salad.    The staff are all very friendly and give great service.  You are warmly greeted at the door and the staff remembers that we have been in before, which makes it very homey.  I will try their veggie lasagna next time I'm in."}
{"text":"Really solid choice for a meal in Surprise, AZ.  My family and I have been here 4 times in the last 2 months and it is consistently good!  The menu is a little overwhelming because there are tons of choices but we've tried a bit of everything and this place can cook!"}
{"text":"great food made by the best! chef craig! i love coming here frequently, they have the best NY cheesecake and my favorite burger is the rockefeller."}
{"text":"Walked in starving for a good sandwhich and some soup.  Menu was so unoriginal hubub and I walked out and went to Paradise across the way, which isn't all that great either.  Nothing special here."}
{"text":"Food was very good! My boyfriend had the Ruben a friend had the the Deniro and I had the the basil mascarpone burger. Nothing was bad. You can't go wrong eating here!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Husband and I weren't too sure at first but the food is damn good. They even made a special pastrami cheese fries order for my husband who was feeling glutinous.  Veggies burger was yummy, it had a black bean base. Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"stop in one day because of all the good reviews I first have to say this is bye fare the cleanest and coolest decorated places I have been to in a long time and for a sandwich shop even better and the people working there are also very friendly and took the time to answer may questions I had now for the food  I had the Spanish Harlem chucks of steak and onions and a and cream cheese spread it was OK the bread was soggy the meat was cook to much for me it had good flavor to it but maybe with a different bread that could hold up to all that meat the fries I could not eat way to much salt and they where soggy too but the cheese cake is one of the best that I ever had that save the day it just needs to be bigger will go back to try something else next time in the area"}
{"text":"Really nice that I discovered after seeing a review from another yelper. I forgot the name of the sandwich I got but my friend got the Philly cheesesteak that was omg good and on some of the best bread you could as for. For the meat to be so juicy the bread was excellently picked out and could stand up to the heat and not fall apart. I did not care for the fries or thr coleslaw but the chef to the time to make it right. I want to go back one day and try there chili cheese burger just cause. Nice place different a local spot that people visit frequently for the renowned buger. Worth checking it out."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to eat. Had the Basil Marscapone burger and fries. The best! Definitely deserves 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had!  As I was eating it I thought, \"this might just be the best burger I've ever had\". I actually sat in the restaurant for an additional 15 minutes after finishing my meal to wrap my head around all the different components which added to the flavor of this burger. My compliments to the chef for thinking this one up.  \"The De Niro\" burger is quite simply delicious. I accept that some might not be a fan of the ingredients included in this burger, but for me it combined several things I enjoy and it was stellar. For those wondering it's a beef patty topped with roasted red pepper, onion, provolone cheese, fried prosciutto, pesto, and mayo. Not being a fan of onions I skipped that part. The combination blends marvelously. You get some sweetness from the roasted red peppers which goes well with the herbilicious (Is that a word yet? If not I'm claiming it!) basil in the pesto. The fried prosciutto adds a wonderful crunch while also adding a bit of saltiness. The melted cheese and the mayo add just a hint of creamy texture to create an incredibly well-rounded bite.   Not bad for the first bite of food I've ever eaten in the entire state of Arizona. I laughed when the wait staff suggested I try the basil burger as well. Here I was just checking in at my hotel and I took to Yelp to help me find dinner. A few clicks and a menu browse later and I was on my way to New York Flavor to try the basil burger. I'm quite happy I chose to try The De Niro, but I think I'll be back during this business trip to try the basil burger as well.   Outside the awesome burger I can say the staff was very friendly and pleasant to talk to. Facility was clean. Menu is impressive. I wish I had time to try more items."}
{"text":"Great casual breakfast or lunch place. Build your own pasta is great, the ingredients are fresh, the marinara is simple but delicious. Seinfeld is playing all the time and it has a relaxed atmosphere. The owner is always around and is very nice and friendly. Can't go wrong with the breakfast here either. Good sized portions, but not so much that if goes to waste.  Nice non-chain option, which is rare in Surprise."}
{"text":"I've been by this place countless times and finally decided to try it out.  Wow, why did I wait so long.  First impression was awesome, we were greeted as if we were family and the food was great.  We did go for breakfast and will go back for the burgers that look amazingly good.  Highly recommended, plus they give military and law enforcement a 15% discount if you ask.  Check them out."}
{"text":"So glad they finally opened.  Love the food. Carrot Cake is soooo moist and delicious. The pick your pasta and toppings is great. Great atmosphere and decent prices too. I really like that everything is so fresh and made to order. You might have to wait a little, but for good food, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Won't go here again. Ordered the penne pasta and the beef sandwhich. The pasta's sauce tasted like it came straight out of the can/bottle. No good flavoring and had a sweet sugary taste. Definitely not any type of new York flavor. The beef sandwhich was very fatty and the bread was not anything spectacular. I prefer Ulta Villas off of Meeker and Camino in SunCity. They know how to do it like New York does."}
{"text":"I love the food but wish they had more seating. About the best way to enjoy their food is ordering it either as delivery or to go."}
{"text":"I have only gotten bread from them but if you're looking for really, really good bread this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"How long have you been asking yourself \"when are we ever going to get a good restaurant around here?\"  We've been asking that question for a very long time and finally found the answer. This place was fantastic! We went in today to check it out. We ordered many things from the menu, wanting to try a little bit of everything. I can honestly say every item was great.  The lasagna almost melts in your mouth. The penne vodka was so flavorful and the sausage we added wasn't too overpowering. I had the sandwich with prosciutto and mozzarella. Our daughter had the sliders. Both were very good. We were so stuffed, but decided to dive in to the dessert. The cheesecake was to die for. You can tell it was made very different than most. The carrot cake was full of flavor and very moist. Last but definitely not least was the rice pudding. Very good and tasted very fresh. We liked everything so much, I ended up ordering a whole cake for my mom's birthday.  Overall, we really enjoyed ourselves and plan to be regulars. The owners and the entire staff were very friendly. Please stop in and support these great people. We definitely need to make sure we keep them around."}
{"text":"This is a solid place for lunch.  As usual when Im traveling I'm hungry and looking for local options and I really try to avoid the usual fast food joints.   Their menu is extensive and they have a pretty good breakfast menu if you want that. I ordered the roast beef with their home made horseradish mayo with a side of antipasto salad.  The sandwich was better than I expected and the salad was on point,     After checking in I found a local friend from the Orange County area reviewed this place and based on her review and others I read i'd have to agree they were right."}
{"text":"i definitely like this place.  good simple breakfasts, nice salads and sandwhiches for lunch!"}
{"text":"I just found out they closed.  Loved this place.  Does anyone know why or if they're relocating?"}
{"text":"Great food check out my pics! Pastrami, Spanish Harlem were amazing! The coffee was great."}
{"text":"We are from New York so it's really hard to love pastrami anywhere else, but this comes as close as possible! Great homemade potato salad and the staff is so nice. My son enjoyed the corned beef as well. We try delis  in AZ and we never are happy. Next time we'll try the gourmet burger that the chef created especially for here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for breakfast, it was so good! And very affordable! We love trying out smaller restaurants & supporting small businesses. You will not be let down here. Fast and friendly service too! Can't wait to go back and try lunch & dinner! Everything looked amazing!"}
{"text":"This restaurant had excellent breakfast food!  We had their banana nut pancakes, which were huge and delicious and their cheesy eggs and fried potatoes were so tasty.  Everything was around $6!   Go there!"}
{"text":"The food and service are both outstanding! My husband had a traditional egg cream. The bakery items looked yummy--they are baked on site fresh daily and include a black & white cookie, cheesecake, brownies...I had a burger, it was delicious, and even splurged on fries...they tasted like fries you get at the fair in a cup; lots of salt and crispy goodness :) Authentic NewYork."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and it was delish! Both of us had the Basil Mascarpone Burger and true to other reviews it was great.  Stephanie came out shortly after we ordered and was very friendly. We got their punch card to return and enjoy the inexpensive breakfasts, deli sandwiches and that cheesecake we've been hearing about..."}
{"text":"Ordered the basil mascarpone hamburger with potato salad side. Totally awesome. The mushrooms were huge and very flavorful. The bun and the meat were spectacular . The potato salad has a unique taste to it. Definitely will come back again to try something else on the menu. The staff was great . My only complain was how small of a place it is. Just like any place in Manhattan .. I guess it makes it more authentic ."}
{"text":"Came out here for breakfast.  The whole experience was weak.  We walk in and there is only one other table with guests.  A heavy set guy with a goatee says to have a seat and someone will be right with us.  So we sit down and wait and wait and wait.  Some skinny scruffy looking guy looks at us a few times from behind the counter and finally says do you guys want to order?  We didn't come for the ambiance bud.  So we go up to the counter and put in our order.  He brings it out shortly after.  I had eggs, potatoes, toast, bacon, sausage, and an oj.  My wife had pancakes and bacon and scrambled eggs.  Everything was very plain and basic.  The bacon tasted like the thin frozen kind you get from Costco.  The eggs were cooked very well and the toast was decent.  The potatoes tasted old and rubbery.  There was no ice in the machine and the oj wasn't cold.    All and all this place was a let down and the two guys running the breakfast shift probably should not be in the service business.  They need to hire a hostess that enjoys customers and then step up their ingredients and delivery.    My wife decided it wasn't worth eating and didn't finish her meal.  She said she'd never come back.  I may be back to try a burger as I've heard they are good but I would not recommend anyone driving out to Surprise for this place."}
{"text":"New York Flavor on Bell Ave in Surprise. A bit over priced for the area.  Food was wonderful...was surprised that sauerkraut  was extra cost on a Ruben Sandwich.  Breakfast was better than Lunch or Dinner. Will return, but due to cost not going to be a lets go to place."}
{"text":"Great place to get a New York style food. I love the big tv on the wall showing NYC live."}
{"text":"Very quaint deli. Friendly owner and employees. We've stopped for breakfast and it's tasty, basic and reasonable. We really come for the amazing and well priced sandwiches. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"HUGE RIPOFF. Quality of food is easily a 4.  I do not mind paying a bit more for quality but this felt like a blatant ripoff.  We were only people in the joint on a Saturday afternnon.  Cook/cashier was friendly and helpful.  Ordered corned beef sandwich with double meat for $4 more.  Cannot even fathom how little meat would have been on the sandwich if we didn't order double meat.   Also ordered a brisket sandwich.   Our thoughts were that they only gave us half of the sandwich.   Here you get a little and it costs alot.  Fries an pasta salad were solid.  Mile high at chompies  for $16 is much better deal.  Would like to go back but cost to quantity ratio will probably keep me away."}
{"text":"New York fraud is a better name for this place. I think the owner or chef just decided to name all their sandwiches after New York people or places, but that is about as far as the NY connection goes. They don't cook their bagels there, instead getting them delivered from the worst bagel shop in Scottsdale (NY Bagels). They also don't cook the pastrami or corned beef in house as they simply order the standard hunk of meat and use the slicer for a less than NY kind of experience. It's funny cause the whole place is decorated in NY murals, etc, but in this case, the bark is more dangerous than the bite."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time a few days ago and I thought it was pretty good. I had a turkey on marble rye, with roasted red peppers and all the fixings. Overall it was pretty good. The owners are very nice also. The decor is clean and has a NY Theme to it. I can't wait to try the corned beef on rye.. They do have a lot of vegetarian dishes/sandwiches also.."}
{"text":"I was discouraged by the sign by the front door but I went in anyway, not expecting too much. However, I had the phili cheesesteak with provolone and a side of pasta salad, and have to say that this place gets it!  (Food wise). Quite possibly the best phili cheesesteak I've ever had. And normally I wouldn't even bother with commenting on a side, but this pasta salad is worth mentioning. Delicious!  The place was clean and the server was super nice. We had a brief conversation and all was good.   One last note, the menu they have says, \"coca-cola\" products, but what they have is actually Pepsi products."}
{"text":"the bagel and the schmear were fine.  however, i can only describe the service as zombie-like.  everyone else seemed to be enjoying their full breakfasts, so i'm sure i will be back if i ever have the occasion to trek out to surprise again."}
{"text":"This place is a gem!!! My boyfriend and I have been here twice and we just can't get enough. The owner is so nice and wonderful and remembered us! The food is tasty as well. Previously, my boyfriend got the 6 pancake stack, but  couldn't finish it all so he had to take it home. Today he got the 3 stack and side of potatoes and everything was just as delicious the first time around. I had the Central Park again and still loved it. Once I can eat bread again I'm going to have the banana nut pancakes. I heard a kid going crazy for them, so they must be good!"}
{"text":"Had the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had!  Gotta check it out.  Staff is very friendly!  Will be back when in the area."}
{"text":"The food was good but the prices are too high.  There are better places for less money.  I had the half of eggplant sandwich.  My friend had the Arthur or something like that.  I had a half of sandwich no drink.  It comes with fries.  $9. My friend has a sandwich drink and bag of chips.  Or bill was nearly $23. Wow"}
{"text":"The first time we went we thought it was \"OK\" The second time we thought hmmm not as good as the first time. We went today for the third time. It dropped again. INCONSISTENT food. Service has gone to horrendous. No one seemed to know what to do or what anyone else was doing.The owner (bald guy) has every sign that the business is wearing him out. Nice guy just whipped by the restaurant. Best of luck to a non chain / independent operator you just need to get it together. See it from your guest view point."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting and upon walking in I noticed how clean everything was. The restaurant is decked out in New York decor and has a live feed of Times Square. We placed our order at the counter both ordering a burger and fries. Everything was cooked to order and was so hot and fresh when it arrived.  My fries were still hot even after I finished my burger. This was a first for me!  I would recommend New York Flavor to anyone who likes hot fresh food or has a hankering for New York styled food. We will be back the next time we visit Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!! The following was consumed by our party of 9.....the Downtown 2 egg & pancake breakfast, the Little Italy, Hot Pastrami, Reuben, Deniro burger,  cheesesteak, Cheesy egg breakfast (too runny but the owner made it right) chocolate chip pancakes, and a Coney dog. Large portions.Just delicious and fresh! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Just ate a what seemed to be giant cheesteak sandwich. It was delicious. Also added an order of fries which were also superb. Defiantly will be going back. Only con is the menu is huge, may take some time to try a few of the item out or maybe I'll just stick with the cheesesteak for now."}
{"text":"Today my wife and I stopped in and I had the classic breakfast sandwich with ham and my wife had the gramercy park breakfast sandwich. The Keiser rolls were probably the freshest bread I've had and the eggs were cooked to absolute perfection so fluffy and airy they were melt in your awesome. The meal was a definite gastronomical delight. Any one looking to break away from the chains or not eat your breakfast from a wrapper definitely give this place a shot you won't be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"I will give this place a solid 4 stars. Been here twice, the first time was for a quick brunch on Saturday. They have two small tables in the front patio which is dog friendly so ++++ It's a small place but looks like  staying busy with local people (I am assuming locals...) of all ages. A good selection of food and Breakfast menu is available all day. Breakfast is a five stars. Really really good pancakes :-) You will have to wait for a while for your food since they cook everything from scratch. My hubby tried classic burger which was just okay but maybe it was their off day? We came back on Sunday for breakfast around 11 am. I would recommend you call first to make sure there is no wait."}
{"text":"Tried this place cause it was highly rated on yelp. It did not disappoint. I had the Basil Marscapone burger. My son had the special Deniro Burger. Mine was tasty but not a strong taste. I thought it could use a little more flavor. The Deniro burger was absolutely delicious. Very flavorful. The fries were great. I also tried the potato salad and that was meh. But overall I want to go back and try more items. I will definitely try the Deniro again."}
{"text":"I was so super excited to try this place.  We live in West Buckeye so we came out this way specifically for this restaurant.  I had the Arthur Avenue and my husband had the Alfredo and bow tie pasta.  The Arthur Avenue is only bread, mozzarella, basil, tomato and balsamic vinegar. Very simple sandwich. There wasn't much balsamic vinegar on it to really taste it.  I had a side of potato salad.  Nothing special. My husband had the Alfredo and besides being extremely greasey, he said it was only \"alright\".   Unfortunately since we ordered simple things and weren't impressed I don't think we will be going back."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to Surprise.  A new, independent restaurant where they actually care about their food and their customers.  This is a wonderful treat, very diverse menu and everything is extremely tasty.  The interior of the restaurant is tastefully decorated with pictures from New York (pictures were taken by the owner) and several large TVs showing news/sports, a live camera feed from New York and episodes of Sienfeld.  The owner (who is from NY) is always greeting customers and getting feedback on the food.  I've given a few, very minor, suggestions and they have always been receptive and have implemented.    Highly recommended to anyone.  It took a couple of weeks to find their groove, but they are now fully up and running.  We have enjoyed their food several times.  There is usually a few patrons from New York and they give their seal of approval.  Keep in mind that while this is a \"look up\" restaurant, they make all of the food fresh so it takes a little longer, but it is always worth the wait.  Don't forget to get a Black & White Cookie!"}
{"text":"Love this place, but when the snowbirds are in town the service seems to go down hill... Great food, super reasonable prices and great atmosphere... When the snowbirds are gone  : )  Only down fall are the annoying little individual butter containers! GET RID IF THOSE AND YOU WOULD HAVE 5 STARS!!"}
{"text":"I am in town visiting my husband and was driving around looking for somewhere good to eat that we don't have back in Dallas. I had originally planned on eating at another restaurant, but it didn't have very good reviews so I found New York Flavor on Yelp and everyone had nothing but good to say about this place. And they were correct! The food was delicious (I got the NY BBQ Burger) and the owner was a friendly and genuinely nice as could be! I will be coming back anytime I am in Surprise!"}
{"text":"Very good food but the side portions are too small, especially the cole slaw."}
{"text":"Had hot pastrami, fries and ice tea, hubby had corned beef, fries, and ice tea! It was $26.00, the sandwich was dry, we both ate half and threw rest away! I felt like I had been robbed, so many other places would have been better,  even Archie's deli loads you up with meat!  I won't ever go back learned my lesson new places are always a risk!!!!!!  The French fries were soggy like they warmed them up! The bread was just that bread not toasted or anything I could have made a better sandwich at home with maybe mayo since I can't eat mustard but was offered nothing!!! Bread and a little meat , no excitement there!"}
{"text":"We only recently discovered this place and I'm so sad I've been missing out this whole time. Love the owner. He is fantastic. Takes times to welcome every customer and has real pride in his food. The cheesesteak is my favorite. My only complaint is their hours. Only open til 3. Numerous times I've wanted them for dinner, but they aren't open. I understand why, but their food is so good, I wish they were open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Had the nautilus sub, was HUGE and delicious. And a veggie burger, that was SO yummy and chucked full veggies. Great potato salad & the fries are fresh cut!! GO! Such an original."}
{"text":"We give it a 3 because the service was great, the place is clean, and they clearly have something goin for them with all the awards they've won, BUT...... Breakfast is NOT their strong meal. Don't recommend it for breakfast at all."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, top notch restaurant. Everybody is friendly. I love the burgers, handcuffs fries, the Nautilus and the Alfredo Pasta."}
{"text":"I consider myself extremely lucky to work within walking distance to New York Flavor. This is one of the most awesome places that I've ever been to. While I can't get myself to get anything other than the Little Italy sandwich, my husband has also been there with me and raves about their Coney dogs. The people that work there are super friendly, always fast, and make your orders as you order them. It's a must try for anyone!"}
{"text":"Great food!! Had the Staten Island sammie on fresh baguette with perfectly prepared skin on fries and they were cool enough to accommodate my sandwich modifications (add arugula and pesto.. Which btw made the sandwich amaze) without the usual sigh of disdain... The management and staff were very attentive and welcoming which in my mind totally sets them apart from other shops... This place is a total diamond among the boring chain eateries of surprise :)"}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times and food was good. The Staten island sandwich is especially yummy. My fiance prefers the BBQ burger. Also, the pasta salad is AMAZING! We weren't a huge fan of the fries, but we will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"By far one of our favorite local places to go. From friendly people to fantastic food, this place rocks!  There are so many creative menu choices and I'm dedicated to working my way through them all. The coffee is a special blend they had roasted just for them. The cheese cake is also very good and features a unique angel food cake crust.   This is a great local find."}
{"text":"I wish I lived a little closer!  We were in the area for a Craigslist deal and decided to get some food.  We ordered the Philly steak sandwich to share and some fries.  The sandwich was gigantic so its good that we did!  Its more like a french dip sandwich but the meat is good and flavorful.  Had some peppers and onions that weren't overcooked and added some crunch.  The bread was flaky and soft.  Fries were also cooked perfectly with just the right amount of salt.  Its really a neat spot with a live feed of Time Square and old Jerry Seinfeld episodes.  They also serve beer and have all kinds of beverages and desserts.  Would definitely come more often if it was in my hood!"}
{"text":"Where do you go in Suprise, AZ if you need to please both  Brooklyn New York  and Dallas, TX pallette for Breakfast?  Go to New York  Flavor!    We got two classics, and the Bacon was amazing and crispy, the kiaser rolls were as close as you can get.  The coffee is just right, the Blackberry tea refreshing and the  Black and white cookie reminded my husband of home.  Give it try, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Can't believe it's been over a year since I last updated my review about NYF. For as long as I've been coming here, it's been a five star experience. The staff; Craig, Stephanie, Ginger, Kenny, Jarid and Alex are all exceptional. The owner, Bill, is always helpful and nice. The kids doing prep work in the back are friendly and polite. You will never see a staff member lose their cool; even during the busiest of times.   You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The specials are unique, innovative and delicious. Lynn's desserts are delicious. The classics are always done to perfection. The hand-cut french fries are the best in town.  Whether you are looking for something lite like the Southwest Caesar or you're going full-scale with a DeNiro Burger and everything in between--there is something for everyone here. They even have gluten free bread!   Baseball season is coming up and the restaurant does get busy so keep in mind that everything is made fresh to order. Fresh to order means that you might have to wait a tad longer than those assembly line fast food crappy places. It's so worth it though. Believe me.   Just can't say enough about how much I love NYF and how glad I am that it's a staple in my family's life. We are able to enjoy so many family meals here together."}
{"text":"In Surprise for a week with our kids to visit my wife's grandfather. Found this place on Yelp and am I glad I did! I ordered the Basil mascarpone burger (medium rare) based off the reviews here..... and you guys didn't disappoint - it was amazing! Caramelized onions, roasted portabellos, mascarpone cheese, and that basil chiffonade... those flavors work so well together! I got (kids size) made to order pastas for the kids which was great cause I could customize it based off their different tastes. My wife got the chicken salad sandwich which I tasted and it was good too. The staff here was super friendly and attentive as well... one of them gave our two kids a brownie each and they were delighted. I had to try the cheesecake they make there and, on par with everything else, it was SO GOOD. I will definitely be coming back here again during our week stay here - which with our limited time here - that speaks volumes about this place. Couldn't be happier with our random choice for dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing and delicious food! Plus the customer service is top notch.  I will be returning again and again."}
{"text":"Recently disappointed in the cleanliness of this restaurant. Their non-paper menu was very sticky and smudged with fingerprints. The cook also swept the floor and then went back to cooking with no hand washing. He also had a bad habit of wiping his nose on his forearm while cooking. The food is not bad, however, the bread used is precut and very thin. Small portion of bread with an adequate amt of meat but sandwich would fall apart when picked up. Had to eat sandwich with a fork due to flimsiness of bread.cost of. Sandwich $2 above what I would expect to pay for the quality. I was there on 4-12-16."}
{"text":"The only downside to this place is the little bit.of a wait... BUT, its due to the fresh ingredients and fresh food. The cooks bring u your food. Hands down the best hot corned beef sandwhich in arizona. Have been a few times now and have not been dissapointed yet!"}
{"text":"I had the Basil Marscapone Burger.. Yummy!!!  It was very tasty and had the perfect amount of gooey goodness.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"I love New York City!  Having spent two summers, when I was 15 and 16 years old, living in and touring Manhattan and the surrounding Burroughs; I got to explore and enjoy this fascinating city. The rest of my family were on their European tour, and dropped me off to stay with one of my sisters who worked downtown.   I was pretty much left to my own devices for several weeks. And I got to experience what big city living was like.  It was nearly a daily routine for me to have breakfast at one of the corner diners as I watched all those people hurry about their daily lives.   That was quite some time ago, but the memories of that city still remain with me after all these years.  As my wife and I were on our way towards Prescott, this one Saturday morning, we opted to stop by this diner in Surprise because it was just right off of the 303 on Bell Road. Their menu looked appetizing and intriguing enough that it piqued our interest. And it definitely piqued my curiosity as to how close they could get to duplicating New York's unique breakfast flavors.  I must say, that except for the traffic, the noise, the humidity, and the big city odors wafting through New York City's air, this establishment's food did an admirable job of bringing their home town's flavor to Surprise, Arizona.  I had a custom omelette with Spinach and Ham, and accompanied it with Maple Bacon and a 3 stack of Pancakes. My wife had the French Toast and Maple Bacon as well.  These really hit the spot!   And having the live Earthcam of the Time Square area was a nice touch to bring some type of big city ambiance to what is basically a suburban family and retirement community.  They had many more offerings in their menu for both Lunch and Dinner, and we really are looking forward to returning and sampling their other offerings; as we were quite impressed with their cookery!"}
{"text":"Great food! Takes a little bit to get it but it comes out hot and fresh. Owners are very friendly to the customers. Real potato French fries which are excellent!!!"}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time there, the first 2 times was about average. Today I ordered a burger med well and it, came out med-med rare and it looked as it had been sitting under a heat lamp waiting for other food. The fry's were cold and way over cooked. My wife's fry's were hot but under cooked. Don't expect customer service once you get passed the front counter.  The 4.75 star rating that is has should be 2.75 for a burger joint/ sandwich shop. Not my first choice, by far..... The owner is really nice, but it's a little place and way over rated to say the least.......This place, and as for most Restaurant Reviews on yelp are rated way to high......As for NY Flavor.... there wasn't much there.........They made me another burger, I took it to go and got home and it was cooked the same way.. Med- Med Rare..... I like my burgers Med Well............not that hard to do......."}
{"text":"Wife and I are FROM New York - this was a fine representation of a REAL New York Deli style restaurant.  We were suspicious when NYF started cutting their \"Open\" hours.  That is usually the first sign.  Went by a couple of times with no open sign displayed.  I expected them to have MORE business stimulated by the demise of \"Archies\" - but No... Oh well. I hope we didn't cause this...."}
{"text":"Great find! Had the best french toast and coffee there! Everything is amazing from breakfast to dinner. Perfect place to grab a bite for takeout or eat-in (love the decor)!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are regulars here. One off business with good authentic food. Friendly staff and a good size menu are fantastic. My favorites are the DeNiro burger, cooked to order, I like rare. Also the Reuben is excellent."}
{"text":"I went there one morning with a few parents from my child's school.  I was pleasantly surprised that they had breakfast items.  It was fast, pretty delicious but a bit greasy.  I found the staff friendly & the location clean.  I could easily see this place become a laidback place to hang out with a few friends for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great little deli, the chef has a lot of innovative vegetarian offerings in addition to great traditional meat sandwiches.  Great burgers but try The Garden sandwich!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Have the Pastrami !! Real New Yorkers .. not BS"}
{"text":"A New York deli in Surprise, AZ?  What?!  Ok, so when visiting family in AZ recently, I had passed by this strip mall with this deli several times.  The menu and pictures of food looked awesome online, so I thought I would order a couple of sandwiches to go for lunch.     I checked out the menu online. http://newyorkflavor.com/ It was hard to choose between the many tasty-sounding sandwiches, burgers, breakfast items, salads, pastas, and hot dogs.  We finally decided on two sandwiches.   Sandwiches come with choice of side to include house-cut french fries,  potato chips or choice of side salad like potato salad, coleslaw, pasta salad.  We ordered the Spanish Harlem and Nautilus Submarine.   The Spanish Harlem was full of flavor with marinated, grilled steak with chimichurri, red onions and tomatoes.  It was an an awesome jalapeno-cheddar focaccia which just added to the tastiness. Ordered with with side of pasta salad which was very good.  The Nautilus Submarine was 11 inches packed full of goodness.  Chock full of stuff to include Genoa salami, capicola, prosciutto, provolone, onion, pepperocini, lettuce, oil and vinegar on a hero.   We got an order of fries with this one which were yummy.   The owner of New York Flavor (who I believe greeted me) takes great pride in his restaurant and food.  I know this as I am new to this area and got my shopping centers in Surprise mixed up when it came to me picking up the food.  When I arrived late to pick up my food, he kinda scolded me for being late as he said he really wanted my food to be fresh when I picked it up and to call in the future if I knew I was going to be late.  Oops, sorry :(  It just shows how much he wanted everything to be right with my order, which I completely understand.  My bad.    The only kind of downside to this place is the small size of the place.  There is basically some side seating in the deli, but it is kind of limited, and there are a few tables outside.  I look forward to checking out the award-winning burgers here and more of the extensive menu on my future visits to AZ."}
{"text":"Do NOT go here. I don't understand how this place has so many stars. My husband, 9 month old daughter and I came here based on the good reviews and were thoroughly disappointed. The staff were pushy and rude and the food was gross. We ordered the deniro burger, a plain cheeseburger and a small pancake for our daughter. When the food came out the cheeseburger had everything on it. Normally we would just pick off veggies no big deal but it was slathered in mayo. My husband took it back up to the counter and was treated horribly. He was asked if he wanted it \"made all over again\". He said he would because we couldn't really eat around it. The employee took it back to the cook and they were both loud about what was wrong and embarrassed us even though they were the ones that made it incorrectly. Meanwhile, we started feeding our daughter her pancake and it was completely raw in the middle. Since we knew it would just cause more problems and she wouldn't eat the whole thing anyway we didn't say anything and just had her eat around the raw part. The Deniro burger had totally burned prosciutto and was so salty we couldn't finish it. The cheeseburger finally came back by the time we were just ready to leave. We ate half of it and left. Upon leaving the male employee asked how everything was and my husband said it was \"okay\". He said \"just okay\"? Then asked how the Deniro burger was and we told him it was salty and he replied that it was just the prosciutto. Not one person apologized for our wait or their mistake. You have pay upfront so nothing was offered to be comped or anything. I have never experienced something like this and I honestly couldn't believe it. That was $30 we just wasted. Needless to say we will NEVER be back to this place. I hope you don't waste your time/money."}
{"text":"Very tasty, great variety of sandwiches and make-your-own combos.  The eggplant parm sandwich was a little skimpy on the filling, but great flavor.  Something a little more unique and special than your typical chain sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Great food I've been there a couple of times and ordered something different. Alway great protons."}
{"text":"Great good and friendly people. We got the chicken Parm and meatball sub and they were amazing!! Nice place."}
{"text":"This place is okay, we ordered take out.. I ordered their famous basil mascarpone burger and my husband ordered their corned beef sandwich.. My burger honestly didn't have any taste to it.. And his sandwich was just okay and the sides are very small, you basically get like 10 French fries. Not worth the $22 bucks that we spent."}
{"text":"My husband had been bugging me for a while to try New York Flavor.  I finally gave in and let him take me there for lunch.  It's a small place in a strip mall in Surprise.    You order your food at the counter then seat yourself.  Your food will be brought out to you when it is ready.  I ordered the Basil Mascarpone burger.  It was a good burger, but I think that the patty lacked a little seasoning.  I had my burger with a side of pasta salad.   I would be interested in going again and trying something different."}
{"text":"Wife and I have been waiting for this place to open for a while! Well, On my way to class on Monday night. I noticed they were finally open!!!!! So when I picked my wife up at work on Tuesday, we stopped off here for dinner. Didn't really know what to expect? There is a wide selection from burgers, dogs, deli sandwich to pasta! You can make them any way you want. Place has a New York decor, with their TVs showing New York shows! One of the big screen is hooked up to time square LIVE!! Going back to the food! Wife ordered a cheese burger w/potato salad, I ordered a sausage and peppers sandwich w/fries. I also added a coney dog for us to share. We both enjoy hot dogs! Going back to my plate! The sausage was taste full, but I expected of a heartier sausage? Have more of a snap to it! The coney dog was great, chili was very good, and I have never had it with mustard? Why! I don't know? But it was really good. Wife's hamburger was OK, We have had better! Fries were good, but I like the fries that have their skin still on! Wife hates them!! We also decided to have a slice of chocolate cake with ice cream. I was not impress with the cake, Wife loved their chocolate ice cream, even though I ordered Vanilla! Their service needs work, I know this place is new and some of their help are young and new. So be patient and give them time, I will go back again in a few months to see if it has gotten better?"}
{"text":"Finally in again. Had the DeNiro. This is a sandwich you gotta try! Prosciutto, provolone, Pasco, red peppers on top of a great beef patty. Very very delicious."}
{"text":"We decided to try this deli today.  It was 10:00AM and we were the only customers.  The :\"live\" Times Square feed was not up.  The guy behind the counter was helpful but not friendly. When I think of a DELI, I think of corned beef steaming, the smell of fresh bagels, the choices of Cream Cheese especially for a \"NY Deli\".  This place had bagels in the bag behind the counter along with delivered sliced breads. We paid first and then the food was delivered to the table. The coffee was in a thermos pot which you pumped to get.  There was no coffee brewing behind the counter.   Glad I tried it but we will not be returning again this \"season\"."}
{"text":"Found this on good Ol' Yelp while passing thru town. They have lots to offer as we had a hard time deciding. We both got sandwiches, a Italian and Pastrami. Both were big and very tasty. The soft fresh bread really makes a sandwich ! Very clean and super friendly service made it all the better. I would stop here again if passing thru !"}
{"text":"Just tried this place after seeing it listed on Yelp. Being a Jersey native myself I miss the North East Food, and some of the \"NY\" named restaurants fall flat on their face when it comes to living up to their name. This place surprised me in a good way. I had the Reuben to see how close they are to the real deal, and it was really good. I was going to take a picture but my phone was not agreeing with me. The menu has a lot of interesting sandwiches that I plan to go back and sample. I asked if they are doing Zepoli's and the owner said 'Not yet' which leave me optimistic. When all is said and done, I will be going back."}
{"text":"This little deli is in a nice strip mall alongside bell alongside a take out pizza place. There is a large flat screen television the minute you walk in that shows actual live footage of Times Square in New York.  The other television features old episodes of Seinfeld, and the third one shows sports. Yes, they have all bases covered for ambiance!  They have a large variety of deli sandwiches. Their Reubens are one of the tastiest around in my opinion. They also have lunch specials too where you can get a half sandwich and soup or salad like most lunch places. The chicken parm sandwhich is also very good to try! I Even though I'm not sure if it's on the menu, I always order a tuna melt and they're always very friendly and accommodating about it.   What people don't know is that they serve breakfast here too! In fact, they serve breakfast all day long! My coworker and friend love it so much, that they always order the pancakes. Fair warning though - if you order the pancakes, there's so much of them that you'd better come hungry!"}
{"text":"Food's great, but it's the slowest service I've ever experienced. I ordered a turkey sandwich and a cheesesteak. One of which didn't even need a grill. From the time we stepped in the door to when we got our food it took 40 minutes.  If you're looking for a quick deli sandwich, this is not the place for you. If you're willing to wait, then go right ahead. Normally I would take just one star off for service, but this was outrageous for a turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"They deleted my previous review... About their establishment... Food good but they have a policy against law-abiding citizens who carry firearms and are licensed to carry. This is Arizona not the Communist state of New York.  Glad your business is closed for being against freedom and the people of this state and the laws we have here."}
{"text":"You know how sometimes you just crave a good Reuben Sandwich.  Well, it's been hard to find one on the West side until we had lunch at New York Flavor.  Their Reuben is stacked high with juicy corned beef and tangy sauerkraut and just enough dressing to give the sandwich a kick.  The marble rye was soft and fresh and the sandwich was tasty & delicious to the last bite.  This place is New York.  Everything is made fresh and the owner, Bill Olear prides himself on having authentic NY recipes for everything from their hot dogs, pasta and sandwiches and even their coffee and desserts.  Coney Island treats, Salads, 1/3 lb burgers, breakfast served all day.....How can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Great food, and great service. Try these cheesecake too its delicious.  I'd recommend New York Flavor to anyone."}
{"text":"The food, oh the food! A friend and I saw the reviews for this joint and had to give a try on a Sunday afternoon. The place was very busy, but had plenty of seating, and fairly quick service. I had the Spanish Harlem, the steak was tender and had no gristle the sauce was spicy with a ton of flavor. The focaccia was fresh and crusty just perfect for me. My friend had the basil mascarpone burger which is their award winning burger. He ordered his rare and said it was cooked perfectly to his liking. We both decided it was one of the best lunches we had had in a very long time. New York Flavor is on our short list to return to soon."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and I am so glad I found this place. I had the Central Park breakfast and my husband had the Reuben sandwich, we also had the cheesecake. The service was excellent and all the staff was friendly. The food was excellent and prepared perfectly. All of the ingredients were quality ingredients, I had the best sourdough toast ever. It reminded me of the bread my grandma use to make and cut thick. The sandwich had plenty of meat on it. The executive Chef came out and talked to us several times and you could tell they value their customers and want to make sure everything is great! All of the food is made to order so of course it isn't fast food. I got a piece of cheesecake to take home for later but I wanted to taste it first and it was so good we ended up eating the whole piece before we left. I highly recommend you try this place!"}
{"text":"There were things I LOVED and things that were a bit... meh... I loved the fact that they had a view of  new york on the TV that was live. It is an awesome idea but was super distracting when it would suddenly stop and need to be refreshed. I know thats not at any fault of the owner but it is something that if it was super busy would drive me nuts and make me want to ask for the mouse to refresh it myself.  The food was fantastic. The kitchen inside is very small and one thing that I noticed is the microwave was used a lot. If I wanted to reheat stuff I can do that at my own house.  However flavor wise it wasn't crazy noticeable.  They also have a nice selection of bottled sodas that tasted great. Price wise idk if it was all worth it but I know if I am in Surprise it would be a place I would consider visiting again. Especially since the owner was super sweet and welcoming."}
{"text":"After we've live in surprise for over a year, we tried New York Flavor and have found our \"regular\" place. Service was exceptional! The food is fresh and flavorful. We had breakfast here and came back to try lunch the next day. We had a submarine sandwich- can you say DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  It's a great addition to Surprise!! Their breakfast is wonderful, I was stuffed, & it was reasonably priced.  Came back a week later for dinner, same.  Everyone loved their food. It's decorated so cute & they have a live feed of New York which is actually memorizing to watch.  Visit this place! Don't let such a wonderful establishment die out in Surprise!"}
{"text":"The West side of the greater Phoenix area is in desperate need of more independent businesses - chains, chains + more chains are all I see when it comes to restaurants.  Enter: New York Flavor.  Huge, unique and delicious menu items, great prices, family owned + super friendly people. What more do you need?  Get on it."}
{"text":"Awesome little place with real New York flavor! We stopped here on a whim and were surprised to find this little place off the beaten path in Surprise. Of course at a New York deli I had to order a ruben and it definitely passed the test. Not too much dressing, tons of meat, and fries to boot. Everyone with us enjoyed their meals as well. The place was crowded and small but there was also a table outside, or options to get food to go. Service was friendly. Overall, a great place."}
{"text":"Bill's New York Flavor is a great little diner - great for breakfast or lunch.  Really good burgers - done the way you want them.  Wonderful alternative to the corporate breakfast/lunch places that are all over Surprise."}
{"text":"Dug on this place. Almost gave it a pass w the signage outside. Ordered a salad which is a 'construct your own' menu. Loved it. Spinach, bacon, cheese, nuts, avocado and then some. Perfect and fresh. Kid ordered the cheese burger and i finished it. Very good.  Guys were really friendly and it was quite fast service which worked since we were driving through. If ever am in the greater Surprise area and in need of eats, would give it another go."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple time and I've had the basil mascarpone burger and it's amazing. Love it. And the fries are great. My mom had chick parm and lived it"}
{"text":"The chef/cook was SO rude to the girl who took my order. She bagged food for a customer and gave it to him when the cook (I think he was the owner) yelled \"hey! Hey! Did I say order up?!\"... I was very embarrassed for the girl and could not believe that he thought that that was ok. Very unprofessional even my 10 year old made a comment. That's unacceptable."}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever eaten.  Their NYPD burger is amazing and always cooked to perfection.  Fresh ingredients.  Its obvious that the cooks/chefs are trained.  Fresh cut french fries are seasoned.  Their breakfast is great as well.  One of the only places that cook over medium eggs perfectly every time.   I like that they are trying to bring the east coast atmosphere to Surprise.  They have a great meat and cheese selection that can be added to most dishes.  I also live their frequent diner program.  I have earned many free meals just by going back to eat at a place I love.  Great idea."}
{"text":"I am excited to go back and try everything else. The hubby had a burger and I had a turkey, brie, pear sandwich (34th st). I liked my sandwich, and I LOVED his burger! The menu is awesome! I am gonna go back and make my own burger with pizza toppings! :) the pasta salad is yummy too. Very very nice service!"}
{"text":"If you want a great NY flavoured sandwich! This is your spot! We tried the cheese steak and little Italy sandwiches with a pasta side and French fries....... In one word.....DELICIOUS!!!! The bread was nice and soft the meat on the cheese steak hot and cheesy and the flavoring of the meats in the little Italy, wow! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is small and cozy but definitely has a soothing ambience. I went in only for coffee because I had read the reviews on Yelp that the coffee was amazing so it made me curious. Not only was the coffee the best I've ever had but I loved the fact that they had a variety of sugar free selections!! So I a sugar free caramel macchiato with soy milk because I knew that I wanted dessert to go with it. Carrot cake was to die for!!! Coffee and dessert at New York Flavor at a very reasonable price made it all worth it!!! This is definitely going to be my new coffee place!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. I ordered the central park, a simple bacon and eggs breakfast. What I got was something that was prepared with pride and attention to detail. Seasoned breakfast potatoes, crispy, bacon, sourdough toast that was not from the local grocer, perfectly cooked eggs and coffee that was not brown water but not so strong that I'll be up for days. The price was really fair."}
{"text":"Was out this way for a class and tried this place for lunch, amazing food and wonderful customer service! Everything was made in house and you could tell!"}
{"text":"We are from N. Scottsdale and enjoy good food.  I have to say I was very pleased at the quality of food offered at the New York Flavor in Surprise.....  I had the Spanish Harlem and it was delicious.. Others in my party ordered the Spaghetti.  The spaghetti and  homemade marinara sauce was suberb!  I hope they will consider opening one in Scottsdale....we would definitely become a regilar..they also offer breakfast which looked equally amazing...."}
{"text":"After being to almost every decent restaurant in Surprise, the beau and I wanted to try something different. So it was a nice SURPRISE (haha get it?!) that Yelp led me to this neighborhood gem.  Being a native New Yorker, it was nice walking into this deli and seeing Times Square on the wall and photos of the Flatiron building. It reminded me of home. We ordered the BBQ burger and a Philly Cheesesteak. The BBQ sauce on the burger was amazing and the fries were crisp. The potato salad was OK and the Philly cheesesteak was a bit salty.  Other than that, New York Flavor has become one of my favorite restaurants in Surprise. I plan on coming back and trying the Basil Mascarpone burger next!"}
{"text":"Just found out this place was not a pizza place which was my misconception based on the title. Actually have sandwiches, burgers, pasta, salads, breakfast and open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I had a burger, my husband a sandwich-both were delicious! Definitely our new favorite."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new place for lunch near work. Read about it on Yelp. We decided to give it a try. What a hidden gem. I took the advice of another reviewer and tried the basil marscapone cheese burger...WOW!!! It was really good.  After ordering, that wasn't the last time we saw the gentleman behind the counter, either. He came out, said hello, asked us if everything was good. Really really nice guy. Will definitely go back again.  Can't wait to try their homemade desserts."}
{"text":"i'd heard about this place a bunch and couldn't wait to go try it.  i have to say i was a bit overwhelmed by the menu, i wish there wasn't so many choices cause it made my choosing very difficult.  i ended up getting a burger that had pastrami on it (the new yorker) and it was REALLY good.  the meat quality was really good and they cooked it rare just like i asked.  i keep wanting to go back and try other stuff, it's just not very convenient for me to go to, but i will again soon!"}
{"text":"Family is the first word that comes to mind when I think of New York Flavor. This family has been kind enough to share their cooking with us! The food is amazing, the seating area is cozy. My son loves the pancakes my wife loves the French toast and love it all. It seems be a popular place and can be really busy in morning on weekends. However it's worth the wait! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Chef Craig knows how to put out quality food. Ate there again this morning.  Place was busy, as often happens with a place that delivers first rate food at a good price.  Had the \"Brooklyn\" which is just bacon, eggs and toast.  Prepared perfectly; eggs weren't greasy, bacon was at that magic point between chewy and crispy that's almost impossible to hit time after time.  You know a place is good when customers walking out tell you, unsolicited, \"That place has great food!\"  Well, I'm telling ya...  this is one of THREE places in Phoenix where I'll bother to eat breakfast"}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times and the food is always top notch.   We often just pop  in (we live right in the neighborhood) to buy a loaf of raisin bread.  Keeps great in the freezer and we just toast and serve with butter and maple syrup.   Yum!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here a few times, and I was pleasantly surprised the food is really good. I live in the area and I have a great place to add to my list of spots. If your reading this looking for a place to eat look no further.   Mr Low Down. .."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Unlike any other place in surprise. Immediately we received great service and recommendations. I had the burger with mascarpone cheese and portabella mushroom. It was cooked perfectly how I ordered it and you could taste the freshness of the ingredients(especially the basil). My wife had the coffee and loved it as well. Great place!"}
{"text":"Not great - I just ordered a chicken parmesan sandwich and a hot pastrami sandwich. - chicken parm was chicken fingers, not even close to what I'd expect for a proper sandwich. The pastrami, marble bread, not toasted, soggy and disgusting. If this is what I am to expect for nearly 40.00 I'd never go back again. Very disappointing especially as so many people rave about this place. Maybe today was an off day, but this is terrible."}
{"text":"Alright, this has to be one of my favorite places to eat by far. I own a salon just down the way from this glorious establishment. (May have been one of the reasons I picked my location.) I think I eat here breakfast, lunch and dinner! The omelets will change your life, Coffee blows Starbucks out of the water and the Management is key here. These people make you feel like family when you walk through the door. Your food comes out so fast and always the way you order it.  Go here right now!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a good sandwich.  I was surprised they used brie, water cress, roasted red pepper, eggplant, and arugula among other unique ingredients.  Seinfeld is playing on the TV along with a live webcam of NYC.  Very unique place with very unique ingredients.  Love it!!"}
{"text":"Food is wonderful and comes in huge portions. The owner is pleasant and personable. I love the TVs that have a live feed of the streets of NY. Great experience overall. :-)"}
{"text":"Gosh Damn, the food here has so much personality. They range from subtle and savory to bold and tasty with every bite. The best part is that they're in the west valley, this is the real deal folks. If you're near, this is a must stop even if for just a quick snack. Minus one star cause I can't afford to eat here as often as I would like."}
{"text":"One of the better sandwiches and a nice tossed chef salad make for a great lunch. Fresh ingredients, seems very clean so not sure why some complained.   My daughters mixed green salad was a bit over dressed however the greens were very good (crisp and flavorful) not like the ones at most markets that are dull and lifeless."}
{"text":"You want food that is as close to New York as you can get? Come here. Great deli sandwiches and burgers. Good flavor and fresh. This is not some \"wanna be\" deli with New York in their name. This is the real deal."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by a friend who lives in Surprise. I walked in expecting your typical breakfast/lunch diner but the atmosphere is more take out but it works. There's a live feed of New York City on a large tv on the side. We took our time with the menu and both ended up getting burgers - I got the classic burger (I believe that's what it's called) and my boyfriend got the NY BBQ burger. We were not disappointed. Very fresh burgers. The cheese was melted perfectly. The fries are delicious. I would definitely recommend New York flavor. I wish we lived in the area to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Nothing Special It is just ok, more a place for lunch than anything else Cost $25 for (2) sandwiches and (2) cokes After reading all the 4 star reviews I was disappointed I will go to Subway next time, not much difference If you like fresh cut fries it may be worth the visit as they are good"}
{"text":"The best cheesy eggs ever! I love the food and service. This is a great place for your family to try."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! This place is AMAZING! The customer service is top notch! The food is fantastic! I have tired both the DeNiro burger and the Spanish Harlem with crispy fries both are out of this world. My husband has had the classic cheeseburger and the 6 stack of buttermilk pancakes with bacon. He's a hard one to please but loved them both! My mom had the central park breakfast and loved it. My son had chocolate chip pancakes with bacon and loved them. I have nothing bad to say about this restaurant!  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches at this local surprise gem. I liked everything about this place and the service. Food came out hot and on point. The cheesesteak was good, the Spanish Harlem was good, the pastrami burger was awesome. My only gripe was that the fries could have been cooked a little more because they were semi flimsy and chewy. Also the soda machine wasn't adjusted right. All in all I would suggest this place to my fellow yelpers and this is closer to a 4 star place than my rated 3. Enjoy!  Ps. Don't forget the excellent sponge cake cheese cake"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today and the Basil Mascarpone burger was excellent."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise.  I stumbled into this place by accident and tried a burger.  I would say these are the best burgers in Surprise and the staff is a joy to be around."}
{"text":"I am still in a food coma while writing this. Unanimous 5 stars for breakfast. Perfectly prepared food. Perfect bacon,eggs,banana nut pancakes, challah french toast. Perfect down to the black & white cookie. Kids can't wait to eat the challah french toast again. Solid East Coast deli/diner food!  Kids and I visited you based on the awesome YELP reviews :)"}
{"text":"Great Burgers cooked the way you want them!  Try the tarter sauce on the perfectly cooked french fries.  I had the New York Burger with the Swiss cheese and Pastrami! They are a bit  spendy at $10.00 each.  The breakfast special looked great and they serve it all day!"}
{"text":"This is  a great little deli with a large menu.  Breakfast is available, fried eggs, potatoes etc. that is unusual for a place like this.  Not sure it is all that authentic but they have hot pastrami and corned beef.  Product seems to be above average but what really made me decide to make a return trip was the service.  Very friendly and helpful.   Seems to be a popular place."}
{"text":"For all the Surprise peeps complaining about not having enough tasty, independent eateries... check THIS one out. They have a diverse menu and honestly FRESH ingredients with complimentary blends of flavor. Our lunch from burger down to the pasta salad to homemade cake was delish. And thank the Lord--it's not another \"New York pizza\" joint! It's everything else! PS: cooks & owner very nice, appropriately attentive; clean dining area; clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch date with my wife.  It didn't disappoint!!  The food was fantastic too!!  NY Flavor has the look and ambience of a real NY Deli.  Narrow and deep; counter on one side and seating along the other.  My wife ordered the NY burger and I got the award winning Mascarpone Basil burger.  Both were cooked to order and were hot and fresh.  I hadn't had a great burger in a while.  Totally satisfied now.  Loved the flavor profile of the mushrooms (thick), caramelized onions and basil.  The mascarpone was gooey.  It was a masterful combination that I have not tasted anywhere else!!  Fries were hand cut and I liked the sea salt on top.  Solid.  Had no room for dessert.  Saw an order of eggplant Parmesan coming out and decided it would be at the top of my list when I come back next time.  There will definitely be a next time!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, I love the large screen TV that's always tuned to time square. The food is always good, the hamburger is fresh and juicy."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here on my most recent trip to Surprise - 3 days in a row because the food, price, and service were all wonderful. The last 2 times I got to speak with the man that I think is the owner, he's very friendly and truly cares that you enjoy the meal. His staff is great. And you really can't beat the price, especially for the quality of food. The coffee was good too, which is a big win for me. Our family is definitely going to make this a regular spot on our visits and we've passed the recommendation on to our relatives here."}
{"text":"Kudos!!!! Lunch on a late Saturday afternoon hit the spot!!!  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Rueben so I had it yet again and the MM had a burger... My Rueben did not disappoint and the MM enjoyed his chili burger (he did think the chili should have had more kick).  Ordered the fries EXTRA CRISPY WITH EXTRA SALT... And they were PERFECTLY WONDERFUL!  Not mushy or greasy... Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"What a surprise to find a gem like NY Flavor in a strip mall in Surprise, Az..lol..and thank you again to Yelp or I'd never find this place. We were in the area on business and I went to Yelp to see what had high ratings, hence my visit to NY Flavor.  When you enter this place there is NY everywhere on the walls. From a big screen shooting live feed from Times Square, to photos on the walls. From the Yelp reviews I heard the Basil Mascarpone Burger was voted New Times top burger a little while ago. Ok I had to order that..  I like places where you order at the counter, then they bring it out to you. We waited about 10 mins or so for the food to come out. I ordered it medium which it was perfectly prepared. From one bite this burger was legit! I'm not really a fan of onions, but these carminalized ones were awesome, along with the mascarpone sauce, this burger was a flavor explosion. Man it was good. The bun it was served on was some sort of sweet bun, just to add to perfection. To top off the experience the fries were just as good. I saw them cutting potatoes in the back, they basically fry fresh patoes slices  I don't know what oil they use but they were also very very good!  Overall was this the best burger in Phoenix. I bet if Guy Feri was here she would say yes, but i like so many places. Don't know if I'd call it my favorite, but top 3 is easy to say.lol. Anyways, excellent joint and Surprise residents should feel lucky this is in their neighborhood."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now so I can say this is one of my favorite Places in Surprise. Not just simple food fare but unique and flavorful ones as well. The grilled Veggie sandwich was amazing and the Burgers are wonderful. The Pastrami, fugetaboutit! I grew up with Cheesy eggs and this is the only place I have found that makes them the East Coast nostalgic way. Gotta try it just once. ;)  Not to mention THE best Everything Bagel you can get in AZ! All while watching Times Square live on the wall! :)"}
{"text":"Great little location for a quick bite to eat.  Very casual and you order at the counter.  I got the Basil Mascarpone Burger that everyone has been talking about and it is fantastic.  I will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"While this isn't a five star restaurant, my rating is still five stars -- for what this place is, it really does hit all the marks. My only complaint would be the location :)  I was actually expecting a sit-down restaurant with a server, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this was not the case. It is definitely more of a New York experience; customers walk in, order what they'd like at the counter, find any available seat, and enjoy their meal when it is brought out. Originally, we were in a bit of a hurry, so this was perfect! However, our plans changed as we were eating, so we were no longer in a rush and were able to enjoy our food for a bit longer.  The service was decent and definitely felt like \"New York.\" While I'm not a native, I have been to New York a few times and loved it there. It was nice to have this experience all the way out in SURPRISE, Arizona! Inside was nothing spectacular, but it was clean and had some nice decorations. As others have mentioned, they have a big TV with a street cam view of Manhattan. I didn't pay too much attention to it, but it was kind of cool and added a bit to the escapism ;)  As for food--as I've just mentioned on my Bliss ReBAR review, I normally don't like French Toast... so I have no idea what's up with me and trying all the French Toast everywhere lately. However, when I see things like Pretzel Bread (Bliss) and Challah Bread (New York Flavor), I can't help but become interested. I LOVE Challah Bread, so when I saw the Challah French Toast, I had to get it. It did not let me down, either... and I'm glad it was all I got. It was very filling!!! I had three slices, but they were huge.  I also shared a slice with my husband in return for some of his cheesy scrambled eggs... His favorite scrambled egg recipe is to make it with crème fraîche, so we were stupidly excited when we realized that these cheesy eggs were made with crème fraîche!!! (By the way, we say crème fraîche like from the South Park episode every. time.)  It wasn't very busy, but we were there around 10am on a Saturday morning. I'm not sure if it gets busy at other times, but their menu did have some really delicious stuff on it for an all-day menu. If we're in the area again, we will definitely consider going here!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot hands down! Great Prices,  made to order quality food and friendly service.  I need to try their burgers cause I heard they are very good. Surprise is luck to have this!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting NYF for years and usually go there for lunch or breakfast (or sometimes breakfast FOR lunch) twice a week.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The decor is nice with framed prints that the owner took in New York and the ladies restroom has really cute fashion decor which the owner's wife picked out.  (They both have great taste!)  They also have a live-feed of Times Square on a large TV which makes it fun to people-watch.  Inside seating is maybe around 35 or so plus there are also some tables outside for when the weather is nice.  I like that the owners are very involved and you will usually see one or both working.  The menu is pretty huge - great breakfasts, delicious sandwiches, awesome 1/3-pound burgers, hot dogs and sausage & peppers....as well as salads and pastas.  But did you know they also have SCRUMPTIOUS, made from scratch desserts like New York cheesecake, carrot cake and rice pudding?  (I have had the cheesecake and the carrot cake a few times and both were unbelievable.)  They also have black & white cookies which are nummy.  Another thing we love is their coffee bar which is something that I suspect people don't realize is an option.  (My daughter loves their caramel macchiato.)  I have tried so many of their menu items that sometimes it is hard for me to choose.  My top two go-to items are Basil-Mascapone burger (oh...my....gosh...) and Mikey's Cheezee Eggs (again:  oh...my...gosh...).  As a side, the pasta salad is my favorite, hubby loves the coleslaw and their fries are cooked to perfection.  I really like that I can build my own breakfast burrito but heck, if you're feeling constructive (see what I did there?), then you should know that you can also build-your-own omelette, sandwich, burger, hot dog, salad or pasta.  Here are some of my favorite menu items: Challah French Toast, Staten Island, Little Italy, Meatball Parmesan Hero, De Niro Burger (previously a special but it was sooo good, they added it to the menu), Veggie Burger (fresh made, in-house) and the Southwest Caesar.  One last thing I should mention is that we have personally used NYF to cater a couple of events and BOY, was the feedback great!  One time, we ordered a variety of pasta for a PTA function for 75 people and a few other times we hosted neighborhood parties in our home and served party platters with a variety of NYF sandwiches plus pasta salad and potato salad.  It is now the ONLY place hubby wants to use for our parties."}
{"text":"A great little place to stop for a bite ..... when I was visiting in June I ate here twice and I am so glad that I had the opportunity to stop again"}
{"text":"Wooooow talk about highway robbery! Went in here for lunch. I asked the guy taking the orders if he recommended the pastrami sandwich or the Armando special burger. He told me the burger was so good and that no one uses angus beef like them! So I ordered the burger without lettuce, onion, tomato, and mustard because that what the special board said came on it. Also was asked how I would like it cooked I answered medium. So out comes the burger. I see mayo on the bun. So now I'm wondering why it didn't say that one the special board. I call over the guy who took my order to ask him for a new bun without mayo. He took the burger to the kitchen and was telling the girl cook no mayo and she snapped back at him how come you didn't say no mayo! He said it's not on the the board. Which she bitchily said yes it is! So glaring at me while grabbing a new bun out of the bag she threw it on my plate. She didn't toast it or heat it up like the first bun that the mayo was on out of some weird anger or spite it seemed. All this over a request for a new bun! On to the $11 burger. It was a well done charred small flavorless puck! I would be embarrassed to serve this meat that they claim is premium. Fries were good. Overall I will never be back not just due to the rude cook but the small portions, gross, and over priced food! My friend ordered the Reuben hoping for a classic New York style sandwich only to be left disappointed after this woefully inadequate, flavorless, dry pile of trash arrived on his plate. (His words) The meat was dry and flavorless, the kraut was generic and weak, and the bread, eh...for 12!!!!! Dollars!!!!! With soggy fries!!!! NEVER AGAIN. Don't EVEN ask me if I want to be a rewards loyalty member...ppsshhh.  No thanks. Keep your east coast trash out my desert oasis.   BIG APPLE MORE LIKE BIG MISTAKE!!!!!  Update Response to the owner. Bill you were pleasant to deal with but your cook has a serious attitude. Why would I voice my opinion of the food when a fit was thrown to replace a bun with mayo that I didn't even order?"}
{"text":"Excellent local spot!  Had lunch today - I had the Harlem sandwich and it was fantastic!  Steak was tender, bread was fresh and the chimuchuri was outstanding.  The two who were with me had breakfast (served all day) and we're pleased as well.  Very nice staff and service was excellent.  Priced right for fresh food!"}
{"text":"Yum! Our first time here, I would give 4 stars because the wait was long for our food and they weren't busy at the time... BUT.... the food was amazing!!!!! The service was friendly, they always asked how we are doing, picked up empty plates ect. Everyone enjoyed their food, I ordered the basil mascarpone burger, there's so much on the menu but I will have a hard time not ordering that next time. The cheese cake was wonderful too.   Ps please stay open longer!!!! I wanted to go back for dinner and yall were closed :("}
{"text":"Great Deli Food! I've been here three times and the food is amazing and great quality. The Staten Island (sandwich) come with delicious slice of fresh mozzarella, creamy like butter. I tried a special called the Kramer, chicken breast on a pretzel bun with cheese sauce, wow. ...but.. My favorite is the Spanish Harlem! You won't know whether to eat it or make love to it. The only negative is that their sides are a little on the small side, but it's no hiccup for me. Go try it, now!"}
{"text":"My first time here, very nice decor, friendly staff, the live cameras of New York was pretty cool... I had a chef salad and a little Italy sandwich with potato salad.. The salad wasn't bad pretty decent size for the price, sandwich was alright could have used more meat on it, the ciabatta bread was pretty thick so it was a lot of bread..my daughter had a Caesar salad that must have been pretty good she ate it all, lol...  Over all it wasn't bad kind of pricey $27 for a lunch is kind of steep, but it won't stop me from trying it again.."}
{"text":"I tried the Basil Mascarpone Burger. It's really good, not too salty, really nice basil flavor, and the cheese is great. I would get that again. Price is decent at $9.99. It comes with a side and you can choose from fries, potato salad, pasta salad, and others. I chose the fries and the fries are okay. It's not seasoned (which I like).  I also tried the Rice pudding. It's light in flavor, not too sweet, but satisfies my sweet tooth.  I will be back again to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.com!! Had a simple omelette with potatoes and toast... They go the extra mile with each and every food item to make it a delicious experience. We've had sandwiches here as well. You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Look, I'll be honest, I am by no means a deli expert. I do know what I like in a deli sandwich. The meat has to be fresh, flavorful and plentiful. I'm kind of a bread snob, it has to be fresh. And finally, the very first pastrami sandwich I ever had came with a dill pickle spear; and in my opinion, that is the only way to serve a deli sandwich.  On to the review, I recently started working in the area and stopped in for lunch. I was so impressed that I went back the next day and got lunch for myself and a co-worker.  The pastrami was great, good mustard, the star of the show was the fresh marbled rye bread, so amazing.   Next was the corned beef, man-o-man, excellent sandwich! Same fresh marbled rye bread as before but the corned beef was phenomenal.  My co-worker had the Ruben and enjoyed it.  Icing on the cake, all sandwiches came with a dill pickle spear AND a side! The cole slaw was uniquely prepared, the flavor was unusual to me and I didn't really care for it, though it was not bad. Next day, I had the potato salad, it was very good."}
{"text":"It was great to find an authentic NY deli in the middle of AZ. Order at the counter then sit back and watch a live feed of Times Square on the big screen. Very friendly service and delicious breakfast sandwiches. Our only complaint is they don't have Taylor Ham as a meat choice!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here was very nice. There are 4 beautiful chandeliers hanging and a cool live cam of Times Square. Very New-Yorky atmosphere. New-Yorky? Is that a word? It is now. When I was trying to order, however, the cashier didn't seem to know what she was talking about. Maybe she's new? I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. Overall, it was a sort of awkward situation. I ordered a build your own salad, which was pretty cool and this is probably the only place with tons, and I mean tons of choices for toppings. Long story short, it took forever to get my food. I kept looking over at the cooks, and they seemed like they were having a nice time chatting with one another, one was even eating. It was kind of annoying, especially when I got my salad and the chicken was burnt. Other than that, it was a very, very good salad. The people I was with ordered sandwiches, and they were humongous, plus we all agreed the food was delicious, which is the only reason I'm giving four stars. Overall, good food."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast on Tuesday morning.  Very warm & friendly greeting by staff.  The owner came to our table as we were finishing our delicious breakfast to say hello & ask how our breakfast was.  Very nice touch.   The eggs were cooked to perfection.  Potatoes fresh (not frozen) & the seasoning on the potatoes was quite tasty.  Sausage patty was delicious.  The toast on the whole wheat multi grain bread was wonderful.   Their sandwich menu looks good too!  We will return & give it a try.  Best breakfast in Surprise!"}
{"text":"Worst chicken Parmesan I've ever had. I asked for sauce on the side. Dish came out w penne pasta and a very strange looking piece of breaded, clearly pre-made, pre-frozen piece of chicken. I stated \"I've never seen a chicken Parmesan without melted cheese on it\".  Cook said to me \"do you want some parmesan?\" I said no, I wanted some mozzarella melted on it. I watched the main female cook throw some cheese on my dish, put it in a microwave and re-serve it to me. To say the chicken why dry and hard would be an understatement. I've eaten here before and I will tell you, stick to the sandwiches or salads. My husband had the lasagna, also a microwaved hot mess, although very flavorful. I don't know why a broil devise is not being used? When the male cook brought my dish back to me I should of just refused it. I would of been embarrassed to give this to a customer."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the redeeming qualities of NYF are.  The quality of the meat was good, however the fries were soggy and I was dismayed by the slightly stale bread on both my girlfriend's and my sandwich.  The sandwiches were very reminiscent of what you would find in an \"office building deli\" rather than more typical joints I've eaten in NY.  Not exactly inexpensive either, about $51 for 4 people ($10 for an 11\" sub).  Other than the names of the dishes, pictures on the walls and Seinfeld playing on the TVs, not sure what is so New York about it."}
{"text":"Tried this place for breakfast for the first time based on reviews on here.  Excellent food.  We are always looking for good, non chain breakfast places.  This is our new favorite place.  We will make the drive from Goodyear.  Plan to try lunch or dinner next time.  Great service too!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here after we got into town for vacation.  I got a chili cheese dog and fries. My boyfriend got the NYPD burger and fries.  The chili cheese dog was good (nothing over the top to rave about) and my bf thought the burger was excellent.  He loved that the blue cheese topping actually had chunks.   The fries weren't that great though.  Very greasy and very soggy.   If they were crispier they would be much better."}
{"text":"I like their breakfast, in particularly their pancakes. Good coffee. Their eggplant parmesan hero is awful though. How the lady who works there described it to me was: they fry the eggplant first, then they put it into a pan, coat it with sauce and cheese and then bake it. Like an eggplant lasagna. WHAT!? When I think of an eggplant parmesan sandwich, the eggplant is supposed to be light and crispy, topped with sauce, cheese, then put onto the hoagie, and toasted. Not this one, it was just a soggy mess."}
{"text":"Our neighbors invited us out to eat and showed us this place. I love local spots & it seems like chains dominate in Surprise. The marscopone burger that my husband got was SO GOOD! I got the sliders and they too were good but nothing compared to my husband's burger! Overall great experience & will be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend introduced me to this place and honestly it was amazing! The first thing I notice when I come in is how cozy it feels. We both ordered a Reuben with fries, which was made to order. The food was delicious and the employees were very friendly. Definitely a nice place to hang out and get good food!!!"}
{"text":"I still enjoy the Basil Mascarpone Burger.  What a deal for $8.99.  For the ingredients it is a deal.  Just stay away if you are still on your New Years Resolution of dieting.  I will now consider New York Flavor my cheat day of the week.  When I am eating my celery and carrots during the week, I dream of the Basil Mascarpone Burger on Friday: cheat day. :) So in other words I do still rate this burger as one of my top picks.    They also have great sandwiches and I am sure one day I will try one, once I get tired of eating the Basil Mascarpone Burger.  I suggest you have one when you are out in Surprise.   If you really want to treat yourself have a slice of cheesecake. Nothing like made in house desert.  Basically everything here is made in the kitchen.    Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with sausage, egg and cheese and it was really good. I also had a slice of chocolate cake and it was also very good. The restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly, and the cook is fast."}
{"text":"Happily popped in here for lunch, came out with nothing but regret!  Placed is located in Surprise just off Bell Road in a small strip mall nestled between Papa John's and a barber shop. Lots of parking however I noticed signs for only one-hour parking (-1).   The place is well lit but small with only seating against the wall.  There is seating outside however there aren't any misters and this is Arizona folks!   Staff who greeted us at the cash register was friendly and asked if we'd like menus which we did.  Took some time to order and wasn't rushed.  I ordered the corned beef sandwich with a side of potato salad, another in my party ordered the basil mascarpone burger with chili fries, and another in my party ordered the make-a-sandwich. The portions was very small and not very filling (-1).  The side of potato salad I ordered as my side was placed in a small cup similar to those cups filled with butter you dip lobster in...it was that small!  The sandwich itself was nothing to write home about as I have been to numerous NY delis and New England delis and it definitely didn't compare. The biggest turnoff of this visit was when one person in my party found a long stranded light-brown colored hair in her sandwich which immediately got her turned off and infuriated.  We alerted the waitress who initially brought our meals to the table and she simply looked at us without a word of apology, then said, \"I could re-make the sandwich!\"  That's all well and good but what about an apology!  (-2)   We decided then and there we were prepared to leave and asked for the sandwich that was being \"remade\" to go.  The waitress brought it to our table, we said thanks, and she walked away with not so much as a word or an apology for our experience! This is definitely not a place to put on your radar and will not be coming here ever again!"}
{"text":"I ordered the basil burger and it was very juicy and well-cooked. The onions and mushrooms were not too soft. I actually enjoyed the little pasta salad that came with the meal.   Expect to spend $10-15 for lunch. Also, they have a rewards program that is worth joining. You get a $15 credit for every $100 spent. Not bad!"}
{"text":"Just tried this spot for the first time! Food was great. Customer service on point. I had the Deniro burger. Will definitely be sampling the entire menu in the future. Note:cheese eggs were delicious as well!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best fast food I have ever had. Hard to believe what comes out of their small kitchen. Their burgers are better that most upscale restaurants, and the friendly service made it even better."}
{"text":"Absolute best of Surprise by far. Bill is an AMAZING AMAZING person and he is so personable every time we come in. The marcapone  isn't something I would really eat until Bill said TRY IT. I was so impressed and I crave it every day now. I love the new york and italian feel (Being both of these and being stuck in a concrete jungle this place is huge for me) I try to make it in every single weekend! They are so great with my kids too! I have been a true loyal customer since I have been a resident of Surprise... If I was ever to move back to PHX I would still come for my fix..."}
{"text":"Went in for a late dinner, at 7:30. Wanted to try the place because we like to support local business, and my husband and I are from New York (state, not city), so we wanted to see how authentic the food was. There were 2 other customers eating.  Place looks really nice- TV's are high quality, chandeliers add an interesting touch. My husband and I had a really fun time watching the live feed camera from NYC- good conversation starter! There were 3 people working- the owner and 2 others.  You give them your order at the counter- took a bit because they are obviously still getting used to the computer system and didn't know where certain buttons were.    Food came out fairly quickly- everything is made from scratch, I heard the owner/chef talking about it to the other customers- so considering we got our food in about 10 minutes, it was really good!  I got penne with marinara and ricotta added.  Pastas are $6.99, adding a meat is $2, and they have a whole bunch of veggies and cheeses that you can add for free!  Serving size was decent- I finished it all and could have used a roll or something more.    My husband's bread on his sub looked delicious and I kept stealing some.  He got the *?illy Cheesesteak (like how they don't call it Philly- I hate that town!).  He really liked it and ate the whole thing, which was a feat because it was pretty big and meaty.  I stole some of the meat, and it was cooked well, not fatty.  Very strongly tasting of peppers and onions.  They offer you a choice of cheeses- not the most 'authentic' cheesesteak around.  I wouldn't really say it's a Philly cheesesteak, but it was still good.  And the sub roll was great.  He got to choose a side, and he went with th fries, which were delicious!  It also came with a big pickle spear.  We got a black and white cookie, and a brownie for dessert.  The brownie was good- soft and chewy.  The cookie was OK- tasted like it might have been a day old.  Also, the frosting was the hard kind- confectioner's sugar kind, not the fluffy kind you get at the deli's in New York.  I also ordered an espresso- I got the feeling not many people do bcause he asked me if I just wanted an espresso...and I was like, yeah, that's what an espresso is.  And they don't have any little cups, so I got it in a paper coffee cup.  BUT it makes a double shot, so he gave me 2 for the price of 1, which is $1!  Can't go wrong with a $1 espresso- cheaper than Europe!  Overall, good experience.  I'll try a sandwich next time, as I think that might be better, though I did overhear the owner say he makes the lasagna from scratch- including the noodles.  We'll definitely be back to try more things!"}
{"text":"My parents & I come here so much for breakfast lunch and dinner and we have Never had any food that was bad. Must try the cheesy eggs and the Yankee Sliders are amazing! :)"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out today for something new. I had the Challah French Toast, it had good flavor but was very mushy in the center. My husband had the Spanish Harlem, and he loved it. The pricing wasn't to bad so I am sure we will be going back to try some other stuff."}
{"text":"What a cute little spot! My partner and I ate here for breakfast while we were visiting from out of town. He had Mikey's Cheeze Eggs and I had the banana nut pancakes. We were both extremely impressed with our meals! I got a stack of four panckes, which were huge. They were, however, very delicious and not overcooked like some places. And, considering how much food we both got, the price was definitely decent.    It did take a while for the food to get to us, which could have been because of how busy it was, but other than that it was a fantastic little stop and we both wish there was one in Vegas (our hometown)!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try New York Flavor ever since I moved to Surprise. Unfortunately, I was not as impressed as I thought I would be.   The service is pretty good. Since it was my first time, I asked the woman at the counter if there were any \"favorites\". She was very helpful in explaining the menu items.   I ended up ordering the Spanish Harlem with a side of potato salad. First, let's talk about the potato salad. It came in a TINY little cup. I am talking, like two bites of potato salad. I wish I had saved the little cup to take a picture. I almost felt like I was being pranked. I paid $1.99 for this potato salad. I expected to be able to eat more than two bites of it. And, to be honest, the two bites of potato salad I had weren't the greatest. It tasted like potato salad you could buy at the grocery store; nothing to write home about.  The sandwich itself was pretty good. The spread was flavorful and the steak was cooked perfectly. The bread was just okay. The sandwich was $8.99, which felt a little pricey to me based on the size of the sandwich.  All in all, the service is there, but the food here just isn't something I would expect to receive if I were actually in New York, which is the impression I got from the reviews and the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"I had passed by this place numerous times over the past few days.  I had also read that they had a burger that had won \"Best Burger in the Valley 2012\".  I looked up their website and saw that it was the Basil Mascarpone Burger.  It sounded very interesting so I decided to come down and try it out.  I walked into the joint and there was only one other customer in there who was talking with one employee.  The nice lady behind the counter asked me what I wanted.  I ordered the Basil Mascarpone Burger cooked medium and fries as my side.  That and a drink came out to around $12.00.  I took a seat in front of their gigantic TV and started to watch the game.  About 10 minutes later, my burger was ready and they brought it out to me.  Here is how it tasted...........  Basil Marscapone Burger-  This thing looked delicious!  The smell of the basil was very fragrant.  This burger comes with a 1/3lb patty, a nice artisan bun that is smeared liberally with mascarpone cheese, tomatoes, roasted portabello mushrooms, carmalized onions and then its namesake,  little ribbons of basil.  I took a bite in and got all the flavors at once.  The burger was cooked a perfect pink medium and had a great beefy flavor, the onions were sweet, the cheese was creamy, the mushrooms nice and tender, the strips of basil very pungent and delicious and the bun was soft yet held everything together.  This burger IS a messy one.  It is piled high and totally worth getting your face/hands/shirt dirty.  Just dig in!  I could see how it won \"Best Burger\".  It was definitely unique and definitely tasty!  French Fries-  The fries were decent.  They could have been a tad more crispy.  They were thick logs of hand cut potatoes.  They reminded me of a cross between Five Guys fries and my moms homemade fries.  They needed a little bit of salt too.  They weren't bad, they just weren't that great either.    I will definitely be back for another one of these burgers in the future.  Their other menu offerings looked great too. They also serve breakfast all day.   It's only about a 5 minute drive from my house,  so I guarantee I will eat through some of their menu."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and hot dogs.  Had the Armando burger special and really enjoyed it.  Potato salad had a good creamy dill flavor.  My wife enjoyed her chili cheese dog and thought the chili was excellent."}
{"text":"I tired the blueberry pancakes and the were great. I really like the breakfast potatoes. This has became a regular spot for Sunday breakfast."}
{"text":"Delightful place. Rice pudding is creamy not too sweet and  delicious!  I'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"Food was delivered promptly, and it was still hot. Ordered the Philly Cheesesteak, and French Fries.  The fries was soggy."}
{"text":"For the money the portions are good. I ordered eggs with bacon and 2 pancakes. Eggs were good and bacon was typical. The pancakes were heavy and dense, not light or fluffy as was expected and we were only given a small amount of syrup for them. We didn't ask for more so I'm not sure if it would've been free. Overall, not a great experience but I've had worse."}
{"text":"Really awesome blueberry pancakes!  Yummy bacon...delicious eggs...such a great place!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!!!   Haven't had anything that wasn't delicious.  We especially love the De Niro burger.  Tried the Spanish Harlem sandwich today, another winner.....SOOOO GOOD!  The people there are super friendly and helpful.  EAT HERE!!"}
{"text":"Good food and live streaming of times sqaure on 60\" tv. Pretty cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great place. Wife loved her burger and my Philly cheese steak was one of the best I've had. I have a big appetite and could only eat half. Also pasta salad was incredible."}
{"text":"We had dinner here. Good deli food, slightly pricy. I had the Reuben sandwich, lean corned beef, so I did have to add some 1000 dressing. My husband had Chicken Parmesan Hero sandwich, which he liked. The staff was very friendly & the place was very clean."}
{"text":"Good food and fast service. My husband and I dined in the restaurant on a Saturday afternoon just before they were going to close. It wasn't crowded so service was a quick. My cheeseburger was average. The fries were delicious! My husband was disappointed by the cheese steak he ordered. Mostly because we were born and raised in the northeast so we know authentic New York flavor food."}
{"text":"Well, I'm sad. They changed their hours, so I'm knocking off a star for not being open for dinner anymore. Food is still terrific but can't have it at night now. WHY?????  They must have their reasons, likely increased competition for dinner crowd from sports bar on corner in same plaza, or not wanting to live at the restaurant, which I respect. However, to not have even a message on their phone informing people of the new hours is frustrating. It just goes to some black hole message queue. Hence, my reason for knocking them down a star.     Bill- In response to your question about favorite food at NYF, the burgers and the corned beef sandwiches (regular and Reuben), along with your fries are great. I'm not in love with the mascarpone burger, but others in my family swear by it. Your soups are really good, too."}
{"text":"Cute little place with great food and lots of menu options. It was very clean and we enjoyed the New York decor. The desserts looked awesome, but we were there for breakfast."}
{"text":"My sister introduced me to the place and I've taken my family there a few times now. Today I had a hot pastrami on rye which was incredibly delicious. Tender pastrami, no visible fat, delicious deli mustard and just plain delicious. My wife had the Staten Island which I had to steal a few bites. Also delicious. Nice quaint atmosphere, nice staff, great food, clean restaurant. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  But Food took a while. Soda didn't taste right. Ketchup came out very watery.  Breakfast potatoes cold."}
{"text":"I have been to NY Flavor quite a few times and the food I order is always spot on. They have a pretty good size menu but I have only had their burgers and fries. Fries are fresh cut and are cooked great. The burgers are really good and are some of the best burgers on this side of town for the price. I'm a fan and will continue to be a patron at NY Flavor as long as the quality of the food stays high."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight and loved it. My husband and I shared two different sandwiches. The cheese steak which was good, but the Spanish Harlem was FANTASTIC! Their french fries are fresh cut and were great with malt vinegar.  Our son tried the Nautilus, he got half and couldn't finish it, he's 9. The had cool lights and decor. A live feed from New York City on a huge screen as well."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Everyone was so friendly! Great fries and my boyfriend loved the Philly steak! Burger was a little too done for a medium burger, but would still come back! Oh! The cheesecake was to die for!"}
{"text":"Mascarpone Burger - Wow! Get extra beef patty. It's not huge but it's wonderful. This burger has some trophies too.   Fries - Get 'em extra crispy! Quite nice.   Philly - pass."}
{"text":"Meh, no way is this place style and taste of NY. That being said it is not bad per say just not NY great. Everything was just okay. My one friend had the pastrami and it was okay. Bread store bought tasting. My other friend had the Turkey, Brie and Pear sandwich. He said it was really good. I noted however, it said it came on a Kaiser roll. Ummmm, no that is not a NY Kaiser roll. I had the Chicken Parm which was not bad but not NY great. I also ordered a side of meatballs. The meatballs were pretty good but for some reason they came to the table cold. Hhmmmmmm! The black and whites are okay I guess just due to the fact that they have them but they are hard and not \"cakey\" like NY style.The Cheescake is not that good either. I don't even think they have Cannolli which makes no sense to me being a NY place. Maybe they were just out when I dined there. Oh well.   I did think the people working here were very nice and I like their points card deal. Great idea. I live 40 miles a way so I won't be back any time soon. My friends live down the street so they might.  I would go back to try other things if I lived close by but not for the NY supposed style of the food.   They said they have a Tempe bakery make their bread but the bread is not that great. They did have other types on the counter like Cinnamon Raisin and Challa. The Challa did not look like any Challa bread I have ever seen in NY. Maybe that is better than their Marble Rye or Kaiser????? Not sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. Split the large  PHILLY CHEESTEAK with my hubby.  And fries as our side. DONT SKIP THE FRIES, they are so good. Fresh cut from real potatoes. Lol We will be back to keep trying more items  Met chef Craig. And the owner. Very nice and passionate guys :0)  Forgot to take pics before I started eating.  :0("}
