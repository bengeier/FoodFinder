{"text":"Love this place. The staff is fantastic and the drinks are very affordable. Lots of good regulars so you'll always meet up with a buddy."}
{"text":"This is probally the most boring bar i've ever been to.The atmosphere is drab and depressing.There's really not a lot to do in there either.They have 1 small pool table and a juke box,but that's about it.Theres a smoking patio that's small and looks out into the boring parking lot towards a pizza joint and a hair salon. If you go there on weekends,it's usually douche bag central with loud annoying music and drunk 20 yr olds arguing,dancing,and doing whatever else.Any other time it's usually dead,and i can see why."}
{"text":"DJ Mo every Friday at O 2 lounge be there if you love dancing any music he got you..... Trust me he got you.....remember you have to start your weekend right fridaaaay nights at O 2 lounge"}
{"text":"Excellent neighbor hood bar!   Great drink specials for happy hour and ladies night on Fridays.   DJs and room to dance.  Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Very fun place to go for dinner and drinks!! They have the most savored food I've had in a long time! They have good drinks and a good time!"}
{"text":"So Since Moving from New York I haven't gone out  in phoenix. My friend Has never had a girls night, so I decided one day on a whim to just try the place. I saw driving by one time.  So we go and we sit in our cars for a Lil bit and I'm like this looks dead, lets listen to what kind of music they are playing ( I am Puerto Rican) I here hip hop play in. I was like wait a minute I have to check this out. So my girl and I walked in and it wasn't packed, which I like. The drinks were great in prices and taste. Customer service was pretty good.  But the DJ was on point, i mean he mixed the music well and yea it was mostly hip hop but I live hip hop. but he was mixing it up. he even took sum requests. though not to many people liked the bachata and salsa. oh well. lol  everything was great except for one thing and one thing that stopped me from giving this place 5 stars.    I  got really upset with a guy that kept hitting on my friends. we explained we were all married and that we were having a girls night and he continued to freakin persist. my friend and I were being nice at first but it got to the point where nice wasnt enough. So  yea i was a big B and I had to put him in his place a few times. He  kept saying why you at a bar if you dont wanna get hit on. I lost it because im entitled to go out with my girlfriends and not be hounded by some dude who gets no ass.   aside from that I will be back sorry  regular customers, dont be mad.  Hitting it up with all my girlfriends and met sum pretty amazing people."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Not crazy busy, good music, an ok pour in the drinks, prices fair for the area and the atmosphere is pretty good. I like the place. Its perfect when you want some drinks, but you actually wanna talk to people."}
{"text":"My God this place is scum. I think it attracts the scum of the scum. And it's definitely a \"who you know\" bar. People came in that obviously knew the bartender and they got great service and were acting like they owned the place. We had a large group with us and didn't get service at all.   Once we went & didn't realize it was rap night. Like - live rap night. Live, entry-level, rap night. We're a fun group and will try anything so we stuck it out for a bit but that was too much. The second time we tried, it was rock music but the clientele and lack of service made people so uncomfortable that we left.  The shuffleboard is fun!"}
{"text":"Dark, the service was slow, and the waitress had absolutely no sense of humor. The prices were reasonable, but the menu was very limited."}
{"text":"Awesome neighborhood bar. Great staff. Karaoke and Dj every Saturday starting at 10pm."}
{"text":"Walked in here on a Saturday evening and I was really disappointed. The place was a mess, it was over crowded and the music was horrible. I had really been looking forward to coming here and I was sadly disappointed."}
{"text":"Weird place, didn't expect this level of dive bar in this area.  But they have an awesome draft beer selection, and the bartender was friendly and fast.  One of the regulars called me a homophobic slur for carrying a \"pretty\" laptop case.  Ah well, can't judge a place by the customers.  They have a few games, and a smoking-allowed patio.  Good place if you like good local/craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Clean, games, and a jukebox so that was good but I had to wait at the bar a ridiculously long amount of time for each drink."}
{"text":"I stopped in on Saturday night to hang out with a couple of friends.  I can't really say much about this place aside from the fact that it was a little empty for a Saturday night.  They had a birthday party there, so I can't imagine how empty it would have been without the party being there.  It's a pretty dark bar, which is fine.    The drinks are cheap.  I can't complain about $4 wells.  Music was fine, too.  If you like dark dives, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Nice place to gather with Friends,  Dawn is an awesome waitress and the guys behind the bar are great! !!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I was here on an \"off\" night, but this place was yuck and lame.  One of my friends loves it because it's so close to where she was living at the time, and I think she was friendly with one of the bartenders, as well.  But I did not get the appeal AT ALL.  The music and sound system were horrible, the sparse crowd was made up of young wanna-be-gangsta types mixed with girls too big to be wearing what they were wearing, and the drinks were weak.  I believe it was a Saturday night, but I can't be sure...it was a few months ago.  The main reason we ended up there was that the above-mentioned bartender was really pushing for my friend to invite her girlfriends, assuring her he would \"hook them up.\"  Did we get the hook up?  Nope, not even a little bit.  Maybe we weren't trashy enough.  I'm not claiming to be high class...I do live on the west side, after all...but this was definitely not my scene.  Next."}
{"text":"This place is insane! They have so many glasses! Like all kinds of glasses! Like pint glasses, shot glasses, beer mugs, cocktail glasses! It's so crazy like its a bar, I get it. But man there's a lot of cool glasses."}
{"text":"A friend said she found this place on google under \"dance clubs.\" Four of us showed up on a Friday night at 11:00 p.m. I'd say there were 30 people in there. They had a DJ playing meh music, smoking patio, darts, pool table, dead dance floor. The bathrooms were clean. I was acting as the designated driver for the night and they do not offer free soda for the DD's, bummer. The crowd was mainly males, really good looking ones, I remember thinking \"there are some serious hotties on the West side.\" The bartender was attentive and nice. It's not a dance club at all, just me and another friend were the only ones that danced the entire night.   I played erotic photo hunt on the touch screen at the bar. \"Moanz\" is top 4 scores."}
{"text":"I only stopped in here briefly but the music was really good and the atmosphere was very welcoming.  We didn't stay long but the prices seemed reasonable and the patio was very nice.  Next time I am in the area I will be sure to stop by again."}
{"text":"This isn't the worst place I have ever been, but I really don't like the atmosphere. It is dark and dingy in here, and to top it off, it isn't really decorated like anything. I am really big on ambiance and I feel like The O2 Lounge doesn't have any whatsoever. The drinks are okay... but I have definitely seen better bars. It's nice if you're just looking for somewhere close on the westside."}
{"text":"First off, ordered a draft beer and it was nasty, I assume because they haven't had their lines cleaned in FOREVER. Then we ordered a veggie platter, and the veggies all came out with some weird red stuff on it, gross. Then, after waiting 30 mins (the place was empty) we got our food. An open faced meatball sandwich, with burnt dry meatballs and a so called \"Italian Beef\" sandwich... horrible. Would never come back or recommend this place. All the old coots screaming at the the tv's for OTB don't help the experience either."}
{"text":"This is blowing away other neighborhood bars in the area. Even though there are decent dives in the north valley, they are plagued by one of two problems: Either it's an old farts bar with cheap drinks, or it's young and hip with prices through the roof.  At O2 Lounge, you get the best of everything. There's a jukebox with a seemingly limitless selection to complement the badass sound system. There's plenty of room to dance, and even a stage for a live act.  The bar itself is also very aesthetic and the prices were more than reasonable for the size and the strength of what I got.  I know this place is out of the way, but if you wanna have fun without an abundance of douchebags and bankrupting prices, make this your next stop."}
{"text":"Well, passing of an era. The doors are locked and it looks like out of business. Sad, as it was my favorite bar."}
{"text":"O2 Lounge is listed as a sports bar, but on a Wednesday night it looked like a busy nightclub complete with DJ and dance floor. No cover to get in and they had 10oz draft beers for 2 bucks.   I noticed a good mix of guys to girls and lots of younger women, which is rarely seen at Hurricane Bay these days. There's an expansive patio that wraps around 2 sides of the building. The bar also stretches a good 40+ feet. I highly recommend O2 if you're in the area."}
{"text":"So... I take my wife to O2 lounge for a drink. Some guy, we've never met, comes up to my wife and tells her he's taking her home. Looks at me and tells me the same thing.  I'm being nice, he said he would take my wife home and \"f\" her. I defend the situation, knock him out and sent him to the hospital. Now I'm 86 from the bar? At least I now know the O2 management are jerks and don't support women. I would never recommend going to this establishment, unless you want to be womanized and are okay with your loved one being disrespected. I will always protect my wife. Be disrespectful and I'll send you to the hospital..."}
