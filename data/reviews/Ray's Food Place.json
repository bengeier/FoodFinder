{"text":"over priced low quality foods! I will never shop here or eat anything from their deli. I was sick to my stomach! plus it smells like thunderbird there. musty and not very clean. I will just stick to Albertson's"}
{"text":"I am completely perplexed as to how a place like this stays open. Their prices are considerably more expensive than all of the bigger market chains, yet they have plenty of loyal customers. 

I mean, I get when you're the only game in town; in places such as Merlin, or Kirby, or wherever, but in Phoenix? Just drive five minutes north to Winco. I get paying more for a \"cleaner\" market ambiance like Albertson's and Fred Meyer do, but Ray's? I don't get it! Even Thunderbird/Food 4 Less prices are much lower, so you go there for price and not atmosphere. But what in the world keeps people coming into Ray's?"}
{"text":"I would like to explain why I am reviewing this chain store, as it's generally not my style.

I live near by this store, about the same distance to the South Fred Meyers and I frequent it, less than the Freddies, but at least once a week.
I'm writing this review because I am a sandwich fiend. I crave the perfect sandwich, and it's very clear what the perfect sandwich is, in my head.
Ray's delivers. While otherwise really expensive (way more expensive than any other grocery store, rarely ever having sales), kinda dim and creepy inside, and with exceptionally irritating and unprofessional employees, their sandwiches are perfection. At least the way I like them. They don't skimp on the veggies, especially the sprouts, like many other grocery store deli's or sandwich shops might, and they also don't charge extra for anything. You get what you order, which in my case, is the best way to eat a sandwich: just how you like it. 
I know I sound like a crazy person rambling about the perfect sandwich, but it exists, and it exists here in this otherwise strange location.
Be aware: the cashiers are really loud and persistent to get you to talk, even if you're a quiet and quick person like I am.
Also extra points for carrying strange and off the wall items like Gold Hill Sweet Tea and experimenting with new cold beverages."}
{"text":"The 2 stars are for the very nice people that work at Ray's. On another note, how is this place still open?! Ray's is so ridiculously overpriced. I strive to support my local businesses, but I can't spend twice as much on groceries to shop at Ray's because it's close to my house. I occasionally go there when I forget the milk, butter, etc. and am appalled at the prices every time."}
{"text":"They should close this one with the rest of them it is absolutely useless the staff is helpless they sent me in three circles not knowing or product was and then they didn't even have the product. It is overpriced. If I didn't have people at my house and need champagne I would have gone to Medford I will never go back there I hope this place closes and a useful store opens in this town"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to write my review because of all the \"not so good\" reviews Rays has had in the past. I can walk to this store from my home, so being close is a plus.
When you first go into the store it's like a throwback to the 80's on theme. Very traditional store decor with the huge lettering identifying the section of the store. 
They have a decent selection of goods and a fairly large produce section with organic choices as well. 
The employees have always been super friendly to me. I've never gotten anyone that was creepy or weird. Just local people working to make a living. 
The store is clean- they have a fresh butcher area and it's well maintained. There's a Wells Fargo mini branch here inside too.
They have a video/DVD rental place on the produce side with fresh flowers and a little gift area.
I've lived near this store for 3 years now and it's nice to have it so close when I don't want to drive to Medford. 
The only drawback is prices. They are more expensive and you pay for convenience. If they weren't so expensive then they would get more of my major shopping business . I go here for a quick gallon of milk or organic produce. They have good sales occasionally and I get emails letting me know.  Overall I don't have anything bad to say about this local store that really does try to make a good impression on the community."}
{"text":"Have done my \"convenience store\" shopping here for years.  Highest prices around but I guess you pay for convenience. Kind of like a large 7-11"}
{"text":"Better prices than Shop Smart in the Roseburg area but about the same as going to Albertsons! $2 for tortilla chips, $3.50 for lays potato chips, pepsi max was super expensive though, $3 for storebrand soda, salad was 2 for $5. Had a nice sit down area for the deli! They had a large movie rental section by customer service with decent prices which is a huge plus since theres no Redbox in Phoenix or Talent! Really big store! The bathrooms were nice and clean! I just used the restroom so cant judge customer service. :P The locals in the store werent as bad as I thought they would be considering what walks up and down HWY 99 in front of the store."}
