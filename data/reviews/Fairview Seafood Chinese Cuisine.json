{"text":"It took me almost a month to think whether I should put a review for this restaurant. But since my conscience still keeps on haunting me to put a review for the health of others who would like to try that restaurant. I finally decided to do so. My family and I had a dinner there back in the middle of Sept. I usually cook or eat at well-known restaurants but decided to try that restaurant since my friends mentioned that their food was good. So, we ordered Seafood congee, noodles and other foods my friends suggested. Unfortunately, the congee has OBVIOUS FLY FLOATING in it. I was really grossed out and it made me sick. We don't want to make a scene so we just told the server and guess what she said??? She asked if we want another bowl of congee?! I was highly disappointed and upset because instead of being sorry or apologize she offered another bowl? Can you imagine? DISGUSTING RESTAURANT!!! We highly recommend NOT TO EAT at FAIRVIEW SEAFOOD CHINESE RESTAURANT if you don't want to get sick!"}
{"text":"This review pertains exclusively to the Thai Fried Rice. There is nobody that appreciates a good fried rice as much as me - if you are out there let me know your pick. This place hands down has the best fried rice (Thai Fried Rice) available in the GTA - and possibly beyond. For $6.99 its a bargain and usually lasts me for two meals. They are about ten minutes away from my office and I go there for the rice quite often. Inside looks a little tired but I don't really care as I've only done take out. If a better fried rice exists in the GTA, pleaseeeeeeeeeee, let me know. If your curious, give it a try, you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"This place is CHEAP!  Yet still manages to taste good.  The downfall is the service, more on that later.  Four of us ate dinner here the other night and we ordered:  Fish in corn sauce - Very good, fish was fried and tossed in wok with corn. Fish and tofu hot pot - Again good, lots of fish and tofu in a gravy-like sauce. Shrimp rice roll - Big shrimp rolled in rice noodles. Lobster special ($9.99 after you spend $20) - flavoured well, tossed in wok with ginger and scallions. Fish congee (rice porridge) - The one bad thing. Terrible, it tasted burnt!    Now onto the service: bad, bad, bad.  There wasn't a language barrier, either.  The girl who served us was rude beyond belief.  She obviously did not want to be working.  She threw the menus in our faces and was biatchy serving us the whole time.  We asked for some food descriptions and special requests, and she sighed and shook her head in annoyance.  She rolled her eyes when we spoke or asked for anything.  When we asked for dinner plates, she gave us saucers (but in the meantime, she gave all the other tables around us full size plates).  When I told her we wanted \"big\" plates, she grabbed back all the saucers and crash threw them all into a bin.  If we weren't eating there, I would've taken her outside for a serious smack-down.    Go for the cheap tasty food, but be prepared for server anguish.  Better yet, order take-out.  Don't order anything congee related.  Cash only, and the restaurant itself is not very clean."}
{"text":"Figured this place could use a new review. I used to come here as a kid when they had the buffet at the back and I still pop in every now and then for their fried rice that I seem to enjoy. One day in December 2017 I was walking by it and noticed they had Guyanese Style Fried rice and Chow Mein! Of course I decided to give it a try and I absolutely loved it!! It was delicious, fresh, flavorful and the wings were perfect tasty and crispy. They even had the Guyanese pepper sauce!!! Winning Great portions! Can feed many people.  Maybe Im easy to please but I thoroughly enjoyed it and have gone back several times since. They hired a new west indian cook I guess, so if you're looking for some variety then check it out!  If you are boujie and expecting fine dining with bells and whistles you are clearly at the wrong place.  I never usually expect great customer services at these types of places but they're always nice to me."}
{"text":"Been here on and off again for years.  We ordered the B15 shrimps in maggi sauce, L9 Yeung chow fried rice & M11 Homestyle vermicelli.  Wife and I decided to try here again for a late lunch.  Service : 2/5 kinda on par for most chinese restos.  on a previous visit I was able to enjoy a bento box here. However, the server conveniently didn't give us the bento box menu or forgot, or else our bill would have been like $16.00 before taxes.  Also 2 of the menus they gave to us were completely chinese and not English..seems like that was the rice combo menu, since we did see other diners having rice combo type meals.  Server told us rudely that English version was gone or something to that degree.  Food : 3/5 for the homestyle vermicelli noodles (this is one of our gauge dishes).  2/5 Yeung chow fried rice had the nice semi burnt taste to it, yet lacked in any other flavors.  3/5 for the shrimp dish with maggi sauce, for the price paid $7 we got about 8 tiger shrimps.  Value to money paid : Good portion size of rice and noodle dishes  We usually try to pick cheap eat type places, usually about under $25.00 with taxes in.  Would likely visit again for the bento box options.  on a per head basis this resto would probably be a $$"}
{"text":"Very good food! But I saw bugs on the wall. I don't think restaurants should ever have any type of infestations what so ever !"}
{"text":"Just came here today for a late lunch. Walking into the restaurant, I saw four huge koi in a fish tank. We were seating right away and menus were given to us.  Ordering took a bit of time, as we had to call the waitress several times before she could get to us, at one point, it felt as though she was ignoring us as she looked at us and yelled out another table's number for the bill. When we finally got to order, she walked away without asking us what drink we wanted even though it stated that the drink was included in the meal.  Food came fairly quickly though. I loved the e-fu noodles as it was stir-friend with thin and evenly chopped carrots and peas. The price wasn't expensive either (you're looking at between $5-$7 for something like this). I also got the noodles with beef tendon. The noodles tasted very fresh, I kind of hope that the soup base could be a little hotter next time!"}
{"text":"Came down here after a day of heavy lifting at the gym. Was looking forward to making some major gains! It was chest day, after heavy incline bench presses 4-6 reps, close grip bench presses 4-6 , weighted tricep dips 4-6 and some supplementary cable cross overs, rope pull downs and skull crushers 8-12. I was sore and excited to fufill all my macro nutrients.  I entered the establishment and was pointed to a seat. I sat down but noticed the table was kind of sticky...Maybe sweet and sour sauce. My fore arm clung to the table, i removed it briskly losing a few folicles of arm hair  I got up and sat at another table, the seat was hard and my angus was getting sore. I remained though. I was approached by the waiter, younger gentlemen, looked around 28. He brought me some water in a generic glass which i really appreciated, for my creatine left me dry as a bone. I ordered some general tao chickens on fried rice with an egg roll on the side.   After about 15 mins my food made a grand entrance. The aroma filled the atmosphere as an older gentlemen across the room gasped. The plate was placed beneath me, i closed my eyes and let the aroma assault my nostrils. My taste buds errupted like little volcanoes.   I went to dig into the dish but realized there were no utensils on the table. A disaster this was. I arose to track somebody down but everyone had temporarily stepped off the floor. I went back to my table and started eating with my hands because i am a savage.   About half way through the taste seducing dish i encounter a peice of chicken that was clearly 3-4 chunks amalgamated. I took her whole into my yapper. As i clenched down my powerful aesthetic chiseled jaw, and loud crunch was made present. It was bone. **pew pew pew* i spat it out into a napkin and finished my dish.   Upon completing my dish i logged my macros and figured out the dish was only about 27g protein. I was in sheer disappointment as i was expecting atleast 50g. I paid my bill and left. No mint, no macros hit and sticky arm."}
{"text":"I have visited this place several times and come here to get take out as well.   For the most part the staff if quite friendly, as I find the staff at most Chinese restaurants to be a little cold. So it's s nice surprise that these people are quite nice.   The food is like any other place you can go to, there is not much special. However, when I have come here with all my family the service has always been quick the hotplates, come out fast. We enjoy the place as my family can get quite load and the staff does not mind this. The pricing is really great as we can get several hot plates and still be under $100 sometimes, which is a big plus for me.   The food is good, the staff is surprising friendly, and the service is quick. These are the reason why I come back here. I recommend this place, at very least give it a try."}
{"text":"Food is large portion, great location just mins from my workplace. Tons of parking space. You get good deal if you order 30$ more and add 3$ you get half a chicken. One downside about this place is that they always give tons of rice but not enough of meat. I find it odd to always have rice left over at the end because I have finished all the meat. Not to mention if you order take out it's extremely fast, that is a plus."}
{"text":"Friends brought us here last night. It's a favorite of the locals because they're open late (11am to midnight everyday). Restaurant is pretty roomy and not very busy late at night during the week. We were seated quickly. If you have a large party make sure to get seated at a round table with a lazy Susan, it makes it easier to pass the serving plates from across the table. Waitress (tall, short hair, thick glasses) was loud and spoke English quickly with a thick Chinese accent. Difficult to understand at times but that's why we have fingers to point things out on the menu aha!  Our hosts ordered the following for our table: Deep fried (shrimp) wanton/dumpling (8pieces for $4.50), Deep fried squid ($8.99), Chinese broccoli with garlic ($7.99), Chicken fried rice ($6.99), Yeung Chow Fried Rice ($7.99), Cantonese style chow mein ($8.99), Deep fried half chicken ($3) and braised beef brisket in hot pot ($8.99). Food came out fast.   Deep fried (shrimp) wanton/dumpling - stuffed with shrimp but it was overcooked and chewy. Comes with a sweet dipping sauce.  Deep fried squid - this is my favorite item on the menu. Crispy edges outside and tender squid inside with yummy spices sprinkled on top.   Chinese broccoli with garlic - Pretty simple standard veggie dish. Can't really go wrong with this one. Good accompaniment with any of the dishes.  Chicken fried rice and Yeung Chow fried rice were tasty but a little too dry .  Cantonese style chow mein - noodles tasted undercooked and too hard for my liking but I liked the rest of the dish.   Deep friend chicken - Yummy with crispy skin but a bit overcooked. Warning: they serve this dish with a side of what I thought was salt but when I looked closer it had MSG crystals in it. Don't touch it if you tend to get migraines.  Braised beef brisket in hot pot - If you like meat dishes on the sweet side then you'll like this dish. Beef shreds easily but the tofu is hard and chewy.   I was generous with my rating because it's a good place to go late at night with a large party. There's no waiting in a long line, you get lots of attention from the staff because it's not crowded, they don't rush you out the door so you can enjoy the company of your friends and you don't have to keep your voice down because the staff speak loud as well. Gotta try out more things from their extensive menu. Curious about the \"fried milk\" hmmmm."}
{"text":"The food is quite good but service is rather poor. Free desert for dinner can run out."}
{"text":"$6.99 for a large container of Thai style fried rice. Pretty large portions as this lasted me 2 meals. Very good taste and flavor but could have used a bit more meat. Good value for what you get. The inside is a bit dated but still better than a bunch of other places I have visited. Service was quick as it took no more than 10 minutes to get my meal to go. It is a seafood restaurant and I did notice fish tanks. One for pet Koi's and one for actual fish that we can eat. I'm gonna have to try their seafood and other dishes one day as this place is walking distance for me."}
{"text":"Driving around Toronto got suddenly hungry and started browsing the GPS!  Then I saw a name I recalled from Yelp.com, Fairview Seafood Chinese and stopped in.  The inside looked like a cafeteria but that's OK since I wasn't looking for a romantic dining experience.  The hostess spotted me lingering at the counter and seated me right away.  I was offered a menu and the option for chopsticks or fork and spoon.  Considering my food choices I opted for fork/spoon.  After perusing the choices my selections were Corn/chicken soup, Fairview Special Fried rice, and Chili Chicken.  The server brought out a huge bowl of steaming Corn/Chicken soup.  Next the fried rice came on a platter large enough for two or three. Next came my Chili Chicken which was both Spicy Hot and temperature hot!  Just the way I like it!  Don't come unless your hungry, cause I took three containers back to the hotel with me.  Loads of food and good prices!"}
{"text":"As the other reviewers mentioned, this place is cheap, cheap, cheap! Located in the Food Basics plaza, tucked in beside a Dollarama, with (generally) enough parking to be found. I find the service to be reasonable. And the food, well above reasonable!  The waitresses tend to be friendly, and I have no language issues with them. On quiet days and with a particularly appealing soap on the TV, they may be a little inattentive, but if you call them over, they will come receive you. (Perhaps the other reviewer just had bad luck on that day? Still to throw dishes seem rather melodramatic and unnecessary on the waitress' part.)  The food is always freshly made. My favourite is their fried rice mixed with fish roe. It's probably what makes me keep coming back. I find it to be the best in Scarborough.   If you want dumpling noodles, you can receive a ginormous bowl of noodles and mixed sorts of dumplings (at least 16-20 pieces) for only $6-7. The bowl is large enough to serve a family of four or five adults. I would purchase it for their dumplings alone, because the noodles in that dish are...okay. Fresh, but only okay. (Compare that to Dumpling Restaurant at Brimley and Sheppard, where each individual bowl is $5-7 with 3-4 pieces per bowl.)  The restaurant definitely lives up to their name with \"seafood.\" All their seafood and seafood-related dishes have always had an ample amount of seafood \"pieces.\" Like their fish and tofu hotpot (one of my favourite Chinese dishes). Very good, very fresh tofu. And lots of pieces of well-cooked fish. Their shrimps are sweet and succulent, particularly if you like the dry pan-fried salted-spicy shrimp dish (this may not be the correct name of the dish).  The restaurant has a special with half deep fried chicken or chicken wings over $20-something dollars. The chicken wings are still priced for $1. The half-chicken is now priced for $3 (previously $1). It's written right on the paper place-mats.   A dollar or three isn't bad for the chicken. And, I must say, the chicken is pretty tasty. Unlike many restaurants, the oil is always fresh, and you can tell right away from the colour of the chicken's deep fried skin, which is a nice brownish-golden hue. It's crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. Incredibly good deep fried chicken. And again, for only a dollar or three! You can ask the waitress if you have hit the $20-mark, if you're having trouble (though unlikely). (No, I do not work for this restaurant.)   I'm a big fan of this place. Few restaurants have offerings like theirs. Fresh, decently cooked meat (not under-/over-cooked, which is very important!) without being stingy on the amount of meat per dish. Very well priced.   Also, I do believe they accept debit/credit nowadays though I've always paid with cash in Chinese establishments."}
{"text":"Fairview Seafood Chinese Cuisine is located right at the corner of Markham and Sheppard.   They serves congee, noodle and Cantonese Entrees dishes. The price here is really cheap.   The shrimp dumpling noodles I ordered is so sizable and it is only for $3.99! The shrimp dumplings are so huge with tons of shrimps inside. There is so much noodles, I can barely finish it!  The rice noodle with mushroom and chicken is freshly steamed ($2.99). I really enjoy that too!  Though the interior of the restaurant is really dated and not really clean. But it is a good place to get a cheap meal.  Cash only!  No Lunch Specials!  PS they have special of spending $20 before taxes and you can get a lobster for $9.99."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time for lunch and see a cockroach right beside us on the wall. Never again."}
{"text":"I am so surprised at how positive some of the reviews for this place are. Having gone to this place a couple of times, I try avoiding it as much as possible.   I recently came here for a meal with a relative. As we were ordering, my relative asked a few questions about the dish she was getting. The waitress literally sighed and gave a snappy reply. Our dishes came out quickly, and the waitress pointed out that the chef had put in a different cut of beef than what was supposed to have been there. I told her that was fine as I was hungry and just wanted to eat. She set down my food and turned around to berate the chef for supposedly giving me a more expensive cut of meat than what was supposed to have been there (this was in Cantonese and I doubt she knew I could understand).   There was more rice in both my relative and my dish than anything, with the meat portions being pretty disappointing in comparison. The curry I ordered was more watery and bland than expected, but I didn't have high hopes coming in here in the first place.   A lot of the dishes are hit and miss here. I'd rather just pay the extra bit and go to a restaurant with more consistent quality."}
