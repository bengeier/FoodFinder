{"text":"This store is really nice inside and the staff is friendly. But the prices are easily $2 per item more than what you would find at other grocery stores on this side of town. So that can really add up."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to do your grocery shopping. The staff is absolutely incredible & extremely helpful. The staff all work very hard to ensure that everyone has a pleasurable shopping experience. The store director is very friendly, approachable, informative and exceeds customer service. This store has an amazing selection of various products, and I can always find exactly what I need. The deli department is always well staffed and stocked. The meat department carries superb quality meats. The dairy department is always stocked. The checkout experience is wonderful. I would very highly recommend shopping here!"}
{"text":"I usually shop @ the Big Stores for everything. But, I go to my local Albertson's for their Sushi. Yes......SUSHI. Because it is a great value, made fresh daily and better than going to the fast food restaurant. Anyway, they ususally have a \"bento box\" which is a great value and also, their product is made FRESH daily (you can see the chef's in the back preparing the food). Today, there was no Bento Box, so....I knock on the door, the lady comes out, I ask for the Bento box, she tells me it will be coming out in a few minutes. I go around to finish my purchases, NO BENTO. So, I ask again, but this time a \"Young Chef\" comes out, I ask, SHE ANSWERS: No Bento Boxes, we are not making them today & goes back in.OK,........ HUM!!   So.....on my way out I comment to Justin (cashier) about the response recvd., he jumps into action, calls the Store manager (JOE), who greets me with a fantastic smile, takes matters into his own hands. By then I was embarrased that I had created such a fuss. The deli manager (Mary) also gets involved, we chat and I give her my impression of the events. Just wanted to ensure that the small business owner that runs this part of the Deli Dept. should be more flexible and cater to the customer. Also, you are already making the fresh food, so...........HUM!!!!!!  The end result: The Albertson's staff did a proactive response. It was a simple, normal  order request, but they treated it with great tact and sympathy. At the end, after many thanks to all of them, JOE apologized again and gave me my order on the house.   I was not expecting this generosity, GOOD KARMA works in wonderous ways. I will keep buying my sushi @ Albertson's. WELL DONE JOE,JUSTIN AND MARY.  YES, we are quick to complain, BUT NOT TODAY!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The rudest and angriest  group of people. I live next to the store and drive 5 miles out of my way to never go there again. They are over priced and very short staffed."}
{"text":"Well I changed this to a one star because after about a year of the Kosher Experience being open it has closed and now there's really no reason to go back there.  Now there's no open Kosher deli there and closed it due to lack of service."}
{"text":"Staff here is moderately pleasant but nothing special.  Ever since their most recent remodel I find it hard to locate merchandise.  I have been grocery shopping for close to thirty years and most stores have a somewhat intuitive layout that makes sense.  Not this store.  The layout is so odd.  It is the closest grocery store to my house so I frequent it fairly often."}
{"text":"It has removed self-check out lane so if you have 1 item you wait in line forever."}
{"text":"Have you ever been in a brand new grocery store?  Not remodeled, not redesigned, but built from the ground up just a few months ago?  This is a brand new Albertson's and it is stunning.  It could be a model for all grocery stores in some far future museum.  Every shelf is filled.  Every bottle is faced and on the edge.  There are no extremely high shelves.  There are no dirty floors.  The ice on the seafood is fresh.  There are no smudges on the freezer doors.  On the other hand, it is just a grocery store.  Now it does have a very impressive Kosher selection (even with signs pointing out non-Kosher items).  But the cheese and vegetable selections are not as good as Whole Foods.  There are some, but not a wide variety of gourmet items.  The bread selection is plebeian.  It's just your average every day grocery store...but beautiful."}
{"text":"Even though this store is being taken over by Haggens next week, I've always experienced great customer service. Some of the prices are actually cheaper elsewhere - if you're willing to drive an extra 10-15 miles away. This place, being in the center of so many homes is in a great location and is more of a life-line when you need to grab something quick for a BBQ or get-together.  They also have new propane tanks (outside) and Redbox (inside).  I know that all of the employees have been allowed to become Haggens employees if they choose to, so hopefully we won't lose the great staff."}
{"text":"I am amazed at the changes in Albertsons since they announced they were cutting jobs.  Their store manager Robert is working harder than ever to improve the quality of the store.  Employees like Chris, at the deli, make you want to shop their more.  She works incredibly hard and it shows!  Albertsons has surveys at the bottom of the receipt.  Their store manager has e mailed me twice and made Albertsons the store I want to shop at.  Is Albertsons the cheapest?  No.  But since Winco wants to compete with Wal-Mart, I don't want to drive 30 minutes to get what I need there.  I don't want garbage.  I would rather pay more at my Albertsons and get quality if I am treated right.  I still have to go to Whole Foods for some things, but Albertsons is adding more of the things I buy, making it easier to keep them in my neighborhood."}
