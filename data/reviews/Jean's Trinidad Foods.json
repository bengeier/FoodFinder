{"text":"Been here twice because a friend likes to socialize with the owner/cook. Both times I've been disappointed. Decor is so-so, food was so-so. Most everything is frozen and thawed as needed/ordered, only what is being cooked the day-of is fresh. I also found it to be a bit overpriced for the amount of food you get compared to other Caribbean restos I've been to.  In NDG my choice for Jamaican/Caribbean food is Ma's Place which is right across the street from Jean's.   Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Came here because of the good reviews on Google mostly and for a dire craving of granny's homemade Trini food. Not only was I extremely disappointed but also somewhat insulted that a restaurant would serve anything like this. Ordered the chicken roti.. The roti shell was sad and reheated in the microwave for so long that it began to harden and there was only about 1 tbl spoon of chicken inside not to mention the all the water oozing out, once again from reheating in the microwave. The sauces were watered down, the doubles were soggy and the worst were the beef patties courtesy of Loblaws, featuring yes, Chef Microwave again!! $50 later all I'm left with is an empty stomach and bleak hope for humanity. Please stay away. Real Trini food is not like this at all.. Not even close. Please change the way you do things or close down already Jean, spare the people. Otherwise, maybe this review will."}
{"text":"On this warm summer night, the meals from Jean's made us travel to Jamaica and Trinidad : Tried the Jamaican vegie patties and the tasty stew chicken plate with rice and plantain...  Yum!"}
{"text":"I can't imagine why there aren't more amazing reviews for this place. It is the tits. The bees knees. The cat's pajamas.  I have a Trinidadian friend, I brought her here and she said that the flavors were better than the rotis in Trinidad.  Everything tastes fresh fresh. There is a little bit of a wait, but that is because she prepares each to order. I didn't once hear that ominous beep beep of a microwave over and over that I often do at other roti places. The accompanying hot sauce and mango pickle really add for a nice touch. Her pumpkin is insanely good.  The sorrell, mauby and ginger beer are all home made and each are fantastic.   I have never been let down by anything on the menu. Ever.  The real clincher though is the woman that cooks/serves/owns the place. Even if the food wasn't up to snuff I would still want to go just to ensure she didn't go out of business because she is so sweet, attentive and pleasant.  It is a must to try in my opinion."}
{"text":"The doubles were AMAZING. The chicken roti was great, not dry at all and very packed !   Loved the food and the service here !!"}
