{"text":"Ok. WOAH. PERSONAL BUBBLE NOT EVEN A THING HERE. Good luck finding the weest of arm space even to bend and snap your elbows to bring the food to and from your mouth. I'm not an individual incognizant of my ever so minor claustrophobia, but holy geez this was more than brushing shoulders, I came into contact with a dozen more than a few derrieres and other such body parts during my brunch hour here.  My 3 friends and I were, for lack of a better word, congested, into this pee-wee fit-for-one table. We were all sort of tucked in under the table, our legs awkwardly overlapping one another's. Next level of friendship achieved at lunch? Absomundo. Might as well have been a subway during rush hour. I could smell the perfume of the girl sitting 9 tables down, which translates accurately to: an arm's length away.  The food...I had an almond croissant, brioche, banana loaf, lunch panini, and cookie. all of which, sauf maybe the croissant, were pleasant.  Though, the panini was ROCK SOLID...I'm talking crack-tooth hard., yummy nonetheless."}
{"text":"This may be the best brunch I have ever had in my life. The poached egg sandwich was excellent - along with the chocolate croissants and butter croissants. I also really enjoyed the hot chocolate drink. It uses real cacao. The staff was very friendly despite the fact that this is probably the most crowded breakfast place in town. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had an excellent salad here while exploring Montreal. The system for ordering/eating in was a bit new to me, but everything worked well, and the service was friendly and helpful. Very cute interior. Vegan sandwich option on the menu was a plus for me. The selection of baked goods, granola, and seasoned nuts to-go was extensive, and everything looked great. I'll definitely try these next time."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday, around noon, and the lineup was crazy. Thankfully, I was planning to order takeout. It only took 10 minutes at most. The hardest part was figuring my way around the line to get to the cash register to place my order. The Vegan 2.0 and the #24 are both delicious vegan options."}
{"text":"some of best food ive had in montreal. period. brunch / lunch as good as it gets in nyc where i am originally from. desserts are fabulous and this place is buzzing till 4 in the afternoon as a testament to its popularity and its located in gorgeous old port"}
{"text":"amazing paninis. amazing homemade lemonade. amazing atmosphere. really good place for brunch.  and who can beat the lovely euro feel of old montreal?"}
{"text":"On a écrit tant au sujet d'Olive + Gourmando que je doute qu'il vaille la peine d'ajouter encore un avis. En bref, ils font les meilleurs sandwichs du Vieux Montréal.   Rien que pour cela, ils méritent leurs quatre étoiles. J'en ai essayé trois jusqu'à présent : le poulet cajun (poulet épicé, avocat, mangue), le gustavo (poulet à l'ail, oignons confits, gruyère), et le cubain (jambonneau, moutard, gruyère). Tous les trois étaient sublissimes.  Mais il y a du mauvais à raconter, aussi :  - Sa popularité fait qu'il n'est pas possible d'avoir une table sans attendre au moins quinze minutes à l'heure du déjeuner. - Le resto, une fois plein, devient ultra-bruyant. - L'attente pour emporter son repas peut être assez longue ; il m'est arrivé de patienter près de dix minutes.  La concurrence des autres sandwicheries du quartier fait que les prix des sandwichs restent aux alentours de $ 10 chacun. En revanche, les salades composées et les viennoiseries sont affreusement chères. On paye, par exemple, un petit carré de gâteau de 5cm2 $ 4, et une salade d'ufs, de légumes, et de fromage $ 15.  Mais en sortant avec sa pêche, on n'est jamais déçu, même si on est devenu pauvre. C'est déjà ça."}
{"text":"Aside from the long line ups and crowded tables, it's worth coming here to eat for their superb sandwiches! If you come too late, some menus will be sold out, so be early!! Take out also available if you don't want to wait in line."}
{"text":"I really, really miss working in the area because this is my all-time favourite lunch spot. The food is to die for. Everything from the daily lunch sandwiches to the sinfully delicious chocolate-espresso brownies will have you coming back for more.   There's nearly always a lineup out the door, and the place is certainly too popular for the limited space available -- especially during lunch hour rush. It can be crowded and a long wait for takeout, and table service is a bit haphazard during busy periods. But the staff handle the crowds with a smile, and the food is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Very unusual breakfast sandwich!  Nice room, a little noisy, very busy on a Saturday morning, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Fabulous! Loved the sandwiches--had the Cubano and really enjoyed it! The wine selection is good for a cafe. The baked goods are good to à porter. The location is perfect right in the heart of Vieux-Montréal. Stop by if you're in town."}
{"text":"This place is great, I highly recommend it for breakfast. My wife and I liked it so much after the first time we went, that we returned the very next day. Great coffee, great panini's, great ricotta, great pastries - didn't find anything I didn't like."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars I would...unbelieveable ...everything was so fresh, and delicious reasonably priced, the staff was accommodating...we came on a recommendation  and so glad we did.  Fast service, clean, delicious.  If you are debating whether to go...just do it. You will not waste a meal here."}
{"text":"Outstanding bakery.  Excellent for breakfast or lunch.  Salad and  sandwich listings are a bit limited, but you are bound to find something you like.  The baked products are some of the best I have tasted.  The lines can be long on the weekend...so get there expecting to wait."}
{"text":"Really good panini, but not a lot of choices in the menu. Good place for a quick breakfast"}
{"text":"So this place was packed when we got here, so we opted just to get a pastry to go.  We had the chaussons aux pommes, mmmm good.  The apple was a little tart and not too sweet.  The pastry shell itself was delicious, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.  We wish we were able to fully enjoy what this place had to offer after having the pastry we wanted more! Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Overrated! Poor service does not compensate the food experience. Clearly more staff needed for this to ensure that you don't have to run after your waitress to get anything."}
{"text":"Cute establishment. Nice music and decor. Friendly staff. Busy for brunch on weekends. I wasn't blown away by the food here. Menu is limited. I got the tartine and it looked great but lacked flavour. My friend got the panini and it was average."}
{"text":"Extremely popular lunch spot; but didn't quite get the hype aside from the excellent pastries and lattes (this is where the 3 stars comes from).  Went here for an espresso and a chocolate brioche, both of which were awesome but then came for lunch and had the Cuban sandwich....not so awesome.  It was just really greasy with a little meat and cheese and the other sandwiches looked so much better.  The ginger tea was excellent though, and the salads looked pretty good.  It's also really pricey -- $35 for 2 sandwiches and 2 teas.  Next time I will pass on this place for lunch (or the Cuban at least) and only go here for the pastries and espresso."}
{"text":"Ordered salad of the day which was a quinoa, capsicum, corn and rocket salad. Food was beautiful and atmosphere was amazing."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Friday early afternoon for brunch and ran into quite a crowd here.  Tables are small and they refused to combine two 2-people tables for a party of three.  Instead, they insisted on squeezing in the third person on the side.  Since the tables are small to begin with, and quite cozily spaced, this was a problem because we kept getting bumped by people passing to look at the offering on the counters.  Table service was cold but the people behind the counters were very helpful and pleasant.  Everyone spoke English.    The food was good but not mind-blowing.  Also, it was overpriced for the quantity, especially things like salad.  The sandwiches, however, were very delicious and were carefully constructed using exotic and fresh ingredients.    I also really liked the focacia du jour, which they panini press and call \"pizza-style.\"  It was warm, gooey and delicious.  As a tip, order the glass of coffee instead of the cup.  It's only $.50 more but more than double the quantity."}
{"text":"Pastries here are a little bit pricy, but it definitely worth it. Best palmier and best chocolate brownie that tastes like Japanese red beans dessert. Eggs on your face panini is the best panini I've ever had! Every time I went there, I had to wait like 30 minutes. Always busy there!"}
{"text":"fantastic!   i read some great reviews on here and decided to go for breakfast. we didn't have to wait at all to get seated, and the service was really nice. you have to order your own food at a counter, which they deliver to you. i ordered the brioche with cheesecake and raspberry swirls and the turtle bar. both were equally delicious.  the decor in the place was quirky and fun, and the atmosphere was relaxed. the open windows allow for you to stare out onto the streets while you eat your food (not that i do that...) and sitting at the communal tables lets you listen in on other people's conversations (not that i do that either).  all in all, an awesome place to eat. definitely going there again."}
{"text":"Wow, worth the wait. Smaller menu but then the flavor a knock your socks off. The elixir iced tea was d lish. Yum yum"}
{"text":"It is crowded, noisy and worth it. I had the potato  chowder and hot cheese sandwich. They were both excellent. I refuse to call it grilled cheese because that doesn't do the sandwich justice. Go! Wait the line. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Was put onto this place by a waitress at liverpool house, and she was right to rave about it.  Read all the good reviews because they are all true. make sure you ask them how it works first, namely: you get a table; you order from the bar (front or back); they serve; you enjoy.  All they are really missing is some kind of terrace, cause i could sit here all day and people watch."}
{"text":"Just so happened to stumble into this place because it started to rain.  I'm enamoured with this place.  Cute, welcoming, unique decor that has a homey feel to it.  We were first seated, then advised that all the coffee/baked goods were to be ordered in the front while the back counter had all the lunch items.  We placed our order and then waited for server to bring it over to us.   I got a cafe latte, my fiance ordered bancha green and shared a raison scone.  Their small latte is about 8 ounces which is smaller than most places so it was stronger than I was expecting it to be but still enjoyed it.  The bancha tea was served in a teapot with a cup both served on a wooden platter - cute.  It was paired perfectly with the raison scone which was sweet and had a light lemon flavour to it.  I'm usually not a fan of raisons but this was good.  From the brief look at the lunch items (mostly sandwiches), they were all just under $10.   I wish I had a bigger stomach.   Note: ALL the baked goods are made in house - yummeh!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, a nice choice of lunch sandwiches, not too many so it won't take forever to choose. Raspberry Soda is delicious."}
{"text":"Best sandwich ever!   I have only been there for lunch, and even though the place is always packed, they will find a table for you within a few minutes! Overall a very good service.  The food is just incredible! It's a mix between a sandwich place and a salad bar, with the menu written in chalk on the walls. I highly recommend the cuban sandwich, but get there early because they do run out! I have never tried the coffee shop and pastries part of the café, but it looks incredible!  Because of its location and the quality of their food the prices are on the high part of the scale for a sandwich ($9), and it's widely worth it!!!  Watch out for opening hours they are closed on Sunday and Monday (which is very rare in Montréal)  I just wished they had other locations around the city!"}
{"text":"Out of all the restaurants I visited over the long weekend...Olive & Gourmando was one of my favourites. We dined here on our first day in Montreal and we ordered take-out on the last day of our trip. ;)  As we were one block away from Olive & Gourmando on Thursday morning, we could smell something delicious. By the time we reached the corner of Saint Pierre and Saint Paul, there were already a few people patiently waiting for the restaurant to open. The moment the clock struck 8, we were welcomed with smiling faces as the door swung open. With a comfy, rustic vibe and a counter filled with freshly baked goods, stepping into Olive and Gourmando first thing in the morning was delightful.  My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed the \"Poached Egg On Your Face\" Panini. Sriracha in a breakfast sandwich? Yes, please! It was a bit greasy, but delicious -- deliciously crunchy and cheesy with a bit of a kick.  I am a chocoholic, and I couldn't leave Olive & Gourmando without trying a brioche, the Brioche au Chocolat Valrhona in particular. The moment I took my first bite, I died and went to chocolate heaven... The brioche was nice and warm, soft, and VERY chocolatey! I LOVE chocolate but even I think it may be a bit too chocolatey sweet for breakfast. It worked out nicely that my boyfriend and I shared something savoury and something sweet.  Before heading back home, we stopped by Olive & Gourmando again. This time, it was right around noon and there was a bit of a line, filled with both tourists and locals, waiting to be seated. We decided to just order take-out and ended up getting five Chocolate and Banana & Chocolate brioches to bring back home. I'm not a fan of bananas, but I was told the Banana Chocolate Brioche was amazing as well.  If you are in the area, and/or you are looking for a place that offers good sandwiches and pastries, why not? It may be a little pricey, but I'm pretty certain I'll return anyway, to try their lunch menu and other pastries next time I'm in Montreal again."}
{"text":"The granola and yogurt is a great breakfast option. Perfect cappuccino and if you're feeling indulgent, try the chocolate brioche!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch. I love the salads and sandwiches. I had the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, roasted grain-fed chicken breast rubbed with cajun spices, guacamole, fresh tomatoes, and mangoes. It was delicious. I also had their salad of the day, which was equally delicious. I wish I was in town longer because I heard the breakfast and pastries are great too.    I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here.  The food is fresh and creative. The decor is adorable. It's so warm and welcoming.  Add this place to your list."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast or lunch in Old Montreal. We arrived at 1 pm on a Saturday and only had to wait about 20 minutes even though it was very crowded. It was definitely worth it!  We had mushroom mac n' cheese (delicious) and ricotta with honey (also great). We also tried a croissant, since they are supposed to be excellent, but it was a little disappointing. The service was fast and friendly and the decor was lovely.   Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who visits Montreal."}
{"text":"Simply divine!  Picturesque flower pots open window seat looking out to Old Montreal on Rue St. Paul made it five star highlight.  The entire menu delights me!  By far my favorite breakfast/brunch hot spot in Old Montreal!"}
{"text":"The food is simply AMAZING. Don't hesitate when you see the line, don't let the mass of confused tourists or the seriously rude hostess put you off. The egg panini is one of my favourite things in the city, and the daily salads are always great, different and healthy. The wine selection leaves a lot to be desired but at least they're trying!"}
{"text":"I attempted to eat here a couple times during my stay but it was packed. Finally today I walked right in, no wait! The service was quick and courteous, the food was AWESOME, cappuccino spot on. HOWEVER it wasn't until after I left the restaurant and quickly walking back to my hotel did I realize just how expensive my order was. For a grilled cheese, salad, and cappuccino, my bill totaled $37. I did the math in my head, and my order should have been $25 tops. So either they overcharged me (hence the lower rating) or I read the prices wrong on the menu (lower rating still... Way overpriced). I'm normally diligent about checking my bill and if there's a discrepancy I ask about it... I should have done that today."}
{"text":"Ok you've probably read it all about olive and gourmando but it really is worth the hype. We had the gourmando chicken sandwich and it was Devine. They sold Out of the cold sandwiches which I hear is pretty common. Expect to wait or try going an hour before closing. We got lucky and had a table right away. I had the only beer they had. It was a Canadian brew (blonde) it was very good.   Simple sandwiches make for delicious sandwiches. Nothing is overstated about this place which is probably why it's so good.   Just one of those places that live up to the hype."}
{"text":"I don't know--I've only been here once, but I  kind of feel like either this place isn't as good as it used to be or it's just not as good as people say it is. The wait was kind of insane for people in groups, but fortunately I got seated almost right away because I was by myself. I ordered the in your face panini, a cup of drip coffee, and an almond croissant. The sandwich was good and aptly named because the flavours really did punch you in the face. The spicy kick was lovely and exciting. What wasn't so lovely and exciting, though, was the coffee... And the croissant. The coffee wasn't horrible, but it wasn't awesome either. The croissant was just plain stale. I don't know if it was a day old or if the baker just didn't factor in the humidity of the air (it was raining that day), but if I come in about mid-morning for breakfast or brunch...I kind of expect a fresh, crisp, light croissant--not the sticky, stale,and quite frankly, dense roll that they brought to me. I do appreciate their wait staff, though. Their job is really hard, considering how busy it is in there."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times, mainly with friends that are visiting Montreal since it's one of those must go places (due to high rating). The paninis are great, but are they worth the 45 min+ wait? Pastries are okay, soups and salads are mediocre, the brunch menu is bad (worst chia bowl I've ever had and French toast was tasteless). Just get the sandwiches to go and eat at the park nearby."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Montreal for amazing breakfast or coffee and pastries !  Expect a line-up but it's worth the wait! Order the Cubans breakfast sandwich if you can. The Moka and latte are both amazing. The chia pudding is also DELICIOUS!! The dark chocolate banana pastry is so good - not too sweet but very flavourful.   A MUST in Montreal!"}
{"text":"This is another gem in Montreal!  My family absolutely loved the food, drinks, and service in this quaint restaurant.  I loved the variety and the flavor of each item.  Yes, the restaurant is busy and somewhat loud...for good reason!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food here is fresh and delicious, I never thought I would enjoy a veggie sandwich so much.  The trout sandwich I had here was also pretty good, and the soups and bakery items looked and smelled incredible.  The worst thing about this place is how incredibly busy it is.  It's always packed, with people waiting outside on the street since it's pretty tiny.  They also have a weird semi-table-service method where you get seated, but then order at the counter with a ticket, then a server comes out to deliver the food (eventually).  Then, you get up and pay the cashier.  I guess they don't want to shout out order numbers.  As a lunch option, it's one of the best light meals in the Old Town.  I personally liked Le Cartet better, but this place is good."}
{"text":"Winner. Had a delicious breakfast for our party of six yesterday. Standouts for us were the almond croissants and the egg panini with cheese and Sriracha--just right amount of spice to bring out flavor. Cheese croissant you can skip, but otherwise hard to go wrong here. Hip atmosphere, friendly staff and great (!) coffee. Go early or expect to wait as it gets crowded on weekend mornings. Seating better suited for parties of 1-4 rather than larger groups like ours."}
{"text":"Of course Olive & Gourmando came up in nearly every Montreal blog I came across, which explained the line outside the door on a Saturday before the restaurant opened. We came prepared for such an event, and showed up around 8:45am accordingly.  This place gets absolutely mobbed, so I wouldn't recommend coming here unless you have some patience. For the most part, the café delivered but was maybe a bit overrated. I found the pastries absolutely delicious, especially the cheese croissant. I was surprised though, how few options there were for actual breakfast dishes. There was a chia seed pudding of sorts, cheddar toast, and a few yogurt items, but I was expecting at least more than two sandwich options. I guess those items are only available for lunch.  The coffee was good, but I didn't understand why they were serving hot coffee drinks in glasses instead of porcelain mugs.... And by good I mean, about on par with any other good coffee shop in any major city - neither better nor worse. Lastly, service was good despite the restaurant being slammed. We requested the coffee be brought out at the same time as the pastries, but at two different times of us ordering each, their timing was off - it wasn't our waitresses fault though to be honest."}
{"text":"On our visit to Montreal, we stopped by this place around 3pm [during a winter storm] and it was packed to the brim. We eventually got a table and ordered the chicken/bean/cilantro/cheese soup as well as the Ginger Ice Tea, The Gustavo panini, Goat Cheese Risotto, and [a twist on the] Mac 'n' Cheese. The food was classic artisan yum, the flavours bountiful, and the presentation... earthy --- simply what the palate needed. We finished everything -- even the random sliced almond from the green salad. Worth. It."}
{"text":"Olive et Gourmando is always a great place to grab a late lunch (it gets crazy busy between 11-2) but its worth even getting take-out. The last time I was there, I ordered the cuban sandwich and the creamy cauliflower soup of the day, both were just so delicious, flawless even. Service is always fantastic. Cozy, cute, friendly and has a local feeling rather than a touristy feeling despite it being in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"As a tourist l visited after reading online reviews, we were visiting with baby on a stroller however due to cramped space in most restaurant around old port area i found it was difficult to accommodate stroller, sadly I found there is no concept of high chair here. I don't know if it means baby are not supposed to  accompany parents. So we waited for long time to get 4 seats , finally after getting seats the service guy check with his senior how to go about accommodating baby, it was a big shock to see cold face and hear raw blunt statement \"sir, you can't take stroller inside\" with no articulation and communication towards customers. Later we asked the service guy if there is high chair again he referred back to his senior lady, this time just a don't care hand wave signal to the service guy. We don't have complaint about food but about the attitude and expression towards us that left a sour taste. This would be our first and last visit in our life to this restaurant , it begs us question if they care about service and customer ? I don't recommend unless you are looking for takeaway food"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. We havent been there in 8 years but the quality and portions havent changed. Trust me when I say that the food is AMAZING ! Super busy at lunch time between 11:30am-1:30pm. It's quaint and tight but it's part of the charm.  Cubano sandwich and grilled cheese with caramelised onions were outstanding ! Big portions and the desserts were outstanding-we had the brownie extraordinaire,  the macadamia cocounut cookie and the white chocolate poppy seed cookie.  The exoerience as a whole was heavenly !   If you get the chance, please pay them a visit-worth every penny !"}
{"text":"I dont understand the big hype about this place - people waiting in line outside. The Food is nothing out of the ordinary, the portions are small for the price and the menu lacks variety."}
{"text":"As an owner of a bakery cafe my wife and always look at other cafes for ideas and inspirations. When were blown away by the simple elegance of the gourmand. The food, drink and service was top notch from start to finish.  We also ate at some of the more \"up scale\" restaurants while in Montreal (XO, etc..) and we always found ourselves looking forward to our next meal at the gourmand. The love and energy always came through with everything we ate. This place is a MUST VISIT but come early if you want to have a selection"}
{"text":"Came here because of their Yelp fame so I knew there was going to be a long wait. But I didn't expect there to be a line at the odd hour of 3:45 pm. Thankfully there are plenty of shops open nearby and a couple of galleries :)   We got the almond croissant and apple turnover from their pastries rack. They were both good but not too impressive. The almond croissant could have been more crusty. I preferred the apple over the croissant. There weren't many other options for pastries as they have already sold out of many options.   We also ordered the Cuban sandwich. Again, some of the other sandwich options have already sold out so I would come early if you want full options. The sandwich was the standout for me. The pork was so juicy and succulent and the sauce was spot on. The bread was also the perfect thickness. We split one sandwich between the two of us and it was enough to fill us up along with the pastries."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches especially the Cubain. The espresso brownies are also excellent. Worth the wait, but better if you get there before or after the lunch rush."}
{"text":"The best lunch that I have had in Montreal. The tuna sandwich is to die for. Be prepared for long lines. The blackberry crumble was a miss..."}
{"text":"I guess I am the only one who is not a big fan of that place. It's always packed, the two times I went the staff was a bit condescending like I was in a very high end place and should almost be amazingly thankfull for being here!  Very big hipster place to be. food was really normal but since the reviews are so good I can only imagine I did not order the best things on the menu..."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The in your face pannini is to die for. Second time here and I'll definitely be coming back. Great food great service and great atmosphere! Worth the wait"}
{"text":"My visit to this cafe made my summer trip to Montreal complete. I couldn't stop going back the atmosphere was so soft and lighthearted yet perfect service, the floor mgr was funny cool and sweet.... I love the breakfast menu... try everything its so worth going here if your anywhere close to old town Montreal"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a weekday and of course the place was packed. While there was a daunting line for takeout orders, the service was very fast and efficient and I was out in less than 10 minutes with my order. The cajun chicken sandwich was really tasty - and although it was a bit pricey at ~$12, the portion size was very generous."}
{"text":"Lovely staff served fresh homemade pastries and breakfast panini. We returned the next morning!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was very pleasant, and the wait time was reasonable. We both liked the paninis we had ordered. I had the Pomme and was a nice balance of smoky bacon and sweet apple.  Will go here again. Try the chocolate brioche!"}
{"text":"Every pastry we had was delicious, especially the spicy cornbread pastry and croissant. If I lived in Montreal, would go here again and again to try all their baked goods."}
{"text":"Such great food and it's all made in house! It's busy for good reason :) the almond croissants especially, are to die for."}
{"text":"We came across this and it was a gem of a find. Great atmosphere. The menu is great and very unique and the food was so delicious. We had the chicken salad with the \"salty \" ricotta and soup. So good."}
{"text":"Das Lokal liegt in der Altstadt an einer guten Ecke. Die Fenster lassen sich weit öffnen, so dass man das Gefühl hat, draußen zu sitzen.  Obwohl es als Bistro und Café erscheint wird man vom Service platziert was ich persönlich sehr angenehm empfinde.  Das zahlreiche Personal ist freundlich, schnell und aufmerksam. Leider war das vegane Sandwich aus aber unsere Kellnerin hatte eine gut Empfehlung als Alternative parat.  Mein Begleiter hatte das Panini mit gegrilltem Käse, das groß und ausreichend war und sich gut zum teilen eignet, falls der Hunger nicht so groß ist.  Ich hatte die Tagessuppe mit einem kleinen Salat. Lecker und frisch. Oft schmeckt Rote Beete Suppe zu erdig. Diese hier war köstlich. Tee gibt es lose und in der Kanne, was für mich als Teetrinkerin ein wichtiges Kriterium ist und bei mir automatisch zur vollen Punktzahl führt. Die Auswahl lässt nicht zu wünschen übrig.  Sehr empfehlenswerte Location wo man zwar etwas mehr als üblich zahlt dafür ist es frisch, schmackhaft und einzigartig."}
{"text":"Heavy snow makes this small country-style even more cozy and desirable. Large chalk written \"homemade\" declares the motto of this shop, homy and friendly. At the same time, the house is bustling with people and action -- while every possible seat has been assigned, the long line still extends outside the door. Well, not really a place for lazy afternoon thoughts and talks.   Now we come to the food.   The famous almond croissant is a bit overrated for me as it lacks the puffy crispiness of a good croissant. The not so puffy layers are further thickened by sweet filling--the taste is ok, but it takes away the airiness. I would not recommend unless you enjoy more chewy croissant.   The brownie is definitely a winner. Soft chocolate in between tenderly baked brownie crust, yet you don't really feel the layers because they melt in the month with the perfect blend of cocoa-sharpness and sweetness.   The white chocolate biscuit is good but not impressive. I like that it's not too sweet and the white chocolate chips really suited the snowy weather visually. Latte is also pretty nice, but hot chocolate is not as rich as I'd love it to be. And it was not well mixed maybe because the kitchen gets too busy.   As for the poached egg panini, it would be perfect if the bread was not so crusty. The filling is an interesting melt of egg-base mixed with a variety of veggies and spices, giving rich taste that varies with every bite. I especially like the creativity in having separated egg white and egg yolk and using them as the bases of the filling, thus creating a changing and complex flavor, maybe that's why it is called \"poached egg over your face,\" saving the trouble of beating the egg with quite good result."}
{"text":"Bit over hyped, the staff isn't bad but not very friendly either. Not kid friendly and menu choices are limited but having said that we weren't disappointed with our orders nor were we overly excited"}
{"text":"As everyone says, this place is just busy non stop. The lady seating people (the manager?) is so smug, it's as if she is doing you a huge favour for seating you. Don't you dare asking for a table for 6....but the worse thing you could do is ask for a high chair. She will laugh at your face. The 2 stars are for the lovely server with the Cedric tatoo and the food was good! But definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I very happily stumbled upon Olive et Gourmando as I was walking through the Old Port.  Its humble facade does not nearly do justice to the goodness inside.    I was promptly seated at the counter near a lovely open window filled with fresh herb, tomato and pepper plants that no doubt are used in their dishes.   They serve various sweet and savoury breads, along with hot and cold panini and several delicious looking salads.  I had Le Cubain panini (a typical Cuban) and the apple salad that was to die for!  Oh, the humanity!  I love that they brought me a whole bottle (branded as such) de l'eau. I find that when I dine alone, those things are usually reserved.  I also had the chocolate brownie which had huge chunks of chocolate in it.  It was good, but not the best I've ever had.    The food was good, the atmosphere was fantastic and the staff was very helpful even though I was only able to speak rudimentary French!    Note: OeG takes cash or debit ONLY, but they nicely tell you that before they seat you."}
{"text":"Yesterday I visited this nice (and always crowded) joint for brunch again. I'd been there before and enjoyed excellent baked goods, but nothing that out of the ordinary. Yesterday, though, I tried the \"poached egg on you face panini.\"  Dear god. It was the best. Grilled bread, thinly sliced very spicy pork, poached egg, chopped and mixed with spicy mayo. If you order this, you will experience happiness on a whole new level. Guaranteed."}
{"text":"The croissants and pastries are amazing. I was there around 9:30 on a weekday morning and the plain croissants were already sold-out. Hence, I ended up trying an almond croissant. It was absolutely divine. By the time we finished eating, even the filled croissants were sold-out. It's like a taste of Europe right in the heart of Old Montreal. All of their breads and pastries are very high quality and very European. I wish there was a place like this in every city.  I would definitely go out of my way to go there again on my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"While there were many good reviews, I found my experience to be lacking, if not slightly comical.  For me the confusion lied with the line to pay the bill. This line consisted of people buying food from the bakery and people waiting to pay for their meals. There were two women taking money, one was the cashier and the other presumably baking and dealing with payment at the same time. The people in front of me were being helped by one cashier so I moved to the next one. This is where the stereotypical French/English Canadian culture clash began. The malevolent little baker yelled at me to get to the end of the line. A little confused I returned to my spot in line. She then yelled at me a second time, 'sir these men have paid!', pointing at the men behind me in line. 'They've paid?' I repeated, totally confused. 'Yes, they paid!' She yelled, clearly losing any patience she had with an ignorant line cutting anglophone. I looked at the man behind me who was as confused as I was. I looked at her with what I can only assume was a stupid look on my face and said 'sooo...'. She mockingly made a stupid face back at me and just stared at me. It began to dawn on me that she meant that the men had YET to pay. The man behind me told her that I had been in front of him the whole time. To which she responded that I could stay in line if the man behind me said it was alright. For some odd reason I felt the urge to apologize to the man behind me. He laughed and said her behaviour was unbelievable. I finally was afforded the privilege to pay her and she threw the change in to my hand without looking at me. I exited onto the street somewhat baffled and embarrassed. The food was good if not a little pricey, but not good enough to be treated in such a manner."}
{"text":"On y est allé pour le brunch et mon choix s'est porté sur la tartine. Excellent ! À se rouler par terre !"}
{"text":"I used to love this place until today gave me a so-so experience this time. The coffee was sour (tasted like it was reheated, not that it was very bold), and the waiter didn't really seem to care, saying it was very bold. They didn't have the salad/ricotta cheese with olive oil and pine nuts anymore, gave me an alternative that wasn't the same sadly. Anyway, it was crammed (as usual) but seating 3 people at the small square table is just... My parents complained about the saltiness and oiliness of the food. It's not like I won't come back, but has qualtiy changed?"}
{"text":"located at the old town of Montreal  but not in the touristic area with all its bad cafes and restaurants. It is an aesthetic place for having coffee or a snack. Feels a little bit like in Paris. Very good food and pastry. Nice relaxed people, few tourists- always crowded. Attentive and charming service crew."}
{"text":"Tasty breakfast and quick service! I had yogurt and granola with fresh fruit one day and it was refreshing and delicious. My husband had a Cuban and he said it was really good.   We returned a second time in our trip, I ordered the grilled cheese and my husband the Miami I believe. The sandwiches are very large probably enough to share! A little greasy for my liking, but overall it was good."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are to die for. Ingredients that you wouldn't normally think mix well are like symphonies of flavour in your mouth. Get there earlier in the day because they run out of sandwiches and there are less choices to pick from."}
{"text":"Thanks for one of the best salads in a long long time!! I had the 'Big healthy salad remixed' and I'm still thinking about it three months later...."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  It has one of the absolute best breakfast sandwiches ever - crispy bread with a zesty spread, prosciutto, melted cheese, eggs, etc.  Amazing I tell you.  I highly recommend the homemade ricotta with toast.  And the baked goods - oh my, they are superb.  The scone is fruity, perfectly crumbly, stellar.  The apple turnover is a solid choice.  The chocolate croissant is delicious (maybe not as perfectly flaky as can be - but the creamy chocolate interior is outstanding).    I assure you that this place is stunningly good."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches I've ever had. The smoked trout sandwich is to die for! I've also tried the Vegan 2.0, the chicken Habibi, and the chicken cajun and they are also delicious.  Restaurant is always very crowded, so expect a wait, but the wait is soooooo worth it.  By the way you can get half portions of sandwiches."}
{"text":"Totally worth the hype. I live a few blocks away, and regularly wait in the dense line of tourists in the depth of winter. Hands-down the best breakfast sandwich I had in my life."}
{"text":"Keep in mind that I am a) a New Yorker and b)a bodybuilder.  Now don't get me wrong, if you are a fat American from the midwest, or if you're just a fatty in general, you will probably really like this place.  However, if you like me, and expect a bit of service along with some protein in the morning, then avoid this place at all costs. I only have negatives for this place . . .let me count them out, from minor to major: 1.  Long wait for this place even early in the morning, probably because early in the morning it's one of the few places that actually serves breakfast/brunch before 11.  This is actually a smart move by the owners and other places may want to consider following suite.  2.  It's crowded and loud.  I realize this is a personal preference, but if I want a loud, crowded restaurant I'll just stay in New York.  3.  Extremely limited brunch menu.  Besides pastries, there are only 5 things you can order. 5. That's it.  No extras or sides either.  4.  Now you might think that one of those options would contain a smidge of protein, you know, like eggs or something.  Oh how wrong you are.  They should rename this place carb city. There are small traces of protein, but it's far outweighed by sugar or fat.  Some examples: a. Chia seed pudding. This sounds healthy right?  Too bad they smother the chia seed pudding in jam then make it even more calorically dense and unhealthy by adding Muesli. b. Cuban sandwich.  Or their version of it.  Which is basically just cheese and a smidge of egg in between two thick pieces of bread.  5. Now none of this would have mattered if not for this.  When I saw the options available to me I asked if they could add an extra egg to the Cuban sandwich.  To my surprise, they couldn't.  Seriously guys you can't add one damn egg to my order? Hell you could have cracked the egg open in a cup and given it to me uncooked.  That would have netted you an extra star for the effort.  TLDR; totally overrrated place with limited options, no protein options, and no ability to make substitutions."}
{"text":"I loved the pouched egg panini but it is a bit salty. I also ordered the yogurt with fruit and it was a good balance.  Coffee is amazing !!  Waitresses are super friendly and the place has a cozy feeling."}
{"text":"Amazing! Delicious pastries fresh baked. We had the chocolate brioche and almond croissant. Perfect breakfast (or at any time of the day)!"}
{"text":"We got there for lunch at 4pm on Friday.  The place was packed even though they close at 5pm!  The place has a great vibe... loved it!  The food was excellent.  We got the Cubain Hot Panini and Cream of Squash soup.  Yummm!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The food was simple and fresh, the atmosphere was nice, and the service was great. Would defiantly recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered and paid for 3 sandwiches and bakery items to go.  When I came back to my place, I found they had put only one of the 3 sandwiches in the bag.  I know I should have checked but they should have made sure to get the order right.  I'd expect this at McDonald's drive through, but not where they charge so much per sandwich."}
{"text":"i'm not sure if it was a time of year when the city empties out, but walking around montreal i noticed that there were so many restaurants that were absolutely empty or outright closed. to my surprise olive was packed and we actually had to wait a bit to be seated. rather than being annoyed, i knew we were in for a good lunch. i wasn't disappointed. the cuban sandwich was excellent and really hit the spot. the bread was perfectly crispy and the cheese was pure melted goodness.   the vanilla strawberry lemonade was surprisingly refreshing and the latte kept me happy as we walked along artist alley on a chilly day."}
{"text":"Everything is usually great. Especially their OG grilled cheese panini with homemade ketchup, the chia bowl, the truffle mac n cheese, their #24 salad and the Big green salad. Also, never forget to try the LATTESSSSSS! Nevertheless, I'm taking off a star because I always have to wait such a long time and the space to wait is so crowded. Also, the tables themselves are very tight!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast at the recommendation of our hotel concierge, and can't say I was disappointed. The service was great, even in the morning rush. Our server even took the time to chat with my friends and I to recommend places to see during our  weekend in Montreal. I absolutely fell in love with the apricot coconut & white chocolate brioche. The place itself was comfortable and rustic - felt like we were in  France. Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Visited Montreal for the long weekend and had a great lunch here. The line was crazy long but well worth the wait. Food is delicious and staff are attentive. They can easily accommodate gluten free. Their soup of the day was amazing. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Yuck! There were so many wasps everywhere. My husband and I went here this morning for pastries and coffee. I stopped eating my pastry when I noticed how many wasps were hovering near the ceiling, crawling all over the windows, etc. And now seeing pictures here on Yelp that people took of the wasps crawling all over the pastries makes me shudder.   Other than that, we didn't have to wait in line (it's a Wednesday morning), but it was noisy and crowded, the pastries weren't even very good, and the coffee was mediocre. I'm surprised this place has such good reviews!"}
{"text":"I grabbed food here on the way to the airport after a meeting in Montreal a couple of years ago.  It was pricey, but service was fast and the food was unbeatable.  My only \"complaint\" is that, like so many other places in Montreal, everybody switches effortlessly between French and English and makes me feel lame for only knowing one language."}
{"text":"You will never find a better mocha. Ever. Nice place for celebrity spotting too in the summer."}
{"text":"Their \"Poached egg on your face\" panini (a hint of sriracha sauce, though optional) is excellent and quite a change from your normal breakfast."}
{"text":"Great truffle mac and cheese and cubano. A little pricey, especially for the drinks and the beer.   Overall great experience.  Also, tax essentially comes to 15 percent and can appear to look like tip. Tip in Montreal is a little lower than in the states at 15 percent tip."}
{"text":"We loved this place. Excellent food, great coffee, and their Earl Gray tea was very aromatic (by Camilla Senesis). We had breakfast and lunch. They make it, people eat and then it's gone - so if you want to try down thing - be there early or it may be gone by the time you decide to roll in. Mt wife and I would certainly come and eat there again when we are back in Montreal and we will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Love their paninis!! Love the decor, sometimes it is too busy, but very good for a light lunch when it is really good weather outside."}
{"text":"What a beautiful, cozy place! The food is delicious; the salads and sandwiches are always my choice and the pastry are just perfect for my usual cappuccino! I love the vibe of the place; the moment you take your seat at the table, the day becomes better, surrounded with those beautiful smells of coffee and toasted bread and muffins :) The service is perfect, it always comes with a smile and with the answers and suggestions you need!"}
{"text":"gotta say it: it's super cute in here. super busy, but turnover is pretty quick. breakfast was super good. we got the \"poached egg in your face\" panini, a plain croissant, and toast with jam and butter. the toast was toast, but the raspberry jam was yum. i really liked my croissant - it wasnt crazy buttery, the inside was soft and chewy and the outside was nice and crispy. the panini was great, especially for someone who likes savory breakfast - salty but not toooo salty with the speck, the sriracha adds a good dab of heat, and the tomatoes round it out. nom."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here 3 or 4 times and have loved it each time.  My first impressions were that the food is overpriced, the wait is too long, and the place is too crowded.  That however was before I tasted the food.  In short, this place delivers every time.  Our last visit (Labor Day weekend 2013) was delightful as always.  In addition to the standards of the terrific sandwiches and salads, they had a cold cucumber and dill soup that was outstanding and epitomized the restaurant's commitment to flavor and freshness.  Also, the pastries are of course top notch and the staff members are very pleasant.  The only critique I have is for the coffee.  The long espressos I have ordered were a little sour and underwhelming.  I am pretty sure this place is in all the American guidebooks b/c my friends who have visited Montreal have all gone here as well (independent of a recommendation from me) and most everyone we observe on the weekends appear to be tourists.  Nonetheless, my wife and I typically make OG the very first place we visit when we arrive in Montreal.  As others have mentioned, not open on Sunday and Monday."}
{"text":"Olivia & G has been recommended by a number of friends who visited Montreal and no disappointment here. Salad and sandwiches were fantastic and coffee was perfect."}
{"text":"Olive and Gourmando was recommended to me by *many* people before my vacation to Montreal. These people apparently know me well.   The decor is right up my alley, a little Anthropologie store, a little cheeky, rustic, and with a hint of luxe. I read the Yelp reviews, so I knew the about the line system and that this place would crazy busy on weekends. We decided to come on a Tuesday to avoid the insanity and we devised a strategy to have breakfast and lunch, with only one trip. It worked perfectly.   We were seated within about two minutes of arriving, we did not wait in the check out line to be seated. We each got a latte and a pastry. I had the chocolate brioche and the boyfriend had the banana nut \"muffin.\" It was more like a loaf. The lattes were lovely, great flavor, the right amount of creaminess, but if I could do it again I would get a large, the small was smaller than I expected. The chocolate brioche was divine, though it was a lot of sugar for breakfast. I couldn't stop eating it though. I tried the boyfriend's muffin and it was also great, huge whole walnuts on top to add a nice crunch and nuttiness and the banana flavor was wonderful and it was quite moist.   We decided to take sandwiches to go since we were bike sharing to Parc Jean-Drapeau afterwords and had heard such wonderful things about the sandwiches. We asked our server how best to order, since we no longer had a paper with our table number on it. He asked us which ones we wanted and took care of it for us. I got the eggplant and mozzarella one and the boyfriend got the Cuban. They were both delicious, even over an hour later and having been strapped into the front of a Bixi. I will say that mine was great, but his was better. I'm delighted we got to do both the pastries and sandwiches, it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from Toronto. Had excellent food. Each item was delicious. Being a vegetarian in Montreal is not an easy task. But we had excellent vegetarian lunch. They tend to run out of few meals. Still excellent food and service."}
{"text":"First time visiting Montreal and heard lots of good things about the paninis here. Got there around 10:15am and it was pretty busy. Was just the two of us so there was no wait. Service was attentive and courteous. We were there before the lunch menu was out so we settled for the \"Poached egg on your face\" panini. Spicy poached eggs with herbs and mayo, Comte cheese, speck and slow roasted tomatoes. It was probably the best panini I've ever had. Super crispy crust, gooey cheese and all the flavours went very well together. Definitely a must-visit!"}
{"text":"Je me suis présentée enceinte de 7 mois et avec un bébé dans une poussette un jeudi à 13h15 pour manger. On a préféré donner la seule table qui restait à deux dames qui sont arrivés après moi. On m'a spécifié que c'était difficile de recevoir une poussette et que je pouvais attendre dans le vestibule qu'une table se libère. Après 5 minutes à attendre debout, habillée de la tête aux pieds, je suis partie en me disant que ce n'était vraiment pas un endroit accueillant.  Définitivement un endroit à éviter si vous avez des enfants. De plus, ils n'ont pas de chaises hautes."}
{"text":"From the ratings to the many reviews on here, it's as good as it gets so I won't repeat the others, but a few of my own tips and observations:  Let me preface that I was just visiting Montreal for the weekend, first time in the city.  I came here essentially to get that Eggs In Yo Face (I'm sure you know what I mean) breakfast sandwich.  Note: The place currently opens at 9 am (on Saturdays).  From reading blogs, it suggested we get there at 8:30, we arrived at 8:40 to a closed restaurant. We walked around and came back at 9:04 and already there was a line. Luckily we managed to snag some seats at the high table though so definitely come early, this place is as popular as they say!   I asked if I could get the sandwich without cheese - DENIED.  Said the cheese was already pre-mixed into the eggs.  I decided to chance it. I've hated cheese my entire life, I've become quite adept at picking out cheese from food.  And glad I did, because all I had to do was open the sandwich and not eat the side on which the cheese was melted. The rest was delicious and cheese free (uhm...but this also means the cheese could have easily been left out but....whatever).    I asked for a knife and fork from a passing waitress (crucial tools in my cheese extraction)...who reluctantly gave them to me with this request: \"please be careful of the plates when  using the knife and fork, the plates scratch easily and can also break if you press too hard\" - uhm. really? I need to be careful of breaking plates.....at a restaurant.....with my utensils?  Sounds like someone bought some useless plates. They were very pretty though.  So why 5 stars for a place that refused me to go cheeseless and warns you of heavy utensil use? Cuz the food is delicious! Really, go and get the sandwich. I miss it already. Also the vibe is great. Lovely cozy spot perfect for breakfast to fuel you up for a day of sightseeing. Also, our main server (male) was great, super nice and friendly and overall we had a great meal.   Approx $70 Canadian (including tip) for 2 sandwiches, 1 fruit bowl, 1 pastry, 2 coffees and 2 very fresh squeezed orange juice for a party of 3."}
{"text":"Near-perfect. The setup is unique, ordering your way through what is Montreal's most unique gourmet cafeteria. The food is divine - tons for the vegetable lover, sandwich aficionado, or soup slurper. Prices range, but you don't have to be loaded to eat there. Perfect to run into on a cold Montreal day, for a pastry and a coffee - or a warm meal. Rush hours will see a line form, probably worth up to a 15 minute wait....unless you're freezing and it's winter...in which case, find a coffee shop and wait it out there!"}
{"text":"I was here a very long time ago but all I remember is the coffee was great and the cookies were gooey. (the desserts are delicious - I recommend going straight for dessert) A staple of Montreal charm, nuzzled in the heart of old Montreal! Go for lunch or  pick up some food and have a picnic in the area."}
{"text":"It was very busy, but two of us were able to get in pretty quickly around 1pm on a Tuesday. The restaurant itself is very comfortable with bar and table seating and a large, delicious looking pastry selection. I had the #24 salad and LOVED it. I would definitely order it again and I rarely order salads. The waitstaff was a little short with us, but honestly, it kept everything moving during such a busy time."}
{"text":"While this looks like a total tourist trap (with tourists overflowing onto the sidewalk), it also had a lot of locals.  It was worth the wait and provided a super yummy, filling lunch.  All of their salads looked great, and my friend loved her's and the soup (and she's QUITE picky).  I had the goat cheese with caramelized onions.  Bought a couple of pastry to have for breakfast the next day.  How to order/pay was a bit confusing, but other than that it was a very satisfying experience!"}
{"text":"I love this place. At first, it will seem intimidating. There are lineups, the ordering system is bizarre. But after everything it is worth it. And the service is actually quite good!   I've only ever eaten their sandwiches- they make an absolutely delish egg sandwich that is usually all sold out by 11:30 am.  Failing this, I get their Cuban- which is salty and tangy in just the right combo. Cheese melting over the sides and savoury ham inside. Crispy, not too thick panini style bread.   Coffees are just right.  Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"I love this place, fresh bakery every day, great coffee, if you're in the Old Montreal you should go for lunch, but go early, the place is pack at lunch time."}
{"text":"Wow ! Bel endroit ! On y trouve une variété impressionnante de produits du terroir d'ici et d'europe :-)"}
{"text":"We happened to stumble upon this little gem while walking on a brisk day in old Montreal. The space was packed which we thought was a good sign. When we wet to order our food it became apparent why- this casual bakery and cafe had wonderful food and desserts to die for- the double chocolate and pecan cookie was amazing! If you want a quaint space to have lunch with fresh ingredients or a delicious pastry and coffee then you should go here."}
{"text":"Great little brunch spot - lots of creative brunch items and delicious baked goods.   Coffee was not so great but everything else spot on. Ambiance is lovely, great little tourist spot to eat. Pretty pricey, but that's what you get in Old Port."}
{"text":"Food isn't bad but it's overrated. Service can be curt at times.  It can get crowded quite easily and the parking situation is terrible."}
{"text":"Je suis une vraie fan de ce resto! Parfait pour le lunch du samedi! Oui, il faut attendre mais ça vaut le coup une fois assis."}
{"text":"We've only been here once but I still daydream about the sweet ricotta and egg panini which were absolutely amazing!   However, I did feel that the pastries were nothing special. My husband and I had a chocolate croissant and banana brioche and felt they are nowhere near as good as other bakeries. But given that the breakfast specials were so good, perhaps we need to try the pastries a second time in case we just got a bad batch? :)"}
{"text":"Easily the best place in the Old Port to get a fantastic lunch. Their only downfall is they sometimes get ingredient happy and add one too many ideas into their soups, but the food is always interesting. Their Cubano sandwich is excellent! And all their baked treats and goodies are completely yummy."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ate paninis here for a late lunch on a Saturday. This place was bumping but we only had to wait for approximately 15 minutes. The Paninis were delicious and unique - lots of great flavor. For the price point and location this is a great spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely great food and service. I got the 'poached egg on your face' panini along with my 2 of my friends and it was one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. One of my friends also had the homemade ricotta and honey with toast and she said it was some of the best she'd ever had. My only complaint is that they don't sell their amazing green tea in bulk but that only means I will have to stock up next time I'm there (if they decide to sell it). I will definitely be coming back whenever I'm in Montréal again."}
{"text":"Based on our lunch experience here.  Service, the staff are very helpful, came by to remove dishes, ask for opinions and refills of drinks promptly.  No issues here.  Decor/atmosphere, the place is nicely decorated but don't come here with a large group.  It seems like the ideal size is 2-3, 4 is okay but harder and any group that is 5 or more will likely have a long wait.  Food, the food was okay.  I personally don't see why the reviews are so good, but it may just be a personal preference and that we had waited for over half an hour for a table and my expectations weren't met due to the wait.  Price, we ordered a sandwich for about $12 and a green salad for $6.  The salad seems like a good size but the sandwich was a bit of a disappointment for me at $12.  I wouldn't make my way out to come here again nor would it be a place that I would suggest to friends if they asked (the food was okay, nothing amazing as I have read)."}
{"text":"Passed by this place twice on our recent trip. Both times, decided to grab a coffee and pastry to-go instead of waiting 30 minutes for a table.  Large room with charming decor in Old Montreal. Always packed on the few times we were there. Seems to have a great following, and after taking our first bite the danish, we know know why.  Great Americano and Dirty Chai. We tried the Almond Croissant, Chocolate Croissant and Blue Berry Danish. All items ordered were delicious.  We will make a bigger effort to eat in for lunch the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"What can I say? This restaurant is one of my favorite restaurants, not just in Montreal, but all over the world. The richness of the taste you get is unbelievable. You won't believe it till you try it. I was searching for good breakfast places around me and found this then went to it and had to wait for over 30 minutes, and it was absolutely worth it. You need to try their summer garden salad or summer green salad, I can't recall and their Cajun chicken sandwich. The service is great as well. Just go early and get your name on the waiting list."}
{"text":"Very nice cafe. Was hungry for a dessert and a coffee for pickup.  Everything tasted grate. Only downside is that the place is super busy and loud."}
{"text":"TREAT YO SELF. This place is worth the $$$  AMAZING food. I was in Montreal for a total of 24 hrs & this place was recommended to me by a friend. I do not speak French. At. All. The waiter was so patient with me & did his best to explain the specials of the day. He ended up just simplifying the day's soup to \"chicken noodle soup\" & also recommended one of the sandwiches.   I felt so bad after. The soup was amazinggggg it did not deserve to be simplified to a mere chicken noodle soup & for that I'm so sorry. It was so good. The sandwich was such a large portion & so great, I had half & saved the other half for later. I ate it cold on the train later, and let me tell you something... when a sandwich that is loaded with cheese still tastes great cold, it really speaks to how yummy it is when it's served hot, straight from the kitchen.   It's also located in old Montreal, which is such a great place to walk around & take in the old architecture. COMPLETELY 100% recommend!!"}
{"text":"A cozy breakfast cafe, although it is famous for the panini they do not serve it in the morning. It is worth giving a try. The brioche and the egg panini goes very well with the strong aromatic latte."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, but brunch is just OK, considering the hype and the line. Pastries though we're excellent!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!! The food... The location.... Everything is unreal. Although they always change the soup and salad the flavours with never disappoint.  I had the tomato soup and it was so perfect.  Try the Cajun chicken cold sandwich or the grilled cheese hot panini both are amazing"}
{"text":"Love this place!!...The panini's were super delicious ; I expected more from their capacinno's though; but Love Love Love the paninis !!  Perfect breakfast and lunch spot!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS BREAKFAST FOOD especially for vegetarians. Must try these dishes! The garlic flavour lingered for a while but that's ok. The peaches in the sale were super fresh. The only thing with the dining was that I had to wait an hour and a half but it was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  We went there during a Saturday on a loon weekend holiday, labour day. And as expected from other reviews there was a line up. I gave my phone number and booked a table for three. The host promised to call when table became available. The wait time was approx 60 mins. But I got a call under 45 mins. Got a nice cozy table inside. great interior with plants and open windows for a hot summer day.   I ordered Cha-Cha-Chia bowl, it was fabulous. The presentation was great, taste was great and quantity was just more than enough. At my table we also had Poached egg on your face and French Toast. Both were tasting great and were very filling.   We had regular coffee, dirty chai and iced team lemonade.   I would go there again.  There is just one washroom and there is always someone in there :P"}
{"text":"Delicious food, cool atmosphere. We happened to be there for lunch on a Saturday, which was terrible timing as there was a long wait. Fortunately, the food was worth the wait. All three people in our group enjoyed our meals. Many people were doing take out, which had the same menu as dine-in, so if you are short on time that may be a good option. The Rasberry Lime lemonade was popular. I had the smoked trout salmon, very large portion and fresh ingredients. Unfortunately we were all too full to try the dessert, strawberry shortcake, but it looked delicious as well. I would definitely recommend this place and stop by again the next time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"A fun, quirky spot in the old town.  A delicious sandwich menu, but my favorite is the  baked truffle mac and cheese.  A fun spot to grab a coffee and a bite while sight-seeing."}
{"text":"Great vegan options! Will come back again soon. Maybe tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"Fabulous lunch and well worth the wait! Adorable setting, delicious food, great service. Loved the summer salad, Mom loved the ricotta salad, and sister raved about her panini. Don't miss it."}
{"text":"Que dire? Dans une vue d'ensemble, nous sommes repartis avec la joie et le plaisir d'avoir découvert un endroit magnifique. Dans le détail, notre choix de plats était lui aussi enthousiasmant. Une seule réserve tout de même. Notre proposition d'ouvrir un établissement équivalent à Genève n'a pas reçu, à ce jour, d'écho favorable... La porte reste ouverte!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place to have breakfast. Great atmosphere. I got the egg on your face panini; It had a spicy siracha kick to it which was perfect! The service was on point. Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Pastries here are to die for. Don't go on evenings because you'll hit a closed store. If you go on lunch time, be patient: the lineup can be long but it's worth the wait. Sandwiches are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Oh my God, where do I event start?  This place is a gem with frequent celebrity sitings! The food is fresh, top quality, perfectly cooked. I had the some of the best food I've ever had at this place. You must visit - the reviews are right!"}
{"text":"Just met the rudest, most arrogant cashier I have ever encountered at Olive et Gourmando. When leaving I was told very forcefully and rudely that I had to return to my seat and wait for a bill. When I reminded her that she was in a service industry, that she could not order me to do anything and it was her problem if the waiter had not given me a bill by the time I wanted to leave, she continued to insist that the only way I could pay was to do as I was told. Finally managed to pay. Will never return, even though it is just around the corner from where I live and the food is quite good. Experience completely ruined by one employee."}
{"text":"We came across this place while touring old Montreal. The panini is great and a warm atmosphere. The service is excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly staff. The Reuben sandwich was the best panini I've ever had.  I also managed to drop over $200 on the floor as I was paying and one of the staff ran after me in the snow for a few blocks to return it."}
{"text":"Cute little spot in the Old Port. Absolutely lovely, very European with tons of french pastries and good coffee. I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Montreal or even to locals."}
{"text":"NOT family-friendly and tacky condiment tactics  Our party of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids ages 9 and 12) arrived at a time when all the tables were full so we patiently waited.  2  tables for 2, separated literally by a one-inch gap, became available at the same time 10 mins later.  Rather than seat us at those tables, the host seated 2 couples who had arrived 10 mins after us.  When I politely asked why he hadn't just split our family and seated us side-by-side so we could order on 2 bills, he shrugged it off and told us that we'd have to wait for the table of 4 (which actually was only a table meant for 2, with 4 chairs squeezed around it).  So we had to wait an extra 15 mins. to be seated.  I was very annoyed and wanted to walk our family out but my husband really wanted to try this place out.  The granola fruit parfaits were admittedly decent.  One child asked for jam for her croissant and they said it would cost an extra $1.25.  Our other ordered the hot dog and naturally asked for ketchup--incredulously they said it would cost an extra $1.75 for their \"homemade\" ketchup but they made a point of saying 3 times that they were waiving it, like they were doing us a huge favor.  Even my husband, who was until then trying hard to be understanding of their seating policy, was amazed.  Really??   I've never heard of such a thing for condiments that typically are included for free, but I guess this cash grab is a first for everything.  We half-joked that we'd be slapped with an upcharge when my husband asked for extra napkins.   Our family are extensive travelers and this is the first time I've ever felt implored enough to write a review on a dining experience.  The blatant lack of respect that I felt our family received, coupled with the tacky condiment issues, made this a poor experience overall."}
{"text":"my panini tasted better cold later than warm at the restaurant.  the salad was better than expected but nothing special."}
{"text":"They were so unpleasant seating us that we simply walked out. Went across the street for a great breakfast at the Portuguese place."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are fantastic, but the service can be hit or miss and the place is very packed a lot of the time."}
{"text":"This restaurant is super cute and the food and drinks were delicious!  Even though the place was packed we were seated pretty quickly and the staff was very attentive and friendly, even during our wait for a table.  Everything here is made from scratch and we were all happy with our food and beverage choices.  I would definitely recommend sharing a panini (big enough for 2 people) and a pastry item like their chocolate brioche.   The Latté was perfect and beautiful."}
{"text":"didnt know this place can be sooooo crowded! well it was late morning brunch time so... i really like the decor and the food presentations/ platings. the pastries looks & smells really good. i had a Cuban sandwich which was perfect for that rainy morning! lots of cheese nom nom nom.. the panini was grilled to perfect, crunchy on the outside and hot n soft on the inside. my friend had a crab salad sandwich which looks refreshing & good tasting as well ;)  staff were helpful and service were fairly fast even when this place was packed with ppl.  highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tried the poached egg in my face panini.  Very good overall and great tasting. The quantity of ingredients was just perfect.  Took is linger to find parking then to devour thus yummy goodness.  Next time I am in the city,  will have to try their pastries"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended to me. I was visiting Montreal for the first time, and I was told that this cafe had the best coffee and baked goods. There was an off-hand mention of the \"beautiful but ill-tempered\" employees but I glossed over it.   MISTAKE.  We arrived and were seated promptly. Upon attempting to order, we discovered they were out of nearly everything we wanted. It was around 11am, and they told us they were out of coffee and the first two sandwiches I tried to order. I work as a waitress in a restaurant. I understand that it is not the fault of the waiters that items run out. However, the rude, irritated attitude of the waiter was uncalled for. If your menu is only 10-12 items long and 2 of them are sold out, you should tell people before they survey the menu. Or apologize for the inconvenience. I tried to order a third sandwich modified without mushroom, which I was told was not possible. I ended up ordering the vegan sandwich.  The sandwich was excellent.  That being said, the overall experience was so poor that I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. There are plenty of other restaurants in Montreal with exceptional food and good service."}
{"text":"Skip the line and just order to go. A table for 4 on a saturday morning can take over an hour. Luckily it was a nice day so my gf and i grabbed their chicken sandwich to go with our coffee and ate while exploring Old Port. The sandwich was so good! The mango with the guac can make such a nice pair"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Great atmosphere.  Excellent food, cute server.  Famous little spot in Old Montreal :)"}
{"text":"This place is top- notch. We thought it looked cute when we passed by one evening after it closed, so we decided to check it out for lunch. I'm so glad we did. It was probably the most memorable lunch of the trip. I liked that they ran out of the salad we wanted to order because they make everything fresh. It's a restaurant that takes pride in its quality, even if that means they can only make a small quantity of some items. The house charcuterie plate is fabulous. Can't recommend enough."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place in old Montreal! It's a little small so be prepared to wait.  We really enjoyed the brioche there and poached egg panini."}
{"text":"Went here for a light breakfast & coffee. Chia bowl was big and filling. Also got the yogurt bowl which was good. This place gets super busy on the weekends. The coffee was good & so are the pastries."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. Service was great, food was fantastic and place had a fun vibe. Desert was fabulous."}
{"text":"I have been here now for lunch twice, and I am always grateful to make the trek to Old Montreal.  The space is great, the coffee/hot cocoa/tea are amazing, and I love their sandwiches. I got the Herbivore salad last time, and it was also great.  Plus their desserts are quite nice.    It is super busy, so expect to wait, but the service is friendly considering."}
{"text":"More touristy than locals, but the panini's are good.   Servers are attentive and pleasant. Nice vibe inside, although very crowded.  I would come here is there is no line, otherwise may not be worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great food and lovely selection. I love how they put up all the bread so you can see what they have. Great environment and because your in Montreal they have French menus, but don't worry they have them in English too."}
{"text":"I'm one of those annoying vegans and I love this place. The atmosphere is really great. On-trend, inviting, youthful but also really classic. My dad introduced me to this place (embarrassingly enough) - it's populated by both in-the-know older folks and cool looking younger people. I guess that doesn't really matter in terms of reviewing the food, but just to give an idea of what the place is like! I really enjoyed the hand-drawn chalk board menu.   Service is prompt and on occasion sassy, but in an enjoyable way.   The food I've had here has always been excellent - I've had both soups and salads. Very thoughtfully constructed food with a very pleasing balance of flavour and texture. I haven't tried the pastries, since I don't believe any of them are vegan friendly, which is such a shame because they look delicious. Regardless I'm just ecstatic I can eat vegan stuff here but also bring friends here who are meat-eaters in the mood for some meat.   Good lattes also! They have soy milk as an option.  Only one bathroom, which is a little awkward, so there's usually a lineup. Speaking of line-ups - I've never had to wait less than 45 minutes to be seated here, so keep that in mind if you're looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Was here last spring.  Will be back to Montreal, because of this place!  Went here twice, for the short four-day stay at Montreal. Would like to try all the sandwiches, soups and hot beverages.  You will like the mocha! Very friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Food is soooo tasty.  It is very crowded though and they run out of their tasty food.  Which speaks more to the quality of the food.  Staff are friendly but expect lineups to get in, and to pay.  And you might not get the menu item you want if they run out but everything else is great on the menu anyways.  We ate pastries, scobe, croissant, goat cheese sandwich, green salad and latte.  All great. Also god location close to all the art galleries in old Montreal."}
{"text":"This is a very busy bakery so if you want to dine in, you have to come really early. Because of the wait time to dine in, I ended buying some pastries to go. The cheese, butter and almond croissant were really good. However the prices are on the higher end, about $5 for a croissant."}
{"text":"We tried grilled cheese panini and Cuban panini both were awesome..  we went on holiday so it was super crowded...  dark hot chocolate was okay but raspberry lemonade was perfecto"}
{"text":"Depuis le temps que j'entends parler de l'endroit, il était grand temps que j'y aille! Je comprends maintenant tous ces gens en amour avec Olives + Gourmando!  Ce petit endroit à mi-chemin entre un café et un restaurant offre des merveilles autant au niveau des plats (sandwichs froids, sandwichs chauds, salades, soupes, etc.) que des breuvages (délicieux cafés, limonade maison, thés glacés divers, ...) ou des viennoiseries (brioches aux bananes & chocolat, brownies, chocolatines, etc.). C'est bien simple, j'aurais voulu avoir assez faim pour pouvoir dîner encore et encore!   Mes coups de coeur: le thé glacé noir, le thé glacé vert, leur soupe du jour (crème de tomates et fines herbes) et leur sandwich froid à la truite.   Le personnel est souriant et l'endroit est chaleureux et sans prétentions.   Mise en garde: on est bien, on mange bien, on commande encore et encore sans faire attention et la facture monte vite... comptez entre 15 et 35$ pour un repas tout dépendant de ce que vous prenez."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible hot chocolate. Place is well known for their baked goods, and I expected drinks to be good, as well. They were not, and it was disappointing. Two stars because food was ok."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Delicious food!! Cute interior. Wait times are pretty crazy for big tables but if you are a table of 2, you should be ok. Waitress said it is very busy 7 days a week so get their early! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food!!!! And excellent atmosphere.  Everything is made In house - the pistachio muffin is to die for. The only drawback is that they will not do any substitutions - even for kids"}
{"text":"I was too full to eat a sandwich, which made me quite sad because I had read so many rave reviews about the Poached Egg sandwich and the Cuban. I had to limit myself to the Elixir and an almond croissant. The Elixir was light and refreshing but packed lots of flavor. It's a drink that you sip on, due to the tangy ginger. I've had many bad ginger drinks lately and am relieved that I finally found one that did it justice. The almond croissant wasn't impressive...it probably would have been better if they served it toasted. I've had much better ones in SF. Much, much better. However, I loved the ambiance here and even chatted with a stranger across the table.  The only downfall here was that 2 of the staff gave me some attitude for not knowing I had to get a table first before ordering. Some patience and a smile for an out-of-towner would have been nice."}
{"text":"super ambiance. option vegan. toilettes propres. toujours achalande."}
{"text":"Super belle ambiance et super service excellent pour un petit dîner vite d'affaire ou entre amis, le tout est A-1 !!"}
{"text":"I went there for my lunch and had a hot panini with cheese and pork. It was very delicious and the best panini I have ever had. It is not cheap, $13+tax, for just a panini/sandwich, but I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great food! Busy, but that's a good sign especially when the rest of the street was slow."}
{"text":"great stuff! the almond croissant was delish and the coffee really good. make sure to try the scones. It a busy place but worth it!"}
{"text":"Five star lunch place. Packed at 2:30 pm. Had the Cubain based on a prior review and it was great. Was buttery and stayed hot for the entire meal. In old Montreal district. Interestingly had 1 beer on the menu. As in only 1. Wasn't a bad thing, just letting you know their approach."}
{"text":"This place has gotten so much good press it was on the list of must dos for my Montréal vacation. This is a charming, bustling, but small space. Our party of two checked in and were given an estimate of 30 minutes to be seated and within 5, we were led to our counter seats along the long bar which runs in front of the open French windows. I don't usually like counter seating but this let us be in a less busy corner of the restaurant and in a prime spot for people watching.   The chocolate brioche was delicious and nicely sized. It was the cold smoked trout panini, though, that was the standout. A white flour grilled bread shaped like a pita but with a moister and more pleasantly rubbery texture was split and stuffed with the trout spread, herbed cream cheese, and a mound of fresh crisp spinach. It was one of those meals that you still think about well after you've eaten it!   Highly recommended. Get the window tables!"}
{"text":"Vraiment très délicieux ! Je donne quatre étoiles dû à un léger problème d'accommodement mais ça s'est réglé assez rapidement. Le service est bon, malgré le resto hyper occupé. Nous avons apprécié le service d'appel pour nous aviser de l'heure d'entrée. Je ne sais pas si nous allons retourner manger à une table chez O&G car vraiment c'est l'horreur d'attendre aussi longtemps (c'est aussi très bruyant). Mais si c'est votre première fois, ça vaut vraiment la peine d'attendre pour une table pour au moins l'essayer une fois."}
{"text":"This small cafe has the best sandwiches and cookies in town! All the waiters are very helpful and friendly and the atmosphere is cheerful."}
{"text":"Wonderful Lunch!   I stopped in with my family on a rainy day. While we had to wait about 10 min, it was worth it. My dad is still dreaming about the soup that we had. My sandwich, the grilled cheese, was ooey and gooey. I had a few bites of my dad's Turn up the Beet salad and that was also wonderful. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Stopped in around 2pm on a Saturday. This place was hopping! 35min wait for a table. Luckily those that don't want to wait can either order take out, or you can purchase their bakery items.   Latte was amazing, panini was fantastic! Service was very polite and quick.   Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious! We got there five minutes after it opened but there was still a long wait. We ordered the \"pouched egg on your face\" panini, oeuf coquette, almond croissant, maple pecan brioche, a latte, and an ice coffee. The panini is large but the first bite is amazing. The cheese mixes beautifully with the other herbs and sauces they have in the panini. It's a bit on the hearty and heavier side. The coquette was just as delicious but lighter. The almond croissant and brioche was the best I've ever had. The croissant was flaky, light, and just the right amount of sweetness. The brioche was light, fluffy, and chewy without being doughy. The service was wonderful. Everything was great and I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a breakfast, brunch, bake goods place in Montreal."}
{"text":"Attempted to eat here on Thursday, July 21 at around 1 pm.  All tables were full with nobody waiting.  We were told by the hostess (tall, slightly curly short black hair; medium plus build) that we would have to wait around 10 minutes and that we were next.  After approximately 5 minutes, a couple walked in and were greeted warmly by the hostess in french (we speak only english) and were immediately given a table.  When the hostess returned, we asked her why they were seated before us if we were next.  She stated that they were waiting before us.  They were not.  She was extremely brusque and aggressive in her response.  The attitude was overflowing.   This led us to a few possible conclusions: 1.  she knew them personally  2.  they were given preferential treatment because they spoke french 3.  the restaurant has become drunk with success and no longer feel that civil customer service is part of their business model. It seems a shame, given the food looked pretty good."}
{"text":"One word: go. Typically I don't like taking travel book recos, but Olive & Gourmando seemed to rank high on all the main sites like Fodor's. (Normally I'm a Lonely Planet or Rough Guide user for comparison.) This is THE breakfast, brunch and lunch place in Vieux Montreal, so be prepared to wait, although you can get takeaway coffee and pastries while you do so. Small eclectic interior with close tables makes for a cozy experience. We had Le Cubian and \"poached egg on your face\" sandwiches; both great however I felt the winner with the latter egg sandwich--mildly spicy and so flavorful! Surprisingly the coffee was just okay; we had traditional so would recommend trying their espresso selections. Appreciated that most things on the menu are locally and organically grown. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Got sandwiches to go. Had the chicken sandwich. It was excellent with chicken, guacamole, tomato and mango on wonderful bread. Took them to the park for a picnic. Line was very long for tables but moved smoothly to order food and to pay."}
{"text":"Best breakfast/brunch I ever had. Super quality and very delicious. The \"poached egg on my face\" panini is to die for, full of flavor and has a nice spicy kick that's not too spicy.  Will definitely come back here again!!"}
{"text":"very good bakery and sandwiches, very nice place. service was ok."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic bakery and if I was just rating the baked goods, I would give it 5 stars. The croissants and brioche items are awesome, but I was very disappointed that they were unwilling to accommodate my dietary restrictions. Thus, the low rating. I am lactose intolerant and ordered their breakfast panini which comes with melted cheese. When I asked if that ingredient could be omitted, the server said the sandwiches were pre-made and they could not remove it. This really didn't make sense to me since they were pressed to order. Additionally, their menus say at the bottom \"tell us if they need to be aware of any dietary restrictions\", leading us to believe they were willing to accommodate. Weird, right?  Oh well, the coffee was very good, but we won't be back. I'm sure there are other spots that can take cheese off a sandwich and put their guests first."}
{"text":"I am usually the type of person that orders eggs for breakfast but opted for the chia dish. Loved it, lots of flavors and textures.  The coffee was good and the baked goods too.  Opens at 9am, if you come after 9:30-9:45 you may have to wait for a table"}
{"text":"Good fresh and interesting sandwiches (trout was very good), salads, soups.  In a comfortable cafe.  I'd definitely go back even if I hadn't tried the sea salt turtle bar which earned a star on its own."}
{"text":"Simply amazing!  The wonderful vegan selection was delectable. The service and atmosphere were charming."}
{"text":"Superbe cadre, superbe ambiance et tip top bouffe ! Les sandwichs sont un régal, les plats et les desserts aussi sans oublier le mac n' cheese, inédit, j'en rêve parfois... Tout est cohérent dans ce petit resto qui se veut granola branché. La bouffe, le service, l'ambiance et le cadre en fait un must du vieux port que je vante sans regrets. En vrai fan, malgré le bruit, le \"tasse-toi je veux ta place\" à certains pics de la journée, la fraicheur des produits, le mariage des gôuts (pourtant que du simple...) et l'énergie qui s'en dégage nous pousse à revenir. Je le recommande fortement !!!"}
{"text":"Everything Olive & Gourmando makes is good! Their sandwiches are just so good, especially the Cuban one. Good selection of tea and sweets too! If you happen to go for brunch on the weekend, try to get there when they open, so you don't have to wait. It gets really busy, but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"We had lunch here 3 of our 4 days - always crowded, and everything we ate was delicious. Great room, friendly staff.  Exceptional dishes: The '24' salad, the ricotta 'salty' salad, the vegan burger, the white chocolate cookie with lemon and poppy seeds, the palmier..."}
{"text":"My breakfast at Olive & Gourmando blew me away. I ordered the strawberry and rhubarb french toast. I tend to be pretty traditional about classic dishes - if a dish varies quite a bit from the classic I think it should be called something else. When I first saw my french toast I started to panic because it was a huge, thick slab of bread and it was covered in what looked like granola. I was skeptical. However, it was absolutely delicious. I usually hate nuts in sweets, but the nut crumble totally worked. I would compare the yogurt topping to creme fraiche and using that instead of whipped cream was very clever."}
{"text":"It is very delicious, just too much waiting.but it is worth. especially pure cheese sandwiches, full of fragrance.."}
{"text":"Worth the line up. This is a pretty small cafe so a wait is pretty much guaranteed(especially if its on a weekend). However unlike kazu, you'll usually be seated in less than 20 mins.    I tried the cuban panini while my friends both had the cajun chicken sandwich. I was told the cuban panini is a must try at olive and gourmando so i wanted to see what the fuss was all about. The waiter was extremely nice despite how busy the restaurant is and repeated fill up our water. The food also came within reasonable time, or maybe we were just too busy catching up. Boy, was the panini good. The cheese, the pork, the lime and chipotle all came together perfectly. DEFINITELY WORTH THE HYPE. I was told that my friend's sandwiches were also both excellent. The portion is extremely generous, although i didn't hesitate to finish it all in one sitting.    Great place to catch up over brunch, and bonus ? a nice walk around old port after the meal."}
{"text":"Even the local Montrealins love this place!!  AMAZING food, fast courteous service, and fun bistro atmosphere.  My husband spent our honeymoon in Montreal and as world travelers and food snob(speaking of myself), I had high expectations of the foodie city. After two weeks, many meals, and some home cooked, Olive and Gourmando was my FAVORITE meal and bistro!  Let me start off by saying the night we ventured in, a sewer main broke a block away thus shutting off the bistros water supply. In mid chaos, any reasonable human would understand to be greeted by a frazzled and short host. Contrary to that, the manager calmly explained the situation and offered to let us stay for a Sandwich. We had been walking all day and needed to use the toilet (which of course was out of order due to the water shut off.) We decided to come back for lunch two days later.  And that may have been our best decision the whole trip! I ordered a cappuccino and a simple bowl of tomato soup. Let me start with the cappuccino. If you've read my other reviews, I'm a coffee snob. I am appreciative and polite but, I will not drink a bad coffee. This espresso was dark and smooth! To add some twinkle to my good impression I saw the barista \"testing\" the machine making sure the espresso tasted exactly how it should.  The tomato soup was both rich in texture and flavor, creamy and fresh! It was topped with a feta, parsley pesto.  SO GOOD! Just the bowl of soup was filling enough and packed with warm cozy flavor.  My husband got a Rueben panini. Again, the best Reuben I have every tasted-and I happen to not be big on meat! It was perfectly balanced between salty and savory, piping hot filled with gooey cheese and fresh crisp home made bread. Yum! Of course, it doesn't help that these are all fresh ingredients as its Montreal, practically France!  We took dessert to go to enjoy later on our travels. As someone who lived in Italy, I fond memories of chocolate filled brioche. :) Either I was brought back to a state of ecstasy, or it really was the best Chocolatey Parisian pastry I've eaten. The only con I have was I shared it with my husband.   I really do enjoy this bistro and will say one last thing- they are very welcoming to tourists. So put on your best French, our at least a big smile with your English and go eat some amazing food."}
{"text":"Went in expecting amazingness based on the reviews. And I did love that you could order food to take out so it got 4 stars for that. The service was also great. The food was okay. Nothing memorable. Maybe it's that I'm Hispanic and have had amazing Cubans, like really amazing, shredded roasted pork instead of deli meat pork on a Cuban. The sauce they use on it was really delicious. So the sandwich was overall okay. The coffee and almond croissant was also good, but once again not memorable."}
{"text":"This resto is a cute hybrid between a cafe and lunch spot but it is always PACKED so be prepared to wait a bit or you risk getting hangry. The baked goods and food is overall above average but I thought perhaps not worth the prices they charge. I would come back for a quick bite to go and skip the line up."}
{"text":"Wait is a bit long, crowded seating and waiting area. But pastries and coffee are great. Grade A ingredients with high quality sugar in the cookies and brioche, not too sweet (doesn't give you a rush, but slowly builds after each bite).  'Mr Miami' panini was a great combo of flavors that also gradually builds up. Even better when adding the applesauce (that is served on the side) into the sandwich. Recommend you dip the sandwich in the beet soup (was soup of the day).  Beet soup was good on its own also.   Too bad it's so crowded."}
{"text":"If you're willing to wait, the food is always on point! Wait times are worse during peak hours or nice days. Yummy brunch and lunch fares. Awesome almond croissant! If it's busy you can still grab takeout!"}
{"text":"Un excellent café-bistro du Vieux-Montreal ! Pour dîner, les files d'attentes sont parfois longue, idéalement, prennes pour apporter et manger sur l'une des tables de pic-nic du vieux-port !"}
{"text":"Tried the cuban and the healtny salad both were great. Long line ups but got seated quickly."}
{"text":"Wrong timing! Came on a Monday morning but should have checked that they don't serve brunch type meals during weekdays. A bit of a bummer because I found their regular morning menu a bit on the light side (mostly pastries, only one egg sandwich, and a yogurt bowl). My group was super hungry for more than pastries and was an hour shy of their fuller lunch menu as well but after about a 30 min wait, we still wanted to give this place a fair shot. We tried the spicy egg sandwich (which was good but if you are a punk for spicy stay away), their cheese croissant (amazing), and a hazelnut chocolate banana roll (also amazing). Hoping that I can catch this place at a different time next time I visit Montreal but you can tell their food is quality. I would definitely go again but maybe for brunch and with an understanding that I would probably have to wait a bit."}
{"text":"Mmm... everything looked so good! This place was so charming, and the food was pretty decently portioned and yummy. I got the vegan sandwich, which was tasty, if not completely memorable. I think there was a bit of a wait, but it wasn't too bad - I can see why everyone likes it here!"}
{"text":"place was small. wait time was 30-45 min , so we ended up just ordering a few pastries. food was excellent."}
{"text":"The best coffee shop in old port and downtown area. If you don't have time to go to cafe Olympico, try this.   Gets very crowded at lunch time and has very weird business hours so check before coming. Interesting spot for a flash date or just coffee and croissants in the morning."}
{"text":"Love the lunch here. While it's usually crowded, I've always been able to get a table for 1 right away. Upon my most recent visit I enjoyed the savory ricotta with homemade bread and a delicious broccoli rabe salad with pine nuts, currents, lemon zest and grated parmesan. Additionally, I had a glass of one of the best (microbrew) beers of my life! It was a wonderfully flavorful beer but still on the light side. My server was kind enough to bring out a bottle so I could take a photo. On my way out, I grabbed some baked goods to go. I highly recommend the super- chocolatey cookies, and the sticky buns although I really don't think you can go wrong. This restaurant isn't cheap, but the quality of the food is top notch, and so are the drinks. If you're looking to treat yourself to a nice meal while in the old port, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Last day in Montreal and I wish I came here sooner! Olive & Gourmando has awesome selection of pastries. We had chocolate croissant, almond croissant, and a brioche. The brioche had apple, chai, and caramel. The brioche reminded me of a cinnamon roll but with apples in it. Both croissant was crunch on the outside and soft in the inside. I enjoyed the chocolate croissant the most. I also ordered a Flat white and a latte. The drinks were okay. They also have breakfast but I only got takeout on their pastries and loved it!"}
{"text":"Great food. Cozy and comfy atmosphere. The wait line is super line but worth it. Will go back!"}
{"text":"got almond croissant & cajun sandwich...ehhh..not impress with the rating."}
{"text":"We visited during non peak hours, it was around 1-2pm so we easily grabbed a table with no problems. Cute little place, great energy and nice staff. The Cuban panini was killer and the shrimp and crab salad hit the spot! A bit pricey for what you get but the quality is there."}
{"text":"Delicious, fun and a good respite from wandering during the day. Would love to try more food here, by don't forget to get a few pastries on the way out the door!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for pastries and coffee before heading over to the conference center. They were both great. I had the blueberry biscuit and almond croissant. The biscuit was amazing. The service at the counter was great and quick."}
{"text":"Olive et Gourmando is a cozy little cafe that is on the outskirts of the Old Town. It is decorated in a very inviting yet casual way that makes you want to sit there for hours. It is old-fashioned in a way that it has gourmet food on display everywhere, but there is something rustic yet modern that instills trust in me - so I don't have to order something safe on the menu (like the other old town restos).  It is sorta split into two with a coffee station and a sandwich station. You sit down at a table which has a little flag with a number, and then when you order, you tell them what number you have. I have had the Cubain there which I think is a Cuban sandwich and has nothing to do with Kurt Cobain. The sandwich here is a pressed sandwich or hot panini with ham, braised pork and gruyere. Very tasty. It is not the biggest sandwich and doesn't come with a side. It makes up for it small size in flavor. My friend ordered a Cesar Salad with chicken which she said was good, although there were only two pieces of chicken in the salad.  The food is visually appealing to the point you could have a photo session with it, and so did a man sitting behind my friend. He staggered his bread pieces around his soup (I think it was), and then spent half and hour shooting it.  We tried going today at around 4pm on a sunday and it was closed. So you might want to check the opening hours before heading here!"}
{"text":"I really love that place, perfect for a nice lunch break when strolling in the old port. Quality ingredients, finesse in the preparation, not too overpriced, and cutest decoration. Only down side is the line, which can't be helped in Montreal's top gourmet restaurants."}
{"text":"Go early for they do run out of their most popular offerings. A must have is their one of a kind incredible yogurt and fruit bowl, packed with fresh fruit shaved fresh coconut and crunchy granola. Then move on to their perfect buttery croissant and blueberry tart combined with a large mug of coffee makes for the perfect start to your day!"}
{"text":"Yum, still dreaming about the tofu hummus sandwich... If it came with a small side salade it would be a 5*, but very good casual place."}
{"text":"My friend took me here when I went to visit him this weekend.  It was a bit of a wait but it was so worth it!  First, I love love love the atmosphere. Very homey and rustic. Very cute!!! Even though the place was packed, I didn't feel claustrophobic at all.  I ordered the raspberry lemonade because I'm a huge fan of lemonade and it was delicious! We started off with the almond croissants that my friend adamantly insisted that we order. I told him that I wasn't a fan of almond croissants and he said to me \"it's because you haven't tried the ones from here.\" And he was right. I have to admit that the almond croissants were the best that I've had so far.  We both ordered the Cubain hot panini because who doesn't love paninis? I ordered mine with the southwest tomato soup. Both the panini and the soup were amazing. The panini was divine and the tomato soup was probably one of the best that i have ever tasted! I would definitely go back again!!!"}
{"text":"One of my all time brunch favourites in Montreal. There is always a wait to get a table, so we typically get on the waiting list then buy some little snack and take out from their counter and people watch outside. The flavours of nearly every item on the menu have been worth the inconvenience of the wait every single time so far"}
{"text":"This is a very popular breakfast/brunch place. They also make very good pastries. The almond croissant is very good and I recommend you try it.  We ordered the panini and the vegan burger. I thought the panini was like most panini's nothing too special, but their bread was good.  The burger was huge and I had to push down on it so that I am able to eat it. The burger was ok, I've had better seasoned vegan burgers.  I ordered a cappuccino, this was very well made and was delicious. The foam was thick and creamy. The coffee was also very good.  Great place to get a pastry or have breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"one of the best brunch places i have tried out in Montreal. both the service and food are great, situated in the old port, it is easier to navigate to the tourist attractions too, especially nice in the summer  i really like the bakeries there, sometimes i would walk there from work during lunch time to grab a muffin or tart"}
{"text":"Quel belle découverte un brunch bien garnie des sandwiches a plus finir grand choix de sucré avec un bon latte c parfait"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place unique for breakfast and chose this quaint, corner restaurant bustling with locals. A forty five minute wait as we strolled the nearby streets of the old city was worth it. The granola, fruit and yogurt dish was refreshing and quite tasty. The almond croissant was incredible. For a crowded Saturday morning, the service was friendly, courteous and our server Tauran made our visit special."}
{"text":"O&G has made what must be the greatest breakfast sandwich of all time.  (It's the \"Poached Egg on Your Face\" panini.). My spouse still votes the breakfast sandwich from Provisions in Woodstock, New York as the best we have ever had on our travels...   but I disagree.  Go have this for breakfast before they change the menu!"}
{"text":"Always fabulous . Great food and great ambiance . They are now open extended hours and that is wonderful . The down side is the wait can be long and it is expensive . Once in, you might be part of a crowded madhouse .Their incredible cookies are $4 each and frankly these are the only cookies I would pay that much for ."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE  Walking in, there were pastries and coffee at the front and seats in the back for a sit down meal. We got there quite late, circa 245 pm, and found that there was still a 45 minute wait. This cozy little spot is notorious for a wait, but it was well worth it.   FOOD   The only disappointing thing was how much had sold out by then! All the cold sandwiches I wanted to try were out. Alas, I took a deep breath and decided upon having a chicken kale caesar salad. Boy was it tasty! And THAT BREAD. So delish. Next time I'm in, I'd like to make it earlier to try one of the sandwiches. And if you don't have the luxury of time, do yourself a solid and get a croissant and/or a few pastries for the road.  OVERALL  Coming back the next time I'm in town. Such a cute spot and I'm determined to get a sandwich next time around!"}
{"text":"This place is expensive.  we had half a smoked trout sandwich that was awesomeness smashed between two burnt pieces of bread. if they bread wasnt so burnt by the fool who grilled it the sandwich would have been much more satisfying as i do not enjoy eating charred carbon that causes GI cancer.  we also got the bell pepper soup which was cold, and refreshing.  the almond croissant was alright, not too heavy with mild almond flavors, the plain croissant was also nothing extra-special  the couscous salad was rather interesting and something i would recommend trying, as it was fresh and the feta cheese and gave it a sharp edge like ow !  only problem i had with this place was that its quite expensive for what you get. all i ordered above, if i were to eat myself id still be hungry."}
{"text":"Such a cool experience. Friendly staff and awesome atmosphere. The food is definitely to die for! The lemonade is awesome and their The Mr. Miami panini is delicious!"}
{"text":"It was our favorite place for lunch, and breakfast during our stay in Montreal. I recommend getting the food to go, and going to old port to eat. The place gets pretty crowded, and wait is a bit long to sit inside. Everything here is great, but I highly recommend poached egg sandwich, chocolate brioche, cubain, smoked trout, and cajun chicken."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to go there and try their delicious bakeries. But the moment the server got me the table and taken my order after brought the food, then later when I asked her for the bill right away, she started to feel unpleasant. I felt that the food, their pastries, and service were alright nothing that special that as stated on yelp or trip advisor."}
{"text":"4.5 stars and 400+ reviews (in Canada!!) - this place HAD to be mind-blowing, right?? Umm.. Well.. It was good but I think there's at least a tiny bit of hype associated with it. We were told it would be a 20 min wait for lunch. In other circumstances I might've thought twice but this was O+G.. 20 mins was a blessing. Anyway, after about 25 mins, we were seated and my expectations were sky high at this point if that wasn't already obvious. I got what might be the most expensive thing on the menu - the Mac and cheese at about $19 while my husband got a chicken sandwich. Once our food arrived (tastefully plated in a rustic cafe way), I realized I was going to have to reset my expectation here. Mac and cheese was good but not $19 good. It came with a salad and that was fine too but again $19?? I thought my husband's chicken sandwich was better. Overall, the ambience of the place is very hipsterish but you are also seated shoulder to shoulder. I would probably give this a miss if I was visiting Montreal again given the number of other options in this foodie-town."}
{"text":"We decided to have brunch here as part of our first visit to Montréal and the food was so good we visited again the next day. We LOVED the poached egg panini (SO GOOD) and truffle mac and cheese.  On our second visit, we got the mac and cheese (awesome again) and the oeuf coquette. We didn't like the coquette as much, but if you might love it if you like minestrone soup (the flavour is kinda similar). Oh, we also tried the orange juice. It's so SO fresh here. Fantastic fresh squeezed OJ (pulp-heavy which I love).  Wait time was 20 minutes 11am on a Saturday, a little longer Sunday afternoon. Service was great both times. We will definitely come again next time we visit Montréal."}
{"text":"J'adore ce café...quand je réussis à avoir une table! Victime de sa popularité, il faut s'armer de patience pour y manger et ce peu importe l'heure de la journée. Mais on oublie l'attente après la première gorgée de café ou la première bouchée dans l'un de leurs délicieux sandwichs. Un incontournable du Vieux Montréal. Essayez leur chai latte ou leur café americano et leur sandwich Viva La Vegan qui saura séduire même les carnivores!"}
{"text":"1. The Wait We arrived at 11 am on a Saturday morning. There was a line that was out the door when we arrived and the place was packed. We were told the wait was at least 15 min, I think we were seated in 5 - sweet!  2. The Order After reviewing the fairly short menu, it was time to order. Poached eggs pls? We're sold out. Some OJ pls? We're also sold out. This was disappointing because what kind of breakfast places runs out of eggs and oranges? I didn't have the heart to show my disappointment as the waiter was accommodating and quickly got us the lunch menu as we didn't find anything else we really felt like ordering on the breakfast menu.   3. The Food I end up ordering the Cubain panini from the lunch menu and the regular green salad as they didn't offer side salads.   The salad for $7 was worth it. It was a nice portion for $7 - all fresh ingredients. They've got their own twist on this salad though, there are some fairly strong smelling herbs that make up a good portion of the salad. Unfortunately, I couldn't identify them as something I'm familiar with. There were some almonds, but other than that, it's a pretty no frills salad which was what I was looking for.   The Cubain panini tasted great and comes in a fairly large portion. Great flavours and sauce! Is this going to be the best panini you've had in your life? Probably not, but it's darn good and up there.   Lastly, my friend go the banana chocolate brioche to go which is supposedly their most famous pastry. We ended up eating this a little later in the afternoon, it tasted nice and chocolatey, but as far as the banana taste goes, we couldn't really find it. Perhaps it was just too much chocolate.   4. The Drink No OJ right? So I order the \"elixir\" some sort of green tea + ginger + ?one last thing I can't remember? Well seeing that I can't remember the last ingredient means I didn't taste it. In fact, I'm pretty sure I didn't taste any ginger either. As far as green teas go, there was a strong green tea taste. Overall, I felt completely ripped off by this drink even though it only cost $4.50."}
{"text":"Very tasty, although the toasted bread hurt my tongue a little bit which is always the case... but still a must try, love the marinated onions"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I was there years ago but still remember how quaint and cozy and warming this place was.   The service was super friendly and the food was on par. I'm planning on going back next year and this is my first stop when I go back."}
{"text":"A must! This place has a great vibe and amazing food! It put my Shazam to work, their music selection is awesome which sets the mood for a good dining experience.  I came too late for the cold sandwiches but the OG panini and Ricotta salad was on point! I'll be sure to come back for the other popular menu items.  It's also close to the Basilica so if you visit, fill up and walk 5 mins to one of Montreal's top attractions!"}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp and were NOT disappointed. There was a wait, lots of people... well worth it! Food was yummy, music was awesome and service was above par!"}
{"text":"Une file impressionnante devant cet établissement très achalandé, mais le service reste attentif. Je dirais que j'ai trouvé la cuisine fraîche et créative. Un endroit à tester absolument si vous aimez sortir des recettes \"classiques\" ! J'ai opté pour la ricotta aux zestes d'orange, miel et sel de mer. Ce fut un délice, surtout avec des toasts de pain artisanal en guise d'accompagnement ! Un gros OUI, mais peut-être pas pour tout le monde."}
{"text":"What a wonderful cute delicious place!! The ambiance is lovely, the service so polite and friendly and the pastries are SO GOOD!! The almond croissant was amazing and the chocolate banana brioche was incredible.  Delicious bowl of fresh fruit!! Very happy after eating here!!"}
{"text":"After a 30 minute wait for a table for two, my sister and I enjoyed a wonderful lunch here. We don't speak French but gathered enough to order the Gustavo and Cajun Chicken paninis. A huge group of about 50 people wearing yoga attire came in for takeout and filled the edges of the store, but our food came out quite quickly. The bread was perfectly toasted, crispy, and delicious. The flavors were perfectly balanced and so tasty. Plus, everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful.  FOOD: 5/5 ENVIRONMENT: 4/5 SERVICE: 5/5 VALUE: 4/5 OVERALL: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Cheese Croissant - addictive! Almond Croissant - dense and flavourful (though a bit heavy for my tastes). Latte - the coffee was fragrant and the milk was smooth..the best latte I've had in Montreal!  Going back to try their poached egg breakfast sandwich...may upgrade to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is out of this world! Perfect for a quick breakfast and lunch and the cafe latte reminded me of Europe!  Got to try the cubain and crab roll. The cubain was a more gourmet version than Im used to and the crab roll was light and delicious. The bread is too die for which is why we opted for the chocolate croissant to end our meal with.   Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Olive & Gourmando was a must-stop on my Montreal itinerary. They are closed Sundays & Mondays, so I forced my group to stop by for a quick bite. Everyone was grumpy from walking around all day.  The pastries looked amazing - all glazed and sugared up! We didn't eat any real food, but I saw some sandwiches/soups that nearby tables got and they looked very healthy and hearty!   For the 4 of us, I chose a blueberry pastry and the famed almond croissant. Unfortunately, they ran out of the chocolate brioche :( Both pastries were unbelievably buttery, flaky, and delicious! We ordered an extra almond croissant for the road.  Nobody was grumpy anymore!  O&G's decor was homey and cozy - would love a place like this back in the city!"}
{"text":"Super chouette petit endroit découvert sur Yelp bien avant notre arrivée à Montréal. On arrive il est midi pile: heure de pointe.  On nous met sur la liste en nous expliquant qu'il y a 30 minutes d'attente pour une table. On est patients et on attend devant sur un banc.   Hop même pas le temps d'organiser l'après midi que 7 minutes plus tard on nous appelle: la table est libre. Youpi!  On s'installe, les tables sont assez collées les unes aux autres et l'endroit est très bruyant. Les serveuses sont très gentilles et présentes.  Mon plat était vraiment bon, j'ai goûté au \"panini oeuf coquette\". Seul hic je m'attendais vraiment à un panini sous la forme... d'un panini. Ils devraient préciser qu'il s'agit en fait de deux tranches de pain grillé avec une sauce tomate et un oeuf bénédicte au milieu. Aussi, dans le menu il est mis : panini avec oeuf Bénédicte, avocat, tomate et salade. J'ai donc été assez déçue par les minuscules bouts d'avocat et les trois tonnes de sauce tomate.  Néanmoins, mon plat était délicieux!  Endroit vraiment sympathique, même si les prix sont un peu au dessus de la moyenne c'est vraiment gai et l'ambiance est cool"}
{"text":"I would have given them 5 starts if not for the coffee.  The food is amazing and the ambient just fantastic. The fresh juice perfect. The coffee a total disappointment."}
{"text":"Everything is great! Try the soup of the day! We had chicken noodle soup, it is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Les meilleur panini de montreal et aussi les plus dispendieux hehehe"}
{"text":"Very cozzy atmosphere. Probably the best place to eat panini in town. Great and friendly service. The place is very small though, you are kind of feel squeezed."}
{"text":"The decorations and vibe of the restaurant was very cute. We got lucky that we didn't have to wait long to be seated. Ordered the latte, which had way too much milk, and not enough coffee. HOWEVER, the food was so tasty. Ordered the breakfast panini and cocette. Both were excellent and we were served very fast. I would like to mention that our server wasn't the friendliest, but superb food!"}
{"text":"We came in the morning @ 9am and had it wait 40mins. Pretty packed throughout but crowd starts thinning out around 10:30am. Nice and cozy, very hipster and modern feel. Quick paced, great for brunch and have baked goods to grab on the go.  $16 - Tartine sandwich (Recommend). Bit on the messier end. Refreshing taste, a bit heavy.  $17 - Coquette (Recommend). Probably their signature dish, also quite messy. Comes with garlic bread to spread the tomato paste and avacado on.  $10 - Chia Bowl (Recommend). Cool experience, basically just a gains bowl in a giant maison jar. Very simple but the flavours work together very well."}
{"text":"Their panini is good, though you must eat fast while it's hot and crunchy or it turns into a rock when it gets cold.  (but of course not TOO fast cuz it'll burn you.) Their hot soups are also usually great.  The rest of their stuff... not so good.  Try to avoid the crowd by dodging the obvious peak lunch rush(noon, 1pm on the dot)."}
{"text":"Man O' man! The food is nothing less than Amazing. A must go place for anyone visiting old city."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Excellent breakfast menu that I had to come back a second time for.  The Oeuf Coquette, poached egg on your face panini, and their baked goods like chocolate and almond croissants are all excellent.  Seating is tight because it's very busy so either go early or pray that you get lucky."}
{"text":"Food is excellent here- wait is crazy.  Beware if you're super hungry. Quoted wait times are long and the actual wait times are even longer. For us, an hour was really an hour and thirty and when we lost our reservation walking over from the boutique across the street which resulted in being told to wait another \"20\" minutes which was really 50.  That being said the food is incredible. The mac and cheese and egg on your face panini were both sold out by the time we were able to order. We were told about the mac and cheese when we were seated but only about the panning when we were ordering. I wasn't sure what to order on the spot after that but the waitress jumped in with a great rec. She said \"no one orders the tartine but it's my absolute favorite thing on the menu\" so I ordered it. It was delicious. I ate every bite.   The hail Caesar cocktail was delicious and had a unique flavor that I couldn't put my finger on until I realized the carrot in the cocktail was picked. So good.  At the end of the meal I got a dirty chai to go- which was another great choice. Everyone at my table got different orders (the grilled cheese, the veggie burger, the ricotta) and everyone was completely happy with their meals."}
{"text":"I have fallen in love with lattes again because of this place.  And they make it with a fancier than normal heart - now that's love.  The Place to come for caffeine & pastry- oh & to people watch...seating is very cozy...maybe too cozy but that's the norm here.  This place is great for caffeine & pastries that are affordable."}
{"text":"Amazing soup. One of the best I had."}
{"text":"It was ok.. coffee wasn't very good pastries were good and panini also good. This place just seemed to be a bit overrated."}
{"text":"FOod is OFF Da HOOK GOOD! The only qualm is the wait... it IS worth it but be prepared to wait up to an hour to be seated during rush time..."}
{"text":"The breakfast panini was really greasy, kind of too spicy and flavourless. I wanted to love this place SO BADLY. It was so pretty, the people were nice, the location is so quaint and cute. Gosh I'm really disappointed.  I will give it another shot and try a banana chocolate something or another..."}
{"text":"Good food and good service!  You should know the place gets real crowded during lunch hours on weekdays.  I really like their lunch menu, their breakfast menu could be better, maybe some more savory options."}
{"text":"Arrived at ~1:30 on a Friday to a 20 minute wait.  TOTALLY worth it.  The leek and potato soup was delicious, my grilled sandwich excellent and my wife's soba salad amazing.  This is the type of place we would have returned to 2 or 3 times during a short visit to a new city, but there are just too many other Montreal institutions to try."}
{"text":"I got an Everything Cookie and an almond croissant - the baked goods were certainly good, but I'm not sure I would brave the line and crowds to eat in. I got my food to go - which, coincidentally, was a little expensive relative to the rest of Montreal. The Everything Cookie contained walnuts, oats, chocolate and candied ginger. The almond croissant was more chewy and moist than flaky, but still very good."}
{"text":"Loved this cute little brunch place in Vieux Port. The coffee was good, and also the food. We had the spicy sandwich."}
{"text":"Great food and a very trendy atmosphere. Came with my family and tried the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, The Majestic (A large, fully loaded hotdog), and the Elixir drink (an infusion of iced green tea, pomegranate, ginger, and lime).  Overall, the food was delicious and unique. The sandwich had a lot of flavor, the mango was a nice touch, and the bread was perfectly soft. The Majestic was a bit difficult to figure out at first, but a solid variety of toppings that made it a solid dish. The Elixir tasted a bit watered down, but was overall a refreshing nice drink.  Definitely enjoyed the time here and would happily return to try the other menu items, but only downside was that the price for the meal was a bit much given the quantity and overall quality."}
{"text":"Oh waouh, quelle place! L'atmosphère qui s'en dégage, la manière dont ils ont agencé l'endroit, le charme, la bouffe... Ce qui a fait défaut au restaurant c'est seulement l'attente. C'est tellement achalandé qu'il fallait attendre, surtout qu'ils ne prennent pas les réservations. Mais ça valait le coup d'attendre, vraiment!   Le sucré et le salé sont aussi bons les uns que les autres. On s'est partagé plusieurs choses à manger entre amis, c'était super agréable, visuellement et culinèrement parlant!  Durant notre repas, je voyais la file d'attente ne plus finir à l'endroit des gourmandises à acheter et emporter. Il y avait autant de monde pour manger sur place que de personnes présente pour acheter quelque chose à prendre pour emporter."}
{"text":"I seriously can not believe this place gets such high rep - there is a bunch of places nearby that are a 100 times better. I feel bad as every time I come to Montreal, I see a long line of people patiently waiting for this restaurant to open.   Following all the reviews, we came in here expecting to poop ourselves with the quality of the food. I was expecting food orgasms and nothing short of it.   It's loud, obnoxious and very energetic. I guess if you are not a New Yorker who has seen a 100 identical restaurants in Lower East Side, this place must really be something special. You probably think - this is as good as it gets and think yourself a foodie.   If you are a New Yorker, this place is a dime a dozen.   Eating  a lb of sugar for breakfast, is not my idea for a healthy start to my day - but if you like it that way -you'll fit right in. After studying the menu, I could not find a single \"non-carbohydrate centric\" breakfast entree - nothing like simple eggs or something satiating with protein. My poor athlete husband whose whole diet evolves around protein was on the verge of tears but it was his idea to come here so he put up a tough front.   I ordered what I thought was the healthiest option on the menu - a vegetable sandwich with goat cheese. The waiter has assured me in comes on the whole wheat bread. The vegetables turned out to be sliced pear/apple type of slaw and the whole sandwich was drizzled with maple syrup on top!  I asked for an extra egg as a side to my sandwich and offered to pay whatever necessary - and they said they couldn't do it. Let me just repeat it to show how ridiculous it sounds: they could not boil an egg.   After traveling all over the world and eating anywhere from the tiniest holes in the wall in the poorest of villages to world's best restaurant, this is a first time I come across the restaurant that's incapable of boiling an egg or doing any request off the menu.  It's a complete opposite of any European restaurant that'll cook whatever you want for a paying customer and is a really just a step up from cafeteria if the menu is this prefixed.   To finish our meal, since we didn't really eat either one of our breakfast entrees - we ordered a granola to split - it probably came in with what looked like quarter lb of jam underneath it, jam as in like straight up jam.   While we were miserable and hungry, next to me, people were happily devouring what looked like 3000 worth of calories in waffles and a panini that was made with a giant loaf of bread.   All in all, I'm sure this is a great place for some but certainly overhyped and not for those who like to have healthy nutritious low-carbohydrate breakfast."}
{"text":"Pretty good brunch place in the downtown area. My wife and I split the poached egg panini, the mac and cheese, and an almond croissant. The almond croissant was a little doughy and felt more like a sourdough than anything else. The mac and cheese was really good, I'm glad that it contained real mushrooms to add an earthy touch. The panini was solid, just a little plain. We got a chocolate brioche to go and oh man it had so much chocolatey goodness it was so goddam delicious. Would recommend for brunch."}
{"text":"Urban rustic.  Simple menu - a huge plus in my mind, know what you do and do it well - and do it well they do.  The pastries were delicious and the coffee absolutely acceptable (that is high praise from me).  The menu items were inventive, fresh and comforting, just what you want for breakfast.  The atmosphere was impeccable and the hipster staff was down to earth and very pleasant.  We loved it so much we went back for a second visit the next day."}
{"text":"Chocolate banana brioche bun!!!! This is their number one pastry! I was lucky there were some left. This is a cute cafe with outlets, food, baked goods and drinks. I paired a short espresso with my pastry and it was amazing! I could only eat half of the bun so definitely a pastry to share. Its dense, sweet and soft. Great place to check out and people watch!"}
{"text":"We have made O+g one of our destinations since our first visit to Montreal as a couple seven years ago. We love this boutique cafe & bakery as do many others. On any given day you'll find a line for about thirty minutes to enjoy some of the excellent treats they offer here.  My favorite is the Og Grilled Cheese and homemade ketchup, what a perfect melding of flavors. KT prefers the salted Ricotta toast.   Don't forget to leave room for a tasty dessert or stop by in the early AM for some of the best Croissants in town."}
{"text":"This is really an awesome place for sandwiches in Montreal. Understand, this will not be an ordinary sandwich : everything is homemade, including the bread. It's simply delicious! You have to try at least once! But be prepared, there is a huge line up on lunch time, you have to wait 20 minutes at least, but it's not cheap for a sandwich (around 15$)."}
{"text":"I haven't rated anything on Yelp in a while. But I had to come back to leave a 5 star review for Olive & Gourmando. Everything we had was delicious. And we sampled quite a bit of their menu--we liked it so much the first time that we came back for lunch the next day and breakfast the day after!"}
{"text":"Its a very nice old-world style bakery.  It feels very European and the attention to details is high.  We missed out on some of the lunch options because we were there \"too late.\"  The signs hung on the chalkboard menu wall told us \"too late\" next to most options, so get there early enough if you want a lot of selection.  :)  The nice hostess seated us and explained in a very French way how it worked.  \"You will sit here.  Go to the back to order.  Tell them you are at station 4 and 5. They will bring it to you and you will pay up front when you are finished.\"  Hey, at least we knew what to do.  :)  The soba noodle salad was very good, the Elixir green tea drink was also quite nice.  Very clean, they wipe the tables as soon as you leave, and the baked goods looked excellent.  This is my second visit to Montreal   and second visit to this bakery.  :)"}
{"text":"Hot of the press! No, not the panini press or a sandwich press. Olive & Gourmando will now be open 7 days a week. Yes.. Seven! Now for those that are a fan, you can understand the joy of this. For those that are not(Yet!) a fan.. Well, you will eventually appreciate the opening of 7 days. FIou! I feel better now. I simply needed to share this with all of you.   Now the real reason why I'm here. To write a review.   I can honestly say that there is nothing negative to write about. No, nothing. The only thing I was planning to mention is the long waiting time for a table and how crowded it gets each time I go. Now with being open 7 days, I think this will relieve the line-ups. Wait! Don't get turned off by the long waiting time.. It's worth it. I promise you!   Yes, most restaurants with very few exceptions are pricey and none other than a tourist trap. Olive and Gourmando is not at all one of them. Their main focus is on the locals that come and enjoy an outstanding breakfast, or lunch. Each of their meals, pastries  are simply delicious and well presented.   This is not about big or huge portions of pancakes and waffles or massive amounts of sausage and bacon. This is about using local and delicious things to make it all about quality.   Their pastries are oh so crumbly and buttery, along touches of Valrhona chocolate in some of their pastries. Nothing is overly sweet or greasy.  Again, just perfect!   I ordered the homemade granola with Greek yogurt and fruits. It was a good portion with such generous amounts of fresh berries, apples, grapes and oranges. The fruits were perfectly ripe and juicy.   Because I'm not a coffee drinker, I put a lot, yes a lot of focus on hot chocolate. Their hot chocolate was out of this world!! A simple glass of hot steamy milk(Perfect temperature) with a generous amount of Valrhona cocoa. You put as much sugar as you desire. Perfect! At last a hot cocoa that is not packed with 90% sugar and 10% chocolate.   We arrived at 11:30am on a Friday. It was packed! Wait.. Give it a try anyways. The service was very professional, efficient and so fast.   For all these reasons, I insist you go try it again and again. Either if you live in Montreal or you're a tourist. You will certainly love this place. Like I said.. I promise!"}
{"text":"O&G is a must on anyone's list of top spots to eat at in Montreal. They are an institution and don't be misled by their Old Montreal location, this is no tourist trap kind of place. O&G is the real deal. Do not pass up a chance to stop in here for breakfast, lunch or a quick pick me up during the day. You will not be disappointed.   You will however likely encounter a line. Just put your name on the list and be patient or grab something to go and eat it on the grass down by the water front walkway.   Everything I've eaten here has been very tasty a few of my favs are: the chocolate brioche - in my opinion not to be missed and absolutely one of the best in the city; the egg on your face breakfast sandwich and the chicken with avocado sandwich. Honestly, I've never known anyone to have something there that wasn't really tasty. So just eat it all!"}
{"text":"Be prepared for a long line up for Brunch, but the food will make up for the wait time.  All the dishes we ordered (brisket, ouef croquette & the grilled cheese) were lip smacking.  However, the grilled cheese Sandwich was exceptionally good. It left us wanting for more.  Great staff, really cool vibe & amazing food."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this spot for brunch! Coming from NYC, I never thought I can love brunch places more than in NYC, but this place did it!  Amazing vibe, beautiful crowd, great service, awesome food! And in the prettiest street corner!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal with couple of my friends and we stopped here for a lunch. The wait was about 30 min on a weekday lunch (which is expected). The waitress was extremely friendly and explained the menu to us.   Each of us tried different panini and shared. I must say that none of them disappointed. The sandwiches had a nice crunch and tasted delicious.  I forgot the name of the one I got (it had the pickle mayo). But it was amazing! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Bof, restaurant du vieux Montreal avec des prix pour touristes (ça coûte cher:un biscuit un petit latte 10$) mwais."}
{"text":"Delicious, try the brioche pecan, uhm, the chocolate one is also good. The coffee is good too coming  Mirage espresso machine. The environment is very nice. I would go back every time I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Overpriced sandwiches. Tried the ckn sandwich that was overly salty and the bread was chewy. $15 for a tiny sandwich is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Great service!  Delicious and unique sandwiches. The ketchup is outstanding.  Loved the vegan sandwich."}
{"text":"Had the raspberry muffin and it was delicious and fresh.  Well, it better be for $3.50.  The chocolate croissant was crispy but I've had much better in Montreal and in other cities."}
{"text":"Fabulous atmosphere, food and service. We will go again! They ran out of the cold sandwiched which makes it more authentic."}
{"text":"What can I add that hasn't been said?  Probably nothing.   Great coffee, fantastic tea, flavorful breakfast sandwiches, delicious pastries, restrained-eclectic decor, open windows, and a waiter with a retro PBS shirt  (ha!)...a painfully perfect laid-back, not-trying-too-hard yuppie brunch."}
{"text":"Everyone I know that's been to Montreal, raves about Olive + Gourmando. For the sake of Yelp, and my appetite, I had to go. And yes, it's amazing.  O & G has a charming, Paris-like cafe feel. Wood tables, freshly baked goods on display, delicious smells and classic but funky decor. The place was packed (so be prepared for a bit of a wait), but you're assigned a table number when one becomes available and then go stand in line to place a food order. If you're looking for take-out, that's also an option and you stand in the same line to place an order.  They have about 9 sandwiches written on chalkboards above the food displays - my memory is failing me, but they were all classic with a twist. Chicken with pesto and roasted red peppers, caramelized onions with some sort of meat....something spicy. My apologies for the vague descriptions, but I guarantee they were delicious and fresh.  They also have an array of fresh salads, fruit salads, and  REALLY good fresh breads & spreads. I had the ricotta cheese with a yummy olive oil and parsley, cherry tomatoes and warm bread with a garlic-y glaze. It was delicious, and great to share.  We also tried the baked goods (how could we not), and tried a butter croissant, banana loaf, and a mixed fruit and nut muffin. All fresh, all delish.  The lattes were just another bonus, and added a nice touch to our lovely brunch.   Located in the heart of old Montreal, this is a must-visit restaurant! All the rave reviews, are accurate!"}
{"text":"After a substantial amount of research, my travelling partner and I chose this spot for lunch today.  We both agreed that it might have been on of the best lunches we ever ate.  We were lucky to get a seat with no wait, a bit of a miracle because it was so busy.  We both ordered the raspberry limeade - refreshing, light and not too sweet.  My friend ordered a delicious salad of tomatoes, corn, roasted pine nuts, etc.  It was served with ricotta and bread.  I ordered the grilled cheese with caramelized onions (it was the best grilled cheese of my life).  I would strongly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"So many friends said that this is the place and they were right. Great food and coffee with very pleasant staff. Weekdays weren't too crowded but Saturday morning was a bit of a wait, so worth it! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous little cafe! I only tried breakfast here, but it was so good I came back again the next morning. The coffee was perfect and the pastry was equally delicious. Pass on the chain coffee shops and head straight to this little place. Worth it, even if you have to wait."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS lunch, snack and coffee spot in the Old Port.   Between the four of us, we tried two different paninis, some wine, the raspberry-lime-lemonade (OMG), a latté and an espresso. I skipped lunch and went straight for the almond croissant, and have no regrets. It was served warm and was oh so tender and not too sweet. Everything was top-quality and very tasty. Five stars for the food. Service was fast & friendly too (they now have table service).  At 4 p.m. on a Saturday, we had a 20-minute wait so went around the corner to the Phi Centre to check out the art installations. We found the restaurant quite crowded and noisy -- that's what you get at a (deservedly) popular spot, I guess.   Prices were normal for the Vieux Port, about $12 for a sandwich and $4-5 for a pastry.  Another coup de coeur from the book \"Devorer Montréal\" by Claire Bouchard & Chantelle Grady."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful spot in Montreal!  We visited once for breakfast and once for a late lunch/early dinner and both times, the spot was great.  The staff was super friendly - we lucked out and got seated right away both times, but I know sometimes it can get very busy.    Everyone on the menu looked amazing - but I have to say the granola/yogurt breakfast was fresh and flavorful and big!  The coffee was nicely prepared (I had a cappucino).  Atmosphere-wise, this was such a cute spot - windows that open out to the street and a mix of small/large tables and counter seating.  For lunch, I had one of the hot paninis and it was flavorful and piping hot.    Overall, the quality of the ingredients was high (which leads to a non inexpensive visit), staff was friendly and everything was delicious.  If I had one complaint, it was that our server vanished during our breakfast.  We had to ask for the bill about three times before we received it (as our server never returned after we started eating, we tried to both pay at the counter and ask other servers for help...). Finally, we got this resolved, but it was sort of odd - especially when everything else was so great.  I would definitely stop back in when back in Montreal - just go early (or later) to try to not wait too long."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great location in beautiful old Montreal.  Plus, cafe staff is amazingly helpful and friendly!!!!!"}
{"text":"The line sucks but this place - from the sandwiches to the sweets to the beverages - is freakin awesome. Good luck picking out just one dessert; I don't think any of your choices could be anything but amazing.   If you're willing to take your food to-go, you can be out in 20 minutes rather than waiting 30 for a table. And the food makes an awesome sitting on a bench in the park meal."}
{"text":"Turns out my internal vacation clock is perfect for avoiding crowds. No line ups at 4PM on a Saturday, though a few items were unfortunately sold out (the regular croissants, all three hot dishes, and a seafood dish). We were here for the ricotta (sweet) that my companion had hailed as the best thing ever and were sad to have missed breakfast hours. Except! Breakfast menu turns out to be available all day. Now the difficulty of choosing between the sweet (which we were here for) and the salty (which also seemed well reviewed). Alas, we got both - and thankfully we did! Both very well balanced and refreshing. The RICOTTA (SALTY) - with sauteed broccolini, pine nuts, parmesan, and dried currents, served alongside ricotta drizzled in olive oil and a healthy sprinkling of black pepper. beautiful combination of creamy, crunchu, chewy, salty, sweet, bitter, hot, cold. Everything. The RICOTTA (SWEET) was far less complex in ingredients but just as flavourful. Orange zest, (possibly orange-infused) honey, and salt flakes garnishing ricotta. Both are incredibly refreshing and different enough that it didn't seem like we were overloading on the ricotta. Both also came with enough slices of crusty bread to scoop it all up, except we got an extra CHEESE CROISSANT for good measure. More of the chewy than flaky-and-crumble-all-over-your-face type. not bad at all but the cheese was unnecessary in this pairing.  Decor is so homey (with the cutest menu illustrations on the wall), and there's a comfortable amount of natural light. Plus, the windows open, which, on that beautiful sunny day, made the afternoon perfecto. Seating is very intimate but doesn't get overly loud. Totally would love to have this as my corner coffee shop."}
{"text":"HIGHLY OVERRATED RESTAURANT: yelpites, seriously! If you are like me who fell for the trap set by the sheer number of reviews this place has, read on!   I visited Monreal during Christmas week for 2 days and given a short stay, I wanted to try the most reviewed restaurants. This place was one of those and there I was on a  ball freezing day among 20 other people trying to get a taste of the ambrosial food promised by the gods on mount olympus. I couldn't believe people willing to wait 2 hours to get a table but so was I.   After waiting for an hour and a half, we finally got a place to sit. We had a chicken panini (the gustavo), croquette and the chia pudding. All of them were average and not worth the wait.   I would recommend a take out then wasting time in the line if you really want a taste of this place."}
{"text":"I visited Olive & Gourmando on a recent trip to Montreal and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The atmosphere is that of a charming and well-decorated coffee shop.  The beverages are wonderful and the menu, albeit a bit limited, is generally inviting with something for everyone.  I opted for their \"famous\" egg, sriracha sandwich and enjoyed it.  My only complaint was that it seemed to lack even a few basic egg, bacon, etc. breakfast options, which may turn some people off.  I'll certainly visit again the next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Had the best brunch here. Small place but they can fit more people with their communal tables.   Started with almond croissant, lemon blueberry scone and apple turnover. The almond croissant could've used more flavor but the other two were terrific.   I had the Mac and Cheese with mushrooms and truffle tapenade with a side salad. A great balance with the two items on my plate. The Mac and cheese was flavorful and didn't feel heavy. Loved the crunchy topping.   My daughter had the grilled cheese with the homemade ketchup. Normally would not eat it with ketchup but this was sweet and a nice compliment. The raclette cheese in it was a nice bonus.   My friend loved her oeuf croquette.   A busy place. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place for lunch while on solo trip in Montreal. Atmosphere was nice, food was excellent.  Would definitely recommend and would definitely return. I got the mr Miami panini but would love to try all the other menu items! They all looked so good!"}
{"text":"Super cute cafe in old port and always hard to find a seat. Best to go far in advance to ensure seating. Super casual ambience. I had chicken panini and coffee. Panini was greasy but so yum! It's a bit pricey for a panini, around $13 but very filling and really just fills your heart with all those great flavours. Coffee was all right. Would recommend going at least  once for ambience, location, and food. Had a great day there!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch on Monday. First of all the food is DELICIOUS! Tried a couple of sandwiches and pastries, everything was great! Totally worth visiting for just that reason.  Unfortunately, a few minor qualms - the space is tiny, the wait is long, prices are on the high side, and they were out of multiple items on the menu when we came in at 11 am."}
{"text":"Wow Yum!!!  A wait well worth it!!  Food was excellent as was the service. Busiest place around so be ready for a wait at any time. Looks like they also do a robust take-out service too so that is a good option. We can see why it is so well rated."}
{"text":"One of my favourite lunch/sandwich spots. Usually packed for good reason but staff is usually friendly. Their vegan sandwiches are delicious. Can't speak much on their coffee as I've only had an Americano there but it was satisfactory."}
{"text":"While walking around downtown Montreal my wife and I found ourselves craving a sandwich. What do we do? Go to Yelp of course. Coming across Olive was surely a pleasant surprise. Like most every restaurant in the area, Olive is small, but unlike a lot of them, it packs a big punch.  My wife and I decided to split a salad and a panini. When the food arrived, we were both pleasantly surprised. The panini was a pressed and grilled to a crispy crunch perfection. The Mr. Miami was a play on a Cuban sandwich. In this case, the panini style really made it better by warming up all the meat on the inside. The salad was a simple mixed green salad that was tossed in a delicious vinaigrette.  Overall, Olive & Gourmando is a restaurant that I would recommend to anyone visiting Montreal. The small but very busy restaurant makes the time to make everything fresh and by hand. Only using high-quality ingredients that ensure every customer is very satisfied."}
{"text":"I have two words for you.  The Cubain!!  Do not eat this if you're worried about calories.  Don't be worried about calories and EAT IT!!  This place is busy at lunch so get there early or get take out.  Do you like cookies?  You'll love the cookies here too.  They're huge so good for sharing and once again worth the calories.  We also ordered their salad of the day which was also very tasty."}
{"text":"Highly recommended their \"Poached egg on your face\" panini which was so delicious and packed with flavour."}
{"text":"We had to wake up super early to avoid the long inevitable line up, but it was worth it. The environment was cold, but I didn't mind because it was buzzing with energy, and had great staff. If you're interested in just the pastries, you can walk right in and order those separately, no need to wait in line for that.  For the breakfast fair, I had this spicy egg breakfast panini, which was absolutely delicious. The coffee was decent, and so were the pastries. The wait staff were extremely attentive, fast, and did not make us feel rushed. Overall, I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Have heard so much about this place from friends. Have been wanting to try their cold veggie sandwich, but by the time I got there I settled for a blueberry scone and an Americano. Being a baker and being fond of scones I must say this was one of the flakiest, layered scones I've had. What I did wish for was for some spread of some sort (some cream) on the side. Call me snobby, but one has to have something to spread on the scone as you sit and sip on a nice cup of coffee or tea. And when you're paying close to $5 for a scone, you deserve it;) maybe even warmed up as well.  Might go back to try their cold vegan sandwich, but would be more tempted if they had a hot vegan sandwich on the menu, especially when it's cold out and you're looking for something warm."}
{"text":"Every time I set foot in here for breakfast (or lunch), I'm always pleased with the food quality, the excellent & friend service and the eclectic and welcoming decor!  You'll often hear patrons of Olive & Gourmand complimenting them on the \"concept\"... interesting because when you ask veteran Marie-Helene and Sandra, or \"old crusts\" as they jokingly call themselves, there is no concept. It's just the result  of a slow evolution of bringing goodness and joy to people, season after season.  The hustle and bustle can perhaps turn off some people who prefer quietness when sipping their café but if you're like me and love the vibe, the energy, the possibility of striking serendipitous conversations with locals or out-of-towners, and the soothing humming of the hustle & bustle this iconic place delivers then you're in for happy times!"}
{"text":"Who cares if it's swimming with people, you can't do much better than this place for lunch. Once they seat you, go to the counter in back, review the menu on the chalkboards above, and place your order which they'll deliver to you at table. They are amazingly cheerful about explaining this, even though they must repeat it hundreds of times every day. The casual atmosphere and excellent food make for a fantastic vibe.  And the food is terrific. I had the Cubano sandwich, a crispy Panini with pork, ham, cheese, and one of the most delicious sauces I've ever had on a Cuban sandwich - something like a super-savory artichoke sauce with just the right amount of chili pepper. But what made me even happier was the side salad. Perfectly dressed and seasoned, it had sliver-thin slices of sweet red onion and the best mix of greens I've had almost anywhere - lettuces and other salad greens, but also baby winter greens like kale, and a good amount of herbs - parsley, tarragon, who knows what else. Every side salad I have will be measured against the heaven that they make here.  The baked goods are excellent, too. This time, brought home a brownie (it's somehow light and dense at the same time - as though the batter was baked just long enough to hold it together) and a chocolate chip cookie (very good, buttery, crisp).  When you're done eating, just go to the register and tell them your table number. There's a dish for tips next to the register, and the staff splits them. It all works very smoothly.  It's hard not to feel like you're at the center of things when you eat here. I'll definitely be returning at least once more this trip."}
{"text":"Oh Montreal!   This is one of the reasons why I love you...   The BEST place for grab lunch in the BEST area of town.  There's always a wait here, but the line moves rather quickly, so WAIT!  Their panini's are amazing, especially the caramelized onions with goat cheese!  Show up rather early, because they tend to sell out of panini's towards the end of the day.    Also, before leaving, you MUST get the \"extraordinary brownie\", and also take one to go for the road home.  Honestly, the BEST brownies I've ever had in my life, and my sweet tooth is ginormous!  It has a hint of espresso in it which complements the bitterness of the valrhona chocolate.  And since you're ordering up the brownie, may as well get the chocolate-banana brioche too!    I'm from Boston, and everytime I visit, I stock up on their pastries like it was the end of the world.  I am considering just calling them up and having them ship to me their goodies... worth every shipping penny."}
{"text":"Delicious tea! Delicious coffee! Delicious pastries! Amazing food!   This place is fantastic! The inside looks amazing and it's bustling. My favorite aspect of the decor is the tree-like chandelier.  The food and beverages are all high quality. I got my standard earl grey tea and it was served in a chinese tea set! The tea was very floral and sweet, without any sugar being added.   We also got the almond croissant, pain au chocolate, and belgian chocolate & pecan cookie.  These were lovely treats, and pretty great quality. I love French croissants and the pastry in the croissants was a little tough and gluten-y. But it was still good.  The cookie was really good too. My colleague had the latte and said it was nice and smooth.  Then, my colleague and I shared the Salad #24. I am guessing it's named that because it has 24 ingredients? It was a vegan salad with a lot of amazing ingredients in it like pea shoots, pickled daikon, rainbow carrots, cashews, marinated tofu, basil, mint, sesame..... to name a few. It was so fresh and delicious. We loved it and have resolved to try to reverse engineer this salad back in Vancouver.   In short, go here."}
{"text":"This place is well-deserving of a 5-star rating!! We walked in to a very busy Saturday morning, but we were pleasantly surprised to have a relatively short waiting time. Before we even sat down, we became excited to try the fantastic-looking food that passed us by. The wonderful sights and smells almost did justice to what proved to be one of the best breakfasts! I had their yogurt and fruit bowl, while my husband had a panini. Both were so fresh and well-portioned, leaving us feeling full in the most satisfied way. We also tried some of their pastries...simply wonderful! This will definitely be at the top of our list for visiting again next time we're in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend around lunchtime on a Saturday, and it was crazy busy. We put our names on the waiting list and were told the wait was 40 minutes. I asked if it was ok for us to go out, walk around, and come back within 40 minutes and was told it was ok. We came back within exactly 38 minutes, and I went up to the counter to say we were back and ask if the table was ready, and I was told (quite sarcastically) \"well yes, and I called your name 4 times\". This was such a bizarre interaction, and had it not happened I would have definitely given 5 stars based on the food, atmosphere, and our lovely waiter. If you want people to wait there, then we should be told not to leave or our table will be given away, or take a phone number and call me 5 minutes before the table is ready or something. There are ways to get around waiting times and lists without being rude to customers. In Paris all the best brunch/weekend spots have huge waits, which I don't have a problem with and am happy to wait for good food. I'm used to queuing up for ages and have seen many creative ways to get around long waiting lists, all without being treated rudely like this before.   Even after starting off the meal with a bad taste in my mouth, overall our meal was really great. I ordered the new addition to the menu, the beetroot salad with flatbread, which had garlic tzatziki. My friend had the ricotta with grilled peppers and pine nuts. I thought it was quite expensive for the amount of food (15-17$ per main course), but the ingredients are obviously high quality, and the presentation was beautiful.  I would come back here if I'm in Montreal again based on the food and the number of vegetarian options, however I hope they can sort out their waiting list issues and find a better way of making customers feel welcome."}
{"text":"The panini they served is extra crunchy and the cheese and other ingredients inside makes is chewy. The rasberry lemonade was delicious and the almond croissant was perfect. It was a bit pricey for the food (around 20$ for a panini and a drink).   The service was quick and the staff is nice. Make sure you don't come here on a tight schedule. The line at the door might be long, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"I've come here twice, with about fives years in between. There is no greater comfort than returning to a place and finding it just as lovely as when you left.  Saturday brunch is a perfect thing to experience. Everything on the expanded brunch menu sings. And no matter how full you are, get a croissant to go."}
{"text":"Been there eat and drink . Besure coming back. Best Salad ever.  perfect pastry with well brewed coffee."}
{"text":"Popped in toward the end of their brunch and it was still pretty crowded, but we managed to snag a table for two by one of their cute little windows.  The space is great. Chalkboards with doodles and menu items cover the walls and the cute cafe by the entrance has some goodies for sale. The space gets crowded quick but it's a lively atmosphere. In the summer, there's no AC but thank the heavens this is a corner location and the open air windows let in a slight breeze.  Once seated, our server informed us a lot of the menu items are done for the day since its the end of brunch but the options left sounded just as delightful. I had the mixed salad with chicken and my boyfriend had the Cuban sandwich. Both were SPECTACULAR. Although it was a different take on a classic, this was probably the best Cuban I've ever tried. The pesto mayo made this dish! The mixed salad sounds so simple but it was SO good, the toasted almonds and the chopped chicken gave this salad the kick it didn't even need. I loved how light but tasty the dressing was. I wanted to come back the next day to have the same meal again, even though I don't like visiting the same restaurant twice while on vacation. It was that good.  This place isn't overrated or as pretentious as it sounds or looks - go check it out!"}
{"text":"If you are able to get a plain croissant at Olive & Gourmando consider yourself very, very lucky! In fact, I assume whoever gets there first, takes them all, because they are always sold out. Good news though: Everything else they make is absolutely scrumptious. I just finished off a carrot brioche, which has copious amounts of shredded, candied carrots inside. So unique and sooo delicious. Everything they make is organic on top of it, so you can feel good about eating all that butter and sugar. O & G is def my fav bakery in town!"}
{"text":"We wanted to have a breakfast to remember. This was definitely the place. The OJ, was so fresh and tasty couldn't get enough of it. The paninis were out of this world. Definitely will go back for more."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Paul Maison - a cafe I found in South Beach Miami. Both are little Parisian-esque cafeterias that showcase delightful bakeries and serve gourmet sandwiches made-to-order in a casual semi self-serve style. Coincidentally, Olive et Gourmando is on Rue Saint-Paul Ouest...huh, look at that.    Cubain...zesty!      Roll crevettes + crabe         Chevre Chaud with homemade ketchup       Olive et Gourmando is a smaller, less polite version - I found one server scary, and I'm pretty scary myself.  You are directed to a seat and then given a sheet of paper.  You take it and head to the back to order. My sister and I got there late, what with our stop at Jeans Jeans Jeans!  By the time we arrived, they were sold out of the sandwich I wanted - egg on your face - booyah!  I feel like it needs to be followed with a booyah and two-finger gun shot motion?!?    I opted for the Chevre Chaud aka grilled goat cheese while my sister ordered the Cuban.  Then we decided to share the shrimp and crab roll. A little well-known fact for you: the average sister duo would share two sandwiches...but we above-average oinkers share three plus dessert.  All in all, the sandwiches-paninis-whatever you want to call them were very good, although the shrimp roll did not hold a candle to our mom's.  Our mother makes the BEST sandwiches in the world - her homemade chicken salad and shrimp sandwiches kick ass.   For dessert I got the turtle bar which my sister could only nibble at because it had nuts.  Whoops, I'm still getting used to the fact she's avoiding nuts.  Poor sister recently discovered she may be allergic to them and it's still under investigation. It's really sad. Like, really sad. Our family is like animal kingdom, when you tell a pig she can't eat something, the jungle cries.   All in all, I liked Olive et Gourmando; it may have been good-er if it wasn't so pricey.   We finished off our plates and walked off the calories around Old Montreal. I want to go back to try the Apple turnover and egg on your face...but this time I will be sure not to be trop tard...  Olive et Gourmando is trendy and fashionable, but a little high maintenance, huh, sounds a little like me *wink*."}
{"text":"Olive & Gourmando was my favorite of all of the stellar brunch spots that we tried in Montreal. The food was delicious, but most of the city seemed to think the same thing judging by the large influx of people on a workday. Still a nice find in a nice city. The long and short of it:  1. Sandwiches. I had the \"Poached Egg on Your Face\" sandwich and can honestly say that it was easily in the top 5 breakfast sandwiches I've ever had (and I loves me some breakfast sammys). The sandwich was on the larger side (had to over-eat to finish it...... no regrets) and was oozing plenty of delicious cheese. This made me want to try their grilled cheese as well.... which will have to wait until next time. My vegetarian fiance had the Vegan 3.0 and that was absolutely delicious as well, and also a good sized sandwich. All in all we were both really impressed with the food and I will gladly come back next trip to try a few more dishes.  2. Pastries. Olive has a large case of fresh baked pastries that we munched on while we waited. They were out of a few things that we wanted to try so it might be best to hit the pastry shelf right away if you intend to get one. We had an almond and a cheese croissant which were both delicious. A nice add-on to any breakfast or brunch.  3. Wait. We managed to hit that magical hour between breakfast and lunch on a weekday, and still ended up waiting 25 minutes. It became overly packed after we had sat down and the lunch hour rolled in. I would try to go on an off hour unless you don't mind waiting a decent amount because by the time we left there was easily an hours worth of people, though I'm sure some were getting their orders to go.  4. Veggie Friendly. There are a few vegetarian friendly items (usually I'd exclude grilled cheese because its just bread and cheese but damn did theirs look good). Always nice when the vegetarians at the table have more than 1 or 2 choices.  5. Price. For what you get I actually think Olive is priced very solidly. $10 - $15 for a sandwich (keep in mind that's Canadian) but the portions are large enough that you'll probably end up taking half home. Throw on a pastry and that a solid breakfast and lunch. Works for me every time.  I wish I was a bit closer to Olive & Gourmando, instead of an entire country away. Still it's nice to have a great place in your back pocket for when you head back to Montreal. I was impressed with this place and plan to head back whenever I'm in the neighborhood!  Overall Grade: A"}
{"text":"Friends recommended this for lunch. We decided to wander over and wow I'm glad we did. Weekends are insane. There is a line for a table and a line for take out.  We got the vegan sandwich and the egg in your face sandwich. Both were amazing! In fact so good we are going back today.   Well worth the wait. Run don't walk!"}
{"text":"What a gem! My husband and I returned several times while in Montreal last week and enjoyed every meal. They are busy, and you may have to wait, but the food and service is great quality!   I highly recommend the seasonal soups -- we had several including a delicious watermelon gazpacho!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by a few people when my husband and I were in town on our \"mini-moon\".  It was absolutely delicious but be prepared to pay dinner prices for lunch.  Everything is homemade and tastes as such.  $8 for soup of the day-- worth it because we were in town visiting but not sustainable for a daily lunch spot if you're local and want to pair it with a sandwich.  The cuban was out of this world and service was good."}
{"text":"First time to Montreal, and this was the third eatery visited.  The other two were very good, but breakfast at Olive et Gourmando prompted me to write a review.  My order only consisted of the Housemade Ricotta \"sweet\" and an espresso, but the ambiance, service, presentation and flavour of the simple dish were exactly what I needed on this Wednesday morning.  Our timing was great, as it was not too busy.  That may have helped my experience, however I will definitely be trying this place for lunch very soon."}
{"text":"I had the big healthy salad remix, but I'm not a salad person. I went there just before closing time so they were out of sandwiches. Their latte is amazing!! 10/10 on ambience."}
{"text":"The wait was worth it  I took my time strolling on the area and as they said they would call with notice of my seats they did ! The food so so fresh  So original  Don't get intimidated by the line"}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant we tried.  I still get nervous when I have to speak French.  But the menus are in both French and English side by side which was a relief for me since it's a popular place.  They are quick to help if you have any food allergies and since I'm non-dairy I was thankful for that.    The Cajun chicken sandwich is tasty and not overly spicy.  It had just a little diced jalapeño in addition to the spice rub.  And their iced coffee is small but strong.  Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Don't let the line out the door stop you. This place is where you need to eat today...and tomorrow.   Crossoints and coffee and delicious but stay for breakfast if you can.  We had the wonderful ricotta cheese that we paired with the fruit salad. Amazing. My husband also ordered the In your face panini that was perfection. You need to eat that panini before you die.  The place is clean and the staff is very welcoming.  I'd come to Montreal again just to eat here."}
{"text":"Super cute place for breakfast.   Service is great! The food is great! Chia pudding was good."}
{"text":"We had a very nice lunch here.  The food is first rate and very fresh.  The only knock is the tables are extremely close to one another.  You should definitely give this one a try."}
{"text":"After arriving in Montreal this was our first meal. We researched it and the hotel concierge even concurred with our choice. I am always suspect these type places are over-hyped but this lived up to its reviews. After a short wait for a table we ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich and the renowned Cuban sandwich paired with a glass of red wine and a cold IPA. Both were amazing but only downside was after a bite of the Cuban I regretted not ordering it as well. The Cajun was good but the crunchiness of the Cuban is what you hope for in those imaginary sandwiches in your dreams. Cute place, nice staff - perfect introduction to Montreal. Merci!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend during a weekend stroll. The place was packed! And it was 3pm on a weekend! Luckily, we were able to grab seats by the windows. The place is definitely cozy, but it gives off a really nice vibe throughout the surroundings.   I had the Cuban sandwich and it was so good! The sandwich temperature was probably close to burning, but it makes all the difference when it's freshly made. My friend told me this was the best sandwich place in Montreal - and I don't doubt her words. There is a large variety of other sandwiches, so I would definitely return to try new items. I also saw many baked goodies (pastries!).  Service was alright - A little slow, maybe sitting in a corner was a bad idea. I don't really remember interacting with the waitress much, since she appeared to have many other tables she was managing. The one thing that probably carved an impression on me was the table spacing. I remember seeing other customers trying to find ways to leave their seats without having to step on anyones toes....Other than that, the place is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"A+, The #24 Salad was super fresh and the Cuban Sandwich was on point. The cookies were awesome! We bought some granola to take home. A little on the expensive side but overall good. I wish they had more breakfast options."}
{"text":"I had the most delicious sandwich here! I ordered the Cubans, and it was the perfect mixture of gooey melty cheese and various deli meats. The pickle mustard was to die for. My only complaint was that I was seated at a bar in front of an open window, which would have been fine normally, but it was rainy and windy and they would not close the window. I would've asked to move, but it was crowded (even on a weekday around 2pm, which is an important note). Overall great, though!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch on a Saturday. It was packed and we were told there would be a 1 hour wait. However, there are several people who had given their names and not stayed so we were seated in 30 minutes. We tried the oeuf croquette, which was delicious. Very flavorful and the poached egg put it just over the top. Their brewed coffee was really good also. All in all, an excellent Montreal dining experience and totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"C'est bon! friday morning brunch- decaf latte, cubain panini et butter croissant. the cubain panini is warm and tasty, with delicious Italian bacon and cheese. Highly recommend.  The latte is okay, not outstanding. But it neutralizes the strong taste of the panini. The croissant could be better. Very crowded even though we arrived by 11. Service is good. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Excellent salad and sandwiches! Nicely surprised. They were out of our first choices when we went for lunch around 3pm (#24 salad and marinaded tofu sandwich), so we opted for the other vegetarian choices, autumn salad and vegan antipasto sandwich.  Delicious! Loved the combination of whipped goat cheese, roasted beets& turnips, and arugula on my autumn salad. Sandwich was also very good.   Will definitely come back to try other ones next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Truly gourmet breakfast and brunch in scenic Old Montreal.  French atmosphere in quaint neighborhood."}
{"text":"The Spot It's four in the afternoon and Olive and Gourmando is full of people. When walking into one of Montreal's hippest cafe's I'm not sure what hits you first: the afternoon light washing through the windows falling on the dark wood furniture, the rich smell of espresso and freshly baked bread, or the excited chatter of the crowd as they wait patiently for the bustling waiters to bring them their newly prepared food. The space itself is beautiful, big wood tables with a family dinning room seating style, smaller cafe tables and a bar with high stools that is perfect for people watching. The menu is scribbled across a dusty black chalkboard, showing that the menu choices change every day. The crowd draws in Montreal's local people, some coming to work on their computers and some coming to grab lunch with a friend. Between the undying love for quality food and the love the owners, Dy Solomon and Eric Girard, have for each other, the atmosphere of this little cafe in Old Montreal can only be described as enchanting.  What's Really Good? Fresh bread baked on the premises. Itay's Illy coffee. Creative sandwich combinations. Dense chocolate brownies. Quality ingredients. Warm atmosphere. Polite and fast waiters. A history of an adorable love affair. What else could you ask for? Olive and Gourmando is one of Old Montreal's most popular breakfast and lunch destinations for many reasons. Take out is available, so even if you don't have time to wait for a table or don't want to deal with the chaos of a hungry crowd, you still won't miss on a tasty and healthy lunch. With meat, vegetarian and vegan options, Olive and Gourmando is a good place for everyone to stop by.  You'll wanna know: Don't go with a big group since seating is limited, the menu changes daily so you'll always have new choices, go early in the day because they only make so much of all of their sandwiches and the type you want might run out early!"}
{"text":"Had the best sandwich I've ever had here. Wait lines are long, even on weekdays during work hours, but it's worth the wait. The Pomme panini had bacon, sliced apple, walnut butter and cheese. Absolutely wonderful, lots of flavor, and a fun mix of textures in one panini. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Always delicious! Good service and the chicken/mango and avocado sandwich sooooo goooood!"}
{"text":"We were walking around old Montreal just past lunch time and our group was getting hungry. We just happened to be a few blocks away from O et G and I had heard great things about the place.  It's basically a sandwich, salad, coffee and pastry kind of place. There is a good bit of in and out traffic here, but we were seated immediately by one of the servers. The group ordered the following sandwiches: crab and shrimp, Cajun chicken, Cuban and vegan (with tofu). Every sandwich was better than the next. The crab and shrimp was light and very fresh tasting, while the Cajun was just the right spice with some fresh mango on it, which was a delicious surprise. I am not a big pastry fan, but they were all great (blueberry tart, caramel bar and pecan chocolate cookie) and the expresso was strong. Who could ask for anything more?  O et G is a great place to stop whenever walking around in Old Montreal and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is always crowded during work-lunch. But after squeezing through the crowds of hungry people, I had the Cuban sandwich.  The sandwich was heavenly gooey with cheesy goodness, finger-licking oily juices, and great texture in the crunch of the breading. (I even walked back to work and it was still amazing). Also got the Coconut / 'Deluxe' Cookie , which was probably the best way to complete this lunch.  [ My Order ] : Cuban Sandwich + Deluxe Cookie"}
{"text":"Worth the wait! Hubby and I shared a almond croissant. It was perfect level crisp with caramelized almond atop. Then I had the tartine- a toast topped with ricotta cheese, marinated cucumber squash and radish! The marination was the best part- made the veggies taste out of the world! Ended with a hot chocolate- it was made with 55% dark chocolate making it taste intense! Made my food trip to Montreal complETE :)"}
{"text":"Got there at 9AM on a Sunday morning and the line was halfway down the block already, but let me tell you, IT'S SO WORTH IT! The coffee, the pastries, the poached eggs, the panini's... Didn't matter what we got it was perfect, and the staff is so nice! Even to us American tourists ;) if you are in Montreal for the weekend make sure you swing by, even if it's just for a coffee and a croissant to go! Do not leave without trying this place out!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is mentioned in several food tour videos on YouTube and let me tell you it is worth the hype! We got there shortly after they opened on Saturday morning and besides the wait to be seated, we were lucky because we took the last table for 2 and did not have to wait at all. We started off with a cheese croissant, which was so flaky, buttery, and delicious and the pecan and maple brioche. The brioche was really good as well but definitely the cheese croissant was on another level. Then we had the poached egg on your face panini which had the right amount of spicy and toasted to perfection. This restaurant hit all the right notes. A tip-get here early and don't skip out on pastries for the hot food!"}
{"text":"I had really good grilled cheese panini and my husband enjoying his Cuban panini. Both iced tea and coffee was very good. It's a nice restaurant with friendly service. We also tried one of the croissants and it was delicious."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely packed on Saturday afternoon. My traveling companion and I had somewhere to be within an hour so we decided to get something from the to go counter at Olive et Gourmando. After spending 10 minutes trying to translate the menu we discovered that the woman behind the counter spoke very good English.   Once translated everything sounded delicious, but I settled on the ricotta and bread, especially after hearing that their bread was baked in house.  We took our food back to Le Petite Hotel*  and I savored every last bite of this ricotta goodness. Soooo delicious! My traveling companion seemed just as happy with her salad.  Unfortunately, my stay in Montreal was pretty short or I would have tried to squeeze in one more meal at Olive et Gourmando.   http://www.yelp.com/biz/le-petit-hotel-montr%C3%A9al-2"}
{"text":"It's definitely a long wait, but if you go during off hours, it's not horrible.  You are seated. You order. You eat.  You pay at the register in the front.   The mixed garden salad is full of beautiful green leafy herbs and various greens and toasted almonds, and great dressing.   The Reuben sandwich is wonderfully crispy with nice Jewish meat. It's not the same as Katz but it's still a solid hot panini."}
{"text":"I REALLY ENJOYED THE CROISSANTS. I THINK THEY RE VERY FRESH AND DELICIOUS! Although I was a bit dissapointed about the service I received at the cashier, she seems uninterested about her serving me. Anyways this food is amazing !"}
{"text":"Un incroyable petit café dans le Vieux Montréal! Je n'arrive pas à croire que je n'avais pas encore rédigé mon avis sur Olive et Gourmando.   Excellent granola, comptoir de pâtisseries à se rouler par terre, succulents sandwichs, salades goûteuses : c'est ce que vous y trouverez. Les aliments sont toujours très frais, sans oublier leur café qui est sans aucun doute mon préféré dans le coin. Disons que je ne suis pas triste de travailler tout près ;)   Les prix sont \" normaux \" pour le Vieux. Si vous prenez un repas complet (p. ex., sandwich, boisson et dessert), la facture montera assez vite... mais selon moi, ça en vaut la peine. Je ne suis jamais déçue par les plats d'Olive et Gourmando. Seul hic : l'endroit est extrêmement achalandé, et ce, à toute heure du jour. Si vous y allez en espérant prendre votre café assis tranquille à une table, vous préférerez sans doute aller ailleurs. La place est toujours remplie et c'est assez bruyant. D'ailleurs, il y a souvent une file d'attente. Vous pourrez donner votre nom à une gentille hôtesse qui vous fera signe dès qu'une table sera libre."}
{"text":"Long wait. Good food. Great service! Grilled cheese, salad, and the vegan sandwich were our picks + we had mimosas and some green tea to kick off my bachelorette party. It was really yummy and we finished almost everything, which is rare amongst the girls I was with! The grilled cheese is really tasty + the salad was really filling - would love to come back to this gorgeous little spot!"}
{"text":"Olive et Gourmando is just oh-so-quaint and charming that it's hard not to fall in instant crush with it... or at least for me.  I came here on my last morning in Montreal during labor day weekend.  I absolutely adore the small decorative details and the cozy atmosphere which was perfect for enjoying a scrumptious breakfast and some hot chocolate before my flight home. Service was helpful and pleasant.   Since we had arrived too early for lunch, we were limited to their breakfast menu and opted for the following:  Poached egg on your face panini A delicious panini filled with poached egg salad, comte cheese, prosciutto, and roasted tomatoes.  The egg salad was light and fluffy and perfectly complemented by the sweet and saltyness of the prosciutto and roasted tomatoes. My favorite breakfast panini by far.  Almond Croissant My fellow yelpers don't lie. This is a must have at O+G.  I particularly liked that this pastry was fluffy throughout even though it appears that it wouldn't be upon first glance.   Olive et Gourmando makes me sigh with a smile.  It will definitely remain on my bookmarked lists of eateries to visit again the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Not a great experience, they make you sit in a super narrow isle right next to the kitchen and then asks you to squeeze up so that they can fit more customers. The mac and cheese had less cheese and more mushrooms. Most of the paninis are pre made and heated up to order. The coffee was good."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for breakfast/brunch/lunch in Old Montreal. Loved the decor and the inventive menu. We split the \"pizza pocket\" and each had a cup of corn chowder for lunch; flavors were unique and delicious. Definitely worth the wait, which goes quickly."}
{"text":"Had the Mr. Miami and Smoking Salmon sandwiches, with the salad of the week (cous cous and eggplant). Everything was delicious. The Mr. Miami was perfectly crunchy and the salmon sandwich bread had a nice chew to it. 30 minute wait for 2 people at lunch time but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing paninis and the curry & cream of squash soup of the day was delicious. 10/10, will come back next time I visit Montréal."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches and paninis in town ! The poached eggs with sriracha was just wow. Every bite gave us joy and this place is going to become our weekly indulge. Loved it !"}
{"text":"Stopped here for coffee and a quick breakfast after reading reviews. They accommodated us quickly with a fast check out for coffee and pastries. Both tasted incredible!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was suggested by a friend . We were on a vacation here and it didn't disappoint us . French cafe feel . Bread was delicious . Soups and salads too . This comes from a person who doesn't like salads or breads too much . Who won't if they make it like they do !"}
{"text":"Why is it so hard to get a good espresso and croissant sometimes?  I'm so glad that I found this place because they fill that void.  I'm not going to lie - this place is packed so  you'll have to take that into consideration.  The staff has a bizarre system that seems to keep things moving along and their friendly attitude makes it work.  Everyone was super nice and the coffee was so rich and wonderful.  The baked good were heaven - brioche, croissants, muffins... and the egg sandwich is so flavorful.  This place is filled with character and is a wonderful experience.  Please note that they are closed on Sundays :("}
{"text":"My girl got the oeuf coquette and I got the Miami panini. The panini came with a pear & pineapple salsa. Panini was tasty but too oily from the cilantro pesto. The coquette stole the show! Very, very flavorful because of the tomato, feta, and chorizo. You will easily sop up every delicious ounce with the grilled bread. Beware, the coffee can put hair on your chest. The palmier was excellent. Almond croissant was just okay."}
{"text":"Delicious pastries! Although a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Awesome. Tastes great. I don't know what else to say, there is always a line waiting so be prepare to wait there for 10-20 minutes minimum.  Also, you better make a list to order a lot because  everything here tastes good but nobody would like to wait so long.  I really like the cakes here."}
{"text":"If you don't get here during the busy hours, you'll enjoy your experience a lot more. But above all, if you love good food, are looking for somewhere that is a sure thing visiting Montreal, or need an amazing date spot or just want to put something super rich and tasty in your face, go here. There's not a lot of waiting area and waiting in the freezing cold kinda sucks. Also, earlier is better than later as they ran out of their hot sandwiches the day we stopped by.  All that said, this place is a gem among gems. The desserts and hot chocolates are made with Valrhona chocolates.   The truffle mac and cheese had mushrooms and was the best I'd ever had, and I've had a lot of these! Oddly enough, the addition of actual mushrooms seems to really bridge the rational of putting the truffle flavor in the mac and cheese and isn't so overwhelming. Also, they serve it in an iron skillet, so there's crunchy cheese!  The cafe is the perfect level of busy. The tables are really small so sharing is a really good idea. The espressos are perfectly poured. The few pastries they have (okay there's like 20) are phenomenally perfect in their simpleness, like they picked the best things they could make and that's what you get, no complaints there! Get the chocolate brioche if you like dark chocolate.  I can't wait to return to Montreal and Olive et Gourmando!"}
{"text":"Our favorite spot in Old Montreal! You must try the salty ricotta dish ($19). I am not usually a ricotta person, but it is exceptional and comes with a side of the best broccoli I have ever tasted!! We also tried their most popular sandwich, the Cuban, which was great! We went around 3 pm and it was still fairly crowded. They were out of a few items, so go earlier!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was quick and nice. Wish I had more space for bread and coffee."}
{"text":"i'm not sure the wait to sit for brunch is worth it BUT the pastries are divine! The banana chocolate was amazing. Best pastry I had during my trip to both Montreal and Toronto.  The kouign amann at the self titled bakery might have tied it though. Go and order all the pastries and coffee and walk around the shops eating them instead of waiting to sit.  The only thing I would wait for sitting down is the french toast though.  Almost forgot about that - that was amazing."}
{"text":"The cuban panini is the best \"cuban\" sandwich I've tasted. It had a kick, right amount of filling and toasted to perfection. My husband had the poached egg with chorizo and grilled bread which was good as well. They're not cheap but we enjoyed everything we ordered"}
{"text":"Ça a sûrement été dit dans les 300 quelques avis, mais cet endroit fait le meilleur macaroni au fromage (mac 'n cheese) de tout le monde entier!  La portion qu'ils servent paraît petite, mais elle tient au corps et ses saveurs sont concentrées jusqu'au sublime. De plus, il est accompagné de la plus parfumée, savoureuse et complémentaire salade verte qu'il vous aura été donné de manger. Sa légèreté acidulée et son croquant coupe divinement l'onctueuse générosité du macaroni. Enfin, leurs pâtisseries et leurs espressi sont exquis. Mon biscuit au chocolat et noix de Pécan était gigantesque et bien moelleux. J'ai été éberlué par leur machine espresso. Ils ont été en mesure de se payer la plus prestigieuse au monde. La Mirage par Kees van der Westen! Wow!"}
{"text":"Sweet brunch spot with lots of pastries but on the weekend, they dont have a lot of options available for breakfast. We went on a weekday for breakfast and there wasnt a lot of options to choose from..."}
{"text":"'Best bakery in Montreal', that's what our horse carriage guide told us. And it was true. We tried cheese croissant, almond croissant, cinnamon bun, strawberry biscuit (though it's more like a scone). All are fantastic! I liked the strawberry biscuit because it was moist and not so sweet. The croissants are very good too but they are better to be had fresh. We bought some to take away and they didn't turn out to be as nice."}
{"text":"This cozy cafe at the corner of St. Paul and St. Pierre is absolutely wonderful and always pushing great food! The menu is simple, but each item is detailed to perfection, giving your taste buds one hell of a trip. The atmosphere is busy, loud, and fun. The service is attentive and helpful. The presentation of the food, as well as the chef's making the food, is visually appetizing and great. As a corner cafe with tons of windows and a packed interior, Olive et Gourmando makes for great people watching too!   My recommendations would be the Cajun Chicken and the Cuban (most popular) sandwiches! They're fantastic. I can't wait to come back and test out more of what they have to offer. Everything looks absolutely delectable.   Go, go, go! NOW! Seriously though... go."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!! Seriously, this was one of my favorite places to have lunch while visiting Montreal. They have the best paninis and the soup I had was scrumptious!   I highly recommend the \"Gustavo\" panini. The soup of the day was a Chicken & Cauliflower soup that had a hint of spice. It was sooooooo good! The servers were super nice too! This is a perfect little cafe and worth the wait. Can't wait to revisit. Awesome lunch!"}
{"text":"If you don't mind a long wait, order The Cubain and pair it with their Elixir Iced Tea with a shot of bourbon. Excellent stuff."}
{"text":"A line out the door is always a good sign. Food was really good and the atmosphere is excellent. We sat at a bar by the window and watched the passerby's. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The salads here are really good, and they give you a big portion of delicious, high quality ingredients. Service is fast. You have to order at the counter and then sit down and wait for your food. They were very attentive and kind. My purse fell on the floor and was misplaced at another table, but they found it for me. Lots of well dressed people come here. Tasty pastries, great drink menu!   We got each of the croissants - chocolate croissant was very tasty. Also got the salad with a goat cheese dressing - SO yummy but a bit too much dressing."}
{"text":"YUM I really liked this place, I had a plate that had some veggie quinoa combo that was like a party in my mouth. I dont remember what my boyfriend had cuz to be honest, I was busy...but I remember he liked it too! I deducted one star for the baked good because although the flavors were nice we had like a ginger cherry scone and something else, they were crumbling like crazy and to be honest Ive had better. But the decor and the place is sooo cozy you just want to curl up in there and pet a cat. Dont ask me why, thats just how I feel."}
{"text":"Recommended by a local and co-worker. \"Don't let the wait scare you\" she said. Apprehensive by her comment, I rolled in solo at noon on a Wednesday. I was seated immediately. The wait staff speaks in French and English. They were overly  nice and accommodating. I ordered the Soupe de jour -yummy culinary concoction with sausage AND \"the Cubain\". A hot toasted flat bread with sliced seasoned pork, perfectly selected melted cheese and pickled mayonnaise. Delicious beyond delicious. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"The Very Petit Portion of fresh, good french food!  Not enough for somebody from Etats-Unis!"}
{"text":"This spot is definitely way more hyped up than it should be.  There are many other non-touristy spots in this part of Montreal to get yummy coffee and pastries.  I took my young daughter for a little breakfast date this morning.  The staff was fine, but the manager, or someone who I believed to be a manager, was surprisingly rude to me, for no apparent reason.  Her rudeness left a bad feeling with me, but I tried not to ruin the moment with my daughter.  From what I understand locals don't frequent this spot...more for tourists."}
{"text":"The Skinny: really great pastries including the almond croissants and the chocolate brioches (4) The service, if dining in, can be confusing because you have to order everything at the back counter.  Unfortunately, the restaurant is claustrophobic, and noisy. They also don't take credit cards unless you have over a $10 purchase (3) Overall, this is a great little breakfast/brunch/lunch spot. If you can't take the crowd, get your stuff to go (4).  After discovering this place on Yelp, I ventured to this cafe at least 3 times during my short stay. I ate in once but after experiencing the crowd decided to do take-out afterwards.  This place is definitely hopping. Primarily a breakfast/lunch place, every time I went here, it was literally brimming with people. At 2:30 pm, you had to wait 10-15 minutes to get a table for three.   Service is confusing so I'll give you the low-down. If you decide to eat in, your waitress will hand you a meal ticket which you are supposed to bring to the back sandwich counter. Order all your drinks, pastries and sandwiches there and they will bring out your order to you afterwards. If you want to add anything to your meal, you just go to the back counter and let the server know what you want and they will add it to your tab. When you are done, you line up at the pastry/to-go line and pay there.  All I can say is pastries are king here. I had three different types of brioche and almond croissant here. Everything was pretty good here. Personally I think the best of the bunch was the chocolate brioche. The lovely pastry was brimming with Valharona chocolate encased with a flaky, buttery bread. Chocoholic porn. 'Nuff said.  Almond croissants were also delicious however were a little on the thinner side. The maple/nut and banana/chocolate brioches was a little too moist for my taste which was detrimental to the pastry itself. The flavours however were very good despite this which was why this place gets a 4 for food.  On the down side, this place is very crazy. Literally, there is no space in this cafe. So don't expect to have a quiet little snack around here. Noise is at a premium while you'll probably be able to overhear your neighbours conversations. Another con is the credit card policy (no credit card over $10). I also wished they made chai lattes too.  Overall, a great little breakfast/lunch spot in downtown Montreal (4)."}
{"text":"A bit of a line up but definitely worth it.  A pretty good vegetarian selection.  Food is very rich though--so make sure your eyes are not bigger than your stomach."}
{"text":"Tried cajun chicken sandwich. Loved it.  This is coming from someone who doesn't like sandwiches that much.  The sandwich was pre-made and I lugged it around for two hours before I ate it in the train. Still, it was amazing.  Pricy but worth every penny."}
{"text":"I'm still thinking about the glorious 20 minutes or so while I was eating my amazing ricotta tarting form O+G.  We came here thanks to all the bread Yelp reviews and guidance.  And boy are you Yelpers on point!  We ordered:  Banana and chocolate brioche -  delicious! Great with your cup of coffee  Poached egg in your face panini - it tastes much better than it looks.  Sooooo good.  Panini toasted to perfection.  Egg and contents all the right amount and cooked great  House made ricotta tartine - WoW.  Just WoW.  One of the most unique, delicious, and filling breakfast / brunch dishes I've ever had (and I'm from NYC).  It was perfectly mounted with squash, English cucumber, honey, sunflower seed, walnuts, radish, - PERFECTION.  If you Are in Montreal or plan to visit - please do your taste buds a favor and go to this place!  We came here on a rainy Saturday morning at around 1030am and there was about a 35 minute wait but they called our name In about 20 minutes.  Service was great as well.  FIVE STARS hands down."}
{"text":"3.5* The food is soooooo goood. But the prices are way expensive. Like much more than I think is worth it.  This is why I would not give it a four or five star- I would definitely come here and try most things on the menu once.  I would bring people here from out of town. But I certainly could not justify making this a regular spot with prices like these."}
{"text":"The hype is real. The lineup here was around 1hr when we arrived at approximately 11am. Give the choice of sitting in a sunlight filled bar seat or waiting for another 30mins, we settled for the extra dose of vitamin D.  We ordered the poached egg on your face panini, oquf coquette, caesar, and the elixir + bourbon. The panini was great. The bread was crunchy and fresh while the slow roasted tomatoes complemented the spicy poached eggs perfectly. My companion wasn't too impressed with her oeuf coquette. She felt that there was not enough flat bread to finish the coquette.  Be warned if you are a lightweight, the drinks here are very strong. They put an interesting spin on their caesar as it tastes more like a vegetable cocktail than the traditional tomato beverage. The bourbon was nice and strong.   The service was okay, but given how popular and crowded this place is, I decided to be lenient in my review on that.  We saw all the raving reviews about their almond croissants, but they were all sold out before 11am. On the bright side, this gives us a reason to visit here again next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"This gem was a block from where I was staying. After passing it the first few days, I decided to stop in and was blown away by my latte and ricotta cheese/honey/orange rind with toast breakfast I had. I'll be back before I leave!"}
{"text":"Great place to have brunch.   It's pretty busy (even during snowstorms)  Food took quite a bit to come so we order a pastry while waiting for the warm food. (It was really good).  Some things can be a bit too spicy, but other than that everything was delicious. Sandwiches are pretty big. So if you're not too hungry, or you don't eat a lot, they're shareable.  Dirty Chai was interesting, and hot chocolate was good.   Service is friendly and changed one of the orders for no charge because it was too spicy."}
{"text":"Awesome staff, delicious bites, strong coffee, quaint atmosphere.  No disappointment here...other than I wish I had enough appetite to order the lovely fruit bowl!"}
{"text":"parfait pour les patisseries et les paninis, très achalandé"}
{"text":"Spotted this place while walking in the area. It was packed so I figured it must be good. Got there at about 11:30 and it was a 20 minute wait. We were a party of 3. Ordered the poached egg panini and was informed that it was sold out. Ordered the mac and cheese for my son and they were out of that too. We ordered 2 orange juices and they only had one. That's kind of embarrassing for them to be out of these basic items by noon. No planning? I had the Cuban panini. It was not bad but not great either. Very salty. So much salt covers up the flavors of whatever you are eating. The salad was also very salty. Had I known it would be like that I would have asked for the dressing on the side. I'm not from Montreal so maybe that's how they like their salads but I've never had one that salty anywhere else. Ingredients were good but again with so much salt it's hard to enjoy them. Service was very good and friendly. Don't understand the high ratings but perhaps the sold out things on the menu are better. I can only review what I tried and was not impressed. Prices are also very expensive for what you get. Bill including tip was $85 for 3 sandwiches 2 salads and one orange juice. Had we all had drinks it would have been nearly $100 Canadian. In expensive cities like NY and Paris you can get better sandwiches and salads for less than half that. You have been warned."}
{"text":"The wait today was 45 minutes so we chose take-out sandwiches. The Chicken (Poulet) was absolutely delish! My hubby had the Vegan and son had the Grilled Cheese. It was gooey and warm! Check in at the front and enjoy the smells & view of the bakery.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said?? Easily the best food I've had in Montreal. I had the mac & cheese, which was perfect. The mushrooms gave it a wonderful savory taste and the texture was something I didn't know I wanted until I had it. The accompanying salad was light enough on the dressing and very, very fresh. Well worth the trip downtown for me and I will be back.  The only issue was price. My lunch for one of the mac and cheese, a small soda, and an almond croissant came to about $21. There was a lunch rush but as a single, I didn't have to wait at all for a seat at the counter."}
{"text":"Food was great, had the Cuban sandwich. Service was friendly. Cashing out is awkward."}
{"text":"Graciously made room for our party of 6 with very little fuss. Only complaint is that they were out of about half of the sandwiches on the menu and did not tell us until we were about to order. I had the cesar salad with the yogurt chicken which had a great balance of bacon, cheese, lettuce, kale, capers and croutons. The place itself was so cozy on the inside. The decor was fabulous and everything tasted very fresh. Great find and would love to go back!"}
{"text":"Dope sandwiches. Super quick service. A little expensive but hey. Better than every other cheap restaurant in the neighbourhood!!!"}
{"text":"The beet soup was one of the best soups I have ever had. It was a long wait, the food was so good I did not mind."}
{"text":"The best panini I've ever had!  (Make that paninis) Yelpers you know when you get something special and must write about it!   This is/was the best restaurant we tried in Montreal.  The food is delicious!!!  Everything is fresh and made there and you can taste it in every bite.  The place is cozy with small cafe tables, crowded with people, the delicious smells dancing in my nostrils.  You will want to eat everything you see, I wish I had more time in Montreal I would have gone back again...next time! My tastebuds were having a party and wanted more!  Mr. Miami panini 5 stars The egg panini 5 stars Cuban panini 3 stars, although tasty compare to the other two it lacked flavor (suggestion ad spicy mustard and real pickles to compliment the spicy pickle mayo) Green salad 5 stars (best salad I've ever had)   They had run out of croissants...I really wanted one!  Service 5 stars Food 10 stars if I could give it Price 5 stars Ambiance 5 stars Overall experience 5 stars s  Omg, O&G, I'm going to miss this place!  The Real Foodie  You had me at Panini"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here while in Montreal with our two year old son. It was after nap snack time (aka 3:30pm). We had to wait 15 minutes to get a table. It was worth the wait! The tables were all crammed together, but we still sat comfortably. Everyone spoke English. The service was great! The food superb. I had the almond croissant, my husband had their grilled cheese (so much better than a normal grilled cheese) and my son had a banana nut cookie. They even brought him milk! No complaints here! We will definitely stop in again the next time we are in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Highly rated place in the old port. I would say somewhat overrated, and prices are on the touristy side, but a bustling place with pretty good food.  Among what we tried, the egg panini (good), the cha-cha chia bowl (excellent!),  the raspberry lemonade (OK), the hail caesar (their take on the bloody mary - decent), and one of their pastries (a chausson), an apple turnover which was good. Our service was decent given how busy they were."}
{"text":"Great tasting sandwiches, salads, soups, etc. Be prepared to wait though. Fortunately, there's enough shops around to walk through while you wait. Parking can be a bit tough too, but the food definitely make up for it."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, so it's always -always- packed, I guess that could justify to some extent why the staff seems overworked and stressed out. Don't expect service with a smile, especially from the cashiers.   If you are willing to sacrifice a friendly service for great food then it's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Went by here in the afternoon around 4pm to grab a quick bite and a cup of tea and it was wonderful on every level. Amazing service, delicious Cubano and good tea!"}
{"text":"I LOVE O & G. So much in fact, that I wouldn't mind moving in. Yes, it's THAT good.   So first thing's first; do not expect to arrive and saunter in to the table of your choice because that's not going to happen. O & G is packed all the time, and there is almost always a line-up to get in. That said, I usually go for breaky or lunch, so it's possible that late afternoons is quieter but don't count on it.   Everything is made fresh, daily, from the salads to the baked goods, to the amazing ginger-lemon iced tea (they really need to offer this in a larger size!). They make a mean latte, and also offer wine (I think it's organic, but I'm not sure). As well, you can buy some of their spicy nuts and jams. The service is OK but not great. It can be very slow and the wait staff don't always think to come and check in once you've been seated so if you're in dire need of coffee, order while you're in line and you can get your fix while waiting for a table.   My favorites include:  #24 salad - made with raw veggies, roasted peanuts, shallots, tofu, basil, cilantro and mint, served on rice noodles and accompanied by a lovely sweet and sour dressing. Now, the last time I was there I could swear the noodles were buckwheat but I could be making that up in my head.  Anyway, this salad is fresh and incredibly flavourful and leaves your belly feeling just right (read: room for dessert).   The Gustavo - holy mother of God, this is good. Garlic grain-fed chicken, grilled onions, balsamic marinated portobello mushrooms, Havarti cheese and maple dijonnaise sauce. Wow. This sandwich can be pretty filling so you may have to take that dessert to go.    Cajun Chicken sandwich - this one is also made with grain-fed chicken and includes guacamole, cajun spices, tomatoes and mango. Equally as delicious as The Gustavo, but packs less of a punch (which is not a bad thing!). I'll eat anything with avocado so this sandwich makes me feel all happy on the inside.   Sadly, since i have been tasked with avoiding wheat recently, I opted for the Viva Las Vegan sandwich on my last visit (a great option for all you vegetarians and vegans out there). I loved this one and felt pretty stuffed by the time I was finished. It's got marinated tofu, dill pickles, hummus, caramelized onions, crushed olives, arugula and is served on organic bread. By the way - their breads are like a taste of Heaven, so fluffy and thick. Of course, I ate everything BUT the bread but we don't need to talk about that.  If you're a fan of chocolate like me, try their 'Extraordinary Brownie'  or 'The Attack of the Killer Chocolate' cookie (triple chocolate, people!). Both are incredible and will satisfy any chocoholic.   Now, GO!"}
{"text":"Who knows Montreal, knows Olive & Gourmando.  An Old Montreal gem promising the most gratifying sandwhiches, warm home-made soups and fresh elegant salads.  And it is understood that no matter how full you are, a dessert is a must have! With the most enticing selection of baked goods all made in house, you will surely be seduced! This is the go to place for local Old Montrealers, as well as my ultimate recommendation for tourists looking for a great neighbourhood treasure."}
{"text":"Great service, the food was delicious. Best croissant I've had so far in Montréal. We also had the breakfast panini. I would love to come back and try some more of their lovely pastries and the yogurt and granola bowl. Perfect for a light brunch."}
{"text":"WOW. Wow, wow, wow. This place is really quite wonderful. The menu is simple and quite limited but absolutely delicious. Fresh and interesting, very well thought out. I loved the brisket sandwich and the udon salad. The bakes goodies are to die for. This little café really blew me away!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an awesome cafe/ resto place to grab and go in Old Montreal, this Olive & Gourmando is a perfect spot for this. This cozy eatery has amazing baked goods that will leave you smiling :). The only draw back is that it can be pretty crowded especially during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Yum. Popular place. Worth the wait. Great atmosphere also. Get there early or they'll be sold out of croissants."}
{"text":"The-best-place in Montreal for breakfast and brunch. Oh wow, I still remember the taste of their numerous and beautiful pastries I tried with my boyfriend. Flaky, buttery, fruity deliciousness in buns, croissants, danishes and donuts. Everything was delicious and I wish I tried everything else. Place was super busy when we got there so we grabbed food to go instead. Get there early if you want to sit down or be prepare to wait."}
{"text":"Although was packed with people, I was still seated quickly and taking care of by the waitstaff.  The brunch menu was small, what the options are complex in terms of flavor.   I ordered the Poached on Your Face panini and the French toast.  Both were delicious, with the Panini sandwich gave me a foodgasm!!  It was SO GOOD!  The juice from the red peppers mixed with the fat from the prosciutto, egg, cheese and butter to create a gooey goodness located between two crunchy pressed slicee of bread.  As soon as I bit into it and the flavors hit my taste buds, I was in foodie heaven.  My only regret is that I didn't get to try the pastries! Next time!!!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by our friend from Montreal but we were rather put off by the inflexibility of the menu and waitstaff. All we asked for was the grilled cheese panini without the onions as my 12 year old is seriously opposed to them. Sorry we can't remove them as all the sandwiches are premise and then grilled to order. I may not be the greatest home cook but a grilled cheese panini would not take much more than cheese and bread. That said the summer salad was very fresh and quite tasty. The Cuban sandwich had great flavor but a bit greasy.  My takeaway if you are or have a picky eater this place is not for you"}
{"text":"Great food.  Nice drinks. Amazing servers.  You can't go wrong.  Worth the short (30min) wait."}
{"text":"Sandwich déjeuner exquis!  Soyez patient pour une place, mais ça en vaut la peine!  Leur café à lui seul vaut le détour."}
{"text":"Visited Montreal for the weekend & this place was deff a great to end It. There aren't too many vegan options however the options here are amazing! I had the vegan 3.0 sandwich & the lentil soup! Really good place for under 12 dollars ! The lentil soup was beyond amazing BTW !   There are no vegan pastry options! However there pastries did look great ! Would deff rate this place 5 starts if they had  more vegan options & pastries -"}
{"text":"Would give 3.5 or 4 stars for food, but rounded down because our order got mixed up twice.   First, was the drinks - we didn't want shots in our lemonade or iced tea, and they both came with shots of gin. I asked to switch mine to one with no shot, and my friend kept one with the shot cause he didn't want it to go to waste. Our server had offered to charge the regular price for both drinks, but when the bill came, the alcoholic one was $12 and the regular was $4.50.   We had also ordered two sandwiches on whole wheat, and they both came on white. We didn't even bother letting our server know, as we didn't want to waste the sandwiches.  Besides that, I thought the ambiance was great and the food was good. We ordered the roast beef panini sandwich and the cuban pork one. Hands down preferred the roast beef one. Would've loved to try the cajun chicken sandwich too, as it was on a different thicker fluffier bun (the table beside us ordered that one and it looked awesome).  Got some pastries to go - berry square and strawberry rhubarb muffin. The berry square was really good, the muffin was ok.  All in all, I think this is a neat place, but not sure if I would wait in line again for a table here. (We went at around 2pm on a Friday, and the wait was half an hour. Can't imagine what the wait time would be at noon!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this place for very long time. When I entered, this place looks really adorable even though it's super small. Everything around you is wooden. Very rustic feel! I was seated by the bar. It was nice, and comfy. I even get to talk to a person sitting next to me. The ambiance is cozy.  My hostess was very nice and amiable. My server seemed overwhelmed because the place was full and super busy. Funny thing is, every time I would speak in French she would respond to me in English. I start talking in French automatically when I sense the person has a French accent; I don't why she kept answering me in English, because it was clear she is struggling with the language, unless she needs to practice.  I ordered oeuf coquette from the brunch menu. It was not that good but it wasn't that bad either. The portion was perfect, but it tasted a bit too salty for my taste. What hurts is that this average size dish is about 20$. Can you believe it???!   Anyway, I always wanted to try this place... here I got to finally."}
{"text":"Dang Montreal!  Why is your Saturday treating me so rough?  Despite facing a full restaurant in what is the most touristy area in all of Montreal, we wanted to at least give this place a go.  Alas, when we went in to put our name down on the list we were told to go outside.  But, don't you want our name?  No, just go outside.  With 50 people waiting, how the h*ll does that work?  I don't think my face is that memorable and I'm sure you WILL NOT be finding/remembering me out there regardless. Then someone behind the counter yelled right in my ear 'everyone needs to go wait outside now!'  Eh, with sh*tty service before the experience even begins why bother?  Go up to Little Italy or similar ilk to find a) better attitudes b) less crowding c) places that actually welcome your business and d) places that have seating systems that handle heavy wait loads in a timely, efficient and friendly manner.  No opinion on food since we never got any and I, for one, won't be giving them a second chance to find out how it is..."}
{"text":"Located on the edge of the old port.  This place feels like you just walked into to Cafe in Paris.  Great espresso and the sweets are great.  They have a lunch menu as well.   Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"-TIP INCLUDED ON BILL-  Decided to come for lunch Time with a friend it was snowing and packed which is always a good sign as long as you aren't all squished in.   We got a seat at the window with a bar table style which was the last open seat. I was skeptical at first but it was beautiful at the big window with the snow falling. Reminded me a bit of Paris (love the old port.) great view !  Staff was friendly and smiley and knew her wine which is always a plus.  It's not a cheap place two salads and a sandwich a small hot chocolate and wine was 70 $! BUT they added the tip to the bill which we forgot about when we read the menu so we left 80, not a huge deal but do be aware this time you don't make the same mistake as us.  The Cesar salad with chicken has kale in it and a light dressing (home made dressing) and lean thinly sliced chicken with bacon and croutons and capers of course.  The Cuban sandwich was really good had this pickled mayo and thinly sliced meat and cheese. The salad 24 was a tofu salad with Asian noodles and peanut butter dressing. It's a really good salad if you want something light and healthy."}
{"text":"Olive et Gourmando, how do I love thee... I've been a patron of Oilive et Gourmando (in the sense of literally having spent thousands of dollarinos there!) for over three years now. I 'm a regular, so it's hard for me to write a totally unbiased review. If you don't know O&G, it's unique among breakfast/lunch cafés in Montreal. The atmosphere reminds one of a New York or LA hipster café, but unlike the latter, O&G is not pretentious in the least, and everyone is treated in a totally egalitarian way no matter who you are and how often you come here. I hate places with attitude about how cool they are, and how lucky you are to be hanging out there. There's none of that BS at O&G, and it is cool without trying. It's first come first serve, and you'll wait at least 20-30 minutes for a table between Noon and 1. If you can't stand the wait, head straight past the line of folks waiting up front, and continue straight back to the glass vitrines, where you can order to go. The great thing about O&G is they make their own everything, and they only make just enough for each day, so you're guaranteed things will be fresh. The soups are usually great, although having eaten so many of them I notice that the flavor profiles tend to be repeated; they are usually spicy with a good bit of acidity. My main critique of O&G, that the flavors can be a bit one-note, is also praise, because they do things with incredible consistency and high-standards. The salads are better than anywhere else I've tried in town, and you won't find any mushy or blackened leaves here. Try the Caesar salad con pollo, which is a great mix of bacon, capers, and parmesan with romaine and kale. Also a classic is the No. 24, a good vegan noodle salad. For sandwiches, the spicy cajun chicken with its great blend of mango and guacamole is \"nummers\". Another favorite, especially in winter, is the Cubain, with its decadent hot, cheesy, meaty goodness. The pastries are all exceedingly rich, and at times too heavy for my palate, but the brownie and the Belgian chocolate pecan cookie are great and will put you in chocolate / butter overload territory. The brioche is way too heavy though. Coffee is very good here too, and they have a nice tea selection. All in all, O&G is a great place to have lunch and / or spend a morning in a buzzing yet cozy place with excellent, friendly service, and attention to detail."}
{"text":"Envie d'un brunch dans un lieu chaleureux ou vous pourrez passer un moment agréable? Ne cherchez plus !!  La limonade maison, framboises et citron un délice, on en boirais des litres et des litres.  Personnellement je me suis laissée tenter par le \"Poached egg on your face\" un panini très  très  bon mais il faut aimer les épices.  Et un granola pour mon ami mais avec le yaourt a l'érable.  Le choix de viennoiseries est juste hallucinant. Meme après le panini j'étais tentée dans tester une juste par gourmandise ! Hâte de tester une prochaine fois leur sandwich du midi à emporter et déguster sur le vieux port.   Tout vous fera envie j'en suis certaine alors foncez. Et n'ayez pas peur du monde qu'il  peut avoir. Cela en vaut vraiment le coup."}
{"text":"Just go and eat! long wait time but its worth it!!! I didnt recommend o&g to others bc i wanted to keep this gem all to myself!!!! Since it got more popular.. and right on old port.. more ppl and more tourists come so wait time is longer so its annoying but its all worth it. Bc its so GOOD!!! JUST GO AND ENJOY"}
{"text":"Wonderful brunch! We had just arrived to Montreal and were suggested to stop by! Definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"Holy moly it's SO good. Panini will never be the same again. A whole other level of goodness!!! Must try when youre in Montreal!!! Had the Cubain and a latte."}
{"text":"Lovely, lovely little lunch spot!  The wait can be long (or they will tell you it's long and turns out to be quick!). Order in the back and food/drink is brought to your table. Very interesting lunch menu . . . good selection . . . nice wine/beer. Very delectable little treats at the front where you pay your bill.  Staff are nice, hip, and available!"}
{"text":"Pas mal du tout! Nous avons goûté le poulet cajun et les oeufs brouillette, et avons été contents de nos choix :) Le poulet cajun vient avec de la mangue et de l'avocat (en portions généreuses), miam!! Ambiance chaleureuse, décor en bois, agréables odeurs de viennoiseries Je dirais que le seul hic est la line up qui peut freiner certains, et aussi le monde (c'est plein!) Mais sinon, c'est un must à Montréal! :)"}
{"text":"Walked over to Olive et Gourmando for breakfast as I had read several Yelp reviews about it.    While I won't agree with it being \"the country's greatest\" almond croissant... Their croissant was quite tasty and unique from other croissants I've tasted.  Their almond croissant is definitely denser than most. Very buttery and it is a very oblong shape... Almost not resembling the familiar crescent moon shape.  The best way to describe it's distinct taste is that the butter appears to be churned from \"raw\" cow's milk as there is a sharp dairy taste to it.  But it was a very creamy, almost creme-fraiche-like type of dairy freshness.  It is not a flaky croissant, but rather a buttery type.  I also tried the pecan and raisin brioche. It was not teeth-wrenchingly sweet, and had just a tinge of tartness which I would guess comes from a raisin-y syrup or glaze. The brioche was very buttery, flaky on the outer \"rings\" and dense an buttery in the center.  I got a cup of cappuccino to wake me up. The foam was creamy without being too heavy. It wad a great cappuccino!  I also thought I should mention their fruit bowl as its not the ol' boring one you'd see in Toronto. Olive et Gourmando's fruit bowl comes with fresh figs, julienned apples, passion fruit, mandarin orange - just to name a few.   You get assigned a table. Are given an order form with your table number scribbled down which you bring to the counter, and they will bring you your food after you order. Then at the end you pay at the counter. Only negative is that its cash only.  A great place to grab brekkie.  Wish we had more places like this in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I recently dined at Olive & Gourmado for Sunday brunch during a girl's weekend.  The place was recommended to us by a local and I saw several good reviews on food blogs.   The establishment has an inviting, relaxed feel to it and the windows and doors were open since it was a nice day.  It's not huge but there's a good amount of seating inside - some tables and some communal high tops/counter seating.  They do not take reservations so we had to wait about 45 minutes to get a table.  There's lot of cute shopping nearby to kill the time.  I had a very unique French toast dish for my meal - it was covered with a cream that wasn't overly sweet and seasonal fruit and pumpkin seeds.  It was very tasty.  My friends both had the tartine which was also very unique.  We also tried a homemade iced tea and raspberry lemonade which were both delicious.  Everything there was very fresh and it was a very enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Best paninis in town! Crispy and never soggy! Must try: chipotle panini!  If you wanna go for brunch, make sure you get there before 11:30, if not you'll have to be waiting outside! Or during summer time, what you can do is order take out and go eat on the grass field in old port, could be quite romantic! :p"}
{"text":"Best fresh squeezed orange juice I've ever had! From the drinks to the food to the pastries everything was excellent. We got seated right away and the waitress was very nice and attending. This place is a must"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast spot. They clearly care about the quality of their food, and you could taste that. The service was excellent, especially as we were there on GP weekend and the place was busting at the seams. I def recommend their sunrise vert cocktail and the Tartine for brunch is out of this world."}
{"text":"Worth the wait! Was with a group of 5. We all agreed 5 stars. This little eat in restaurant and cafe has delectable pastries, breakfast menu, and lunch menu. You can order mimosas too!"}
{"text":"Un charmant snack bar de luxe! Ils ont la touche des saveurs même dans leur petite salade verte. Le sandwich sans viande est fameux et son pain est exceptionnel. L'ambiance est très agréable et le personnel est très sympathique."}
{"text":"Brunch done right!   I was visiting Montreal for the weekend and decided to try this place which got a lot of great reviews.   I ordered the oeuf coquette ($17). I love this dish so much because it has very simple ingredients but they are all fresh!   Tomatoes were fresh. Eggs are perfectly done with a runny yolk. The feta and chorizo really added unique flavors to the dish and complemented the tomatoes really well.   You know you find a great place when they can turn fresh and simple ingredients into something extraordinary. Combining the right textures and flavors of the different ingredients is like a symphony in my mouth!   The down side to this place is that it is crowded and Can get noisy. It opens at 9am and when I get there at 9:45 there was already a line up."}
{"text":"Stopped in Sunday morning for brunch. The wait was excruciating considering there is no room to wait inside and it was blistering cold out. 30min felt like 3 hours. Either way, once we were seated I ordered the choc banana brioche and their infamous panini as well as a cortado. The brioche was far better than what I expected and was huge, definitely enough for 2. The panini was delicious, perfect balance of spice and savory. The coffee however was a big letdown. Owner should invest in better and fresher beans."}
{"text":"Delish, hip, happening and fresh. Worth the wait but it can be so hard to sit tight on a cold winter's day!"}
{"text":"A great spot for French pastries, tasty food and great coffee and tea. Located in old Montreal, a very popular place for locals and tourists. There was a constant line but the staff is very efficient and the wait was not long.  The Cuban panini was the best panini I ever had. Full of flavour and crunch. The gooey cheese and pickled mayonnaise made the sandwich great.  The cream of mushroom soup was earthy and full of mushroomy flavour. It was a great accompaniment to the panini.  When in old Montreal, this place is a must try.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The hype for this place is real. Showed up too early so my aunt & I went to the cathedral first. By the time we returned, the place was packed & there was a line. It only took 15min or so for us to be seated because there was two of us (so if there's more of you, I'd show up early to make sure there's a seat).  I adore this place. The food was delicious. While I am giving this place a 5 because of the food, I'd give the service a 4.1 because our waiter had a senior moment and forgot to put our order into the system so we waited longer for our food as a result. If it wasn't for my aunt asking to check up on the order, we would have waited there a lot longer.   But it was worth the wait. The panini was delicious and my stomach is crying just remembering it because I want it again.   Definitely another must go to while in Montreal"}
{"text":"Oh my, this place. I don't even know how to begin.  At least 3 friends recommended O+G to us when we mentioned about our trip to Montreal. One of them even went back 3 times on their last visit. We had to go, right? We were completed shocked by how good the food was. That includes the sandwiches, salads, pastries and drinks.   So what happened? In a short few days trip to Montreal, we went back the second time just to have other food on the menu. It was one of the best restaurant experiences we'd had in Montreal, or in fact, the world. Sounds exaggerated? I know but we do feel that way. Get used to it.  We tried a bunch of sandwiches: Le Cubaine, Cajun chicken, vegan and pomodoro. We also ordered the extravagant tomato plate with this crazily addictive crouton bits drenched in sun-dried tomato infused olive oil. They are beyond good, the flavour of the dishes screamed extravagant. They have a full spectrum of tastes and flavours.  The special drinks: sweet lemon tea and vanilla strawberry lemonade, were both excellent companion to the off-the-chart flavourful sandwiches.  Be sure to go before 2-2:30 on a weekday because some sandwiches will be sold out around that time.  I would not mind taking a 7-hour drive to Montreal just to eat a panini at O+G, like, today."}
{"text":"Beautiful brunch spot in old Montreal! During our three-day stay in Montreal, my friend and I came here twice, and we wished we had discovered it sooner!  The first time we were there at around 10am, and it was already very crowded. Thankfully the turnover was faster than I expected. My friend and I tried the poached egg panini and the cubain panini, both were hot and crispy on the outside, and rich with melted cheese on the inside, highly recommended!  The next day we came back for some baked goods takeaway. The almond croissant was perfect, possibly the best I've ever had, and the chocolate & banana brioche was rich, sweet and delicious.  This place is definitely one of the highlights of our Montreal trip. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Came to Olive et Gourmando for a quick lunch near the Old Port.    The place was packed of people on a beautiful day. I found the layout to be a bit confusing, I guess that adds to the charm here.    Tables by the Pastry display, Tables near the bathroom door, Tables along the line to wait to make your order in the back, waiters squeezing by, patrons hitting the seated diners trying to squeeze by. It was Perfect chaos, it felt hip in some way, the tightness and the amount of Louis Vuitton bags I spotted.  Waiters asked while waiting in line if we wanted to be seated, the wait was 20 mins for a table so I passed and ordered in the back.  The chalkboards on the top left display the fresh Sandwiches of the day that are already made. There are signs hanging under the menu items telling you ' Trop Tard ; Too Late!' Yep that good.  I ordered the Brie and Caramelized onions, with a homemade ketchup compote $9.50 (I really wanted the chicken..sold out!). My fiancé ordered the Cuban Sandwich ; Cuban - pressed very thin with Pancetta, braised pork & Gruyere cheese $11    After making the order in the back you then go to the front to pay and the girls are making espressos and lattes, and bagging up treats for hungry sweet-toothed customers.  Couldn't resist buying the Huge Triple Chocolate Cookie. Then you wait. There are benches outside and in front of the cash.  People ordering coffees with need of sugar or stir sticks, have to excuse the waiting benched customers to move for their self-custom blended coffee, again chaos. There has to be a better layout or is this charm?   We waited some time before our ready made sandwiches were put in a Press,  Cut in half , then Bagged without side of homemade Ketchup, the Huge Cookie, and some napkins for us to go.   As we walked to our Hotel the bag started to get translucent from the grease, the deliciousness was screaming to get out, a great sign. The Brie had a generous portion of the cheese and melted on the caramelized onions it was perfection. No need for the ketchup but tried it anyways and it was good, it tasted like a fruit chutney.   The Cuban was amazing. There was Pancetta, Braised pork, and Gruyere cheese a beautiful marriage. The Braised pork was unexpectedly the star to me and had soo much flavour it Made this sammie. The crunchy bites were increasingly tasty.  I was full and tried the Triple chocolate cookie. Wow, the generous amounts of Real Chocolate chips is soo good, it was an experience, it did not disappoint!  I Love Chocolate.  O&G set the bar high. The best sandwich we had and made others eaten from now on difficult to beat!  A MUST must try if in the Old Port area"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!!   I cannot recommend it enough, and it's no surprise that it's on every \"best place to eat\" list out there online.   Reviews don't lie and neither does the food. I went here on one of the coldest days of the year and was a little nervous that there would be a wait. There was, but not for long. After about 15-20 minutes for them to call and let us know that a table was available - not long at all if you're accustomed to typical brunch culture, lines rounding street corners.   We were seated quickly thereafter and got our cappucino's, which were amazing!! (I would recommend getting the large size if you're going to have a meal as well). The menu is small but everything on it sounds amazing! I ended up getting the poached egg in your face panini which was to die for!! I cannot recommend it enough. Definitely a must-try. It has the perfect amount of spice, just enough to add flavour, and the cheese was just perfectly melted. The portion sizes here are also great and will keep you full. My mom ordered the salty ricotta! The ricotta was so fresh and lightly sweetened with the honey and orange zest. The bread they served with it, perfectly crusty.   After reading much about the croissants and how amazing they were we ordered the almond croissant as a side and damn, it did not disappoint. It was perfectly flaky and buttery. I can barely describe it without wanting another. All I can say is: ORDER IT!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best panini to get is the Mr. Miami. You won't regret it.  Tried the chocolate and banana brioche and the strawberry lemonade. The brioche is big and was mildly fresh when I got it around lunch time. Banana was closer to the middle of it. The lemonade was good but not worth the price.   Really go here for the panini. The salsa sauce is amazing, very fruity. It's worth it."}
{"text":"OG is the original gangsta when it comes to tasty sandwiches.  I think they own the meat & bread racket in town.  And I'm happy they do.  The \"panini pomme\" that parted my lips began a short-lived love affair with my mouth too torrid to recant in delicious detail on these all-ages pages.  Ham, roasted garlic aioli, walnut butter, smoked Prince Edward Island cheddar finished with mandolin-thin slices of Quebec apples  Suffice to say it was \"sex in mouth\" as a friend put not-so-delicately.  And this was the backup option pointed out to me on the sandwich menu, above left of the deli case at back, after the highly touted cubain was sold out at 4pm the rainy afternoon of my visit.  The shop was quiet; Only two of ten or so tables occupied.  The crew were prepping a quick surprise b-day celebratory break to sing & present a candle-lit cake to a co-worker as I made my way in.    Lighting inside was set on romance level lending appearance of being closed from the outside window.  Staff will seat you if you're staying (and it's so cozy you'll want to), but all sandwiches and viennoiserie (baked pastries) are available for take-away.  Cash, credit ($10 minimum), and debit card ($5 min.) are all accepted.  Sandwiches are between $10-$11, fairly sized and quality-wise unbeatable.  There's no doubt I'll be back for another tasty tryst with these sandwich slingers."}
{"text":"I've had Mac and cheese, vege sandwich, cubano sandwich and some other meals here. Every time it has been amazing. So much flavour. Go during off hours or order to go during peak hours because there will be a lineup."}
{"text":"Love this place and love their sandwiches. But man, it's OVERPOPULATED with tourists. Best time to go is after lunch during the week (that's if your schedule allows it!)"}
{"text":"The chocolate croissants melt in your mouth and your coffee.  Excellent decor. Great staff. Welcoming atmosphere. If your in the old city it's the best way to start your day or to spend a leisurely brunch."}
{"text":"Solid five star place in Montreal Old Quarter. When we went in there late afternoon, there was a little bit of wait. But the food was totally worth the wait. The vegetarian tartine has to be one of the most delicious vegetarian dishes I've had. Layers of fresh veggies, each with their distinct taste, on a bed of nice, crusty bread and a sweet-tart dressing. Perfect summer dish. The brisket sandwich was quite good. Healthy portion of brisket. Pineapple salsa is a somewhat unlikely pairing with brisket but it works."}
{"text":"Un air climatisé serait fortement de mise. Aussi, il y a  sandwich chaud et 3 froid. Il fait 36 dehors et vous manquer de 2 choix de sandwich froid... Planification... 4,50$ pour un jus de 4 oz sans alcool... Abusif... Service très long, mais courtois."}
{"text":"love love LOVE this place.  i don't know if its b/c the tomatoes are so fresh - again something we realized after visiting montreal - the tomatoes are so fresh and good.  like crack - addicting!  i love it so much i want to give it 5 stars and wanted to go back for dinner and the next day for breakfast/brunch.  it is in a completely cute area of old town montreal and has the cutest vibe.  entering the restaurant, you wait in line until someone comes up to you and asks for your name and # in party.  you wait and then get seated at a table.  you then order your food at the counter, give them the paper that the host/hostess gave to you and wait for your food to arrive.  how they know where you are sitting to deliver your food - i still don't know.  i don't remember them giving you a table number.  it has such a cool vibe, ambiance.  very casual with a mix of couples, singles, and families.  service was good and everyone was very friendly.  we ordered the tomato/mozzarella salad, cream of broccoli soup, and a side salad.  all were phenomenal!  the tomato/mozzarella salad had the perfect mix of ingredients.  there were some crunchy crouton type of fixings along with some roasted tomato/olive salsa.  the cream of broccoli was more like a broccolli puree and was not that fatty/creamy.  we also ordered almond croissants to go (as recommended by other yelpers) and a palmier.  we had the croissants the following morning on the plane and they were still completely tasty!  i cannot wait to go back to olive et gourmando...i would love to eat breakfast here every day if i could."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing ambiance and food! Long wait times on Sunday, but the Tartine was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Super super super super delicious. I absolutely love this place. A must if you're in the Old Port and hankering for a sandwich, a cup of coffee, and the tastiest brownies around."}
{"text":"Super cute cafe with a great menu and wonderful staff. On a Saturday around lunch, we waited for about 10 minutes for a table, which I have to say I'm quite fine with. I wouldn't want to bring a big group here though, since I heard them quoting waits of closer to 45 minutes to people with more than about 4 people.  We both had paninis, which were very good. I think that if I ever came back here, I would want to try something a little more interesting, but that's not because the paninis were bad - there were just so many great things on the menu. A little pricey, but I think it's just since the whole area seems pretty upscale.  I didn't get any baked goods, but I totally lusted after them, and I would for sure try some if I came back."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the food has always been quite good, especially for an old port spot.   The wait is always long but that's expected. Today I went with 3 of my friends (so 4 in total) and after waiting for an hour they said they had a spot ready for us. They wanted to seat us at the bar by the window, which makes it clearly difficult to talk to each other (basically impossible). There were two other tables extremely close together that were available and we asked if we could have those instead - they said they don't normally push tables together so we'd have to wait another 20 minutes if we wanted a 4 seater table. The thing is even if they didn't push the tables together and we sat down as two groups of two, we would have still been able to talk and converse so much better because there was barely an inch between them. They said it wasn't possible so we sat at the bar- there were a lot of people so we didn't want to cause too much commotion then.   After we got our food and really struggling to talk or hear each other, we wanted to ask our waitress what the reason was for not being able to sit at those two tables instead- to us it seemed more logical to allow us to sit there and two separate groups of two to sit at the bar that sat 4- since it's a lot easier to talk if you're just two people at a bar. We asked politely and just wanted to know why. The initial interaction was fine, she didn't really give us a reason beyond the fact that the hostess' job is extremely stressful. However when she came back she was EXTREMELY RUDE and basically told us off, we were not being confrontational at all and she was getting mad at us. It was a very unpleasant experience and no way to treat customers - we didn't demand anything and just wanted to ask why we couldn't sit there and express that the 4 seater bar is not conducive at all to a group that big. I don't think anyone should speak to anyone that way regardless of the circumstances.   The frustrating part for us was that there was clearly a table we could have sat in. We brought it up because we just wanted an explanation and instead of providing one she started a debate instead and was extremely rude to us. I think she knew it because she didn't come back to give us our cheques. It was an unpleasant experience and we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Olive et Gourmando is exactly the type of little cafe that I wish I had in my town. When you enter you're greeted by a tantalizing display of baked goods, along with a chalkboard menu of coffee drinks. But you can also sit down for a light meal if you wish.   When I told the hostess I wanted to have lunch, she reserved me a seat in the front window and directed me toward the counter at the back of the restaurant. Here, another chalkboard listed several sandwiches. But the one that I chose was the truite fume. There were also salads and side dishes. I ordered a salade verte to accompany my sandwich, then went to enjoy my seat at the window and wait for my lunch.   The salad and sandwich both were generously sized. The sandwich was a truly delicious combination of smoked trout mixed with capers, sun-dried tomatoes, and red onions, and then layered between the two halves of a grilled white bread round with herbed cream cheese and fresh spinach leaves. The mixture of saltiness and smokiness balanced by the cream cheese was fantastic.   The salad was equally fabulous. I'd expected a plain green salad but what I got was so much better, though still deliciously simple: a combination of watercress, parsley, and mâché covered with a lot of toasted slivered almonds and dressed with a light vinaigrette.   Both dishes were wonderfully delectable--easily the best salad and sandwich I've had in a long time. Maybe ever.   On the way out I couldn't resist getting a palmier to go. As I later discovered, this too was excellent. I'm used to palmier that are simply buttery and sweet, but this one went to the next level. The sugar had actually caramelized, coating the entire cookie in a slightly burnt caramel goodness.   If there were an Olive et Gourmando at home, I'd never need to eat anywhere else."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is out of this world. Homemade ricotta salty was one of the best dishes I have ever had!! Ordered several pastries, all homemade all amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I DID IT! I FINALLY TRIED THIS PLACE!  OMG it was a long time coming and you know what? Worth it! Checked it off the restaurant bucket list.  I know this place gets a bad rep for the price, wait, and service.  The food is insanely expensive. But I think it's all part of their business model. They are so popular right now and tourists are willing to pay that much so why shouldn't they charge that much? It is going to stop me from going often but it did make me want to try it.  The wait time is ridiculous. My Boyfriend and I got lucky, we only waited 15 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. I left my name with the guy who does the seating and he told me it was a 30 minute wait. So we left and walked around for 15 minutes before my boyfriend told me we might have a chance at getting in earlier because people probably don't show up for their reservations and he was right! We got in ahead of 3 other couples who were no shows.   I thought the service was slow but I understand that with the volume of people, it gets a little hectic. I personally thought everyone was really nice and helpful.  Now, the food! I got the soup of the day. Black bean with porc and yoghurt with some avocado and tortilla chips. It was great! Best soup I've had in a while. It was super creamy and tasty. Made me feel full and happy.  My boyfriend got the OG grilled cheese with a green salad. The salad was ordinary but the grilled cheese was delicious! It had caramelized onions which I'm usually not a fan of but they were excellent. It also came with some homemade ketchup that really complemented the grilled cheese.   The food is worth it in my opinion. But don't go with a group of people or with friends. Go with someone you know who doesn't mind waiting and doesn't mind the prices. It's really not for everyone and I was lucky my boyfriend enjoyed it. It's not family friendly since the space is so tiny and the seating so limited."}
{"text":"I have to admit, trying to get into the doorway of this cute brunch place is quite hectic.  There is barely enough room to stand in the cramped entrance, whether you're just going for a pastry to-go or waiting for a seat. I arrived with two friends, and we were told the wait was going to be twenty minutes (this was at noon). We decided to wait. There's a continuous traffic of customers flying in and out the door.   Olive et Gourmando has a lively ambience and warm atmosphere once you get to sit back and enjoy it. I've previously had the hot chocolate her (thick, bitter, rich; only downside was the incredibly small size of the cup) but today I was here to try a sit-down meal.   I ordered the goat cheese panini with caramelized onions ($9.50) served with house made ketchup. It didn't take long to arrive, and was served hot and fresh. It met my expectations, yet I still regret not trying something sweet from the breakfast menu.  I tried my friend's mac and cheese ($17 and served with salad). I found it salty, and I expected a bigger portion for the price.   I must say, O +G is a place to enjoy a comfortable, satisfying meal. Nothing blew me away, but I had a nice experience here (except the first bit; trying to get into the restaurant!)"}
{"text":"The egg in your face panini is excellent. The cheese is melted to perfection and very flavorful. My bf had the croquette which was basically tomato sauce and bread, still nice flavor though. It was so packed where we had to share a table with others on either side."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and it's got a very relaxed atmosphere. Options for vegetarians with an interesting menu. It's the kind of food that makes you want to pat yourself in the back. Marked down for the ridiculous queues (yes it's very popular) and the variability in service, sometimes they're amazing but we've had the odd experience with rude staff. If you're not in a rush you can put your name down, wonder around the old ports shops and come back for a yummy lunch."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE. Fresh ingredients, great service, amazing energy. LOVED this spot. This is the epitome of good food.  A must stop while in Montreal."}
{"text":"It's a good lunch and breakfast cafeteria style place where you can grab fresh juice, nice comforting soups, fresh baked cooks, healthy salads or a quick pizza made on the stop. I usually pick up a few things and everything is usually pretty good but but you can expect to spend a little more then at the food court."}
{"text":"La bouffe est très bonne et moi je préfère leur soupe qui toujours d'un mélange de saveurs exquis... hummm vous ne serez pas déçus..."}
{"text":"What can I say, I found this place on Yelp and had to try it myself.  The previous reviews were dead on.  We had to wait but weren't intimated by the crowds considering the food here was supposed to be excellent.  I was disappointed that they didn't have the poached egg sandwich but the server suggested the Mac n cheese which was made from 4 cheeses and included a salad (all for $10).  It was definitely worth it, hot and tasty!  Also tried the Chicken sandwich which was very satisfying.  They have a very nice ambiance, slightly loud music but good songs. Closed on Sundays and Mondays so make your way here on weekdays or Saturday mornings."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, nice atmosphere. Best Mac and cheese I have ever had. Vegetable soup was also fantastic. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is amazing and the service was wonderful! We ordered breakfast poach egg panini, cheese croissant and a butter croissant! All really delicious! We will revisit again when we are in Montreal!"}
{"text":"We found this wonderful breakfast thanks to a Yelp search in old Montreal. So glad we did!  It was a busy morning but we got seated quickly. Service was fairly quick and coffees were served promptly.   All the food hitting tables around us looked delicious and ours turned out to be delicious. The Egg on Your Face panini was soooo good. We were warned it was going to be spicy but it wasn't really, just yummy. The granola had half an apple grated on it - super fresh and filling. The best part was the chocolate banana brioche. It was rich and thick without being heavy and dense.   I'd love to come back and try more but sadly the trip was too short."}
{"text":"With regards to this place, the atmosphere is great, service is fun and friendly and they definitely cater to tourists.    It's definitely pricier than most places, which is par for the course in Old Montreal. A raspberry and cheese brioche was $4.75, chia seed pudding was $10.00 and coffee was approximately $3.00 each (before tax and tip).   From what I was told, the brioche had great flavouring and was very flakey.  The chia seed pudding had a great fruity flavour but also plenty of protein with the museli and chia seeds.  After 1.5 days of eating junk food, eating this was very refreshing (plus it was the cheapest thing on their brunch menu lol).  It's a great option for healthy eating.    With regards to the coffee, it has a very strong coffee aroma, so if you like it, that's great.    Pro-tip: Get here early as we got there at 8:45 am before opening time and there was already a lineup.    Verdict: Great for tourists and a one-time visit. If you want to save money, just order from the takeout counter."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding and the coffee is pretty good, too. I would have given it 5 stars except it is pretty expensive, even for the quality. When back in Montreal, I would go again, though once per trip is the splurge limit. The brioche is quite good. We also had a fruit cup which was good, though way too much. Between my husband and me, we ordered two brioche and one fruit cup, which was too much for the two of us (and my husband has a pretty good appetite). The coffees are good but order the large size. It is about twice as much as the petite for just slightly more money. Fresh orange juice was a nice treat.  The only downside is the cost - 2 lattes, 2 OJ, 2 brioche, and 1 fruit cup came to over $50."}
{"text":"Delicious paninis and a very nice comfortable setting! Servers were friendly and service was good. Would recommend coming here for breakfast/brunch!"}
{"text":"Delicious delicious!  The panini is so crunchy and delicious.  The cheese in the panini is also very good!  The almond croissant was crunchy on the outside doughy in the inside.  The iced coffee was also very strong and smooth.  I wish they had a larger size for coffee."}
{"text":"Food is DELICIOUS here!! well worth the wait.   Have passed by this place several times and its always packed. Went here w a few friends- a great lively place to hang out w friends and enjoy good food and ambiance."}
{"text":"WOW! What a FANTASTIC breakfast!  Make sure to get here early, or at least be willing to wait up to half an hour for a spot during the busy hours. This little bakery/coffee shop/cafe is super cozy and loaded with superb breakfast offerings. There are lots of windows that the staff will open up on mild days, and the space is warm and inviting.  You can certainly grab a pastry and cappuccino to go (their pastries are sooo good), but if you stay it's best to get a mix of dishes so that you can try a little bit of everything. My husband and I shared the ricotta toast and the yogurt & granola bowl. I can't believe I am rating a restaurant 5 stars of two dishes that might be some of the simplest food you can eat. HOWEVER, Olive & Gourmando serves up some of the lightest, freshest dishes you could ever ask for. Their ricotta toast comes with whipped ricotta, sprinkled with honey and orange zest, served along with thick, oh-so-delicious toast. The yogurt and granola bowl was the best I've ever had. Fresh yogurt and even fresher fruit. Being from America, I am used to all the (what I call) \"sad\" fruit; melon, grapes cantaloupe. Here we had blackberries, blueberries, black grapes, strawberries and julienne apples. What a great combo.  I could've eaten at this place every day of vacation, and kind of wish I had. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"After seing this place featured on so many shows, we had high hopes for this restaurant! We went there for lunch and we both had sandwiches (one with porc and another one with nordic schrimps) with beverages. We also took a cookie to go which was a bit grainy and oversweet. Overall, an average experience, thankfully we didn't have to wait in line for a table."}
{"text":"Le sandwich à la truite fumée est divin. Il y a beaucoup de monde, alors allez-y en dehors de heures de pointe."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for a litigation...obviously not good.  But this place was recommended to me for breakfast while I was in town, and it made a miserable trip a little less miserable.  It is a very cozy place that makes you feel very comfortable.  The service and the servers were great.  They do not rush you and make you feel very welcome, even though neither my travel companion nor I spoke a lock of French.  I was craving a baguette, but when I asked the waitress said they did not make them but recommended their homemade bread with some homemade jam (I think it was peach jam but cannot remember).   It was excellent.  My traveling companion had the fresh fruit salad with yogurt and it was a very pretty presentation.  The coffees were excellent.b we also had the chocolate filled croissant which was delicious.  Will definitely be back every time."}
{"text":"We were arrived at 8:56 on Saturday morning. Luckily we came in at 9:22 and ordered coffee/ poached egg panini/ great home made granola. It's a super popular and busy place. We had been waited for 20 mins until food served.  Daily soup starts to be served after 11am. It's great atmosphere to experience once."}
{"text":"Magnifique endroit !  La file est longue mais ça vaut la peine d'attendre. Les sandwiches et paninis sont toujours délicieux. Leur boisson \"Elexir\" est incroyable ! Et aussi leurs scones salés valent le détour."}
{"text":"Forget the hype (RisaD.)!!  The food may not be a journey into the danger zone of the new and tasty but they do know their stuff...I ordered an allonge and she let me taste check it because it was only half full of hot water. It takes someone with food knowledge to get that...They may do it one way but to make it more of customized product really matters, I had a blueberry cream cheese brioche and it was loaded with blueberries and cream cheese and you can tell there was craftwork in the brioche, it was not frozen pastry garbage you get at the local chain cafes. I fully recommend it, hype and all!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an innovative high end cafe, Olive & Gourmando is the place for you! This was my favorite meal I had during a recent trip to Montreal. After we had to pass up a Saturday brunch because of an hour and a half wait, we returned on Monday afternoon (still to a crowd which speaks volumes to the quality of food) to snag a cozy table. I had the big healthy salad remixed, which was a blend of amazing flavors, topped with a mango curry coconut milk dressing. My dining companion ordered The Cubain hot panini. The service was superb, quick, and extremely reasonably priced for the high quality ingredients. Looking forward to returning during my next trip!"}
{"text":"Olive et Gourmando is the perfect place for breakfast.  The display of baked goods at the counter is mouth watering, atmosphere super comfortable, and service is friendly and efficient.  I had a latte and a brioche de pomme et cannelle.  It was like eating a delicious cinnamon bun with less yucky frosting and more natural flavors of apples whose pieces you can actually find in the brioche.   My husband had a \"tartelicious,\" a flatbread looking square pastry with some sort of berry on top.    Good coffee, good pastries, and the sandwiches listed in the deli part of the cafe looked really good too."}
{"text":"Best pastries in Montreal so far!!!! The only downside is that it is a really small place so it is always packed."}
{"text":"Best lunch ever!! Delicious sandwiches, fabulous homemade deserts. Must try the Cuban sandwich and the cupcake of the week."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches, salads, and baked goods in Old Montreal.  It's on a busy street full of office workers and tourist, but it's certainly worth the wait.  I also like going there in the morning before it gets very packed.  I here in the summer they have a rooftop garden where they grow the vegetables.  Can't wait to try them.  It's on a pricier side for sandwiches and salads, but you will definitely not be disappointed."}
{"text":"By the time we arrived, the croissants were completely sold out.  I settled with a belgium cookie that was delicious, but definitely didn't satisfy my croissant itch.   Get there early! Pick up some pastries and then sit down and enjoy their breakfast menu. Olive & Gourmando is walking distance from the port and a number of other attractions, so plan to go for a walk around the area after."}
{"text":"IMO, this place didn't really meet the hype. Came in on a Wednesday afternoon around 1:30p, no wait thankfully. We ordered a latte, Cuban sandwich and grilled cheese sandwich. Latte was not bad, the 2 sandwiches were okay. The bread a little too hard, the flavor was so-so for both. We also ordered an almond croissant and chocolate banana brioche to go. Nothing particularly special, I liked the pastries at Maison Christian Faure better.  Only one bathroom for the whole entire restaurant. At least the customer service was great, which is consistent with most places in Montreal I have found. The people in Montreal are so nice! Anyways, would not come back again."}
{"text":"I was here again during the summer. The place was crowded with not only many people, but also many flies and some wasps. The baked goods section was swarming with them. I had to keep swatting them away from me as I was paying at the counter. It was just so disgusting and revolting. No one working there seemed to notice or care. They merely asked if I wanted any baked goods. No way. Not with that degree of insects around."}
{"text":"over priced, and why do you make pastery so small ? no point"}
{"text":"One word. Actually a few words. The Cuban. That is the only thing I have there and I have been eating there for 7 years."}
{"text":"A really great lunch spot. Every time we have come here we had to wait for a seat because it's really popular.  Has a good atmosphere and the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"super yummy and delicious. sandwiches are greatly recommended as are the salads and pastries. great atmosphere as well!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch at Olive & Gourmando after checking out the Phi Center next door (great place, btw!).   We had a short wait for a table which is to be expected at exactly noon on a Tuesday. I ordered the Cajun Chicken sandwich and was told that since they were out of mango, it would be served with pineapple instead, yum! Husband ordered the Cuban Sandwich and a cup of the soup du jour which was Tomato Meatball.   We were both very impressed with our meals! I would have preferred to have my sandwich heated up, but it was still delicious cold.   Our waiter was very pleasant and the serve was quite quick considering the place was completely packed! This is definitely on the list of places to return to next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"It was so good !!!! Such a hip place,and if you go, you must must try the in your face poached egg panini! To die for ... their Cuban sandwich was excellent as well with Chipotle, melted cheese, etc etc  Good service too, I would definitely recommend this place ! When I went there was a lineup at lunchtime..make sure your whole party is there so as to be seated as fast as possible"}
{"text":"Stopped in with some friends on a recent trip to Montreal. The space is small and seems to be perpetually busy. If you're hotel is in the area, or if it is a nice day, I would recommend grabbing some pastries and coffee to go.   I had the grilled cheese and the star of the dish was the house made ketchup. We passed it around the table and it just went with everything. Surprisingly good for a group that usually passes on the sauces. Average price for a touristy area, but a cute stop if you can hit it at the right time of day."}
{"text":"We went to the Concierge and asked for a recommendation - she was right when she told us to go here even if we had to wait. We also saw it on Yelp.....  This is place was buzzing - we put our name on the list and waited 15 minutes. So glad we waited....we shared two dishes, a Cubain pork sandwich and a ricotta 'salty'. Both were 'to die for'....fresh, full of flavour, mouth watering.....and the coffees were the best in our two weeks in Canada. Indeed the coffee's were faultless!  This is a restaurant that specialises in quality not quantity...it is a foodie experience and our first experience was so good we went back later for cheese and wine....and this visit was the equal if not better than the first.  The atmosphere is alive, energising and warm... the servers are a pleasure to work with.  This is true gem of discovery in a sea of mediocrity......a must do."}
{"text":"Best house made gruyere croissant I've ever had. Pilot drip coffee was great too. Definitely go here."}
{"text":"Lovely place for breakfast or lunch. The cafe has a really nice atmosphere and it was definitely a popular lunch place. We had to wait for at least 20 minutes before we were seated. It was worth the wait though! Every dish in the menu is homemade so once they are sold out, they are gone until the next batch is ready. We wanted to try the Viva Las Vegan cold sandwich and the salad of the day, unfortunately both of them were sold out. So we ended up having the Homemade Ricotta \"Salty\" and #24 salad. And they were both delicious! We also had the banana chocolate brioche which wasn't too bad. This is an awesome place to drop by when you are in the Old Montreal area."}
{"text":"My husband and daughter went there today, to have lunch while I finished up my work. I am a regular customer. I was shocked to hear that they had to leave. The waitress didn't speak a word of English, but forget that. She also didn't know what was on the menu. When I called to inquire about this, the manager got extremely defensive, I won't be eating there anymore. I think they're  just too popular, and they are just resting on their laurels. There's much better places to eat now in the neighborhood, such as Bello's"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this place (it was one of our first stops as tourists in Montreal). Think of a bustling, chic, bright and homey environment. Super busy, packed with both locals and tourists, and a community environment you can't help but want to be a part of. Located in Old Montreal, we visited on a Friday afternoon for a quick snack and was enamoured at first sight. Kitschy decor, a wide variety of items on the menu, smiling and friendly servers, clean, welcoming atmosphere, and the decadent smells of baked goods and homestyle cooking.  We picked out two (2) items to share for a snack: a) the \"Palmier\" which is basically a half-cookie, half-pastry, adorably nicknamed an \"Elephant Ear\" because of the way it's shaped. It's a French pastry that's sweet, crunchy, and buttery - absolutely delicious, and b) the Almond Croissant, which was chewy, soft, and oozing with butter and flavour.   Everything here was a delight - from the food to the servers, to the way you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the social, community atmosphere. There are a lot of tables and counters with stools, but with very minimal spacing in between, so make note that you'll probably be making a friend or two.  For two pastries, with tax and tip, we paid around $9.00 (we sat in and opted for table service, hence the tip. However, you still have the choice of purchasing the pastries to-go and enjoying them elsewhere)."}
{"text":"Biggest disappointment of our trip.  We loved this restaurant two years ago, but it has grown too big and they cannot keep up their quality with the demand.    The menu is more limited, the food is not made to order, their drink menu is narrowed down, and the food was fine but not great and certainly not worth the rude service and the wait for a table.  The first time we visited here two years ago, their food was down right addictive.  Now it is fine but nothing special at all.    There is a much better, semi-hidden lunch spot up the street with no tourists, only locals.  Bye-Bye O+G.  We have a new love."}
{"text":"Boulangerie Chari in Brussels, Belgium has the second best almond croissants the world over; the best can be found herein. Hands down. And I'm a connoisseur of this particular food, as it's my dietary Achilles heel.   Also of note are: all their other pastries. I asked, and they can't ship to the united states. BUT, they're worth bribing your friends to bring em home for you. Oh yes they are!"}
{"text":"Chocolate Banana Brioche.  Order a 100 since they do run out quickly.  We have been there at 10 am (1 hr after opening) and they ran out.  We even bought some to take with us back to the US with us for the week.  The chocolate is so rich and creamy but doesn't melt when heated in the toaster oven or microwave.  In the USA, you'd probably call this a Chocolate Banana roll (similar to a cinnamon roll without the sweet glaze), but better!!!  The only sandwich they have for breakfast is the egg on your face so unfortunately, we didn't get to try the other sandwiches.  I didn't want to give up on my Chocolate Banana brioche for their lunch menu! ;-)!  Also, it does get very crowded but just leave your name and walk around if it is that long to come back for your table.  They seem pretty organized and try to accommodate large parties."}
{"text":"What? Cuban sandwich?  Drools... I'm speechless. I need to turn the chef or chefs into my BFF !  I can't even explain the flavor explosion of this sandwich, I feel like I'm insulting this masterpiece by calling it a sandwich. It is seriously the best sandwich ( so sorry to call you that ) I've ever tasted.   I wish they would open another one closer to where I live. The place is very busy but worth the wait. Yes 10$ or so for just a sandwich with no sides is a little more pricey then other places but you owe it to your soul to try this little miracle.   I do want to try the other things they have but it's soo hard, I can't neglect the Cuban I just can't !!!  Are you convinced yet? I could keep going if you like, in fact I could write a poem about it, it's that good.   Olive and Gourmando I love your Cuban sandwich  I'd eat 10 in a row And I know I would finish  I crave it night and day It is seriously the best It drives me nuts that way I can't even try the rest !"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by another shop owner and I couldn't be more pleased. There was a line out the door and I'm not surprised after trying their croissants. We bought pain au chocolat and the almond croissants. Both were wonderfully flaky and reminiscent of croissants that I've eaten in Paris. I'm eager to go again and try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"The sweet stuff is less sweet than the ones in America, which is a huge plus. Latte was meh. Atmosphere was good. Would come again."}
{"text":"Went here with a few friends. I got the Cajun chicen and my friends got the Miami roast beef sandwich. All of us were quite happy with our orders. I felt it was slightly pricey - but it's old port so that's understandable. Keep in mind that they do not seem to take reservations and it is incredibly hard to get a table."}
{"text":"Very good cafe. We had to wait about 30 minutes on Saturday, so prepare yourself for a wait. We walked by this place on Friday and could have gotten in right away. You can also just walk to the pastry counter for a quick purchase. We did that while waiting and the almond croissant was the best. I had Le cubain, which was very tasty. The bread was crunchy yet soft. GF had provenciale with tuna which is served cold. Even though it was cold, it was also tasty."}
{"text":"I wish there was a coffee shop like this in every town in every city. This is the model of a perfect cafe: good food, good homemade fresh pastries (almond croissants I LOVE! Cheese ones were also great) and superb coffee. The atmosphere is perfect. Old Montreal in an historic building, the windows, the people, the sounds. It's just so awesome.  I went here while on a trip to Montreal to do my final consulate interview for my US immigration. It was awesome because the paperwork came in really quick, and they actually took the time to email me with an update that stuff was approved and being processed. To thank them I sent them a nice message (through the special secure website form - you can't email or call them without giving your case number see and going through all the hoops and such) and I told them to check out this cafe.   I'm told the US government will review my helpful tip in 4-6 weeks :P"}
{"text":"Finally, good coffee in Montreal! And the orange juice was what you imagine fresh squeezed juice should look like, but ought to be for $5.50/glass.  The restaurant is on a really quaint, narrow street with other cafes and boutiques.  The hot sandwiches were really tasty, but a little greasy (which can be a problem in a city that's so tight on napkins...).  The cajun chicken sandwich was excellent - fresh and delicious. This is a cold sandwich, so not greasy. The bread was really unique - like the thin outer layer of a light focaccia.  On the down side: no refills on $3 drip coffee; sandwiches ($10-12) are a little on the pricier side for Montreal cafes; the check machine calculates % tip on the total bill (including tax), so just be aware."}
{"text":"Food is good but worst service ever. Not a French speaker and was neglected while the lady next to me got great service because she spoke French. I guess they don't care much for returning patrons since they are busy enough. Got my hot chocolate and it was spilled all over the plate and not hot. When I asked for another one to be hot, he told me he would take it back and heat it up... why would I want something you brought to the back and god knows what you did with it?!"}
{"text":"Ok. Needs work. Not accommodating as advertised. Multiple places on their menu/website say they will accommodate allergy and dietary needs. When we requested something specific we were told that everything was made in advance and could not be changed. ???  So..everything is sitting and warmed up to order. Not too appetizing. Flavor profiles have major potential but execution needs serious tweaking."}
{"text":"Still incredible, indulgent sandwiches. There's a reason this place is constantly mobbed."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We waited about 15 minutes, but the paninis were more than worth it.  We had the Cuban and the pizza pocket - they were both divine.  The service was also pretty good.  Love the atmosphere and the music :)"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast I've ever had. Really unique flavors and atmosphere.  Really recommend going if you are in the area."}
{"text":"After visiting this place once a few years back before it had gotten tons of hype, my mum and I were finally able to return for a delicious breakfast (the other time we tried to visit was stupidly on a sunday when they were closed)!  From reading other reviews, I expected it to be busy (and it was) so we got there early around 9:30 am.  Even when walking into the cafe you're hit by the delicious smell of fresh pastries, which admittedly just makes you want to buy and eat them all (and makes it very difficult to decide if you want one and which one you want).  Unfortunately, it was too early for the lunch menu, but the breakfast menu, while smaller, looked just as delicious. I got the Cha-Cha Chia Bowl - chia pudding with nut butter muesli, mango pure and fresh mango, bananas and coconut chips. It was freakin' delicious. My mum got the Poached egg on your face panini without meat and also very much enjoyed it.  The server was very friendly, the interior was charming and rustic, the coffee was great, and the food was delicious. It's definitely a place that I will return to some day to try their lunch menu."}
{"text":"Deux étoiles en moins pour Olive.... J'y suis retournée un samedi matin, aux environ de 10.30am. L'endroit n'était pas trop plein, mais les serveurs s'étaient tous levés du pied gauche et n'avaient surement pas bu leur café du matin...   Finalement installée avec une amie, nous décidons pour une brioche aux paccanes et l'autre choco-banane le tout accompagné par un espresso. Le café était super mais les brioches... Heurk !!! Grasses, trop sucrées, lourdes, une pate trop épaisse et pas du tout aérée !!! Un boulanger français aurait crié au scandale ! Rien d'une brioche mais tout d'un mauvais croisement entre donuts & buns !  Olive, je te redonnerai sûrement une autre chance, alors ne me déçoit pas !!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't understand the hype. Sure its a nice place to get a coffee and a pastry, but its not a breakfast or brunch restaurant. They were sold out of the one egg dish they serve and so we each had a parfait which was basically our only other \"non pastry\" option. Plan to eat before or after your visit to O&G."}
{"text":"This brunch place is a must in Old Montreal! It's quite a popular place, so expect a wait that will surely be worth your while. We stopped by for brunch on a weekday morning and had a wait of about 20 minutes.  This place is just charming. The weather was nice when we visited so the windows were open and we could look out into the street during our meal. There is also a wide selection of baked goods laid out that look delicious!   We ended up ordering a grilled cheese sandwich, the vegan sandwich, and savory ricotta. Everyone loved their meals, but I particularly recommend the ricotta as it came with tastiest cauliflower salad."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for coffee and almond croissant. I gotta say that the coffe was amazing, but the croissant wasn't the best. I really enjoyed the atmosphere there, and I will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Can you express the language of love?  Can you taste it, feel or or even smell it?   I can and will explain love to you in the form of carefully crafted artisanal food found here at Olive et Gourmando. Upon entering, love will be communicated to you in an innumerable amount of ways.   Sight: Neat yet creatively scrawled on chalkboards abound with messages, mottos and food. Rows and piles of goodies that tease you behind the glass. Rustic decor. Friendly faces. Calming light.   Smell: The smells of sweet breads, brioche, savory eggs and breakfast foods, cheese, coffee, all flowing, twirling and swirling in the air like a beautiful melody to the olfactory glands. You'll want to dance around in the harmonious smells that are privy to this establishment.  Taste: Hot, coffee slightly bitter cooled down with fresh milk. Handmade ricotta cheese with toast and honey. Sweet, soft croissants. Some with chocolate, some plain and some with a few surprises on top.  Sound: Harmonious conversation. Crunching, slurping, multilingual chatter. The clanking of silverware on plates followed by hushed giggles. Close your eyes and listen to it all.....  Come to Montreal, step in olive et gourmando and find out what you love."}
{"text":"We dropped by in mid afternoon for something quick sand tasty. To our surprise the panini sandwiches exceeded our expectation for quality of good and taste. Of course this is Montreal where food is a religion. Stop by and enjoy."}
{"text":"Great Cuban Panini, adorable spot, going back for pastry to go, they looked incredible."}
{"text":"Amazing service! The cashier was very nice and patient even though I came with a large group. Order the Pomme de Luxe. Best sandwich I've ever had in my entire life. Money well spent. Also, ambiance was amazing."}
{"text":"En visitant le Vieux Montréal, nous nous y sommes arrêtés pour casser la croûte. Super endroit !! Nous avons par contre peut-être mal choisi notre heure : tous les bureaux alentour vont déjeuner là !! Les sandwichs sont délicieux, le mélange des saveurs originales et très appréciés ! Vraiment un très bon endroit pour manger bien, bon et vite :)"}
{"text":"A very down home style bakery, straight from the streets of France.  The olive and gerunade is nestled I a populous downtown Montreal.  Everything the have is homemade and delicious. my wife ordered a chocolate croissant, and it had 20+ plus layers of buttery deliciousness.  The chocolate was layered in  the middle of the croissant like a surprise of sweet heaven.  The chocolate tasted as if had been made right in the shop.   The coffee I decided on was a black roast with nothing held back.  The coffee roared like a lion and left like a lamb.  Delicious strong and robust but smooth and delicate on the palate. Jessica had a latte that screamed sweet nothings in your ear, while you were sleeping.   The fresh ricotta spoke volumes with its fresh orange zest sprinkled across the top. The fresh baked bread, accompanying the ricotta was simple yet delicious vessel for the cheese and not taking anything away from the ricotta but bolstering its presence.  The \"poached egg on your face\" was simply delightful, spices and meats folded into one another as if holding hands.  The panini lightly toasted was perfect, one thing I can't stand is over cooked bread.  This sandwich was everything I could want as a delicious morning meal."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot in old Montreal.  The radishes on my salad were picked from their garden out back, which I thought was pretty impressive.  My friends sandwich was OK, not great, but it was kind of their specialty item.  The Cuban I believe it was. The spicy chipotle type sauce kind of over drenched the sandwich in my opinion, which I hate.  My meal was good plus the overall atmosphere and decor of the place sway me into giving a 4.  That said, I used yelp to find the place so nothing new to report I guess."}
{"text":"The first time we walked by Olive et Gourmando, you could hear the din walking down the street.  I thought that we were happening upon an uber-cool bar, but it was a Saturday afternoon when we stumbled by.  We made a mental note to try Olive et Gourmando for breakfast instead, since sometimes busy restaurants don't work with our active toddler.  The second time we went by, my high school French failed me as I was wondering why they weren't open, though the sign said 8 to 6.  Well, just don't go on a Monday!  We ended up at Titanic instead.   In the end, I sent my husband and brother to pick up many things to nosh on the way the flight home.  Apparently I was spared the crowd, surprising for a week day!    The goods were quite decent and my favourite was the rhubarb and ginger muffin.  They had no morning glory muffins, sadly.  The chocolate brioche wasn't as sweet as a chocoholic would hope for, but it was Valhrona so high quality chocolate at least.  The almond croissant was much sweeter.  My brother apparently didn't like his egg sandwich, but my husband did.  I think they spent about $50 on a variety of items that I lugged to the airport.  Everything was individually placed in a bag, which sported huge butter stains.  :)  Just the sort of thing you need on vacation.  I'd do it again if I had the chance."}
{"text":"The soups here are fantastic. I stumbled upon here when I was on vacation and I will make it a point to go back. I brought home the packaged nuts. So good!"}
{"text":"Used to be much better a few years ago. Too pathetic and overpriced for this quality."}
{"text":"I ordered the poached egg panini. Since I'm pregnant and eating raw or undercooked egg is a nono, I asked if they could substitute the poached egg for a well done egg. They said no. Was the sandwich worth the risk? HELL YEAH! It was the most delicious panini I've ever had.  Perfectly melted cheese, amazing flavor with a slight spicy kick.   The pastries also looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Having heard about this place from several different sources it was a must on the list for our recent Montreal visit.  Unfortunately, we were only in the fine city for 3 full days and I had a long list of musts.  I was familiar with the general location of the restaurant but hadn't pinpointed the exact location when we came upon it by chance while wandering around the neighborhood.  We already had lunch plans for the day but because my feet and my nose wouldn't let me walk past without going in, we decided to get some pastries for later.  One step inside and I knew that no matter how packed our culinary itinerary was - we would be back!  The first visit we took away a chocolate croissant and perhaps one of the best bites from our entire trip - a turtle bar.  The shortbread was amazing and it was topped with a very rich chocolate ganache.  It really was once of the best sweet bites in a trip filled with so many!  I managed to talk my husband into coming back for breakfast the morning we left Montreal for home...quite the feat since he had one thing on his mind: the 9 hour drive.  To which I said that meant we needed a very special breakfast to fuel the ride home.  In the end, I won out but just barely, especially when a parking snafu would have no doubt resulted in a  ticket (parking signs in French  - gotta love them).  The place is so popular that there wasn't a (legal) place to park within 2 blocks.    The weekend morning was a busy mess.  A hostess kindly explained the procedure while hubby dashed out to move the car.  I was assigned a table, given a card that I should take to the pastry counter to order, and found myself in the midst of a loud group of tourists, regulars, and one very unhappy little girl who protested quite loudly that she wanted out of the clutches of her daddy's arms.  Wondering if I had made a mistake by dragging hubby here rather than grabbing a bite to eat at many of the places closer to our hotel I ordered a juice, coffee, almond croissant and the deliciously sounding 'egg on your face' panini.  I returned to my assigned table, was given a bottle of water and then shortly our coffee and juice arrived.  I began to settle down a bit as I surveyed the yummy looking food being enjoyed at the tables around me and knew that what was to follow would be worth the headache of parking and slight delay in getting on the road.    I loved the drawings on the chalkboard and found it curious to read that one Saturday in June  of 1998 only 3 customers were served all day long.  What a stark contrast that was to the bustle of this Saturday morning where there was a constant line out the door!    While I was happy for their success, I secretly thought to myself that perhaps a happy medium between 3 customers and the hundreds (literally) that would overrun the peaceful dining area would be nice.      I was pleased when the panini and croissant arrived.  We shared both and had a happy little breakfast.  The panini was a good size and the bread was toasted perfectly.  The prosciutto was of good quality and paired well with the poached egg salad.  Not a fan of runny egg yolk, I'm happy to report that the eggs were soft but not runny.  It was a very delicious sandwich.  The set-up was odd to me in that we had to pay at the end of the meal by getting in the long line again, giving the cashier our table number and then being cashed out.  Perhaps it was a system that worked better when not so crowded.  Or, as my husband stated, perhaps it was to tempt you one last time with the delicious pastries while waiting in line.  If it was the ladder, it certainly did its trick with me as I couldn't help but order a chocolate croissant for the road (sadly, none of the cookies or that amazing turtle bar were available at the time).  If you are in Montreal, you must stop, even if only for a sweet bite to eat.  Oh, and if you can possibly walk over, I'd strongly suggest that as well!!  Happy noshing."}
{"text":"I could tell that this place was extremely popular, as there was a lengthy line waiting outside the restaurant when we arrived, and also when we left (over an hour later). Also, my foodie relatives love this place, so I knew it was going to be good. And it was.  We were there for breakfast, so we didn't have their famous sandwiches, but their bakery items were fabulous. Perfect croissants (regular and almond), wonderful (and big!) muffins, fresh scones. The coffees were also excellent.   As we left, they were putting out their lunch pastries: unbelievably gorgeous cupcakes and cookies and brownies. All looked amazing.   The restaurant interior is really welcoming, with long, warm wooden tables, comfy wooden chairs, wide open big windows (in the summer), chalkboard-covered columns by the entryway with menus and cartoons drawn on it, funky twig decorations hanging over the tables..... The whole place reminded me of some funky, hip hang-outs I used to frequent in my McGill days (in the early '80s). I guess you'd call it a post-hippie kind of vibe. I liked it.  What I wasn't so keen on was the whole system of ordering and paying. When the place is crowded (which, I gather, it often is - especially on weekends), it just doesn't make sense to have such a chaotic, inefficient system for diners to order and pay. So many queues, so much waiting, so little room in which to wait. Some older relatives asked me afterwards if they'd like this restaurant and if they should go here, and I had to say no: they'd love the food, but they couldn't handle the process to get their table and order their food and pay. For this reason alone, I think this restaurant is geared more for a younger crowd who can tolerate the wait and chaos."}
{"text":"I love the sandwich I had here and would love to return to try some of their beautiful pastries. I was there at noon, and it was extremely busy; there was hardly any standing room to wait for my order to-go. This is obviously a hot spot, plus I noticed it was voted as one of Canada's best new restaurants by Air Canada's en route magazine. I had the Miami sandwich, which has roast beef, pesto, cheese & caramelized onions. It was more than satisfying. What a wonderful Montreal spot."}
{"text":"Delicious treats in a cool atmosphere in an even cooler part of town!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, salads, soups. This place is always packed so be ready to wait to be seated. The good thing is it's worth the wait.  On your way out scoop a cup of joe and a delicious pastry Cheers"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found this place on Yelp while blindly looking for paninis near our apartment during our stay in Old Montreal. We came for a late lunch around 2pm on a Wednesday, so we were luckily seated right away. The place has a very trendy, eccentric vibe and a unique menu. At first we were hesitant about some of the menu items (a panini with pickle mayo?), but decided to order the Cubain and Pomodoro paninis to split since they were most appealing to us.  I am not exaggerating when I say there are the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. The Pomodoro got better with every bite, the perfect mix of salty and savory. As the for the Cubain, I would choose this as my last meal. The variety of flavors fused together into one and somehow really worked together. We also ordered two cappuccinos which were also very good. The server was very friendly and accommodating.  We enjoyed our food so much that we even came back and ordered two more paninis to go for our long road trip back to the US. It was a Friday afternoon around 12:30pm, and although it was raining, the line was out the door. I'd recommend coming late afternoon to avoid the rush and really enjoy the meal! Definitely don't miss this stop in Montreal."}
{"text":"The baked goods were amazing, coffee was ok.  Considering the place was packed we had very good service. The table (for 4) was so tiny that we were limited to order more pastries.  Had to finish our tea to be  able to fit our paninis.  I had the grilled cheese panini and it was the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I ordered the Tartine - it was on the brunch menu. It was fabulous. It was grilled hearty bread with housemade ricotta, radish, cucumber, pears, acorn or butternut squash, with fresh herbs, toasted nuts, and a lemon and maple vinaigrette. My daughter ordered the grilled cheese and she loved it."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and breakfast. Everything was amazing. Had salty fresh ricotta for lunch--fantastic. Husband had large healthy salad which he said was excellent and filling. Next AM we each had a croissant--a mistake because it was so filling. But crusty and melt in your mouth good. EXCELLENT latte and espresso (and I'm a coffee snob). Husband had sweet ricotta dish which he loved. I had a panini which was only disappointment--too much cheese, and very salty. All in all though, very good. You must go."}
{"text":"Incredible place. Well worth the wait. Best lunch in Montreal. Well you wait you can grab a coffee and pastry. Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a busy day. It was packed but we were served quite fast! The Gustavo sandwiches were delicious! The waiter even took the time to check if everything was okay. Great place."}
{"text":"I don't even have the words for this place. All I have are gurgling happy tummy noises and salivating.   Perfect fall-almost-winter meal: Squash soup (with pumpkin seeds, tomatoes, pesto, chickpeas and about a million other fun \"You can put that in soup?\"-ingredients). Heavenly. A little kick to it. Hearty and warm, but not enough for a meal. You must get a sandwich. I got the Cuban. Gruyere on a Cuban? Yes please. Pulled pork, pancetta, and loads of melty, melty gruyere. You will scoff at anyone who ever tries to serve you Swiss cheese on a Cuban ever again. My wifey had a salad. Borrrrrrrring. You must get a sandwich.  Friendly service, cute vibe, hipster iced teas, 80s pop.   Total win."}
{"text":"I am vegan and my husband is not. We were both able to find delicious sandwiches here. The beer was great. The service was awesome. Great environment. Really cute little place."}
{"text":"Don't be afraid of the line out the door. It moves quick. Great selection of baked goods such as almond croissant. There is a good selection of brunch items such as the Oeuf Coquette (baked eggs)  Loved the rustic vibe with ample natural light flowing in and the wooden tables.  I came here once in 2015 when I was on a work trip in Montreal. Loved it so much that 2 years later when I returned with my husband on vacation, I had to relive my trip and bring him here."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on a weekday. Very busy and crowded. I enjoyed the food.  Food: 4/5, got the panini with poached egg and meat. Spicy, warm and very delicious.  Service: 2/5, lacklustre, felt a bit rushed and the tables and seats were not very comfortable.  Ambience: 3/5, nice little place with cool decor.  Price: 2/5, overpriced for what you get; somewhat odd for Montreal but it could because they have buzz. Not sure about the $5 lemonade lol."}
{"text":"First off this place is super busy and when you get constant 5 star reviews and mentions in print publications its a reason to go to the Old Port for lunch  They have a wonderful menu but its really grilled panini sandwiches, salads and soups with an excellent pastry/bred offering  I had their take on the Cuban which was excellent. Hats off to the pastry chef in the back because the bread was excellent and the blueberry tart put me in tears. Its all made from scratch  The salad was interesting because there was parsely in it that gave it a unique taste  The interior is done very farmhouse rustic which matches the food offering and is actually what i would expect from a resto on a cobblebrick laneway  Coffee is well done as well and I cant recall ever getting a double espresso the equivalent of a tablespoon. I asked twice about what for an italiano boy is a super small espresso got me a \"sorry its too busy look\" to bother with this  Oh well maybe its a montreal style doppio.   same goes for their artisan beer served in a wine glass....a very small portion?  I do have one complaint and that is they really seem focused on getting you in and out fast as there are line ups and angry people waiting but knowing this in advance you can choose the experience you wish for the lunch you wish to enjoy  It will be very noisy, very crowded and very hurried and it will cost you more to eat here but the food is well worth it.  On my second visit i chose take out and enjoyed it down by the nearby square while basking in the sunshine"}
{"text":"Yummy - albeit a little overpriced and most of the options run out so make sure you go early."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! Had lunch here on a local friend's recommendation . The Cuban sandwich was beyond delicious, ginger ice tea was great, pastries were perfect. Perfect place for a quick lunch in olde Montreal ."}
{"text":"Yum! The poached egg paninis and the scones turned this family into a group of glutens eating over paper bags in Notre Dame park.   The coffee was nothing to write home about, but it didn't really matter. We have been talking about the paninis for over 2 weeks!"}
{"text":"This is 100% my favorite place for brunch in Montreal. The lineups you see in front of the store are completely worth it   I'm from Toronto so unfortunately I don't get to come here as often as I'd want to, but I make sure that I stop by at least once whenever I'm in town.   I always get the vegan sandwich, and it's mind blowing every time. All of the vegetables have a fresh crunch to them, and they make the bread in house.   My only complaint is that one time I tried to order a sandwich to go at around 2pm on a Tuesday, and the woman at the front said that they were sold out, which was confusing to me because I assumed that everything was made fresh to order?   Regardless, I would highly recommend this place to anyone considering"}
{"text":"Just like most of the other reviews, this place is fantastic. Probably, no definitely the best mac and cheese ever... Sandwich was perfect, our waitress recommended a nice glass of wine.  There will be a wait, come back when they tell you and your table will be waiting.  Make sure you get some dessert to go for later!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday at 9:15am. I know that they open at 9am and by the time I arrived, the place was already packed and a lot of people waiting for a table. I opted to just get my brioche and coffee to go and ate it at a bench few blocks away. The chocolate and banana brioche was huge. With every bite, I was looking for the banana flavor and only got to taste it as it was only in the middle. There was a good selection of pastries but with the long line, you might be better off buying somewhere else."}
{"text":"Olive and Gourmando has delicious sandwiches. They've also mastered the art of poor customer service.   The staff and management are extremely rude, arrogant and pretentious.  They shamelessly treat paying clients with a degree of hostility and contempt that you'll remember for a very long time.   All that being said, their sandwiches are good - but it's not worth being treated like a piece of garbage to obtain it."}
{"text":"It's a very cute little place in Old Montreal.  Fresh pastries and sandwiches.  Whole leaf teas in artisanal tea pots.  Great for catching up with a friend.  Limited hours so check ahead.  More often than not when I wanted to return they were not open."}
{"text":"croissants were perfect,  delicious sandwiches,  really sparse menu,  had the Cuban and wife had the cajun chicken. great location,  hip,  quirky,  very pleasant service."}
{"text":"The food was amazing here  We went there because we read a review for the Cuban sandwich. We got the Cuban with the beer it was so delicious. The beer was great also. The place was packed and they close at 5 pm. Definitely worth the wait. Everything about this little place was outstanding."}
{"text":"The quality of the baked good is amazing.  Delish strawberry biscuit, peach tart and bread.   However, waiting two hours for a sit down meal here is not worth it.  Carry out.  Keep in mind most of the sandwiches have cilantro so be aware cilantro haters.  Also the potato and seafood soup lacked flavoring.  Definitely will take out when I return."}
{"text":"C'est le genre de café que j'aimerais avoir plus près de chez moi. Peut-être que dans un coin moins touristique de Montréal il serait moins constamment bondé de gens? Parce que oui, Olive et Gourmando est rapidement passé du bouche à oreille à un haut lieu touristique, et avec raison: Les pâtisseries et viennoiseries y sont tout simplement divines, ils font de délicieux lattés et leur liste de sandwichs est à faire saliver même les plus difficiles mangeurs de ce monde. Ils ont tellement de choix appétissants qu'après ma première visite, où je m'étais délectée d'un latté et d'un croissant aux amandes, je n'ai pas pu résister et je suis repartie avec  une brioche au chocolat Valhrona et bananes. \"Je n'en mangerai que la moitié et je proposerai le reste à mes collègues de travail\" que je me suis dit, mais aussitôt déposée sur le bureau de mon patron que la tentation fut trop forte et le reste de la brioche vint se transformer en taille supplémentaire de pantalon.   Il faut choisir son moment lorsqu'on veut faire un tour chez Olive, puisque comme je disais plus haut c'est un lieu hautement touristique et qu'il est difficile d'avoir une place pour plus qu'une personne pratiquement chaque matin de la semaine. Mais ne reculez pas devant une quinzaine de minutes d'attente, le foodie en vous vous remerciera."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for a great breakfast! The food is delicious and the service fast, however, it is busy so get early for short wait. I strongly recommend to go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Not many options but the options they had were very tasty. Their soup of the day changes but I had the tomato soup and it was one of the best tomato soups I have ever had. Very sandwich and salad based. Cute little cafe-atmosphere place in Old Montreal"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to bring out of towners and show off Old Montreal. It's in a beautiful part of town and serves fresh homemade baked goods and a great lunch menu. It gets busy at lunch times. It's casual, bustling and you have to wait in line for a table at peak times. So not quite the place to go if you're in a rush for lunch.  It's a little on the pricier side for an everyday lunch but I guess you're paying for the location and the freshness, so it's justified :)  I love to bring out of towners here for an off-peak lunch or a brownie snack."}
{"text":"Get the Grilled Cheese with homemade Ketchup! And the Chocolate Chip and Pecan cookie."}
{"text":"Very quaint Euro cafe in the old city. We had to wait a few minutes for a table on a busy mid-Saturday. We had a table at a bar like area looking out on the very a Euro looking street. People watching at its finest while enjoying awesome espresso drinks, Panzella salad, soup of the day , Cuban sandwich and house lemonade. Service efficient, but certainly not warm and welcoming, but adequate. Food felt very authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"C'est bon, mais je n'ai pas capoté non plus. J'avais peut-être de trop grandes attentes, vu les excellents commentaires d'amis et sur Yelp! L'attente est très longue, mais le service est hyper efficace une fois qu'on est assis. J'ai pris que sandwich cubain, que j'ai trouvé bon mais pas à se rouler par terre. Je l'ai trouvé très gras et lourd. Le café est excellent, les pâtisseries aussi. Endroit sympathique, mais qui ne vaut pas le 35 minutes d'attente. À y aller en période calme, donc!"}
{"text":"L'expérience que nous avons vécu a dépassé nos attentes. Le décor est très accueillant. Nous avons rapidement été pris en charge même s'il y avait une file d'attente. Le capuccino avec lait de soya était excellent. Et le menu offre une variété très différente de ce que l'on retrouve typiquement dans un Resto pour petit déjeuner. On y reviendra!"}
{"text":"C'est dans cet endroit où j'ai le mieux mangé durant mes vacances à Montréal. Meilleur sandwich au fromage de ma vie à moindre coût! Je me mords les doigts encore aujourd'hui de ne pas y être retournée au moins une fois de plus..."}
{"text":"I can't stop raving about the food, the servers, and the adorable ambiance! The specials were beyond fantastic and the servers were so delightful. Top brunch spot in MTL"}
{"text":"I am absolutely in lurve with Olive et Gourmando.  I am still dreaming about the Viva Las Vegan, drooling as I gaze at a picture of it on Foodspotting: http://www.foodspotting.com/places/16856-olive-et-gourmando-inc-montreal/items/353295-viva-las-vegan .  Tofu, pickles, veggies, hummus, the most perfect bread I've ever tasted; you get the picture.  I think everyone else in Montréal feels the same way, because this joint is always packed.  But don't let the ridiculous crowd at the front door deter you from getting your lunch.  Getting a seat may take some patience, but if you're placing a to-go order, you'll be in and out in a jiff.  The line is split into two portions: the folks clogging the front door are all waiting for specialty drink orders or maybe an entire cake or something.  Dunno.  I just know it didn't have anything to do with me, so, shrug.  Squeeze through them and make your way to the second line, near the menu board.  Place your order there, then turn around and join the other line---you'll see it; it's still not the mob at the door).  If you're ordering a salad or a sandwich to go, they'll usually have it ready-made, so all you have to do is stand with your order in the line to pay.  At the register, do yourself a favor and add a croissant aux amandes to your order.  Holy freaking hell.  I can also recommend the chai tea.  You also place your coffee and tea orders separately from your sandwich / salad order: you'll see the barista person in between the two lines.  Yeah, it's a weird setup, but for the most part it works.  I love the super-cute hipster staff.  Even when they're stressed and busy, they're still very sweet.  So, yes, like I said, the Viva Las Vegan will knock your socks off, as will the croissant aux amandes.  If I'm being honest here, I ate two of each on this most recent business trip to Montréal.  After which I promptly hit the gym for two hours.  Worth it!"}
{"text":"One can't help but pine for the culinary comfort of a Parisienne cafe when walking the cobblestone streets of Old Montreal. When in search of a place to have breakfast we happened upon this place which had quite a line at 10 am on a friday. Stupidly we opted to go to a place across the street that was fairly empty called Marche de la Vilette which ended up being a failure. Angry we went back across the street just to check out the menu and I ended up getting a sensual chocolate banana brioche bun. The butter caused see thru grease stains in the takeaway paper bag but I didn't come to Monteal for salad and granola... We still wanted to try the true \"petite dejeuner\" and hit up Olive et Gourmando the day after. We had the egg salad hot panini which was a damned revelation. The cafe au lait was great too. Reading the paper in the sunlight that teased its way to our table and dining on a complex panini of eggs, sriracha, oven roasted tomatoes and cheese was one of the fondest memories of our trip."}
{"text":"I don't really get why this is so highly rated.  I went there for breakfast by myself before some sightseeing upon these recommendations.  It's a bustling place, which is fine.  It's cute and comfortable and though it gets packed, you don't feel too squeezed in.  The pastries are fine, the breakfast selections are ok but they are all made with something cheese or milk and if you can't eat dairy like me, then you are limited substantially.  But that's actually not why I'm rating them a bit lower than others, that's just the breaks.  I didn't think the service was very good.  I understand they are packed and hustling and I cut the servers slack for that.  And if you know French and speak to them in French, they will cut you off and only speak English continually just because your pronunciation is not French-Canadian.  There's a lot of that in the Old Town area in general and it's just rude if you're trying to use your language skills and be polite, respectful of the culture.  They definitely know what you are saying. But though that happened to me here, I'm just speaking in general about that area.  However, here at Olive & Gourmando there is this attitude that they're such a cool place and you're kind of lucky to be there as a customer.  I didn't think it was any big deal or thrill compared to anywhere else and there are certainly many similar restaurants in the US and even in my town.  It's fine, the food is fresh and entirely decent, but I just think it's nothing special honestly."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch at this place.  Foodies rejoice!    The food is delicious mix of complex flavors and deliciousI I had a panini that was really as perfect as they come in terms of taste, texture and temperature.  I loved it.  My partner had a sandwich with smoked trout that days later she referenced as the high point in the food of our trip.  We got there for lunch on a saturday and the place was packed with lots of people waiting.  The wait wasn't too long (15 minutes or so).  We sat at a counter, and the place was bustling.  If I had to ding it for one thing, it would be that the place seems too full, too busy.    You order by sitting down and then going to a counter in the back to look at the offerrings and place your order.  I doubt you'll have a choice, but if you can, don't sit near the line that forms by the ordering place as you'll feel even more crowded as we did.  But the ordering line goes fast, and the people there are very helpful (even though we felt a bit rushed by the line).  We enjoyed the location of the place, with horse-drawn-carriages passing by the window, light snow falling outside, gas lamps and solid old buildings around made for a very romantic setting.  We recommend waiting until after your meal to go up to the other counter and get a pastry and some coffee for dessert.  Lots of yummy stuff and great coffee.  A note about the star rating:  The food is really as good as it gets for what we wanted ( a not too expensive, but delicious and upscale (dare we say hipster) place.  So I'm giving it a 5 star.  I would have given it a 4 and a half because of the way the service works and the feeling of being rushed, but any food that sticks in your mind as a high water mark is deserving of 5 stars.  Bottom line:  Looking for complex, delicious food?  Willing to pay a bit more than average and looking for an upscale, urban elite vibe?  This is it!"}
{"text":"Worth every star I gave them! Good service, great food, and fun vibe! Their pastries  are great, egg in your face sandwich was good, service was prompt and polite. My only complain would be that the tables were too close! But that's in all the restaurants here in Montreal."}
{"text":"Went there at 10am, there was waiting line at that time. So if you do not want to wait, go there early. Best almond croissant I have ever had, the poached egg sandwich is a little salty but good, try soup of the day. Service is great."}
{"text":"I came for their so called famous Cuban sandwich. Not really impressed at all. Far from being the best I've had. It was ok.   The place itself was cute. Busy, but service was still quick."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this amazing place while exploring the port. As soon as we walked in, we were blown away with the atmosphere and decor. The first thing we saw were the croissants, which certainly made our mouths water. They looked so good, that we ended up getting 3 (cheese, almond and chocolate) and all were just as amazing as they looked. My boyfriend got the \"egg on your face\" sandwich. I'm not a huge fan of spicy food (which this sandwich was) so I didn't get one of my own, but decided to try it once it came out. I loved it so much that I ended up eating half of my boyfriends sandwich. Seriously one of the best sandwiches I've tasted in a while. Food was delicious and coffee was fantastic. Service was excellent as well. Certainly a must-try when you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"just love this place However don't take the mac and cheese truffle oil ;)"}
{"text":"Amazing! This place was packed with a long wait line, which speaks volumes to how great the restaurant is. The restaurant has a very hip but cozy feel. We got the Cuban sandwich and it was unreal. Also great cappuccinos and pastries. Have to get one before you leave!"}
{"text":"We had 6 ladies.. 5 of my girls ordered something and I was not due to my gluten/dairy allergies. IN ALL OF MY years of eating at restaurants all across the world I have not been treated so rudely! Vincent was extremely rude and told us to leave because I was not ordering food. He said \"this is not a library\",  And several other rude comments. We all decided to leave and to not give them our service. Instead of simply asking us in a nice way if we could either order more food or to eat swiftly so he can seat other people he ATTACKED US and immediately told us to leave! Do not eat at this restaurant, they only care about taking your money and they have the worst customer service I've ever experienced. No employee should EVER treat customers the way Vincent treated our group."}
{"text":"I loved this place, the ambience is super charming! Bread it's amazing delicious, chocolate is not bad. Food have very good taste. Just go there not in holy days because is toooo full and be waiting can be not something to enjoy ;)"}
{"text":"Best almond croissant ever.  Unfortunately, it was crowded and we didn't want to ruin our dinner reservation, so we stopped in for a snack of some pastries.  The almond croissant was unforgettable.  We also ordered the raisin and walnut brioche and it was fantastic.  Only down side is they're not open on Sunday or we'd bring some home."}
{"text":"Good food. 5 stars for the taste and freshness of the food and the ambiance of the restaurant. I liked the iced tea and the grilled cheese sandwich with Gouda. Other sandwiches and salads looked delicious as well and I would have liked to try all the pastries from the counter. I think the service could have been a little bit faster, but was still fine. This just seems like a place that is always busy."}
{"text":"We were visiting Montreal as tourists, so having breakfast at this place was exactly what we were looking for. It's in the Old City; you'll want to stroll around the neighborhood and work up an appetite. The ambience is funky. The place seemed to be filled with locals, so we really felt like we were having a true Vieux Montreal experience. The service was friendly and prompt. The food was very good and prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"The La Cubain sandwich was to die for and the Mac and Cheese was incredible. I could not be more complimentary of this charming restaurant. A great lunch!"}
{"text":"An update: Olive et Gourmando reopened in January 2009 after its usual December-January hiatus with some cosmetic changes to the space, AND the decision not to bake and sell breads anymore.   The sandwich breads are still made in-house, but OeG says it wasn't doing enough volume in breads to justify the effort. The rest of the menu is unchanged and still as good as ever."}
{"text":"OMG this place is amazing.  We tried to get in for 3 days - it always had a long line.  Finally we were able to get in for breakfast.  I had the sweetened Ricotta.  It was delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"I want to move to Montreal to eat at this restaurant everyday. We had Le Cubian sandwich and Ricotta Salty salad. OMG! Both were scrumptious. I was not a big fan of Ricotta cheese prior to trying this salad and I love it now. I wish I had found this gem sooner.  We decided to have desert and coffee here as we could not leave Montreal without trying the sweet flavor of Olive & Gourmando. I'm glad that we got Chocolate Croissant for the road to Ottawa."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after reading the amazing reviews on yelp. They had sold out of the only vegan option sandwich and did not have any non dairy options for milk. Not vegan friendly at all. Service was very average and coffee came out barely warm."}
{"text":"Un de mes restos préférés à Montréal, toujours un plaisir d'y revenir pour manger un sandwich cubain... Seul bémol prévoir un peu d'attente : la rançon du succès !"}
{"text":"This place has a bit of a reputation.   There was a long line to get a table -- we waited about 40 minutes, then another line to order, and another line to pay our bill, heck even a line to go to the bathroom... and yes, after all that I can still say it was worth it.   The food, especially the sandwiches are out of this world, with special kudos to The Cuban. The breads, excellent, the pastries, not so much.  They also serve a rose from Corsica that was amazing.   The staff were exceptional considering the difficult crazy busy & crowed conditions when we were there, with special props to the girl who manages the waiting list.  I'd try and go at off hours on an off day, but I definitely would go!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place was great!  I had a breakfast special of a poached egg on a Panini with bacon, herbs, cheese and roasted tomatoes and it was really good - the eggs were perfectly cooked and the bacon added that special richness.  While the breakfast sandwich was very good, the Chocolate Brioche was insanely amazing - rich and buttery brioche bread layered with dark chocolate - it was perfect!    This place is must-visit."}
{"text":"Service: Great, though we had to wait for about 20 min. It was a Saturday afternoon around 4 pm. This may be why it was so busy.  Food: Really excellent. My date had an excellent sandwich and my salad was delicious. Everything was local and organic, always a plus in my book.  Atmosphere: Really loud, but cool and trendy.  Pricing: Slightly overpriced, but when you consider the quality of the ingredients, it may be the right price-point."}
{"text":"We've been here a long time ago so I can't remember exactly what we ordered. We had two different types of paninis. As I remember, they were delicious. It is a little bit expensive for what you get, but yet, we were not disappointed. Since it's in old Montreal it makes a really nice spot to invite family in friends visiting for brunch. Overall, a really decent place for paninis and salads."}
{"text":"Just a cozy, tiny cafe in the heart of Montreal. The breakfast items weren't mind blowing. The service was great and the location was convenient. I just didn't find anything absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Very busy at lunch time. You can go in and order to go which I did the second time I went... Found a spot in the sun a block down and enjoyed a little picnic. Loved the eggplant soup with feta and salsa verde. I will dream about that soup. Also I'm not vegan but loved the marinated roasted tofu on flatbread. Chocolate and banana brioche to die for."}
{"text":"I'm always impressed when i eat a sandwich and think - even though the ingredients are listed on the  wall, there's no way I could ever put them together in a combination that would be this good... It's baffaling really... House made tea and lemonade also spectacular - cafe americano was quite lovely as well. Avoid the 11-2 Lunch rush - we got there at 3 and still had a 15 minute wait, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Overall, I loved the concept and execution of the restaurant, though it was a bit pricy for what it was. That being said, the statement is true for almost all places in Old Port. Maybe it was because I didn't come in on the weekend when they have an apparently delectable brunch, but nevertheless, it was still satisfactory.  I ordered the raspberry lemonade, the grilled cheese sandwich, and the chocolate banana brioche. First of all, I found the raspberry lemonade slightly disappointing, as it could have used a bit more sugar and more of a fruity flavor. It almost felt as if I was tasting the essence of raspberry rather than the actual fruit at times. The grilled cheese sandwich was a cheesy, gooey, and toasty delight which I loved. The combination of Gouda and raclette cheeses worked extremely well and tasted rich and delicate at the same time, and the caramelized onions added a nice touch of sweetness. I'm not exactly sure if it was worth $12, though.  The chocolate banana brioche was definitely the highlight of the meal. It was so moist and, being a sucker for banana bread, I loved how you could see banana chunks actually baked into the bread. I appreciated that the chocolate part of the filling was more along the lines of dark chocolate, as it highlighted the banana flavoring while being deliciously cacao-y in its own right.  I paid about $27 (ish) for my meal in total including tips I believe. Was it completely worth it? Not exactly, in my opinion. But I'll be sure to come back sometime for brunch because their options look tantalizing and appealing to my tastes by the looks of it."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Food is tasty but the portions were on the small side. Pricey but understandable given the location in the old port. Place is tiny, you are almost sitting in your neighbor's lap. The ppl sitting the next table over could literally hear everything we were saying so definitely don't go there for an important meeting. Just overall disappointed and don't feel the need to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent endroit. Ma copine ne jure que par O&G!!! Toujours très occupé à toute heure de la journée, particulièrement les weekends.  Excellent cafés et cappuccinos. La nourriture est excellente aussi. La salade #24 nous y fait revenir encore et encore."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner, decent prices, good service. I liked the atmosphere and vibe. The staff was nice and helpful. I would go back."}
{"text":"This place is always packed for a reason! The food is phenomenal!! Every time I've been the wait has been over an hour long but it is worth it. My mom is a very picky eater and she cleared her plate. She was even fighting me for one of their croissants and she's not a fan of sweets and pastries! I would 100% recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Best Cuban sandwich in the world? Little pricey but well worth it. Small place and gets quite busy especially during lunch hour. But SO worth the wait."}
{"text":"I really don't think this place can get any better.   Once again it was recommended to me by some Yelpers and I'm glad I had the opportunity to visit.  It's located in Old Montreal and is simply a must do on your visit.  They have fresh baked goods, coffees/tea and do serve brunch/lunch.    Here on a weekday and later in the afternoon - about 3:30pm it was about 3/4 full.  I can only imagine on the weekend that this place must be hopping so definitely try to get here on a weekday at on off time.  The brunch/lunch menu had my mouth watering - everything sounded so delicious but as soon as I saw the mac & cheese I knew that is what I had to get.  And boy am I glad I did!  It was tiny bursts of flavour explosions in my mouth - it had mushrooms in it, all this delicious gooey cheeses that provided a beautiful bite without being heavy.  The top was all gorgeous and crispy - I literally savoured every bite and scrapped the dish clean!  Just thinking about it makes me want to go back.  It was a tad bit on the salty side but I can forgive that.  It comes with a small salad that has pine leaves in it that gives it a nice finish - it;s also lightly dressed which I totally appreciate as I find most places douse their salad with dressing and it just ruins it.  With a glass of vino, and some tea afterwards this really hit the spot.  The mac & cheese was $20 - yes a bit pricey but I'd get it again and again and again.  I made the mistake of ordering a 6 oz glass - that alone cost me $12.  A rip off but oh well.  You learn.    Service was a bit slow when I entered - you wait to be seated but I felt like I was a bit ignored for a few minutes but I'll let it slide because I just loved my meal here.  Plus afterwards it improved as the server was attentive and made recommendations when I was trying to decide between a few dishes.  She was also nice enough to let me know (as well as the other patrons) that the kitchen was closing at 5pm so if we wanted to order anything else to get the orders in now.  I'm already looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food! Deliciuos and tasty Cuban sandwich! Service was good and please go but be expecting a 15 minutes wait list. Nice and cosy ambiance. Sorry we did not take a photo of the cuban sandwich, we devoured it! But the apple salad was nice too! Will defenetly come back!"}
{"text":"We ordered the big hearty salad and Cajun sandwich. The food is awesome and the flavor profiles and complexity is what makes this place stand out. Of course it helps when the service is great!!! Must come if you are in Montreal. A true gem in the old city."}
{"text":"This was my favorite lunch spot in Montreal.  My wife and I were there on a busy Saturday and only waited 5 minutes to be seated.  The system is very simple.  You order your food at the counter in the back then sit down and wait about 15 minutes for it.    I had Le Cubain (ham, braised pork, homemade mayo, and gruyere cheese in a panini) and a bite of my wife's Poulet de Grain Cajun (chicken, guacamole, tomatoes, mango fraiche and cajun spices).  Both were delicious with lots flavors going on and a little kick from the spices.  We each had a glass of their vanilla lemonade too.  I'd never had vanilla lemonade so I didn't know what to expect but I liked it.  When you're done you pay at the register while getting an almond croissant to go.  You must not leave without one!  Especially if it's Saturday because they're closed on Sundays.  Their croissant flat out embarrasses the Almost Twist bread at Taipan Bakery in Flushing."}
{"text":"Grabbed 2 coffees and 3 pastries to take away for breakfast. Showed up as they were opening the door and there was a small line of around a dozen people. Everything was excellent!"}
{"text":"It was our first time visiting Montreal.  We stayed nearby at the intercontinental Montreal. So the walk to Olive was nice and short. I absolutely loved the atmosphere, the feel and design of this coffee shop. The shop opens at 9 and it gets very busy very quickly.  Their menu is short but delicious. And a bit pricey. But if you feel like treating yourself to a nice breakfast, go here.   We tried their granola bowl, cha cha chia bowl, and the panini.  All 3 are outstanding.  Their almond croissant is to die for. I wish I would have brought about a dozen home with me. Their coffee is not that good - a bit sour. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a mid-afternoon snack and got espresso and various sweets.  The espresso was full and strong, the way I like it.  I had the turtle bar, which was a decadent calorie bomb made of shortbread, salted caramel, and chocolate ganache.  Freaking amazing.  My mouth just filled with saliva thinking about it.    My friend got this shortcake thing with whipped cream and fresh blueberries, which was also really good and not that heavy or sweet (opposite of my dessert), so there's a dessert here for everyone.  They also have sandwiches and savory snacks for a nice lunch.  TIP:  They are closed Sundays and Mondays!!"}
{"text":"We were so taken with Olive & Gourmando on our visit to Montreal that we went back again, and definitely thought about doubling back to Montreal from Quebec City later in our trip just to visit it again.  The almond croissants are out of this world. They're just unbelievably good. The salads are wonderful, as well. But let me extol the virtues of a couple of the sandwiches we had.  The Cubain is a hugely memorable roasted port panini with gruyere, lime, chipotle, cilantro and mayo. This sandwhich just launched me into heaven. The chipotle especially gave this panini such a wondrous flavor. The Cajun Chicken sandwich was just an unexpected delight. I didn't come to Montreal to try \"Cajun\" anything, but the spices worked so well with the fresh ingredients on this sandwich that it was a toss-up which of the two sandwiches I planned to order again on my next visit. We'll definitely return when we come back to Montreal.  Be prepared for long lines at lunch time unless you come early. This eatery's reputation is well earned. Apparently, everything on the menu tastes delicious."}
{"text":"We arrived during lunch and of course there was a wait so we decided to take it to go and just eat outdoor since it was such a nice day out. Cute and charming place. The Cuban panini was soooo good. I love a good panini but this was probably best I've had.  The bread crust was perfectly crispy without being too hard but once you chew into it...it was soft and melts in your mouth. The filling with pork and panceta was yummy with their blend of mayo. We also got the almond croissant which was also so yummy...it was flaky,  buttery, and soft...not too sweet. Definitely a highlight of my food adventure in Montreal."}
{"text":"What a spectacular find!  We ate here twice. The healthy salad was full of yummy surprises in every bite. I don't even know how to explain it but try it. We went back the next day for maple flavored yogurt, fruit and granola. I was hesitate about maple yogurt but it was amazing. Not too sweet and it went perfectly with the house made granola and fresh fruit. Charlotte was our waitress and she couldn't have been kinder or more attentive.   This was my favorite restaurant in all of Old Montreal!"}
{"text":"The gustavo panini is one of my favorite sandwiches ever. Cozy spot, great food."}
{"text":"Yelped this place and so happy.  Incredible ambiance,  food, and although only one beer on the menu...it was terrific.  Thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"So happy I chose this place for brunch! I had the Cuban panini and salad. Both were delicious and fresh. The venue was also nice. I'd def. recommend eating there!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb.com - we came in after the basilica and we were in need of some fresh farm to table food and crafty cocktails. We ordered their Michaelada and an aperol spritz and both came in a timely and refreshing manner. Then we ordered the salad of the day (broccoli, Israeli cous cous, walnuts, and peas... amazing!), the chicken curry, mango and avocado sandwich (fantastic!) and the summer salad (lovely!)... service was friendly. The bill took a while to come but nothing to set us back from this being the HIGHLIGHT of our trip!"}
{"text":"Yum!!!! Our favorite brunch experience in Montreal. (Tourist review here)  There was quite a wait when we got there, it was snowing so everyone was bundled up inside. A place for coats was nice. Decoration was kind of random and they had a chalk board wall behind the coffee/sweets. i'll post a picture because that's a lame description. But it's so cute and perfect! They cranked people out pretty quick though so we really only had to wait about 20 min.  We tried a handful of pastries, and both of us got some delicious marinara/spinach/ goat cheese(?) chorizo dish. with grilled bread and an egg on top.  omg.  we're going back to Montreal just for this spot! Keep up the good vibes"}
{"text":"First time at O&G. Service was very friendly, and the food was amazing. I had the sweet home made ricotta on toast. Couldn't have asked for a more original and refreshing breakfast. NB: prepare for a 30-40 minutes wait - this place can be very busy in the weekends."}
{"text":"Awesome lil crowded cafe in Old Montreal serving YUMM Sandwiches & baked Goodies. They say makin the beast with two backs  is biochemically no different from eating large quantities of chocolate. I'd say its biochemically no different than havin the delicious Sandwiches or patisserie @ O&G.  Nuff said...........   Food -  Great Service - Fast & friendly Ambiance - Casual / Cozy / Crowded Worth the money -Yisss"}
{"text":"Pretty good! Had to wait in line for 10 minutes. Their paninis are huge, so had to bag up the other half. Nice servers, maybe a bit too crowded. But overall, it was great!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 5 for food and maybe a 2.5-3 for dining experience.  I have been here three times, and I think I might be done for awhile.  I know it is really popular, and I expect to wait 45-60 minutes to get a table after putting your name in.  But, really, to then wait again in a line to order your food at the back counter?  That second wait was about 15-20 people deep, all crowding everyone else eating at tables.  When they bring you the yummy food, you are probably going to be crowded as well.  When you want to pay... guess what?  You get to wait in line at the front counter to do that.  Three waits seems excessive even for a really good Cuban sandwich and the world's most amazing raspberry lime-aid.  (Aside note: I have a rule that I don't drink calories except for alcohol, but I break it for this stuff.  Which is not to say I wouldn't put vodka in it if I could).  Also, while I think Montreal is generally rather expensive, $15 (before tax and tip) for one sandwich and drink is excessive for a cafe.  Add tax and tip, and you've got a $75-80 dollar lunch for four people.  Four drinks, four sandwiches only.  (Second aside note: it is not helpful that I just ate at a fantastic Italian place in Munich two weeks before... cocktails, bottle of wine, basil lemonade for the kiddos, salad, two pizzas and two pastas for 80 Euros, so the comparison is not great.)  I accept the fact that perhaps I am old and the aforementioned is not a big deal to 20-somethings.  I don't think I need to come back unless it were a really nice day, and I ordered take-out to eat at one of the picnic areas on the river, which would be a far preferable dining experience.  (And only one line involved.)"}
{"text":"My whole family did the pre-teen move and took a picture of our breakfast.  Embarrassing but worthy.  The pastries were just as good as they looked and the yogurt with fruit made eating healthy feel good. Loved the warm inviting interiors and the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Located in Old Montreal but was a really good restaurant!! I came there twice because the Cuba panini was only on lunch menu. It deserves visiting again.  My friend and I had two divine brioches for breakfast. My chocolate and banana one was the best of the world! Too much chocolate inside! Not too sweet but very crispy. Soooo nice~ The Cuba panini was crunchy outside and gooey inside. Melting cheese with bacon and salty turkey, never forgot. Because it was the last meal in Montreal.  The staff were all very pretty and friendly. Love the ambience and decoration of the restaurant. The price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow I can't tell you how good this place is, while in Montreal this is a must"}
{"text":"Olive & Gourmando, or 'o+g' is a small little breakfast/lunch spot that is known for their paninis.  Besides hot paninis, they also have cold sandwiches, daily plates (such as mac & cheese, salads, etc.), as well as breakfast items (such as granola, homemade ricotta, etc.). Just make sure you request both of the menus, as you can order from either/both of them. This place was bustling when I walked in, but the host is great at remembering the queue and seating parties quickly.  I tried their O+G Grilled Cheese hot panini that was filled with caramelized onions, Raclette, and Gouda Beemster XO, served with a cup of housemade ketchup; the caramelized onions were a bit too overpowering, and the housemade ketchup was a thin consistency of a sweeter sauce (I found this not to complement the panini at all); and, the 'Poached egg on your face' panini (filled with spicy poached eggs with herbs, mayo, Louis d'Or cheese, speck, and slow-roasted tomatoes; this was definitely the better of the two paninis, but it has a spicier kick; the taste kind of reminded of Korean spicy pork sauce (dwegi bokkeum sauce), so it had a familiar taste to it).  I appreciated the crispiness of the bread, but note that they don't brush the bread slices with olive oil or butter.  I'm open to trying out their other kinds of paninis, as I really did like the thing crusty/crispy breads holding the fillings together.  To wash it all down, I tried their raspberry & lime beverage, which seems to be the place's version of a limeade with some raspberry juice - it wasn't as tart as I thought it would be, but more of a smoother finish.  Service was super friendly and efficient, and complimentary water is offered in an olive oil bottle. Once you're done, remember your seat location and pay up at the front!  +known for their paninis +raspberry lime beverage +fast and efficient service +crowded during breakfast/lunch rush"}
{"text":"I am traveling through Montreal on my own and this was the place I felt most comfortable having a bite alone. It had a very cozy atmosphere with jazzy music. I was seated at a bar-type table in front of the window, and while a tight squeeze, I was able to eat and read a book comfortably. Servers were attentive and cordial.  I ordered the poached egg panini and it was hot, gooey, cheesy and just a little spicy. The bread was crunchy and fresh --the perfect vessel. I went on a food tour the day prior and it was better than anything I sampled on those 7 stops. The only thing that stopped me from giving it a 5/5 was that the latte I ordered was just okay. But I would go back everyday and try their other offerings if that were a socially acceptable thing to do."}
{"text":"Excellent food! We didn't have reservations and had to wait about 20 mins for a table but it was worth it. Had the soup and a panini. Also tried the hot chocolate but found that to be a bit too bitter for my taste."}
{"text":"We came around 1230 pm.  30 min wait.  Placed our coats on the rack.  Service was quick.  We ordered Mac and cheese which came with a delicious salad, soup of the day (apple soup), and the cubain panini.  All delicious.  Unique tasting.  Very good vibe, good, and location.  I would come again if and when I visit Montreal again."}
{"text":"What a beautiful beautiful place! Bright, cosy, tastefully decorated, friendly service and tasty tasty tasty food! I love everything about this place except the wait time! I haven't had anything that I didn't enjoy at this place (soups, salads and sandwiches). So to make it short: the most memorable menu item for me is the cuban! If you like warm melted cheese and a crunchy crunchy bread with just a bit of meat this sandwich is a MUST!"}
{"text":"I don't think anyone needs me to tell them what to think of Olive et Gourmando. This is a Montreal institution and definitely worth a visit. One of my favorite cafes, in fact, because of the quality of the food. But its success is its weak spot. It gets rather chaotic and crowded - so not a place where you can usually enjoy a beverage or a snack in tranquility. They have servers who bring your food and drinks, but they make everyone crowd around the cashier to order and then you have to queue up a second time to pay after eating. (Why?) Some of the pleasure of visiting is lost by the whole \"process\" you have to go through."}
{"text":"I didn't understand the hype! The food was pretty average for what it was! The paninis were greasy and it comes with nothing.. no sides nothing! Beer selection was good but food was disappointing"}
{"text":"I had the ouef coquette: the bread was fresh and crispy and the dish was good too. A bit of a treat since it was $17 pre-tax but I'm surprisingly full and it was indeed tasty. My friends got the paninis and they look really good--I'll get them next time! I like the decor and atmosphere in here though. I may be back for a treat!"}
{"text":"Amazing Cuban sandwich and salads, worth the wait! The coffee and chai are also very good!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place out because of all the hype surrounding it. Right in the heart of old port. They don't take reservations  I went with a friend who's been there several times and she says the wait can be very long. We were lucky to wait about 15 mins. It's a cute little coffee shop/resto.   They have a small menu that's limited with what you can order during the week and weekend. They have a lot of salad options. I decided to go for the grilled cheese sandwich. I didn't enjoy it much because of the caramelized onions that were quite bitter. They serve it with their house ketchup which was very good. I also ordered a latte which was the perfect drink to have after work on a windy day. My friend ordered a salad with bread. I loved their bread. It was very soft and tasty. The best part was the extra large cookie we had for dessert. It was cold though and we asked if they can warm it in a microwave and they said no. However we still enjoyed it very much! They have a huge selection of baked goods and patisserie. My friend recommended to go their on the weekend for breakfast which I will probably.   I wasn't too impressed with their menu or food. The server said it changes with season, so everything my friend had in the past wasn't available. Our server was very nice and helpful explaining the menu and our options. The place is quite packed, almost claustrophobic. It is nicely decorated with a woodsy theme. The resto closes early, so no options for dinner. Easily accessible from metro. Very, very close to the water in old port."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch spots I've been at. This place is known for their hot crispy sandwiches. Other items in the menu is just as good with amazing flavors. The bill was $110 without tax but covert that to USD it's about the same as NYC prices considering the amount of different dishes that we ordered.  The vibe is good, the waitresses are nice and welcoming. The view is nice if your sitting at the window and occasionally horses walk by."}
{"text":"This is a great cafe and bakery in Old Montreal.  The coffee is very good and the food is super fresh and well made.  The servers all are very friendly and welcoming.  My server highly recommended the \"morning glory\" muffin and it was probably the best muffin I have ever had.  I will definitely come back the next time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Came here for an 11 am brunch on a Wednesday. The place was crowded and rustic. Very small.   The waiter initially told us we needed to wait 45 mins for a table of 5, then suggested splitting us up which would seat us immediately. It was super awkward. My friend and I went to a table while the other 3 waited. There were clearly tables that we're going to be empty very soon, but he seated us at the other end of the restaurant. After my friend spoke to him he came and got us and voila! A table for 5 magically appeared. It was a crummy awkward start to the meal.  The service was pretty horrible. We grabbed our own menus. No one explained anything to us (like how we can order off the breakfast as well as the lunch menus, and they were 2 physically separate menus). I ended up getting the habibi chicken sandwich. The only egg option was the poached eggs and they had RUN OUT OF EGGS. I was in need for protein. Unfortunately they also didn't have French toast. The sandwich was cold (yes I get it it's called a cold sandwich but it was too cold), jam packed with a handful of dill!!!! Wow way too much. It was overpowering even when I tried to scrape most of it off. The latte was good but wasn't hot enough to my taste, I don't enjoy lukewarm coffee.  I won't be coming back here and I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I DID NOT speak to each other the entire time we ate our food. It was absolutely delicious and all together life changing lol.   He ordered the Mr. Miami and I had the Vegan 3.0 paired with beer and freshly squeezed orange juice. I am so surprised how delicious the Vegan 3.0 was considering it's not an all vegan establishment and generally vegan options aren't this tasty. Both sandwiches were generously sized. There was a bit of a wait to get seated but it's totally worth, you don't want to miss out on this food !"}
{"text":"Just as good as you think. Fun atmosphere, delicious pastries, great service.   The wait is often long. I recommend trying breakfast (early - before 9am) to avoid long waits. There is one hot breakfast option (like an egg sandwich with fontina mmmm) and all the amazing pastries you could want. I like the apricot, white chocolate and nut brioche. Very close to the Pointe a Calliere Archeology museum for out of town guests."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly service!  The food was wonderful as well.  I had the soup du jour and the Rubenesque sandwich, and my wife the Hot and Cozy Stew... Both excellent.  The pastries here were delicious too!  Would definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Great little corner spot for brekkie in Old Montreal. Friendly staff and welcoming spot. We ordered the Healthy Salad and the Mr Miami panini. Also while we were on line waiting for a table the smell of the baked goods irresistible. The almond croissant was calling my name. So we pregamed with an almond croissant. Didn't regret that move as soon as we took a bite into it. Unlike most almond croissants, this one was in long form. Rolled up pastry dough along with almond meal. Wasn't too sweet but just the right amount of sweetness and topped with sliced roasted almonds. Ooh la la...I had to keep myself from ordering another one! Into our salad and panini. The Healthy Salad was a big bowl of micro greens and local greens with quinoa with chicken. The taste and texture crunchy and chewy was awesome! Chicken was grilled perfectly and the quinoa that was stuck into the chicken along with the tahini pomegranate dressing was just paired so well! My panini was super tasty with a well balanced cilantro pesto and pineapples. Um hello! The pineapple and cilantro pesto cut through the heaviness of the brisket. Will def be back!!!"}
{"text":"Had to wait an hour for brunch but it was delicious! Got the Caesar salad, grilled cheese, and the miami panini. Everything was great! Was a bit pricier than expected and was definitely a tourist spot. Glad I went but don't think I'd go again and wait in that line."}
{"text":"It's a must try in this area! although the store is a little bit small, it has some big table for groups which is perfect. Food is delicious and the entire interior and the decorations are just great"}
{"text":"My first Montreal cafe! It was a cold winter day but excitement definitely aids in ignoring the chill. The weather could explain why I saw few people.   Walking into this place, I discovered this was where everyone was hiding.  Packed and bustling is how to describe what I saw. I cannot imagine this place in the summer.  My French to say the least is rusty and squeaky would be the best compliment I could hear. I couldn't understand a single word - and I studied it for how long? I swear, even when i heard the basics, I was a bit dumb founded.  Practice, practice, practice.  We were seated quickly but I have heard there are long waits. Its a great people watching space if you are waiting. Lots of eye candy. Yummers!  So here is why you should go: they serve your coffee with warm, frothy milk. Who does this? Is this a french thing? I love it if it is. The coffee was strong but without any bitterness.    Presentation, atmosphere and speed - this place scores high.  If you want something more spacious and quiet, oh, girl, you will have to go elsewhere.  As for the French language, they speak English as easily as French - so do not worry!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars Great variety, amazing taste, but very busy on weekends. Had the chia bowl which was nice, but the stand out order at our table was the Egg on Your Face panini. Spicy, crunchy, gooey, and delicious all around."}
{"text":"Best panini in town, do check this restaurant out. There was a bit of a line but absolutely worth it. We ordered the Cuban and the Miami (the pineapple salsa dip is to kill for) panini, loved both and couldn't get enough of it. Already waiting for another opportunity to go there again. I have heard so much about their almond croissant, waiting to taste that.   They could improve their regular coffee.   Highly recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"It's worth the wait and effort to stop in.  My wife got a egg panini and I had a fruit bowl with some pastries on the side.  Both were delicious.  For my pastries, I had the almond croissant and apple fritter, both were amazing.  Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"The food here lived up to the hype. Great neighborhood vibe.  Walkup and order and then they serve you.  Not a place for dinner but any other time the place would be great.  Good music going also.  Highly recommend it as a stop."}
{"text":"Petit bistrot sympathique au cur d'une librairie.   J'y étais allé à l'occasion du lancement d'un nouveau livre avec présence de l'auteur. Pendant le repas, ce dernier nous a entretenu de son aventure d'apprenti-écrivain et des étapes ayant mené à la publication de son livre"}
{"text":"Rude and poor service!!!!  I came here for lunch on Monday, Oct 24th with our 7 month old baby, my wife, and two Montreal friends.  We put our names on the list.  We were told the wait would be 45 min, which seemed reasonable given the busy lunch hour.  After 45 minutes, we enquired as to when we would be seated.  We were told another 45 minutes.  In addition, we were told that we would only be seated at the high top tables, which we explained would be difficult for us with the baby. The maitre'd was particularly rude to my wife and one friend, who were both native english speakers.  He continued to seat individuals in pairs at the high top tables who arrived after us, after having promised us to put those seats aside.    The end result was us leaving the establishment and going down the road to Le Cartet, where the service was significantly better.  This experience left my wife with a bad taste in her mouth, and left her with a poor impression of a city that I grew to love during my years living and working here."}
{"text":"Believe the hype. This place is AMAZING. I got this breakfast chia bowl that had the most fantastic combination of flavors imaginable. It made me rethink breakfast. There appears to be something for everyone here, and everything that I saw come out looked delish."}
{"text":"Found this place based on fellow yelpers - was not disappointed.  Got seated without too much of a wait at the communal table (I was by myself).  Wait staff was running around but still came to take my order very quickly.  I ordered the soup of the day (Celeriac cream with almond brussels spout garnish) and a Cuban panini sandwich.  Soup was just delicious (my waitress told me their soup is always good).  Picked up an almond croissant on my way out to pay (how can I not).    Planning to go back again to try the Brioche and coffee that everyone is raving above (and really mainly to get my soup fix)."}
{"text":"Their bread is like a carb pillow or fluffy dough cloud. If you've tried it, this is the prefect analogy. I'm not high.  Sandwich menu is made of heaven. I waiver between the Viva Las Vegan and Cubano.   Sweets spread is everything you could want and your ass is afraid of.  I wish they had more salad options. Everyone has faults.  Espresso is lovely.   Lunchtime line is hell. Going during off times is cool and it is worth the wait. I hate lines so I mean it when I say it is worth the time.  Always bustling."}
{"text":"Came here to sit down and get lunch but ended up just ordering and eating at a local park with the lady  Atmosphere: - Bustling sandwich place that is very popular - You can sit down (35min wait at 1:15 on a Tuesday) or go to the back and order a sandwich  Service:  - No complaints  Food: - Lady got the L'Antipasto which was amazing.  Eggplant on there with the moz cheese and basil really made for a creative and interesting sandwich.  I was having a bit of sandwich envy on this one. - I got the Cuban which was a little heavy but very tasty (heavy on the mayo).  Her sandwich definitely takes the price for creative and delicious - Salads looked very tasty and creative  Other: - Prices are a little high, but this is the old port  - Not open on Sundays or Mondays - Want to go back to try some of the other sandwiches - They do not sell brand name drinks (coke, etc)"}
{"text":"Wowzahhhh. Pastries galore. Gets very crowded on weekends  located in old Montreal. *they do accept credit card  My highlights:  Almond croissant: flaky perfection and everything you look for in an almond croissant. I want more !!!  Banana and chocolate brioche: Holy Moly. Chocolate was so rich. It tasted like it was dark chocolate and the gooey'er version of the chocolate you typically find in a chocolate croissant.   Highly recommend both of these, you wont regret your trip here!!!"}
{"text":"Tried to go back two days in a row it was that good, unfortunately it was closed on Sunday. By the time we got there they were out of their famous poached egg Panini, so we went with the Cajun spiced chicken with guacamole, mango and roasted tomato. One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Husband and I also split an almond croissant which was nothing short of incredible, and the lattes and drip coffee were great as well. HIGHLY recommend, the wait to eat here is worth it."}
{"text":"A great cozy place for lunch. Fills up fast on the weekends, so come early or make a reservation to avoid the wait. We tried the pork sandwich and gourmet mac n cheese which were both good. The soup was exceptional! Their desserts and pastries are also amazing. We had the best coconut macadamia nut cookie ever!  The only thing that was mediocre was the chai latte. But overall, very satisfied with food and service."}
{"text":"My girlfriend brought me here for brunch at the recommendation of a friend of hers. We got there and it was about a thirty minute wait to get a table on a Sunday. The place was pretty crowded, but they seemed to have plenty of staff so no one seemed to be waiting too long to get there food or anything.  The problem arose when I looked at the menu. I was allergic to everything on it except for I think toast with PB and J. PB and j was not what I had in mind for brunch. Normally this is not a problem as something like cheese or nuts can just not be added to the dish when it's made. This has been the case at literally every other place I've been at that serves food. However, upon requesting this omission of cheese from an egg sandwich from the waiter, he told us that they couldn't make it without cheese because everything was made that morning and the food couldn't be altered since it was already made. I thought this was strange and requested more time to look at the menu since he shot down this first request and my back up option. Upon realizing that everything else likely contained dairy or nuts in some form and that they weren't making things, we decided to leave.  I found it odd that they weren't cooking anything upon being order but I guess just heating it up or serving it cold. Also the two egg dishes both contained poached eggs, which sounded unappealing to me. I wouldn't want to eat poached eggs that were made hours ago. Again this isn't after eating any food but is the only thing I can infer from what the waiter said to me. Also I am anglophone, but there is no way this was a language barrier thing because this was one of the most Anglo-centric eateries I've been to in montreal.   We ended up going to the boucherie across the street, which was quite good and fulfilled my request without question."}
{"text":"We ate here recently on a trip to Montreal. We stopped in for a late lunch, but the place was still hopping. W/o a reservation we were able to get a table in about 10-15 minutes. I had the Cuban panini and the hubs had the cold chicken sandwich. Both were tasty and pretty filling and large portions. We opted for dessert, but I kind of wish we hadn't. While the desserts looked very appealing, the almond croissant and chocolate brioche, they were a little dry and we didn't finish either. Overall, this is a great place to stop for a quick bite in the Old City."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are heavy but tasty. Croissants and cookies are good. Service is very good. Worth the try and the average 30 min wait time."}
{"text":"Best Brownie Ever!!!   And an awesome place for lunch in the old city and worth the wait. The long lineup is a testament to the quality of the food and environment. The food is fresh and delicious. The people working and eating there create a welcome buzz that feeds the experience.   This is a local favourite that delivers a hip feel and delicious food. Sitting in the restaurant having a nice lunch and drinks made me feel part if the Montreal community."}
{"text":"Still incredible, scrumptious sandwiches. There's a reason this place is always packed."}
{"text":"Such a lovely place! It felt quite SoHo - and in another context I might say that sneeringly. Here, it means the cafe is on a corner in clean, pristine Old Montreal, surrounded by cast-iron-style architecture, open cobblestone alleyways, and horse-drawn carriages passing by the window every minute.   (Horses in Manhattan's SoHo would go on a mad killing spree after 5 minutes, but you get the idea)  Olive + Gourmando was PACKED for lunch on an early weekday afternoon. It felt a bit touristy but also had its share of locals (e.g. people on laptops).  The location is walking distance from the touristiest (!) part of town, by the Notre Dame Basilica.  The ordering process is a little funny. The hostess gives you a blank memo paper with your table #. Go up to the cafe counter or sandwich counter, give them your slip, and place your order. They keep the slip, food is brought to your table, and you can order more at any time by telling them your table #. When you go up to pay, they will already have your complete bill.    The lunch menu is small, with 4 cold/4 hot sandwiches plus soup/salad. There are pegs on the chalkboard to hang signs indicating which are sold out - but they replenish frequently. Our hostess spoke English natively, but the menu is in French. But if you can read English you can easily figure it out (thanks for being 30% French-origin, English Language!)  I was so happy to find that not only is this place adorable, the food is da bomb (technical term).  My smoked fish sandwich (a cold option, $10) was packed with shredded smoked trout and slightly sinful with a slab of herbed cream cheese. The centimeter-thick layer of spinach was not overwhelming in the least. The salty trout was balanced out by capers, which I normally dislike but were fabulous here mixed in with sun-dried tomatoes.  The Cuban (hot option, $11) was nothing short of amazing - pressed very thin with pancetta instead of ham, and served very hot, with plenty of pickle that imbued just the right tartness to combat all that cheese. Ever had a great Cuban? You won't even know that you WANT MORE delicate pickly tartness til you've had O+G's version.  Mmmmm.   Both sandwiches came promptly, which surprised me because the restaurant was so busy.   The espresso ($3.25) was fine, nothing spectacular. We also had an apple turnover ($3.75) that was fresh but really not on the adventurous side on either our part or O+G's.  It seems their regular drip coffee is good, since many, many, people came in to order coffee to go.  If you're looking for a hectic but lovely luncheon or cafe visit with plenty of Montrealaise flair, try Olive et Gourmando! If you don't care for the hectic part, come well after the lunchtime rush. The food will still be fabulous."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. LOVE IT.   Go, you won't regret. In the summer, it's even better, take a stroll in the Old Port afterwards, bread or whatever else in hand, this will be unforgettable."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite late lunch spots in Montreal. However, I mention late because this place is very busy and the wait list is long! No reservations.  The interior is welcoming and cozy.  For beverages, you must try their home made lemonade, it is simply delicious and refreshing.  Their mocha coffee is very good too. For meals, my favorite is The Cubain, it's porc and pancetta with a Gruyere cheese. In the fall, their Mac N Cheese is very good too. I personally also love a side of their green salad - it has a distinct taste that at first I was not so crazy about but it has grown on me since then and I love it! And, a must try at the end of your meal to complete everything is their brownie - so moist and simply to die for!   Prices are pricey but well worth it on a gorgeous day! (About $50-$60 for 2 people for lunch.)"}
{"text":"Visited Montreal for a long weekend and came back twice because I loved this cafe so much! Their croissants are amazing - tried the plain, chocolate, and also the cheese croissant. My favorite definitely was the cheese croissant. Also had their cappuccino for take away and it was the most perfect start to my day. Came back the a few days later with my girl friends for a quick lunch, and ordered the Tofu Sandwich. My mind was blown. I was already full by half the sandwich, but ate the rest anyway because it was that insanely good. My mind still dreams of this sandwich, and I am scouring all of LA now to find something like that!"}
{"text":"This was the first place we went after driving four hours into Montreal. The food was really, really good and our waitress was extremely nice. However, their seating system was a bit frustrating. They didn't seem well organized and we waited for a good deal longer than we were told we would. The waitstaff behind the counters seemed completely uninterested in helping customers and mainly chatted away with each other. Luckily, the ambiance and the food were well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best croissant eveeeerrrr! I dream about going back for them! We also got sandwiches and they are really filling I choose the vegan sandwich because our server recommended it! I loved it but could only finish half of it. You need to go and have croissants!!! It's also a cute place very cafe but plants and art too"}
{"text":"Used to be my favourite breakfast place when I lived nearby. Excellent coffee,patisserie and breakfast offers, but I particularly enjoy this place in winter, it is nice to come in this warm, terrifically smelling cafe on the cold winter morning...   I miss that"}
{"text":"J'ai découvert Olive & Gourmando grâce aux avsi des Yelpeurs, et quelle belle découverte ! J'y suis allée un midi vers 13h30, l'endroit était plein, on a quand même réussi à avoir une table très rapidement, c'était super. Les sandwichs sont vraiment très bons ! On s'est régalées avec nos grilled cheese et sandwichs et poulet. Avant de partir, on a testé la limonade lime-framboise, c'était renversant ! Et ça goûte vraiment la framboise et la lime. Le latté est aussi très bon. On repassera pour les pâtisseries, qui nous on fait de l'oeil, mais après le grilled cheese, on avait plus de place !"}
{"text":"This is a sweet find in old Montreal.  A must try when visiting Montreal!  Do consider getting the salad bowls and the grilled cheese sandwich"}
{"text":"I had the mac and cheese, which both my girlfriend and I thought was delicious.  The place is intimate and in the heart of old Montreal.  If you are driving, there is decent pay parking on the street.  You may have to wait 20-30 minutes as we did on our first visit.  The staff is very friendly and generally accommodating.  I wasn't too impressed with the vegan Panini.  If you're thinking about desserts. I'd try the cronuts diagnolly across the street...but I don't remember the name of the cafe.  I gave it four stars but I don't feel this is a must during a visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"I really can't say more that hasn't already been said about this place.  Staff is kind and informative, food is to die for, bread is crisp outside, soft inside, fresh fresh fresh.   Do yourself a solid and go....please."}
{"text":"It's worth the wait.  There seemed to be a wait every time we passed by, and I know why.  Just eat here.  The wait time was much less than we were told, and the service was prompt.  The sandwiches and pasties were awesome.    Nothing bad to say about here at all.  We wished we stopped by more often while we were in town, but we are glad we did finally try it out."}
{"text":"Scanned Yelp for some good eateries in this area and of course this one stood out. Showed up and were told it would be a 20 minute wait but only took about 10 minutes. The waitress was very attentive to our needs. I ordered the Cuban sandwich and it was very good. Spicy and constructed a little different than a typical Cubano, but good nonetheless. One thing I'd suggest was to add something to the plate, a pickle or even a small handful of chips. The coffee hit the spot, and helped wash down some wonderful selections from the bakery like the blondie and turtle. All in all a great spot to take in an eclectic menu."}
{"text":"I love this little place. They always have the best looking pastries, and the lunch menu is great. I usually go for their cubanos, and it's the fattiest, richest sandwich I've ever had. I usually can't finish the whole thing, so I have a little leftover for later. This place also gets super busy, especially for brunch, so go earlier!"}
{"text":"Relaxed and warm atmosphere. I didn't try the sandwiches but the patisserie was so delicious"}
{"text":"Wonderful, must try spot in Old Montreal.  Getting this out of the way up front..The three negatives that are somewhat minor are...  1. You will wait and wait for a table on a nice weekend. 2. Service is only ok. They are so busy that you may be overlooked at times. 3. No coffee refills. The coffee is 3$, your meal is over $15, but no refills on coffee.  Beyond that...  1. The Cuban and egg in your face paninis are both delicious and of a respectable size. 2. The chocolate brioche bun (as well as the blueberry) are a meal in themselves. I suggest splitting one of these if you are also having something else! This is one of the best sweet treats I have eaten in a long time. 3. The fresh fruit bowl with yogurt is super fresh and delicious. 4. The decor in here is fun. The chandelier (made out of vines) is cool, as are all the chalkboard drawings and general feel of the space.  You have to eat here. Overall, it is a bit pricey, but the food and experience are worth it. Just go slow on the coffee."}
{"text":"Best lunch we've had in Montreal!  Their Cajun chicken sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I've EVER had.  It's definitely big enough to share (although you may not want to...). They've got a butterscotch and pecan bar that's phenomenal. My wife loved her almond croissant."}
{"text":"I give it a breakfast 5 stars, but . . . it is not for anyone looking for a typical breakfast. No omelets and waffles here. We loved our fresh yogurt, fruit and granola; the pastries are amazing; great coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice. They did have a breakfast panini that included egg that looked really good. It's a fun place with a quick turn-around in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"The first thing we did after getting off the train was make a B-line here for lunch. It was a 15 minute walk from the station, made a little more cumbersome with our carry-on's but it was worth it! I was initially disheartened to see the crowd waiting in line, but was pleasantly surprised when we got seated right away once we got the hostess' attention. I think it was because we were a party of 2 and everyone else was waiting for a bigger table. Lesson learned! Always ask!!  My partner in crime got the Mr Miami ($14.95) and we both tucked in happily into the piping hot smoked beef brisket sandwich. The pesto and havarti brought a lovely creaminess while the salsa and red onions gave a hint of sweetness. I skipped the menu and asked for a cheese croissant and a palmier from the bakery. The croissant was perfect in texture (I should have asked for it to be heated up), and the Palmier was the sweet touch at the end of the meal.   For those who don't know what a Palmier is, it's like the Asain butterfly cookie but much larger and with more textures. The outside is crusted with a sugary almond glaze, while the inner flakes are soft and buttery. Absolutely delicious. I would stop by just to grab one of these!!"}
{"text":"Nice vibe overall. If you are a visitor like me and live nearby, it would be a nice place for breakfast/brunch. Servers are polite. Foods are just normal even too oily."}
{"text":"Easy 4.5 stars for O+G. If you're visiting Montreal, you MUST go here.  Located in the heart of Old Montreal, this beautiful restaurant sports huge windows, plenty of natural light, great wines, and super fresh ingredients.  My wife and I both got paninis with a plate of sweet potatoe chips that did not disappoint. Our server recommended a glass of the Chenin Blanc which was the best white wine I've ever had.  I'm not speaking in hyperbole when I say our experience here was euphoric."}
{"text":"Loved it!! Great panini and coffee. Also their chocolate chip & pecan cookie was to die for!"}
{"text":"The Cubain panini did not disappoint. I loved the crusty bread, delicious combination of meat and spicy chipotle mayo, and other hidden flavors. The soup of the day was corn chowder so I ordered it expecting \"American\" version where it's super creamy but the chowder prepared here was vastly different which I liked way better since it was super unique and flavorful. This place is definitely worth your time to check it out if you are in the area!!"}
{"text":"Great ice tea and dirty chai tea!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Our server was extremely arrogant. She made our experience awful."}
{"text":"One of the most overpriced and underwhelming meals I've ever had.  Not only is this place super pretentious about they way they won't customize or modify anything but they also serve food that is impossible to eat!  The veggie burger fell apart the second I tried to eat it and had so much sauce and mustard on it that it immediately stained what I was wearing.  Not impressed..."}
{"text":"Very healthy breakfast choices! 100% worth! It is different, the shop itself gives off a homey vibe, very welcoming. The food and coffee was something, in a good way"}
{"text":"Dernier et tant attendu repas de notre séjour à Montreal !   Evidemment après le documentaire (http://aladistasio.telequebec.tv/a_la_tele/emission.aspx?id=218) dans l'avion sur Olive + Gourmando, j'avais envie de tout goûter !  Nous avons donc pris deux sandwichs qui étaient très bons mais trop gras, beaucoup trop gras, c'est dommage.  Ensuite nous avons pris la petite assiette de ricotta maison, agrémentée de tomates, pignons et salade, un délice ! Puis un cupcake, un peu trop riche et sucré à mon goût.   J'ai cependant deux regrets :  - ne pas avoir goûté les mac&cheese aux champignons - ne pas avoir goûté leurs salades, il n'y en avait plus :-/  Quoi qu'il en soit, c'est une adresse que je vous conseille pour un petit déjeuner ou un déjeuner !"}
{"text":"Artsy place with a cool vibe. My wife and I went there for a nice lunch and that is exactly what we got.  I really like the contrast of flavors that we had in our sandwiches. Mango, cajun chicken, and avocado --MMM!! Delicous!"}
{"text":"La nourriture était délicieuse, ça valait vraiment le détour. Je vais certainement recommander la brioche au chocolat."}
{"text":"The lineups for weekend brunch are more than justified. My wife and I waited over twenty minutes to get a table but our drink orders were taken shortly after sitting down. The mocha I ordered was decorated beautifully and the flavor was the perfect balance of bitter and sweet. The maple pecan brioche we ordered while waiting for our mains was sublimely fresh and gooey. They are not shy with the maple syrup nor the pecans, and for 4.75 it is superb value. I ordered the oeuf coquette and my wife ordered the pizza pocket panini. My favorite part of the coquette was the warm and chewy bread that accompanied the coquette. It was drizzled with olive oil and had such incredible texture that I ate it on its own. Like the coquette, the standout component of the panini was the delicious bread. I was left with a heavy feeling after the meal, and would have appreciated a side salad to provide some lightness."}
{"text":"So so good. Walked into this place after spending the afternoon in old montreal. They told me they were closing at 5 and I got there at 430 so I felt like I had to rush a bit. They also sold out of a few items when I got there so I settled for a grilled cheese which was super yummy with caramelized onions. The bread was also delicious. I also tried an almond croissant and it was awesome. Service was also excellent. Just not sure why they close so early."}
{"text":"LOVEEEED this place! No wonder there are so many reviews and so many positive 5 stars. We came here on a Saturday afternoon during our stay in Montreal and came back on our last day before the airport because it was just that good. On Saturday afternoon it was packed, with locals, tourists, you name it, so we had to wait like a half an hour to get a table, but it was definitely worth it. The second time we came was on a Wednesday around the same time and the wait was only 15 minutes so it really depends, but expect to wait a little. Now, onto the food, it was superb, the Cuban sandwich, toasted, warm, gooey, a lil spicy, was oh em gee delicious. Now onto the pastries, we had both the almond croissant and the tangy blueberry tart, and they were both spectacular, I felt like I got them from the streets of Paris, they were just that good. The next day we came back and tried the Cajun chicken sandwich and the goat cheese, caramelized onion with spicy ketchup one, and once again, filled with soo much flavor. I don't think you can go wrong with any item on the menu, from the drinks, sandwiches, pastries, all are top notch. The atmosphere is buzzing as well, making it much more enjoyable and fun. We loved it here and def. recommend it for all the foodies."}
{"text":"My favourite way to do O&G: late lunch on a weekday, big salad and a glass of wine. If you go here because of hype you're bound to be a little disappointed, it's just a tasty cosy cafe with good food guys, relax. I've always had friendly service, I've always been a little confused by the ordering process, I've always loved what I've had to eat or drink although I do agree the coffee could be even better."}
{"text":"We came here and I wasn't that excited because we can't change anything on the menu- I ordered a mocha which was good but a little too sweet. We ordered to eat, a seasonal riche which was basically a cinnamon roll and it was great- we also had cheese croissants which were YUM! I'd be more than happy to go again!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, but I'd say it's a little overpriced for what it is.   Location is perfect if you're walking around the old town. However, I wouldn't recommend if you're in a hurry, there's usually a long line. I tried coming at non-peak hours, the only problem is that many items on the menu are gone by then.   Groups are also probably not a good idea because of the wait and lack of large tables, but the place is perfect for a date!"}
{"text":"Very popular brunch spot, long waits for delicious food so make sure to show up at 9am if you'd like to sit right away. They offer amazing pastries to hold you over until it's time to dine."}
{"text":"This place has delicious breakfast pastries and food!!  Their coffee is amazing.  Their lunch sandwiches have so much flavor, the bread they make their sandwiches with is the best flavor and crunch combination we have ever had.  First time in Montréal, we ended up coming here 4 times in 3 days!   Thanks Benjamin and the rest of the crew, for such friendly and wonderful service. Benjamin, thanks for the Rose wine bottle suggestion for our friends"}
{"text":"We came here for a late breakfast on a Thursday and we were seated right away. It was either going to be an adjoining table right next to a couple or at the window. We chose the window so we could drink our coffee while people watching the narrow, \"cobblestone\" street.   Very cute decor and friendly staff.   Coffee-- very bitter, not the best by a long shot   Poached Egg on your Face-- closed panini sandwich, with a kick. Large portion. My friend and I could have just ordered one because we both only finished half. I would suggest to share! Ultimately it was not my favorite dish and I wouldn't order it again. I feel like it's hyped up.   There are other things on the menu I would try, but this visit fell short of expectations."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a late lunch and knew we made the right choice by the crowd. We were lucky to be seated quickly but immediately after the wait list spilled on the sidewalk. The servers were attentive, knowledgable , and friendly even in a crowded, hectic environment. We had a Cuban panini and a Cajun chicken sandwich. Both were tasty. As we observed different orders and the way they were enjoyed, I think Olive and Gourmando was a hit for everyone."}
{"text":"I ate what was possibly the most delicious lunch I've ever had in my adult life. I had Le Gustavo, a beautiful panini-like sandwich of grilled red onions, chicken, gruyere cheese, and mushrooms. It was heavenly. I don't usually rave about sandwiches but this was so good that it really set the bar very high for the rest of my meals during my Montreal trip. There was a line when we arrived but we waited not even 10 minutes. My friend ate Le Cubain and that was just as good. Very cute ambience and cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Cuban sandwich alone is worth making a detour for this place! The treats are also yummy! It can get busy at lunch time from workers in nearby offices so arrive early (or wait until later in the afternoon!) The staff is friendly mostly."}
{"text":"Had Cuban sandwich and butternut squash soup, both packed with great flavour. I will definitely come back to try more"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is awesome. My husband and I were in town for a week for our one-year anniversary. We went for lunch on a Tuesday and it was busy but we only waited for about 10 minutes for a table. Their coffee was awesome and their food was amazing. My husband had a sandwich and I had a salad and both were so flavourful and delicious we decided after only a few bites that we were going to go back before our trip was over. It is reasonably priced for how awesome the food is and the staff were all very friendly and checked in on us a lot. We also grabbed a cookie before we left and it was very good, too. Nothing bad to say about this place. It lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Très bien. Le sandwich cubain est excellent.  Les salades sont superbes aussi, de même que toutes les pâtisseries. Le service n'est pas constant; parfois il est excellent et sympathique, d'autres fois il est bête et prétentieux. Heureusement, la nourriture est toujours à la hauteur. Les prix sont un peu élevés, mais on est au cur du vieux Montréal."}
{"text":"Olive & Gourmando is a cute brekkie/brunch spot with delicious pastries and dishes. Chia pudding is amazing. The fresh fruits and mango puree are a nice touch. The muesli adds a great crunch. Banana chocolate brioche is sweet but not overwhelmingly. If the wait is too long, there were many people doing takeaway. So that is also an option. I definitely recommend for brunch before exploring old Montreal."}
{"text":"Great lunch/brunch spot in Old Town. The Mr. Miami was delicious. Great spin on this sandwich with the pineapple/jalapeño dipping sauce. WOW!!"}
{"text":"Best Mac n Cheese and hot cocoa I've ever had in my life. To begin with, who ever thought of mixing truffle sauce with cheese? Genius."}
{"text":"Get the almond croissant, don't ask. Just get it. And maybe slather on some ricotta. OMG. Greatest thing I've tasted in Montreal!  I wish I could have returned for lunch but we only had time for breakfast. This place is very popular but we were lucky to grab two spots in the back. Service is fast and friendly...why can't servers in Los Angeles take note?   Definitely a gem. If I'm ever in Montreal again, I'll make sure to return."}
{"text":"Great place to go to get pastries Fabulous service I love going here every time I'm in Montreal"}
{"text":"Delicious spot! Went for our first meal in Montreal and we are planning on returning today. We had paninis and tea! Very yummy"}
{"text":"Les meilleurs sandwichs au monde se trouvent à cette adresse avec des recettes toutes plus originales les unes que les autres. Sans oublier les délicieuses soupes du jour (en 6mois nous n'avons jamais eu les mêmes) les salades de la semaine et les différents desserts. La décoration est de très bon goût dans un mélange vintage et moderne avec les menus écrit a la craie sur les murs. Les prix sont un peu plus élevés que d'autres restaurant du même type mais restent abordables. En revanche la qualité et le goût sont totalement au rendez-vous ! N'hésitez pas un seul instant."}
{"text":"Whether you're vegan, vegetarian, or a carnivore (me), Olive & Gourmando redefines what wholesome, homemade food should be."}
{"text":"Nice sandwiches and salad. Lot of people on summer days at lunch time."}
{"text":"Hit the restaurant right before the lunch rush. It was worth the 15 minute wait. The Cuban pannini sandwich was one of the best I've had. The crust was crispy without being too hard. My friend ordered the Mac and Cheese. It came out hot with a nice crust and contained mushrooms and carmelized onions. I definitely would go back"}
{"text":"I usually trust Yelp's reviews but found this one off the mark for the experience that we had at Olive & Gourmando.  Yes, it was obvious that it was madly popular and this made for a crowded inside and outside of the restaurant. We added our name to the list and after  sizable wait saw a couple of two who had come in well after us be seated before us.  I questioned the hostess and she said she had looked for us but couldn't find us. We were standing in the restaurant the entire time and it is a very small place so I found that very hard to believe. She half apologized and said a table should be ready shortly. Upon getting to our table we were told that the only hot breakfast item they had on the menu (an egg dish) was sold out. How do you have only a few staple entree items on the menu and sell out of one of them?  I had the ricotta with honey which was served with toast. It was tasty but more of a side than a main and seemed like a lot of money for something comprised of a handful of ingredients and not even cooked. Our coffee was served without milk and our food was served without utensils.  With that said, the apple turnover was one of the best I have ever had.  Maybe I hit this on an off day, but boy was it off."}
{"text":"Tasty food, nice decor, good quality ingredients - the poached eggs in your face panini is very yummy. (But you have to go early because they sell out quickly - around noon, they should stock up on more of those so that we don't have to rush to go early!) The only thing that sucks is the lineup/wait time because it's not a big café, hence the 4 instead of 5 stars. it's not cheap, but I'd rather pay a little bit more for something good than get something cheap that tastes cheap.. After all it's unlikely that you'll find something in old Montreal that is good and cheap."}
{"text":"My wife and I were here in late August and ate here twice while we were in Montreal. The food is delicious as is the coffee and tea. Expect a wait and tight seating quarters but fantastic atmosphere. My favorite waiter sang chaud laaaaa! Every time he went to the kitchen. We will definitely return when we are back in Montreal."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee, very friendly staff and some of the best cafe food we ate in Montreal... came back a few times as we loved it so much...  Be warned, it does get busy...  but absolutely worth every minute of waiting :-)  Definitely a recommend..."}
{"text":"This place is usually quite busy and would be a thirty to forty minute wait on a weekend but it is worth it for a delicious grilled panini.   I tried the Cuban last time and it was so delicious. It's your average grilled sandwich yet it feels way heartier and satisfying. The knock out star of my meal would not be the panini, in fact, it was a drink that was sort of like a fancy lemonade/tea. I can't remember exactly but that was the most refreshing drink I had and went so well with my Cuban. It's a bit on the expensive side for a sandwich but come on, it's olive & gour-met-ando (I tried)"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Most go lunch spot in old Montreal for foodies! Great atmosphere! Fun music! Very lively! Very good menu! Sister restaurant Foxy!"}
{"text":"I had not truly experienced a brioche until I came here.  The sandwiches were delicious, but months later the brioches that stay with me (both in memory and in actuality, on my thighs).  They are astoundingly good.   My friend and I came here twice on our long-weekend trip to Montreal, and munched on brioches and other pastries on the ride home.   The banana chocolate brioche was my favorite.     It gets crowded fast, so get there early, I would say before 11am if possible, if you don't want to wait  a long time for a table.  On the bright (or dark, depending on your perspective on temptation) side, you can admire the piles of amazing looking pastries -- the details of the sheen on the glazed gigantic croissants, the crumbly nooks on the scones, the powdered sugar on the brioches.    The savory goods were indeed good -- I believe we had the Cuban and the Cajun Chicken, both delicious.    If you're planning a trip to Montreal and intend to visit O&G, note that they are closed on Sundays and Mondays."}
{"text":"My cousin took my boyfriend and I here for brunch when we visited Montreal because 1. We love brunch, 2. This is one of her favorite spots. Boy am I glad she introduced O&G to us!   Amazing food. Good atmosphere. Friendly staff. What more can you ask for? The only cons were long wait times and limited menu, but I'm not complaining. We came on a Monday and we seated after 10 minutes. The place was packed. You could practically have a convo at normal voice volume with your neighbors. Luckily that didn't bother us (I was just happy we beat the line).   I ended up ordering the dirty chai latte, chocolate banana brioche, and poached egg on your face panini. 5/5 for all of it! The panini was so flavorful and filling. It doesn't come with a side but I didn't need one. I enjoyed the fact that it was spicy. The brioche is a must! Literally one of the best pastries I've eaten. So delectable.   Totally worth the wait. I'll be back one day!"}
{"text":"Good, but pricey and a little strange. We waited for about 45 minutes for a table for two, so obviously this place is popular. You are packed in, basically sitting shoulder to shoulder with the person next to you. We got fussed at for putting our jackets in the window sill (a little strange), so we had jackets piled on the backs of our chairs. I ordered the Cuban, which was delicious, but pricey at over $10 without any sides. I asked for a side of chips, and all they have are full size bags of chips made for multiple people... So it became close to $20 for a sandwich and chips. Like I said, the food was delicious, but it's pricey for what you get and you don't have much space."}
{"text":"The space was quite crowded on a Saturday morning! But their coffee was heavenly!!   The Mac and Cheese was delicious and simply perfect for a cold winter morning. I enjoyed my meal and was happily full for hours after. I didn't enjoy the salad the came w/ the Mac and Cheese tho - had a particular dressing or smell that didn't please me.   The Oeuf Coquette (Poached egg, tomato, feta, crumbled house chorizo, avocado + Olive's grilled flat bread) was not bad but didn't meet expectations.   If I'm in the city next time I would prob pick up coffee and a baked item from this spot."}
{"text":"C'est un 5 étoiles pour la nourriture et les gâteries au comptoir... mais ils sont victimes de leur succès, en pleine semaine, à 13h, il manque souvent plusieurs des choix. La dernière fois, il restait deux options de plats. Mais les sandwichs étaient délicieux, bien présentés, avec un service de qualité, considérant la folie qui règne dans l'endroit. Aussi, c'est un peu cher pour ce qui est offert... mais ça demeure un incontournable quand on veut se payer un petit luxe et qu'on n'est pas pressé!"}
{"text":"It is so clear once you visit O&G why it is such a fan favorite on Yelp. We visited for an early lunch on a Wednesday during the winter and the place was abuzz. There is a nicely curated arrangements of tables and seats, but despite the busyness, we did not wait more than five minutes for a seat. Service was solid as many people attended to us while we were there. I started with a latte which was perfect for the grey day outside. There were so many options on the menu that appealed to me, but ended up with The Gustavo panini that had chicken, portobello mushroom, balsamic, maple mustard, cheese.. man, it was killer. A lot of their verbiage in the restaurant/cafe speak to their food being 'homemade' and 'made with love' and that is so apparent. When you are done you walk up and cash out at the counter which is very smart. They have you wait in a line that forms along a beautifully arranged counter of delicious pastries, cookies and sweets. If my sandwich hadn't filled me up to the top, I could have impulse bought one of everything. I highly recommend a visit to this clear local and tourist favorite."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon (well more like bixied upon) Olive et Goumando on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Ok, stumbled upon is probably not the right wording either as I was planning on going to O&G but wasn't 100% sure where it was. But my sense of direction is still good as I found it perfectly!  Anyways, the place was packed (as usual) and bustling with people.  I had already eaten lunch so just stopped by to try one of their baked goods. Had the almond croissant ($3.75 I believe) and took it to go. Nice and crunchy, sweet but not too sweet - perfect little snack to eat and enjoy while I sat and lounged by the waters in Vieux-Montreal.  I have been before and the rest of their food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Cute, bustling restaurant with a simple but delectable menu. Bit too crowded for comfort in the dining room. Loved the restaurant, menu and vibe, but it was so busy and cramped. Good problem to have ... for them.   We loved the menu even though it was very carb-heavy as another reviewer mentioned. We enjoyed the stellar selection of baked goods, great coffee, loaded granola yogurt, and the paninis. Really wanted the poached egg panini, but they were sold out.   Experience would have been better if we weren't packed like sardines in there. Service was friendly but forgetful. Our server didn't provide some essential items like utensils, napkins, and side plates for items, then cleared them too soon and never brought more out. It was difficult to reach her during our meal.   It's definitely worth a visit, but expect a tight squeeze. I recommend going during off peak hours or grabbing a coffee and pastry to go."}
{"text":"Really fun environment. Lots of people coming and going. What I was hoping for in Montreal. City hustle and bustle.   The panini had was not bad. $14. Didn't have as much inside the sandwich as their cold one. Only a measly 1 or 2 thin slices of meat. A little greasy too. You really just fill up on the bread.   But it was cooked well. And again we ha to try as it was alway such a packed place.   They have some other cookies and coffee that look pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Although the coffee, sweets and paninis are good, Olive et Gourmando is probably not worth the wait or price."}
{"text":"J'adore l'ambiance, la nourriture y est très conviviale. Superbe place, bonne musique et beaux produits!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Every time we tried to grab breakfast or lunch here, there was a line out the door. So, in the midst of a drenching downpour, we ran to O&G for an early dinner at 5:15 pm. When we arrived, we were shown a table for our large party of six. We were also told that the cafe closes at 6 and they were out of all cold sandwiches. Soaked and ravenous, we ordered teas, coffees, hot paninis and a fabulous ricotta, corn and tomato salad. The food was delicious--made with interesting combinations of real, fresh ingredients. Just what we needed warm up and fill up. Almond croissant was divine, as well."}
{"text":"We went to O&G for a breakfast. It is a very busy place. The wait time was about 15 minutes on Friday morning. We took a short walk, came back after 10 minutes and were invited in right away. Everything on our order, the cha-cha-chia bowl, fresh orange juice, coffee, pastries, fruit salad and yogurt, was delicious. The pastries are amazing!! I just wish we would have something like this place in Virginia."}
{"text":"So great! Perfect breakfast spot! The croissant, granola and egg sandwich were great! Good tea and coffee. Need to go back for more pastries!"}
{"text":"Oh yummy. If you are in the mood for a great breakfast or brunch, you have to try Olive & Gourmando. They have some of the best pastries you will ever have in your life.  It can get crowded, but the wait is never long. The service is fast and friendly. I love their eggs and any of the pastries are just the best."}
{"text":"There were insects crawling around on their pastries including bees and flies (took a picture).  The restaurant is way too small for how many people they let in and there is no space for a stroller OR carrier if you have a baby. The line to wait for food was over an hour and then the time to receive the food was average.  The food was OK but nothing too impressive."}
{"text":"Read about this place in the Chicago Guide magazine and decided we must come to Montreal and try this place and so here we are! OMG... Best sandwich ever (ok..there is Ike's in San Francisco that is a Best as well, but different) .. I don't even think we should call it a sandwich... Panini... it sounds better .... this place serves the most out of the world Panini... the Cuban is the best... ok, we loved the Cajun chicken as well.. (and I don't normally go out of my way for sandwiches) Not sure the spread they use but it is delicious.... of course we had to try their croissant... it's on the smaller side, but I like it because it is not filled with tons of butter! The exterior is perfectly crusty, and the interior is soft. It's probably the first time I had a croissant and not feel heavy. We came at 11 and that seems to be the perfect time. Anything after 11:15, you will probably stand in the line."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!  I can see why this place gets so many great reviews!  We came here because we've heard so much about it and it was super close to our AirBnB.    The pastries here are to die for 100%. We even got more to go home with and made the effort to hand-carry them on the plane to bring back to Toronto.  After having pastries here, all the other places in Toronto are no longer the best, sadly.    We also got a breakfast panini, which was absolutely fantastic!  It was a good mix of spicy and savoury and it was also to die for.  It's a shame that we didn't get to stay in Montreal longer because I would have come back here multiple times!    Word of advice, try walking around this area and don't even attempt driving...it is insane.  The first day, we drove around and parking was impossible and then we realized this was minutes away from our AirBNB so we ended up walking the next day :)."}
{"text":"Super place pour manger sainement et à prix très abordable.  Les sandwichs sont délicieux et les serveurs sympathiques.  Pour passer dun bon temps entre amis durant le w-e dans le Vieux-Montreal!"}
{"text":"Ooo la la!  Cet endroit est incroyable!    Okay, so I used Google Translator for that French.  Not sure if it appropriately translated, so this is what I wrote...\"Ooo la la!  This place is incredible!\"  We had heard about it from folks we met in Toronto.  When we were walking around Old Town in Montreal, we weren't looking for it...but we stumbled onto it.  Glad we did!  The line was very long, so we decided to come back mid-afternoon.  Good choice, even though there was still a line...it was much shorter.  The wait was worth every minute!  We had delicious sandwich and one of the best salads (unusual combo) ever.  Of course, on the way out the door we bought a few baked goodies.  This place was one of the top 3 places we ate at during our two week trip.  Great food and fun, energetic atmosphere!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I would rate this a 5, but for a couple of quirks. I will definitely go again when next in Montreal.  Two of us had the house made ricotta with honey and toast. Adult and child both loved it.  I had the bufala maple yogurt with fruit. It was perfect. Maybe 8-10 types of fruit chopped tiny with the delicious yogurt. Quirk: happy accident as this was not exactly what I had ordered. When I got to the bottom of the bowl and had not encountered the granola, I really didn't care as it was that good.  One had the egg on your face panini which she enjoyed, but found the spicy warning out of place.  The croissants, plain and almond, were much enjoyed by mother and child.  Quirk: for $4.50 each I would expect the hot chocolate to be made with milk. They were bitter dark chocolate and watery. The children and adults agreed that even with added sugar, these were disappointing."}
{"text":"Make sure to call ahead or to come early to avoid lines and a long wait!"}
{"text":"I had the cha-cha-chia bowl at Olive & Gourmando and it was pretty good. It was a very tasty, unique breakfast meal with nuts and all that good stuff.  I also ordered some toasts with peanut butter, which were a bit over-toasted, but no harm done.  Finally, I ordered the elixir iced tea, which was a very nice, refreshing drink without copious amount of sugar.  I, for one, would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Come early if you don't want to wait too long! My friends and I arrived around 11:00 AM and had to wait a little while - seems to be always very busy, especially on weekends for brunch.   This is a really cute place with lots of interesting pastries. We sat down for brunch and each ordered an entree. I had the chorizo egg dish - really really good, with the nice toasty bread. One of my friends ordered the Chia bowl, which came in a jar with lots of nuts and fruit. The coffee beverages are very good.   This is a must visit for brunch in Montreal :)"}
{"text":"An adorable place in Old Montreal get a great breakfast/brunch!  The space is quaint, cozy, and FULL of people. Don't let that deter you, the food is worth the wait. The poached egg sandwich was completely delicious - perfectly cooked egg, a roasted tomato that was the star of the sandwich, and some smoky prosciutto that added another great layer of  flavor.  Service is great considering how busy they are. The folks that work there are friendly and very helpful.  Don't leave without a sweet treat for the road. The salted caramel turtle bar was seriously the yummiest thing I ate in all of Montreal."}
{"text":"This corner café in Old Montreal is seriously one of the best in the entire city. The food and pastries are absolutely second to none. Everything I have had here has been incredibly creative, fresh, and tasty. The atmosphere is also truly charming. I love their Franglais plays on words written on their chalkboard walls; the charming old seating and the windows filled with plants that open onto the cobbled streets and three-hundred year old buildings. It would be improved if they added a row of street seating (were it legal) for those beautiful summer days. And it is insanely crowded - at 3 PM on a Wednesday, no less. I am not sure if there is ever a time you will feel relaxed here...but that's what you get when you offer the best food in the best surroundings in a neighborhood somewhat surprisingly lacking in other quality offerings. If you are going to Old Montreal, make this your morning or afternoon repose, bar none."}
{"text":"Wait, is this place for real? Excellent prices? And right in the heart of tourist country?  Score.    This place was really busy the day I dropped in with some friends.  The wait was short for a table and we got three different sandwiches (the veggie one with coppocolla (s/w), the cuban, and the cajun).  All the sandwiches were really tasty with the veggie/cured ham sandwich being my favorite.  The salad was full of great fresh vegetables and dill.    We were all kind of full but we split a blueberry tart, which was good, but not my fav. One person at the table ordered an allongée (coffee) and it looked and smelled so amazing, that the other two got one as well.    The inside of the place has a great atmosphere and les prix sont corrects. You should definitely check it out."}
{"text":"A friend told us we MUST go here and so off we went! They don't do reservations and the wait is always 45 minutes +. We decided it would be worth it if all these people are hanging around and actually waiting.   Their menu is succinct, 3 cold pani is, 2 hot paninis, 2-3 salads, a small brunch menu, and beverages. You take the order as is because they facilitate ZERO MODIFICATIONS. Fine by me because everything was delicious! I ordered the Tartine, emotionally prepared to not finish it because it looked HUGE, but it was surprisingly light! It's a large baguette with ricotta, tomatoes, corn, peaches, nuts, and other great things. SO good.   The Cubain was another one that was super bomb! That pickle mayonnaise...like what is that?!! I also had their grapefruit spritz with a touch of aperol and it was the most refreshing drink I've ever had.  4 stars because my husband asked for a side of chips and got an entire bag emptied in a bowl! Which is cool, but then let us know it's an entire large sized bag bc we didn't want all of it and didn't want to waste it either."}
{"text":"I had one of the best Ciabattas I've ever had here. Love the staging as well as their service. Will revisit if I go to Montreal again."}
{"text":"Wow the almond croissant!!! Cane back on Sunday to get some to go and they were closed.  Next time I will not be that eager and I will Yelp the closing times!!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. The grilled cheese was good but nothing super special. Great environment although some of the tables were too close to each other and you would be basically eating with strangers."}
{"text":"Great salads and French toast. Very different from what we were expecting and we enjoyed the eclectic tastes with both of these. Olive & Gourmado uses lots of nuts & seeds and some rarer fruits and vegetables for both dishes. We would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Soooo yummy. Was hanging around old Montreal and came across tons of people lining up in front of this restaurant, went in and ordered some random food for takeout. (So called \"random\" cuz I can't read French.) After I coming back to hotel and ate them, I was amazed by how good they are - the almond croissant, tartellete, canjun sandwich and homodero sandwich (not sure abt all the spellings) were all beyond my expectation! All 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The seating was a little chaotic.. I guess you can't help that when you are super popular but it was a bit alarming. We weren't sure if people were being seated in front of us because they were a smaller party or if they had forgotten us. That being said, we were able to get a snack while we waited. VERY quickly we received our pastries and coffee. Almost instantly. That held us over while we waited. Once we were seated we ordered and the food came quickly. The Panini was much larger than expected and I couldn't even finish it. It was very good with just the right amount of heat. If I'm being honest, I wouldn't come back here to eat breakfast as a sit down, but I would come back for their pastries. That was probably the best Croissant I've had in my life. And the oatmeal cookie was incredible."}
{"text":"Excited to try this place after looking at so many great reviews. We opted to do take out since it was so busy on a Sunday morning and our order came up fast.   The Cuban panini was wonderful, it had a spice to it with the meats added in the sandwich. It was big enough to split if you're not too hungry.   Lattes are on the weaker side here, we ordered the large size but it just seemed as if there was only extra milk not espresso.   So many different things to look at when you walk in and a wide selection of desserts and pastries."}
{"text":"Our concierge recommended it to us and we loved it. Long wait (Saturday brunch around 2PM and waited a good 40 min) but really enjoyed our meals and treats!  We split the healthy salad and egg in your face panini, both I would order again. The service was good, they seemed to have an overflow of hands on staff which never left you waiting for a refill etc.  I didn't love my citron scone but truthfully it was a random choice for me, my BF loved his maple pecan brioche. Latte was mediocre.  Would highly recommend a wknd brunch here!"}
{"text":"I am not a pregnant woman, but after that meal, my food baby was ready to be born!!  As a tourist in Montreal, I had heard that Olive & Gourmando was a must, and I can see why. I ate lunch with 3 friends, and the wait was about 30 minutes. We walked around the beautiful cobblestone streets surrounding the restaurant while we waited. The food was rich and tasteful & the atmosphere was cozily funky.   Be prepared to wait and possibly walk around while doing so, as there is not much seating available for those waiting. However, the setting is something out of a fairytale book, and the food is worth it. Definitely deserving of its status!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by many people so we wanted to give it a try.  It's a pretty frenetic space. A small space that tries to pack them in.  To add to the confusion, the front desk isn't manned very well so first timers are left wondering, is this a line or do you wait to give your name.    The menu is okay but if your in the mood for something plain, this place isn't for you.  It serves one type of soup and a handful of sandwiches.  I chose the grilled cheese and it was good-not packed with cheese but good.    Their bakery is okay. We had  an Apple hand pie  which was exceptionally good. The next the chocolate almond croissant roll which was NOT.  The double chocolate cookie was very good.    This place just left me flat. It felt like they had achieved this reputation and didn't need to go beyond that, so take it or leave it."}
{"text":"In the heart of Old Port. This is a gem!! I think this is my favorite place in Montreal, maybe because I loved my sandwich. I had the On Your Face panini sandwich, which was spicy poached egg. SOOO full of flavor. The green tea was also very fresh and tasty, wish they gave it in a bigger glass.   Only thing I wasn't a fan of is the set up of the place. Wait in line to get seated, once seated, go wait in line to order, and when you're done eating gotta wait in line to pay. Very inefficient but still loved the food."}
{"text":"This was my favorite spot in Montreal.  The food was phenomenal yet not pricey.  Perfect for breakfast or lunch.  The chicken-avocado-mango sandwich.  Yum.  Yum.  Yum.  Go!  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and I ate the Veggie Chili. It was DELICIOUS. The place was slammed with people (1:30 lunch rush) but all the staff were calm and very kind. The decor is funky/homey with a great sound system going. It's a bit pricey but I have no idea if this area is \"the place to be\". I'm visiting from NYC. Def will go back and recommend to people."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast or brunch. I came here on a weekend so there were more people and there was a wait. Only waited 15 mins. The staff and workers are all really nice. Explain the menu really well. Their egg plates were good, but their sandwiches were better. I think they are more known for sandwiches anyways."}
{"text":"A very interesting spot. The wait staff basically says it's our way or no way...it's what's on the menu & it's exactly the way THEY want it.   The soup of the day (tomato veg) was good but not overly great. The Cubano Sandwich was also good but not super good. Thought it would have been better based on the line up to get into this place. I doubt I'd go outta may way to go again."}
{"text":"Such a cute little cafe in Old Montreal. Food is mainly soups, sandwiches and salads but it is very good. They have a good selection of pastries to go with very good coffee and other beverages. Would definitely recommend this place; in fact we went there in two consecutive days during our 4 day trip!"}
{"text":"Le sandwich cubain est à se jetter par terre!!! Excellent! Longues files d'attente alors il faut parfois s'armer de patience. Service parfois expéditif et non chaleureux, j'ai été déçue à deux reprises."}
{"text":"The panini lived up to the reviews.  I had the poached egg breakfast panini and it was absolutely delicious.  The croissants and pain au chocolat were also perfect.  Flaky, buttery.  The service was very good despite how busy they were.  We got there around 8:30am on a Saturday and managed to get a table for 4 right away.  We're definitely going back next time we're in Montreal."}
{"text":"I had the afternoon to myself in Montreal and decided to explore a bit. But first--lunch! Olive & Gourmando appeared to be a great option in the heart of where I wanted to putter around so I pointed my cab driver in this direction and away we went. When we pulled up in my cab I saw the long line of folks waiting outside and I grew immediately concerned. I just wanted something tasty but quick so I could get to wandering. Sure enough, the wait was about 30 minutes. But, lucky for me, since I was solo diner I was able to be seated right away at the window bar in the back of the restaurant.  It was super tight back there and not a lot of room to move, but it was quite alright because I wasn't there to linger anyway. I ordered a sandwich (The Pomme) and an iced tea and settled into my map to figure out where to go first. After a few minutes, my sandwich came out, smelling amazing and looking delicious. The Pomme is a panini of sorts filled with double smoked bacon, housemade walnut butter, sliced apples, garlic vinaigrette, and cheddar. So so good. It's also HUGE. I could only get through 2/3rds before calling it quits. FYI-- the bread gets super crispy from the toasting/press, and I totally cut up the roof of my mouth trying to wolf that thing down. No regrets, though!   After I finished I cashed out and ordered a latte and a sweet treat at the coffee bar inside for the road. The pastries looked amazing and I almost bought a few to take with me but I didn't want to be bogged down with bags while sightseeing so I just got a chocolate turtle bar in the end. This was maybe my highlight of the trip here. I have a real sweet tooth and this did the trick. It had a layer of thick, dark ganache, followed by a layer of pecans mixed into a gooey rich caramel, followed by a buttery shorbread base holding it all together. Damn good. I wish I had gotten another one for later. Latte was also really well done.  The space is small but cozy and the decor, a mix of wood with a flora and fauna feel, felt welcoming. I'd definitely return here on a future visit. I'd just plan for a wait if I'm not flying solo."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I walked around the neighbourhood trying to find a good place for breakfast/brunch, we read the glowing reviews on yelp and decided to come here. We arrived at about 9am on a Sunday and it was already packed, there were two groups of people ahead of us waiting in line. Still, the waiter was able to sit is within 5 minutes.  The water came quickly, and the waitress took our order right away! Here's what we ordered: 1 coffee 1 orange juice 1 almond croissant  1 chocolate croissant  1 Oeuf Coquette ( poached egg with tomatoes and feta crumbles) 1 Tartine ( stacks of cucumber, roasted squash, asian pear, nuts, herbs & honey+lemon+Aleppo pepper dressing on top of homemade ricotta and a huge slice of bread)  .. okay, in hindsight, we ordered way too much food.. but it was definitely worth it! Everything was super fresh and tasty, and they are very flexible with customizing your order. I asked for my poached eggs vegetarian ( it usually comes with chorizo).  Seeing other yelpers' reviews on paninis, I wish we had gotten that as well!!  We will definitely go back to try more items:)"}
{"text":"Best place to go for lunch. It's always packed, which is a good sign, so I just walk to the back and order lunch to go. Their soups are tasty and salads, really good. Haven't had their pastries yet, try to resist, but they look like the best things I've seen in Montreal. Great service, good food, great atmosphere, decent price, I will be back. Love this place!"}
{"text":"France away from France! Quel endroit! Super charmant et la bouffe est bonne! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Last week, I was at the old port and decided to try this place out. We arrived around noon and it was packed, we went inside and put our names on the list, we waited about an hour before being seated, I was starving and the waiter wasn't coming by fast enough for me. After another 15 minute wait inside our waiter showed up and took our order.   Thankfully our ordered arrived 10 minutes after, we started off with the soup of the day, which was a very luscious tomato soup with chunks of sweet potatoes, carrots, celery, wild rice and chick beans. It was one of the best soups I have ever had.  I had ordered the Miami sandwich, which consisted of smoked beef brisket, grilled red onions, cilantro pesto mayo, havarti,  and a pineapple and jalapeño salsa on the side. Wow! What a great combination, the panini was pressed with grill marks on it, the cheese was oozing out. The pesto mayo just brought all the flavors together.   We also had a fresh baked chocolate cookie with a blueberry tart. Very fresh, sweetness was just enough not overly sweet.  Altogether, it was a great experience, the wait was certainly worth it.  Everything we tried was delicious from the drinks to the food and desserts. No wonder they have such high ratings."}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday morning and it was packed, waited 15mins for a table. Service was friendly and prompt once seated. Would recommend the Miami special sandwich. Great experience, would come again for lunch or just a casual coffee with friends."}
{"text":"Pretty good brunch/lunch spot considering it's the old port and the surrounding places are rather tourist traps in general. However if you decide to go on a weekend be prepared to wait! We got there around noon and was told that the wait was 1 hour for 2 ppl!  Thankfully they have takeout and it was a nice day to sit outside and take in the old port vibe. We ordered the O&G grilled cheese - pretty decent grilled cheese, good size, well seasoned and great choice of cheeses. We also had the Vegan 2.0 panini, it was flavourful but lacked texture. I understand it's a cold panini, but the sandwich could have been so much more awesome had the bread been crunchy and the chickpea patty more consistent.   Would go back if in the area, but would not drive there for that sole purpose or wait in line for."}
{"text":"Crowded but the food is heavenly! The restaurant being closed on Mondays seems strange"}
{"text":"Limited breakfast menu, but the quality of what they have more than makes up for it - you can't go wrong with anything you order.  Phenomenal coffee and pastries too."}
{"text":"This place is so good, you can never get a seat. I advise you come by during the summer.  lots of nice places for a little picnic in Old Mtl."}
{"text":"I enjoyed it. very much. The sandwich was tasty. The staff was friendly. I rather enjoyed it. grilled, fatty sandwiches filled with cheese and pesto and chicken... WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE???"}
{"text":"Honestly, if my boyfriend brings up this sandwich one.more.time...In fairness, it was THAT good. He had the cuban. I had the poached egg on your face panini. Mine was just the right about of spicy/egg/cheese/bread to immediately cure that slight pounding in my head from the wine the night before. Go. Seriously."}
{"text":"My previous time in Montreal, I unfortunately walked in right at closing time. This time around I made it a point to stop by, even risking missing my flight. Was it worth it? Oui Oui Absolutely! Had the cubain, which can only be discriminated as a fancy upscale Cuban. What a great delicious take on a classic sandwich. The menu is filled with inventive interpretations. It's no wonder the place is always filled to the brim"}
{"text":"I wish I had done more research on this place. I was excited to try their acclaimed sandwiches, but when I arrived in the AM hours, I was unfortunately notified that it was too early to serve those items and was presented with a breakfast menu. I opted for the Chia Bowl/Pudding. Food arrived fairly quickly, and I noticed the crowd that gathered ranged from businessmen on a morning meeting, to runners who were grabbing a quick bite. There were also several people on their electronics doing their own work.   As for the Chia Bowl, I was pleasantly surprised for the first bite as it had the right amount of crunch and sweetness in it. However, this quickly became a dish that couldn't maintain its initial appeal. I eventually grew sick of the dish halfway through. I am not one to leave food unfinished but I did just that with this dish. With about 5 spoonfuls left, I betrayed my family's teachings to never leave food unfinished and asked my server for the bill. Simply put, the flavour just grew too bland with each bite I took.   Verdict: A cute little cafe to get work done. Service is friendly, but I can't say I can wholly recommend the Chia Bowl/Pudding given my experience with the item. It wasn't a bad dish, but it didn't stand out either."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING bakery!!! Oh how I wished I was able to squeeze in a 2nd trip here. They have the most amazing croissants... pain du chocolat. I credit myself on being able to spot good food when I see one and ordered the most amazing bread/ pastry that I saw in the display. OMG. DROOL!!! Hands down all time favorite bakery IN THE WORLD!  We had a cuppa hot chocolate along with the breakfast... OOH SOO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Very cool place.  It would do well in SF.  Very diverse menu with fresh ingredients. . . soups and salads.  Excellent Goat Cheese panini.  Listened to the guy who wrote 36 hours in Montreal and he was spot on."}
{"text":"Brunch was so good! We missed beating the rush Saturday morning and went back Sunday and I'm so glad we went.  Show up about 10 minutes before they open on Saturday or Sunday and you should get seated.  We enjoyed a pastry which was definitely the one of the best almond pastries I've ever tried (check some of my other reviews and you'll see I'm quite the pastry fanatic), The ricotta toast, and the pork breakfast sandwich.  I couldn't pick my favorite because they were all so incredibly amazing. Although this restaurant was full of families with young children, my only negative feedback would be that there were no high chairs which made it difficult to savor our breakfast holding a wiggly toddler. That said the service was quick so we didn't have to hold him for too long. The atmosphere is so quaint and worthy of your social media photos."}
{"text":"Love the vibe at this restaurant. Place small and can get a little squishy but somehow it doesn't matter salads and sandwiches are FABULOUS!! Fresh and very tasty. Lots of take out and some nice baked goods. It is a must. Go this summer and take a nice walk down St Paul."}
{"text":"Nice place for breakfast/coffee or wine/lunch. Nice options. Good vibe. A tad pricey but normal for that area. I'd go back.  Had a vegan sandwich and two glasses of wine yesterday afternoon. Yum. Place was cute, but something was a bit lacking. Not sure what. Feeling, I guess. But that's just me."}
{"text":"Comme a l'habitude la nourriture est parfaite. Le sandwich au poulet cajun est excellent."}
{"text":"Cuban panini was delicious!  Raspberry lemonade and almond croissant were disappointing...Maison Christian Faure almond croissant is flakier and richer."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is thriving and hip. The staff and servers are friendly and welcoming, which is a huge plus. I was solo so I bypassed the long queue (over 60 minutes) and was seated and served right away. The food was solid, the coffee was tasty but I wasn't blown away."}
{"text":"Being a spoiled New Yorker not many places wow me, O&G did just that.  My wife and I spent a few days in Montreal and this was a definite we wanted to try and we are glad we did.  What a gem!  The whole vibe and decor is perfect.  The food was even better.  We came for breakfast and to start the coffee is outstanding.  This is not your typical diner or local brunch joint watered down coffee, it was full of flavor.  My wife and I enjoyed the a lot.  It is fairly priced and the service was top notch.  If you are in Montreal this is a must!"}
{"text":"Love this little spot! Although very crowded, the breakfast sandwich and the cuban (a bit on the salty side for some people) are amazing! Homemade ricotta was super yummy also. Best to go during weekdays when it's not packed with people to enjoy some tea and a brioche."}
{"text":"Super cool ambience with a really warm feeling vibe. We came in around 5 pm and there was no wait, but they were out of a lot of the menu items, such as all cold sandwiches.  Regardless, we were here more for coffee and some sweet bites. GET THE PALMIER! IT IS A GODSEND. The berry pie bar was very dense, but in a good way. We also got the pistachio lemon bar. Just the right amount of sweet and tart, and I loved the crunch the pistachios gave in the middle. Finally, the citron cookie also had a bit of a coconutty flavor to it. The lemon was obviously not as pronounced as in the lemon bar, but the light tinge complemented the white chocolate chips well.  Their cappucino and drip coffee came in big portions, and tended to sway more on the bitter side. Not in a bad way though! I quite enjoyed it. Anyways, would love to come back and try their sandwiches, but even their last pick baked goods were delicious."}
{"text":"During our four day trip to Montreal we got the chance to visit Olive and Gourmando.  our favorite was the home nade ricotta with honey and orange zest and wow were we blown away by this simple but beautifully presented dish.  overall great experience!  definitely worth your time and money."}
{"text":"Easily the best lunch I had during my trip in Montreal!  Even though this spot was packed to the brim during lunchtime, the wait wasn't too bad (about 15 minutes).  My sister and I ordered the Cajun Chicken sandwich and the Summer Garden Salad to share. When the sandwich arrived, I instinctively started picking out the orangey-yellow slices, until my sister told me to \"STOP\" and then I realized I was picking out mango slices, not cheese.  Thank god my sister stopped me before I picked them out, because the sandwich was UHHH-MAZIN'! The mango was perfectly ripened and sweet to counterbalance the savory cajun chicken.  The garden salad was phenomenal as well. They don't gyp you on the greens and lentils. The salad was flavorful, had a spicy kick, and was super filling. This salad is definitely not an afterthought on the menu.  Service was friendly and prompt, and Olive & Gourmando was the perfect spot to watch the long queue for the Kendrick Lamar pop up shop at the Phi center across the street.  100% recommend this place. Make this your lunch spot when you're in Old Town!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite meal of my trip to Montreal. Visited on a sunny August Monday for lunch. There was about a 45 minute wait for two. Lots of people were waiting on the sidewalks corners surrounding the place. Wandered next door to an adorable lunch box store and then came back. My grumbly stomach couldn't wait for lunch so I had a chocolate chip cookie from the bakery. It was warm and very chocolatey (always a good thing!) so I found it to be a solid choice. We were seated a few minutes earlier than expected. I had the salty ricotta plate which came with delicious warm bread and an heirloom tomato and pine nut salad. It was a nice size portion and the perfect summer lunch. My fiancé got the \"poached egg on your face\" panini and found his to be somewhat overrated due to how heavy the sandwich was. He felt like the sandwich lacked a brightness/acidity to cut through the heaviness. Overall, was a good experience and the service was very pleasant, friendly, and patient despite the obvious busy time. Would highly recommend for brunch or lunch!"}
{"text":"Absolutely charming and delicious, perfect for a morning brunch, nice lunch and even an afternoon wine with a pastry. The crowd is nice yet not uptight and it's also located in the nicest part of the city. Must-do."}
{"text":"Honestly folks get a grip.  The sandwiches are good but not extraordinary and not worth going out of your way for.  It gets a zero for ambiance.  All the guide books talked this place up but we just didn't get it."}
{"text":"Primarily a lunch spot, it also has gained some fame for their pastries and breads. Understandably so. The wait to eat in, even at 1:30 on a Friday was nearly half an hour, but it's totally worth it. They have a daily soup (Roasted pepper the day I was there. Drat) and a selection of both hot and cold sandwiches. There are also daily salad selections to choose from. I went pretty simply and got the Smoked Trout sandwich, consisting of  hot-smoked trout, capers, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach and herbed cream cheese. It was really quite good. The smokiness of the trout blended so well with the rest of the ingredients and oh man, the bread. This is a great example of what a sandwich should be. Together in this way, the ingredients offer a taste palate you wouldn't get from any other incarnation.   The man next to me was determinedly devouring their Cuban sandwich, a favorite apparently. He sure looked pleased. On my way out I grabbed what turned out to be the best latte I've had in recent memory and a palmier pastry to nibble on later. I would go out of my way to grab a pastry here in the mornings.   Did I mention to can get everything à porter (take away)?   I wish I was closer!"}
{"text":"Best. Sandwiches. Ever.   Yep, we were a bit worried that the place would feel touristy (so many reviews on Yelp! and this one is not helping!). Maybe it is the case, but honestly, who cares - even tourists are allowed to have great tastes.   We had 2 sandwiches, one hot (with more cheese that you could ever imagine, and I am French), one cold (with chicken and mango and guacamole and probably a bit of magic because it was the best thing we had in a week in Montreal). Each was around CAN$11-13. It was awesome. We didn't try desserts (they seem to mostly have pastries), I don't remember service, I just remember those sandwiches. If you are in Montreal, it would be a sin not to go eat them right now."}
{"text":"This place captured me with its cute looks, but our breakfast there will bring me back.  While in Montreal for a winter weekend wedding, our group of friends discovered o+g. We went early on in the day, when it was bubbling but not yet crowded. Somehow I read the menu wrong and didn't realize that the 'poached egg on your face' is a panini, but still found it tasty and a bit indulgent (but wish there was a touch of green to break through the grease). The Tall Man got the housemade ricotta, which he still dreams about and was one of the best things he's eaten.  While I didn't try the pastries, my friends who did were very very happy."}
{"text":"One of the best Cuban sandwiches I have had....and I have had them in a lot of countries....   Long wait but it was worth it.  Very reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Very tasty panini and crisp salads with fresh ingredients in a lovely though crowded and noisy setting. We split the Pomme - bacon, cheddar, apple slices with vinaigrette. It was delightful!! Wait staff was helpful and pleasant - until the end. We were unaware that we were not supposed to leave the table to go to the bakery shelf and order some take out. We were scolded a bit - which was fine but rather silly. I mean it's more money in the bank and there was no signage or warning we'd be breaking an unspoken law! Any way - the almond croissant and banana chocolate brioche was little better than average and tasted a day or so old. So, maybe skip that part!"}
{"text":"wow, i was amazed by how this place truly lives up to its hype. olive and gourmando is walk-in only (and be prepared to wait, this place is super popular) and a must for any foodie visiting montreal.  we did a family style brunch and ordered a number of different things, including their housemade ricotta, chocolate croissant and tartine. their tartine is a great dish to share amongst friends, as it is a carefully composed pile of ricotta, heirloom tomatoes, fresh corn, fried garlic, peaches, cucumbers, basil, chives, parmesan reggiano, grilled red onions, and toasted almonds - all nestled on top of a slice of their chewy bread and dressed with some lemon-maple vinaigrette. it's got a little bit of everything, and somehow every bite feels perfectly balanced in flavor and texture."}
{"text":"Everything here is good! So well located, even tourists who look to visit the street will stop by at least once during their stay in town to taste bakery, sandwich or salad. It has been years and still today, every weekday lunch is packed!"}
{"text":"I only took a star off because it's a bit dear for what you get...it's fantastic for sure, but 13 bucks for a Cuban sandwich and not even a tiny salad or coleslaw to go with it.  That being said, a memorable sandwich and I'd still go back to try their other ones.  Place is super busy, like all the time...being smack dab in the middle of old Montreal will do that.  Pastries are fantastic too...grabbed an almond croissant on the way out and it was super.  Again, 4 bucks is certainly on the high end for a pastry, but you get what you pay for.  Service was good and despite how busy it was, the vibe was still enjoyable.  So yeah, a bit over the top on price, but it is a really really good place to grab lunch and I'd still go back."}
{"text":"Like but not love.  Excellent coffee and amazing baked goods/ pastries  but once you sit down and order the brunch items... there's nothing here that hasn't been done a thousand times before (and just as good if not better).  Unfortunately this neighborhood can be a tourist-trap, at times... so this option shines compared to what maybe down the block or across the street...  But I'm also not sure about the crazy long waits during prime lunch/brunch hours... there are definitely better options on how to spend your time"}
{"text":"We were lucky to stop in on a Monday afternoon for a late lunch when we could be seated immediately. The soup of the day was tomato with chorizo, chipotle, and feta. Yum. It was just spicy enough. I also had the Big Healthy Salad (that's its name) with mixed greens, carrots and cucumbers, herbs, hummus, quinoa, lentils, smoked almonds and a turmeric/ginger dressing. Excellent! Unfortunately the grilled garlic bread was sold out, but we were offered grilled wheat bread that's used for the cold sandwiches. It was tasty, especially with the high-quality butter served in a cute little butter crock. The service was good, and all three of us were happy with the food. The bill was reasonable -- can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Wanted to check what all the buzz was about. There was an hour and a half wait time. Got the almond croissants. It was normal. I have had better ones."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars from me, at least from the breakfast standpoint. We came here because it was a highly recommended spot located in Old Montreal, and we wanted to try it out.   For breakfast I had a coffee, and the granola. The granola is amazing it comes with yoghurt and a bunch of different types of fruit. It was delicious. I also had a chocolate and banana pastry which was super yummy as well.  This place is very busy but we were seated and served pretty quickly. I really liked this place and would totally come here again."}
{"text":"Dropped in for breakfast before heading to the airport and it was a fitting end to a great food experience in Montreal.    - Homemade \"Sweet\" Ricotta The ricotta came with honey, orange zest and sea salt, served w/ toast.  Thought it could've come w/ a little more honey to balance out for each bite.  Could be preference, but by the end, only had the ricotta on toast left over, which was good by its own right   - \"Poached egg on your face\" Panini Probably my favorite dish of the morning, the bread had a satisfying crunch on the outside w/ a soft interior.  The cheese and egg melts in your mouth, complimented by the siracha for a spicy kick.  The menu says a speck of pork, but there was a decent amount of pig in there.  Maybe speck means something different in Canada...  - Butter Croissant Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, done perfectly.  - Apple Turnover Not too sweet, with the brown sugar coating gave it an extra crunch.  - Chocolate-Banana Brioche So flavorful but extremely dense.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but you could probably get full just off of the brioche, so beware when ordering."}
{"text":"Montreal's food scene is outstanding; Olive and Goirmando shines amongst the multitudes of the amazing avenues the city offers - this speaks volumes of how great this place is.   We tried the following:  -- Hot Panini: it was delicious, had all the right flavors, I would give it 4 stars.  -- Soup of the day: The tomato soup served that day was with out a doubt the best tomato soup I have ever had. We were trying to figure out all of the ingredients that went in to making it, but fell short of a few not-so-obvious ones. Our server was so kind she wrote all the ingredients down on a list for us. I would give it a 6/5:yes it was that good. -- Tartine(Vegan): Not like I have had my fair share of Tartines, but I'm confident that this one would be extremely hard to beat. The medley of flavors blended so well together - certainly one of the most satiating meal I have ever had. 5 stars!  -- Mocha: Epic.   Ambience:  It's a beautiful setting, the only thing I felt was tables could be a little far apart and they might want to keep a larger waiting area. But apart from that, not a thing I can complaint about.   I highly recommend this place for brunch."}
{"text":"Cute brunch place in old Montreal. The restaurant was packed when we walked in but we were seated in about 20 minutes. I got the vegan sandwich which was really incredible, full of vegetables and great flavor. My husbands sandwich (mr Miami) was pretty good as well. Portion sizes are very good. The only thing we did not enjoy was the fresh juice which was tiny and kind of a rip off at 5$."}
{"text":"Si seulement le service et le sourire des commis derrière  le comptoir etait équivalent à la qualité de la nourriture on y retournerait ."}
{"text":"best French toast I have ever had! I love the atmosphere too"}
{"text":"Written up in the local press and for reason. We had an excellent brunch at this restaurant. We waited 30 minutes for a table, and used that time to plan the rest of our trip. The staff was attentive and the food was tasty. Plates we average sized and two are recommended for lunch. We ordered:   Eggs with tomato sauce +++++A perfectly poached egg was situated in the middle of a clay bowl filled with rich tomato sauce and feta. The side of Portuguese break was dipped in olive oil.  Yoghurt with granola +++++Way above average, the yoghurt cake placed on the right side of the bowl, that matched the fruit on the left. Granola was added tastefully on the top. The fruit was beyond you average mix, and included pomegranates, tangerines, and pineapple.  Salad with chicken +++A mix of green lettuce and frisée mixed with toasted almost and a few slices of grilled chicken. The dressing was an olive oil base with apple cider vinegar and roasted garlic.  Coffee +++Above average  Green Tea ++++Above average."}
{"text":"my pain au chocolate was very tasty and the coffee too. a bit expensive, but we are in vieux montréaò"}
{"text":"We ate a breakfast and lunch here. The food is very good. I had the mushroom soup and a panini and it was tasty. It was a little too much food. The cafe latte and croissants were great. I would definitely stop here again. It is very busy on the weekends, but the wait was worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent!  We had cappuccino,  croissants,  and sweet ricotta.  Delicious!  Be back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Busy place, a bit slow service but it's all part of it. Salted Ricotta was amazing!! Counter window seats = great people watching."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a beautiful day, so of course, the wait was unbelievably long so we decided to get it to go.  The menu is only in french, but the people are helpful and translate the menu for you.  I had the Viva las Vegan, it was very tasty, but huge! I could have done with just half of a sandwich.  It is a bit on the pricey side for a sandwich, but they use quality ingredients.  The water is a quick walk away, so if you order to go, take a stroll down there and sit on the picnic benches to enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"What a great place for fresh baked good, good coffee and excellent brunch.   The menu is delicous - we tried almost all of it and i was pleasantly impressed. It's got all the ingredients of a traditional brunch - but it's turned into something modern, pseudo healthy and something to think about all day really.   Come early, or cross you fingers, or sweet talk every person who works there."}
{"text":"This place is simply WOAW ! We visited it on a Tuesday afternoon, right after a snow storm, my better half and i found parking very easily .. The place is always busy but u can find comfort and tranquility, its a very warm environment! The menu is tasty the cookies are amazing and the water bottle in an okd olive oil bottle (loved the creativity)! The mocha was to the point and served in a glass rather then a cup! the staff is kind and responds quickly! Will go visit very soon !"}
{"text":"always always love this place... their salads and sandwiches are tdf! Its a little pricey but worth every penny. You can tell that the best ingredients go into the food here, you taste it! Yum...my favorite lunch place in Old Montreal"}
{"text":"5 star food with 2 star service - the system for placing/paying for orders makes no sense (you can see other reviews if you don't believe me). I try to avoid it by just getting takeaway, and going to the nearby park if the weather is good.  The coffee is actually really good - it's a nice surprise to find deep in the Old Port (a very touristy area).  The scrolls they have (raspberry cheesecake, maple and almond, etc) are fantastic, and the croissants they have are good too.  Unfortunately, if you eat-in you have to deal with their strange ordering system. After waiting to be seated (which on the weekend is a loooong time - it's a popular place), you get given a piece of paper with your table number. You then need to take this piece of paper to the queue (where all take-out orders are placed too), and give your order. After you've gotten your food, and are ready to pay, you have to get back in the queue (behind all the take-out people) to make your payment. This all means you end up waiting in queue two or three times for the one meal - which just doesn't make sense to me. If I want to pay you, don't make it hard for me!"}
{"text":"No wifi here!  But it's okay. Per the server's joking suggestion, I forgot about the wifi and seized an opportunity to socialize. I made friends with a fellow entrepreneur who was also from the States. It was a great dining experience since we had an awesome view eating from the window bar-top. Those seats are perfect for people watching and passing time. The narrow alley ways of Old Port are interesting to be inside and to observe. Olive & Gourmando is a place to enjoy and savor. I easily had spent 2-hours there.   I had a simple lunch: Latte, Cuban sandwich and then took some pastries to-go. They have a wide variety of baked goods on display that is hard to miss. So, don't skip!"}
{"text":"It was delicious.  Ordered the seafood special and very much enjoyed it.  Was very rich for my taste, but still yummy.  Bathroom does not have a changing area, so beware.  But the food is worth it.  The grilled cheese was good.  Atmosphere is fun and eclectic."}
{"text":"Great for a lunch but to eat, the paninis were delicious and different than others I have had in the past. The service was average to below average, but the coffee shop/rustic environment was great!"}
{"text":"super long line, buy worth the wait, i love the oepn face sandwich, if u are in old port area this is a must try"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place five stars, but I should warn you that even as a tourist, you will be disappointed by how chock full of tourists this place is.  The almond croissant was not impressive, but the brioche was, and my husband was immediately obsessed with his cheesy southern biscuit. The coffee was spectacular, and we had a lovely seat by a large open window filled with plants.  The ordering process is a bit confusing there, but we didn't have too much of a wait."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, brunch or afternoon coffee with pastries. Organic and quality food, cosy ambiance, friendly service. Try their Oeuf Coquette  (Poached egg, tomato, feta, crumbled house chorizo, avocado + grilled flat bread)"}
{"text":"Decent place to grab breakfast and brunch although it can get crowded. Plus they've got some really strong coffee if your into that. Would definitely recommend the ricotta with orange marmalade if your getting something off the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Coming back from an afternoon at the Montreal Botanical Garden last Friday, we decided to find a place for a late lunch in Old Montreal. We saw that Olive & Gourmando had high marks, so we headed over on the metro. The place is small, but crowded. There was about a 15-20 minute wait. We were seated along the window which was fine because we could people watch.  My friend ordered Mr. Miami which she said was good. I ordered The Majestique. It was a huge entree, but it was so good. The apple coleslaw and pickled corn+jalapeños were delicious accompaniments. The slaw was more sweet & tangy rather than jalapeño spicy. It was one of my favorite meals in Montreal.  Service was good and they accept credit cards. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Sure, this place is good but I don't get the hype. We had to wait two and a half hours to get in. Food was okay but nothing special that would explain the line. Drinks were small. I had a salad which was hearty and yummy, but the breakfast sandwiches that we ordered for the table were nothing to special. Not sure if I would have written the same review had I not waited in line for 2h30."}
{"text":"VIBE  O+G hits all of the marks - great local Montreal vibe with both English and French Montreal chowing down. Go to your table, then go to the counter, get what they have (they don't really make substitutions either) et voila! It is very busy here. PS they have a lovely chandelier in the middle.   I ATE I had the truffled mac and cheese with mushrooms and a hardened crust on top. Bestill my heart. They evened out the fattiness of that dish with a side salad. Wish I could have gotten a soup. Dining partners had soups and sandwiches and vegetarian chili.   Croissants transport you back to France. The desserts? Like their chocolate tart with a crispy, crunch bottom? Oh mon dieu!   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Definitely one of those lunch/brunch places you travel to and return to again and again. Le sigh. Pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"This place gets busy, so plan to wait or just get your food to go.  The coffee and food were both great, although my first choice of a meal was already sold out when we showed up. I took this as a good sign because it must mean they have fresh ingredients and aren't wasteful.   The dining area can get very crowded so expect to sit near some strangers, but who knows, you just might make a new friend over a cup of coffee or breakfast."}
{"text":"THIS. IS THE BEST. SANDWICH. I'VE EVER. HAD.   It was, I think, the vegan 2.0 or something like that but DEAR LORD it was good.   It'll take you a while to get seated, but my friend, IT IS WORTH IT."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches, cozy place and other goodies in the heart of downtown Old Montreal. Probably my favorite place to get lunch down there.  My one gripe is that when it's busy, the line snakes out the door and it gets very cramped."}
{"text":"Recommended by the concierge at W hotel. Love her. Will go back again soon for brioche and coffee."}
{"text":"I don't often give five stars, but can't recommend this place enough!  Their egg-cheese-bacon sandwich was out of this world, and the croissants were to die for.  I lived in Paris for 5 years, and can tell you these croissants were as good as they come.  Nice little cafe, wish they had been open Sunday too!"}
{"text":"Petite boulangerie située dans le vieux montréal. L'endoit est vraiment charmant quoi que les places soient limitées. Il se rempli très rapidement en particulier la fin de semaine ou à l'heure du lunch. Les viennoiseries sont succulentes (chocolatine, croissant, muffin ou encore leur palmier très feuilleté) et tous les produits sont frais. J'ai beaucoup aimé leur sandwich à la rillette de canard. Je prends souvent leurs produits pour emporter et je les déguste dans le vieux montréal. Personnellement, je trouve leur café très corsé, mais c'est une question de goût. Service toujours aimable, A noter les prix sont quand même assez élevés, mais la qualité est là :)"}
{"text":"Hey...you looking for a good bakery? You want a good pastry or two? You want a cinnamon bun, or a garlicy corn bread muffin, or a yummy cookie? This is the place for you!  Oh hell yeah! I would come here again in a heart beat.  here is the thing, though. They don't have bread here. So don't come looking for a baguette!"}
{"text":"Brilliant place. We visited twice during our long weekend in Montreal and enjoyed this bakery/cafe.   Try the delicious house-made fontina cheese plate and the basic green salad (which is anything but basic)"}
{"text":"There are three things that are going on at the same time here.   1. Take out counter at the back where you can order food. 2. Pastry/Coffee counter that's a must before you leave. 3. Actual sit down restaurant that has a long line, but is totally worth the wait.   My friend and I did 3 first and then 2.  Worth all the money and wait. I had the best soup and sandwich.  Plus the cookies and coffee I took home was delicious.   It gets really busy, so don't go in a group."}
{"text":"BEST. CHOCOLATE. BRIOCHE. EVER! The butter, the rich Valrhona chocolate, the crust. Its all divine and takes me to chocolate heaven.  This was booked marked as a must try for our trip to Montreal. I only wish that we could have had a 2nd breakfast here. Very disappointed that it was closed on Sunday. It was super crowded on the Saturday morning we popped in and definitely not suitable for a stroller. I wish we could have eaten in and tried some other things from the food menu but being with a baby means being flexible with our wishes and wants. The coffee was good. I also grabbed a Almond croissant but that was only okay."}
{"text":"Love this place !!! Great food, Atmosphere and coffee!!! Just get here early there will be a line.( because it's GOOD) whattttttt!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Everything is superb. The food quality, the preparation, the service. Everything is top notch. I love the \"egg on your face\" sandwich the most. Truly an elevated egg sandwich."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance in this cafe in Old Montreal. Sandwiches & paninis are well made & flavorful!  Prepare to wait in line, it is always packed."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy. The coffee is delicious here. The pastries are okay, but not outstanding. Definitely come for the coffee though."}
{"text":"This trendy cafe in Vieux-Montréal has tasty food and a fun (albeit crowded) atmosphere.  I came at 9 am on a Sunday morning, and they already had a line out the door. I didn't stay for a sit-down meal (I just got my food to go), but the restaurant had nice decor and looked like a cozy place to start the morning (provided you could get a table).  I ordered the chocolatine and the highly-praised \"egg in your face\" panini. The chocolatine wasn't that good - not sure if I'd recommend O+G for pastries - but the panini was amazing. It was loaded with eggs and meat, and it had just the right spice level (usually French food has zero spice). It was a delicious and hearty way to start the day.  So if you're hankering for a tasty breakfast, give O+G a try - just make sure you arrive early!"}
{"text":"Chouette établissement ! Ils proposent de la nourriture healthy à des prix raisonnables (n'oubliez pas que les taxes ne sont en général pas incluses dans les prix affichés au Canada). Seuls points négatifs: l'établissement est victime de son succès. Sur le temps de midi, nous avons dû attendre 5-10 minutes pour avoir une table (alors qu'on nous avait dit 30 ! On a peut être eu de la chance ? :)) et le service sera un peu expéditif une fois que vous aurez fini de mangé."}
{"text":"Great environment, staff and most importantly, great food!  It's worth waiting for a table! :)"}
{"text":"Came here last year on a friend's recommendation, and I knew that I had to come again this year on my Montreal vacation. Food was slightly less mind-blowing than I remembered (isn't it always?), but still amazing. I've tried the brioche (banana chocolate and just chocolate), almond croissant, elephant ear, Cuban sandwich, and latte and have loved them all.  The space is super cute and always packed. Expect a wait at pretty much any time, especially during peak hours. One star off because service can be a bit slow - I waited almost half an hour for take out once - but it's worth it for the exceptional food. If the wait to dine in is too long, I'd still recommend getting a to go order and eating by the old port."}
{"text":"In my opinion they have the best chocolatine in the city! Soooo good! Pricey but I just have to eat them!"}
{"text":"Cutest place we discovered on our last day in Montreal. Brunch line out the door. They also offer pastries to go so got in that line which moved fairly quickly. Chocolate banana brioche bun is all you need to know when going here. Eye opening happiness good. One of the most memorable things I ate on our trip."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Food and baked goods on point.  Made our way here on Canada day. Got there around 11, was told it would be a 45 minute wait. Perused and walked to the basilica (and even went in) and made it back and waited about another 10-15 additional minutes  past the original 45 min. No biggy, though. Place is small and loud and bustling.  Food: Poached egg on your face panini. Perfectly cooked eggs, with a little bit of a kick to it. The boyfriend got the pizza pocket and that was deliciously warm and kind of sweet. Both sandwiches were reasonably priced.  What takes the cake here are the desserts. Although I was bummed because they didn't have the banana chocolate brioche, we tried the raspberry white chocolate brioche. That pastry was all around soft, sweet and tart and just very, very delicious. Also took a chocolate cooke and lemon poppy seed cookie home and those were moist, tangy, and rich. I love their pastries.  Service: Awesome. Friendly. They take american credit cards too.  I would definitely come again the next time I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They also have a great idea.  You go up to the counter and order your food, sit down, eat, then pay right before you leave.  I think that this definitely speeds things up a lot.    I got the trout sandwich with kapers, herb cream cheese, spinach, and onions and it was delicious.  I could tell that the bread was fresh and homemade.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. It's a small space and absolutely packed at lunch, so be prepared for a wait. My party of four had to wait about 20 minutes for a table at noon on a Friday. By the time we paid and left though it had calmed down considerably.  I really like how they separate the ordering process. You first go to the back to check the menu, see the salads and ask about the day's specials. After you've ordered, you take your seat and servers will bring out your food. Once you're done, they'll ask about coffee and desserts. All in all it's fast, efficient and doesn't force you to decide everything at once.  All of the servers are friendly and nice, the hostess especially. It's moderately priced for lunch, around $11 for sandwiches and $3-4 for desserts, but the portions are huge and everything is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"One of the best paninis that I have eaten. It was spicy and perfect!!A must if you are in Montreal!!"}
{"text":"We were a party of three and shared a fall beet salad, the salted ricotta salad and a goat cheese hot panini.  The food didn't last very long as it was delicious. The menu very much reflects the seasons and its options are extremely fresh tasting and masterfully put together.  You have to try this place!"}
{"text":"what a perfect little place.  I wish we had more places like this here in Miami.  All you need to know is that everything is exceedingly fresh and the sandwiches are the best I had in Montreal.  The atmosphere is very cute with great energy.  Highly recommended for an excellent lunch.  We were there for 6 days and came here twice."}
{"text":"I just had the best panini I've ever eaten. Egg in your face was fantastic. Such a perfect crunch. Had the elixir iced tea to drink and that was nice, would have liked a larger glass."}
{"text":"We go out of our way to go here every time we visit Montreal (in fact we've booked hotels just so that they're within walking distance).  It can get pretty crowded especially on weekends for brunch and it looks like it is very popular with locals.  The decor and service are both wonderful, really cosy right in the heart of old montreal.  I've been getting the egg-on-your-face sandwich (basically a panini with ham and cheese and a poached egg plus some sriracha on it) since I first went there five years ago.  It has been consistently excellent as are all their pastries.  Great selection of teas and coffees too."}
{"text":"I think I died and went to cafe heaven!  This place is marvelous! It has sass, charm, culinary aptitude, & most of all the best carbs in baked form one can find!  Came during 3 separate occasions, bumped into Kristin Chenoweth & Kathy Griffin, gorged myself silly, and just sat in utter content at what a charming place this establishment was!  Had the following: egg in your face panini, peach shortcake, chocolate banana brioche, cheese croissant, almond croissant, pecan chocolate cookie, & zucchini cupcake.  I want more..."}
{"text":"Got here at 11:30 am right before the crazy lunch line. Still, for 2 people we had to wait for 45 minutes! It was a bit hectic as you walk in because there is a guy that takes names but he is busy running around most of the time. So people who walk in at the wrong time have no clue who to go to or what the drill is. Basically the other patrons waiting had to tell them where to stand/who to look for.   I know this is weird to start off w/ but they had some ridiculously good R&B music playing in the background. Just.... something unique. lol I made sure to tell one of the managers that.   My friend and I both got coffees and croissants before our actual meal. Hey, it was vacation! Anyhow it was one, if not the best, butter croissant I've ever had. For the lunch item, we got the spicy panini w/ cheese, eggs, tomatoes, and pork. Since my friend doesn't eat pork, we got it without it and our server promised us it would still be divine. AND IT WAS. Man, Montreal really gets their bread right. I wish for the price that the panini came w/ a small side item but ah well. I think a small side salad would've been the perfect accompaniment.   The french toast was different from anything we've ever had. Their syrup was infused w/ orange and their french toast was super thick. The topping wasn't the overly sweet whip cream we were used to but very sour cream-like that gave it some oomph. It came w/ some really interesting nuts and gave a great contrast to all the creaminess.   This was probably one of the best meals of my Montreal trip. Yes, the reviews did not steer me wrong."}
{"text":"Local spot for sure - and It gets crowded very fast!  Arrived at 930 on a Friday morning and were seated without a wait but there was soon a line.   We shared an almond croissant and the panini (in your face) - croissant was more floury than flakey but still good. The panini though - legendary. A gathering of sriracha, poached eggs, speck, spring onions and cheese - crusty on the outside, hot, savory and spicy on the inside... what a breakfast!   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Some mighty fine pastries and croissants with the combination of good italian coffee while located at the heart of old Montreal, makes this place a true gem!"}
{"text":"This tiny place is ALWAYS full, which  isn't a surprise : they make awesome sandwiches. They also make daily salads and soups which are aways yummy. If you deserve a treat, go for their somptuous brownie! Olive & Gourmando definitely isn't too good if you're on a diet, but still, it's always a good treat."}
{"text":"You must go here for lunch if you are in Montreal - amazing.  Avocado and bread find a new life in a marriage of taste here that is INCREDIBLE."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on a recommendation of our Airbnb hosts. The line was out the door by the time we arrived for brunch at 12:15p. We were quoted an hour wait by the host but only ended up waiting for 20 minutes. There is no paging system while you wait for a table, so stick around the restaurant if you don't want to get skipped! I was excited by the strong pastry program and the hyperlocal cuisine. We got a simple drip coffee and dirty chai latte to start, which ended up being less sweet than we were used to, but still very good. For our mains we got the Oeuf Coquette, a take on a shakshouka with chorizo and avocado and the Pouched-Egg-on-Your-Face Panini sans pork. The vegetarian version of the panini was very tasty and had a nice spicy kick. We also had a chocolate brioche and took a palmier cookie to go. Very busy but definitely worthwhile!  Highlights: Oeuf Coquette & the chocolate brioche."}
{"text":"This is one great original coffee and restaurant. I'm sorry to leave old city Montreal. Croissant are so fresh and delicious. I had to go back my second and last day in Montreal to get a croissant fromage for the flight home. Coffee excellent! Service is a tad slow as  only one barista for such a huge crowd pleasing small place."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. Came here on the last day of my conference to grab lunch and found an incredibly long line with tons of people inside the little space. But I had time on my hands, so I went to the back of the line and waited for my turn. Lots of delicious looking treats on display. I got some sort of a chicken sandwich and a brioche. The sandwich was flavorful but rather greasy and a bit messy to eat. The brioche unfortunately I wasn't able to get to until the next day and got a bit dry, but overall good flavors."}
{"text":"Please come to New York!  Love this place - food is fantastic and staff is friendly.  I've been lucky with not ever having a terribly long wait - but I was flexible and sat at the bar if it was busy.  This is the type of place where you can order food that you think you don't like and will love it!  I've yet to have something I didn't like.  Creative menu creations makes choosing what to get a challenge - but always delivers a tasty and healthful lunch.  Yummmmmmmm.  Did i mention that I love this place?!?"}
{"text":"Arrived around noon on a Saturday and there were at least 15 people waited to be seated. We gave our name for the wait list and was told 5-10 minutes. The wait was only a few minutes for a shared table which was fine with us.   The place is super cozy and love the fresh baked goods on display. We both got paninis which were buttery, and quite filling. I thought both were too salty though. The first few bites were great, but it quickly got too heavy.   Next time, will opt of the salad and split the hot dog."}
{"text":"a good variety of really delicious pastries!  a must try for sure! We went there twice for breakfast.  come early if you don't want to wait for too long.  I wish they have more menu items for breakfast (we have not got a chance to try the lunch yet).  I think the breakfast is good but you don't have to try them if you are pressed for time.  I personally think the pastries are way better than the breakfast."}
{"text":"I was recommended to this place by the concierge at the Hyatt Regency.   She said that it was not a very far walk from the hotel.   For a Los Angeles native that drives everywhere, she was wrong.  It was a very long walk.  The July weather was hot and humid in the morning.   I built up a very nice sweat going there.   I ordered a couple of croissants, a fruity bread, and a Latte.  I then started my hike back to the hotel.  I gave up.  I caught a taxi.  $8 later, I was back at the hotel.   All the breads were good.  The latte came in a small cup.   I needed more of a caffeine fix, so I had to buy another cup of coffee from somewhere else.  A nice little gem in Montreal."}
{"text":"Visiting from NYC so we decided to go to all the hyped places in Montreal. Olive & Gourmando was on the list so we decided to go and waited an hour on a Sunday afternoon. Seeing how packed the place was, I expected the food to be absolutely amazing.  I ordered the poached egg panini and my Bf ordered the majestic. I was disappointed in my panini. I didn't expect it to be so greasy. I couldn't eat it after a couple bites. The majestic was just okay as well.   We didn't get to try anything else but I was definitely upset that we waited for so long, paid $50 and only got two mediocre sandwiches.   Oh and ketchup was an additional $1.75."}
{"text":"Looking for a good cup of coffee and pastry, my doorman recommended this place - and he was right, it is fantastic!   The place is small and every table was full with a wait. I just grabbed a late and croissant to go. The late was made perfectly. Oh, and the croissant...oh la la! It did remind me of Paris."}
{"text":"This is my favourite coffeeshop in old-port Montreal! If you look for a fresh and nice pastry to have it with your warm coffee also seating beside the window to have the view of old-port streets you should go there and give it a shot,you won't be regret! It's a lovely place! The environment is very inspiring,warm and friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is a must for me when I visit Old Montreal. The food and atmosphere are breathtaking. The service is fast and it's always packed. The French toast is so different and to die for. Make sure to grab pastries on your way out!"}
{"text":"The only thing that disappointed me about this restaurant was the fact that I didn't find it till the last day I was in Montreal.  I probably would have eaten there multiple times had I known.  Love the atmosphere, it's loud with talking/laughing and the ages of the crowd are mixed. Seemed to have been packed with locals (always a good sign)... Had a glass of rosé and a hot panini: The Goat Cheese - Carmelized onions, goat cheese and homemade ketchup... Finished off with a latte and an apple turnover with cinnamon sugar.    Yum, will go back daily when in Montreal next."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5  Located on Rue Saint-Paul Ouest and Rue Saint-Pierre at Old Montreal. Parking spots were hard to find, so we had to park a few streets away from this place.   [SERVICE] - 5/5 Our server was friendly. The wait time was 45 minutes, but we left our phone number so we could walk around, and the hostess gave us a call 5 minutes before our table was ready.   [DÉCOR] - 4/5  Very small, intimate, and homey vibes. There were a lot of people when we went at around 2PM on a Saturday. They had a takeout area for pastries and hot drinks if you just want to order something to go, or while you wait for a seat.   [QUALITY] - 5/5 Fresh ingredients and homemade recipes. I totally understand why this place was so crowded! The food was really, really good.    [ORDER] - 4/5 - The Gustavo Panini - $14.95: BEST. PANINI. EVER. The yogurt & roasted garlic marinated chicken was so juicy & complemented the roasted mushrooms and grilled red onion. The whole panini was glued together with with maple and Dijon mayonnaise and melted Havarti cheese.   - The Cubain Panini- $13.95: Basically a next-level ham and cheese sandwich. Pancetta (Italian bacon) and roasted pork were very flavourful but a little too salty in my opinion. The lime and cilanto cut through the richness of the pork and melted gruyère cheese. The panini was brought together with a tangy pickle mayonnaise.   [OVERALL] - 5/5 Before I came here, I thought a panini was just a panini. But boy, I was SUPER glad I tried the ones here. Although both paninis were delicious, The Gustavo was much juicier and the medley of flavours were better than The Cubain. Overall, this place was worth the wait, and I would definitely recommend The Gustavo Panini."}
{"text":"Ricotta salty was very tasty! My boyfriend had the beef brisket sandwich and wasn't blown away by the flavors. Huge sandwiches though! The restaurant is a little small for how much business they get. Nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We ordered the fruit and yogurt (delicious!!) it had a wonderful combination of fruits (berries, mango, crunchy coconut, black currents and so on). We also had the toast with peanut butter and the ricotta with toast. The ricotta was also fantastic. Great mix of flavours! The peanut butter tasted like it was made in house (definitely did not taste like what you get in stores) -not too sweet which was nice. Overall food was fantastic but I was not a fan of the toast. It was too rough/hard.  Stroller tip - it is very tight but the staff was friendly and accommodated us with our stroller. There is also an option to park your stroller at the entrance as well. Bear in mind there is a step or two to get into and out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was bustling when we arrived around noon, I was worried there would be a long wait, but it was only about 10 minutes (2 people).  Unfortunately they were out of the first thing I tried to order \"Egg in your face\".  The menu looked very good and our food was delicious - we had the Cuban sandwich and the trout sandwich."}
{"text":"Très bonne adresse ! On y est allé, c'était remplie, pas mal de groupes attendaient devant nous et pourtant on a attendu que 10 minutes.  Le service était rapide, efficace et malgré le monde notre serveuse a pris le temps de savoir si tout allait bien. On a pris une salade et un sandwich, tout était bon, frais et original.  J'y retournerai !"}
{"text":"Reminds me of my fav place in Connecticut, Caseus. It has casual and relaxing yet hip atmosphere. It gets very crowded though so beware. I had an amazingly good truffle mac and cheese which came with a green salad with toasted sliced almonds. I got a chocolate chip cookies with pecans to go and it was very good."}
{"text":"Perhaps my favorite part of the visit to Montreal, the Gustavo sandwich was just out of this world, paired with a soup and house salad I left a happy camper... Also great coffee!"}
{"text":"Ordered Almond Croissant , Chocolate Croissant , Egg Panini . Everything was delicious and totally worth it. My personal favourite was Almond Croissant."}
{"text":"Finding a solid place to eat in Old Montreal can be a challenge sometimes since this part of the city is loaded with tourist traps.  That being said if you know where to look you can find a good restaurant or café.  I had heard loads of good things about Olive and Gourmando for a long time but since I rarely find myself in Old Montreal for lunch I only made it there for the first time recently.  So is it really as good as everyone says?  Yes indeed!  It is a café but you are seated by a host and served by a waiter.  The place is packed at lunch so either get there early or try and go after the lunch rush has died down.  If you are one or two people consider eating at the counter.  They have typical café food which is why it is best as a lunch place.  You can expect a variety of sandwiches, salads, soups and so on.  They do have wine and beer if you so desire but I skipped that since it was lunch and I was on my way to a meeting.  I kept it simple and got a latte and grilled cheese.  The latte was as good as any coffee shops here in Montreal and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The star though was the grilled cheese which was made with goat cheese, raclette and caramelized onions.  It was wildly delicious and there was so much cheese that it was oozing at the sides and that is a good thing in my opinion!  Now I like ketchup with my grilled cheese but for a sandwich of this calibre Heinz just won't cut it.  Of course they know that only the finest condiments are acceptable for their food so they serve up the grilled cheese with a homemade spicy ketchup.  While it wasn't very spicy it certainly put Heinz to shame.  Now you can't come here and not get a goodie.  When you're ready for dessert head over to the display of pastries.  This will probably be the hardest part of your whole experience because here you will be faced with the arduous task of narrowing your choices down to just one.  Ultimately I settled for a banana-chocolate brioche which was so fresh and loaded with chocolate and big chunks of banana.  The pastry was very flaky and as a whole the experience was divine!  The service was another highlight.  My waiter was very friendly and despite the fact that the café was completely packed I got everything I ordered in a reasonable time frame.  As soon as I was seated they gave me a glass and my own pitcher of water.  I was really thirsty when I arrived here so I really appreciated this.  It is expensive and for me that was a downside.  The latte, grilled cheese and brioche came to $23 and of course because it was a sit down place I also had to tip the waiter so in all I paid about $26.  While I don't mind treating myself once in a while I wouldn't routinely pay that for lunch.  That being said I would put Olive and Gourmando on my list of places to check out when I'm in the area because it is too good to pass up."}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm in Montreal - I discovered it five years ago while spending the summer there, and it's still every bit as good, if not better.  Obviously this place has a following and is well recommended, as the wait is often 1+ hours or more just for a table for 2, and I was once quoted 3-4 hours for a table for 3 (the actual wait time ended up being about 1.5 hours).  It's honestly worth it, though.    Brunch is good, the sandwiches are to die for, and the coffee + pastries are excellent as well!  I will say that many of their dishes are out of the ordinary, packing in lots of flavors, and that is what makes this place stand out.  If you're looking for something more normal/plain, this probably isn't what you're looking for.    If you're in Montreal, do yourself (and me, sadly 2000 miles away) a favor and try this place!"}
{"text":"This place is way over rated in my opinion. Yes the music was nostalgic and felt good while younare waiting over 30 min for a table. The menu is limited and at best mediocre. Staff is friendly and attentive.  So here is the deal. The coffee and baked goods are good. The sit down menu is just ok."}
{"text":"My, my, my! This place is simply amazing! From the decor to food, I cannot find words to do justice to Olive & Gourmando. First off, please keep in mind that there may be a wait to get a table (around 45 minutes to an hour depending on when you go). But don't worry, you can order some delicious pastries to munch on while you wait. Once seated, my friends ordered some coffee and I got the Dirty Chai, which was basically an espresso shot in cold milk tea. To eat, we got the O & G Grilled Cheese and the Tartine, both of which were so delicious. The caramelized onions on the grilled cheese provided great flavor and the tartine was really fresh- definitely recommend both. We had a wonderful time dining at O + G and hope to go back when in Montreal!!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious mocha and egg panini for breakfast. Nice atmosphere. The little chocolate chunks in the mocha foam made it special. Partition was great server."}
{"text":"\"Foodie destination for artisanal breads & sweets, with panini & salads, in a charming rustic space\". Open 7 days a week. Brunch served on weekends. Best to get there early as place fills up and line ups are huge going out the door. Can provide your name when there but have to have your entire party present to be seated. If going there alone- will be placed amongst other patrons. Do it have to sit in- can also order and take out. I had the O&G ouef / croquet and my friend had open faced ricotta apple cucumber sandwich. Great destination but requires you to enjoy and then move on when finished. Sat elbow to elbow but did not mind people were extremely nice. Staff pleasant and accommodating. Did accommodate people with babies - one stroller did fit but not truly space for that. No patio option as on Rue St Paul in the heart of Old Montreal a few blocks from Notre Dame :). Would go there again as they had rustic decor and a place does like this is not present where I currently live :)"}
{"text":"Just what we were looking for!  Think of this as a MUCH better Panera bread. Everything is actually made there and 100x more delicious.  Their soup of the day today was corn chowder and it was warm, enjoyable, and really hit the spot. The grilled cheese panini serve with home made ketchup was scrumptious-- in fact my husband and I kept fighting for the last bites!  As a native to Miami and Cuban, I'll have to say that the Cuban panini didn't really get the taste right but it was still a good sandwich.  A bit Over prices, at $12+ for just the paninis with no sides, but overall an enjoyable meal with great service in a cute spot."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth stopping by if you're in town. Breakfast, brunch, lunch...whatever the occasion, you'll find something that will delight your taste buds. These guys don't mess around. They put their heart and soul into what they do and it shows.  I suggest you either try one of their breakfast options or one of their hot sandwiches. This place, along with Le Cartet are my go-to places for breakfast in Montreal."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday for lunch around 12pm. The host told us it would be a 25-30 minute wait, but when we came back around 12:30pm, he told us another 25 minutes, so that was pretty annoying that the estimated timing was wayyy off, but we got coffee at a nearby café so that was fine. They also serve coffee and pastries in the takeout line, so that's nice to have while you wait.  The place itself is very cozy and cute. We sat on a communal table and I ordered a Goat Cheese and Onion Panini and a raspberry lemonade. The Panini came with a homemade ketchup which was thinned out ketchup that was sweet but still tangy - it complemented the sandwich perfectly. I couldn't finish the whole Panini by myself.   My friends ordered the Cuban sandwich and the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, which they all enjoyed. Great to share the Paninis with friends for some variation in your overall meal. I was sad to hear that they ran out of the egg in your face Panini -- I really wanted to try that!  The service was pretty quick as all the sandwiches were premade, which I thought it was odd, considering sandwiches are pretty quick to make, but I was happy with our overall meal."}
{"text":"Came to the restaurant because of the hype - posted about on several travel websites.   There was a big crowd outside. A 90 minute queue killed any ambition of dining in. We got our sandwiches and moseyed out. The pastries on display were tempting but the bunch of flies feasting on them were not.   The sandwiches were merely ok - nothing special.   Not a place I would recommend to a friend  Overall it was a f"}
{"text":"With so much pastry, fine dining, and Canadian comfort food to be sampled on our brief visit to Montreal 'breakfasts' as a proper sit-down entity were still not to be overlooked (much to my family's dismay and with a schedule heavy on museums, churches, and hockey along with the food mornings would be early - and thankfully so would be the opening times of each of the three breakfast spots we decided to try.  Beginning first with perhaps the most oft raved breakfast in the city we almost ended up taking a pass on Olive + Gourmando because the traffic and parking on the tight streets of the busy business district is nothing short of a nightmare during the morning rush - but thankfully, as fate would have it a spot opened up on our third trip around the block and with streets uneven and crowd bustling we made our way into the small store and restaurant only a few minutes later than anticipated.  Owned and operated by Dyan Solomon and Eric Girard Olive + Gourmando reminds one much of Panera as you walk in - a few dry goods and baked items up front along with the local paper plus a busy kitchen in back, but with communal tables consistently packed as people vie for space and the air rife with notes of coffee, butter, and vanilla there is clearly more than \"quick casual\" at play - specifically the use of all natural, organic, and high quality local ingredients in each of the restaurant's creations; items I was left to select for the group as my mother and aunt attempted (successfully) to procure seating.  Utilizing both the pastry counter, kitchen, and servers to facilitate service the modus operandi at O+G is to order at the pastry counter, find a seat, and wait for the items to arrive - a successful approach even despite my over-ordering that led to an impressive pile of food arriving perhaps 10 minutes later - each item warmed or hot and from the coffee to the sandwich to each of our four baked goods everything looked fantastic despite the simple style of preparation on brown paper in wooden baskets.  Beginning first with the coffee - mostly espresso but also offering an Americano I eschewed my traditional ordering and went with a double based on the recommendation of the barista that the beans taste best without the added water and with the roast very low in acidity I had to agree, particularly given the smoky top notes and mellow caramel tones underneath - no sugar was added and none was needed.  Moving next to the pastries, a quartet was selected and attempting to make selections that would appease all I ran the gamut of flavors from fruit to chocolate and light to heavy beginning first with two spirals of brioche; one Raspberry Cheesecake, the other Valrhona Chocolate, and both exemplary.  Beginning first with the eggy bread - crisp on the shell with a wispy and rich pull-apart within and lightly kissed with an egg wash before its trip to the oven both curls were rife with their respective ingredients and as much as I love Valrhona dark it was the cheesecake that impressed most - a rich balance of the cream cheese's smoothness with sweet pureed raspberries complete with seeds.  Moving on to the measuring stick, an oblong almond croissant, I found myself somewhat less impressed than I had expected largely due to the texture produced by such a tightly wound crumb.  Certainly tinged with almond and packed with butter this simply was not the texture I would expect for a croissant - more like a breadstick in its lack of an air-pocketed leavened crumb.  Good, but not on par with the rest of the choices, including the Chausson Aux Pommes sharing its basket.  Translated literally as 'slipper of apples' it would be hard for me to find something more comforting than this hand-pie and no matter what language the crispy golden shell and dense core of pan cooked cinnamon apples was lovely - the only thing that would have made it better was ice, or perhaps whipped, cream.  For our final choice, the only kitchen item that screamed 'must order' we received the \"Poached Egg on Your Face Sandwich\" - a pressed panini made with house ciabatta filled with sauteed onions, a thick curl of aged Comte, confit tomatoes, griddled speck, and 'cooked egg salad.'  Hitting on pretty much all of the savory notes with the caramelized onions and bright tomatoes acting to cut the fat just a bit the most intriguing aspect of this dish to me was the 'salad' - a texture somewhere between rough chopped hardboiled eggs and a lightly poached egg but very interesting on the tongue.  A great meal from first sip to last bite with only a slightly disappointing almond croissant to mar the experience I definitely understand the hype around Olive + Gourmando and compared to our other Montreal Breakfasts it is the only one to which I'd return."}
{"text":"Wow, if I could give 6 stars, i would. We came, we saw, and we conquered everything on the menu. We were only in Montreal for one night, but had two of our meals here because it was so delicious. That's all we thought about the whole trip.   The first day, we had the Great Big Salad, which had quinoa, alfalfa sprouts, a mix of nuts, microleaves, and galore. It was an unexpected harmonious blend of vegetables, interesting textures, and flavors in your mouth. We had the cuban panini, which was decent but word of advice - stick with the salads here. We also had a latte, which was literally the best latte we've ever had. It was so creamy and flavorful - wait a minute, do Canadians have different milk than us??  The second day, we came for breakfast. We had the ricotta, which was very good and was not heavy at all. The cheese was super light and the orange zest really brightened the dish - fireworks in my mouth. We also got the cha-cha-cha-chia seed bowl, which stole the show hands down. There was so much going on in every bite - from the chia pudding, to the granola, to the pumpkin puree, to the nuts they threw into that bowl. Everything tasted like it was individually and thoughtfully selected to bring an \"O\" to your morning ;)  We also had the much acclaimed almond croissant, which was BOMB.COM. It wasn't overly sweet or heavy - it was the perfect ending to our trip to Montreal.   We would drive 4 hours back to Montreal just to eat here. You should too. You're welcome.  PS This is not a paid review or a sponsorship. It literally was THAT orgasmic."}
{"text":"I think I definitely worked this place up in my head by reading all the reviews and then was a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong the food is good and the quality of the ingredients is great. But is it worth the price, the wait and sitting shoulder to shoulder cramped with other guests...probably not.   I've been here twice. Once for take out and once for a sit down meal. For take out I ordered the banana chocolate brioche and a cappuccino. It was good. The pastry was delicious. However I think the tiny cappuccinos are quite overpriced and nothing special.   For the sit down meal I got there at 10:40 am and it wasn't too busy. I tried to order the 'in your face egg panini' which they were sold out of. How do you sell out of eggs and bread at a breakfast place by 10:40? It wasn't a big deal, but it made a difference since their menu is already very small and limited. I also noticed it's a trend in the other reviews. Anyways I ordered the ricotta with honey and bread and an almond croissant. Both were delicious. The ricotta is creamy and refreshing. The almond croissant is good but overpriced in my opinion.   I do have to say that the service there was lovely. Everything was delivered quickly and with a smile. However overall I think this place is a bit overrated. Would I go here for lunch once in a while if I worked nearby, sure. Would I go out of my way to come here? Probably not. There are so many other cafes in this area with incredible cappuccinos and pastries at almost half the cost and half the crowds."}
{"text":"The Mr Miami sandwich was really really good!   We ordered a Chai latte with soymilk instead of cow milk and they couldn't handle it. They were unable to simply prepare the tea and then mix it with soymilk before bringing it to the table. So they brought us a cup of soymilk, another empty cup and then the tea so we had to mix it ourselves.  No matter what their excuse is, the mixing we had to do at our table totally could and should have been handled by their barista but they were unable to do it.   Reminiscent of that Seinfeld story where Elaine wanted a big salad and the restaurant only served small salads... she asks for them to put 2 small salads in a big bowl and for some reason they were not able to compute such a request."}
{"text":"I have a big problem with O&G. Every time I walk by the restaurant, I am unable to control myself and I absolutely must eat 2 Cuban sandwiches.   It's a big problem because that's over 20$ every time I walk by this restaurant, but I just can't help it. I must have the sandwiches.   The Cuban sandwich melts in your mouth and it's like you're having a party and the whole city is invited.  It's a pain to wait in line and the service is slow but da*n that sandwich is good. It's the best sandwich in the world.   DAMN YOU O&L!"}
{"text":"Best lunch EVER! The grilled goat cheese and cartelized onion sandwich and roasted beet salad with nuts and watercress were to die for! Again, best lunch ever!"}
{"text":"By Day 3 of my recent trip to Montreal, I was beginning to doubt the city's culinary ability.  After reading all the hype on Yelp, I had pretty high expectations...being a food snob, I still went in with a critical mouth.  I wish I could give a 4.5, but only because I want to challenge myself to find something even better than this on my next visit.  At 10 on a Monday morning, this place was full - I can only imagine weekends.  We were instantly sat, though, and our \"waitress\" took extra time explaining the process of ordering pastries/coffee at the front, and sandwiches in the back.  Not wanting to completely overdo it, my friend and I split a sandwich which had THE BEST oven-roasted tomatoes, making the $10 worth it.  I had a latte and almond croissant and would easily have devoured twice as much.  It took all my will power not to order a cheese croissant to go."}
{"text":"This place is great for sandwiches but prepare to wait in line! I highly recommend the paninis because they are AWESOMELY CRISPY! I also really like the ice tea even though it's pricey. While you wait you can always walk around and look at some galleries at Old Port."}
{"text":"I have honestly never been to a less accommodating restaurant.  OK, look, I know that I have some quirky-ish dietary restrictions (mostly vegetarian, slow-carb/low carb), but I'm not particularly fussy and every restaurant I've ever been to (sans this one) has been able to accommodate.   So, there's a salad on the menu that looks like it will fit the bill, but it's served on noodles.  Can I get it with just more greens and no noodles?  No, we can't do that.  Can you take your regular greens salad and add vegetables (that are on the menu for other dishes)?  No.  How about the salad and some of the smoked trout from a smoked trout sandwich (I'll pay for both).  No - we can bring you the sandwich and you can scrape it off yourself.  What??  Really??  Ended up with a simple greens salad that was at least 50% parsley (wow, lovely).  And, for the rest of the party (who ordered stock menu items), nothing was actually very good.  (Nothing was horrible, mind you, just not worth the trip here.)  It was, however, VERY expensive and there was an extra serving of hipster pretension thrown in for good measure.   (Oh, I won't even mention the wait for all this pretension because, after all, one does know what one is getting into when you see the line.)  Finally, it's not even as if there was even a bit of apology from the waiter for the absolute refusal to alter any dish in any way - just an offhanded, \"we're a busy restaurant.\"  Got it.  You're very important, we're just the customers."}
{"text":"I was STARVING when we arrived here. Not the nice, easy-going kind of starving (is anyone ever?), but instead...the HANGRY, get-me-food-right-now kind of starving, so even thought this place was a MUST GO when I was visiting Montreal, the 15-20 minute wait at the door was not pleasing to me. I attempted to convince my partner to go elsewhere, because, when you're hungry, you're delusional. But, he urged me to stay.   And, thank goodness, he did. We peeked into a nearby furniture store for 5 minutes, and then came back. Within 10 minutes of being on the list, we were seated. This place is decorated like a plant lover's (me,me,me) dream. Plants are scattered throughout, wooden aesthetic, and even a lovely tree-trunk lighting. However, it's not like a quaint, spacey, relaxing kind of space, because the cafe was super busy.   It's okay though. Understandable from the refreshing food and yummy drinks. My partner got the dirty chai, and I got the green tea elixir. Montreal cafe's really do have drinks down, with a perfectly sweetened, perfectly elixered out green tea. I would recommend this drink as a perfect pairing with their sandwiches.  My panini was very delicious. I forgot the name, but there was an accompanying mango salsa, with a pesto sauce inside, which was very delicious. I recommend light eaters to share a sandwich and a salad, because we had leftovers from both sandwiches.   The BOMBEST thing I had here was definitely the asian soba noodle salad. Due to the very cheesy things we had previously had, a salad seemed like the perfect fit for us. It was a very delicious salad, perfectly dressed with a tangy-sesame dressing. Soba noodles, lima beans, carrots, lettuce, so much health goodness- for a girl that doesn't normally eat salad. I would recommend this salad as a must-order to accompany the paninis. I liked this salad so much and tried to replicate it when I came back to America...but failed. :'(  I guess the memory of this salad will live on...until I return here."}
{"text":"I am visiting Montreal and was looking for a nice place to have a breakfast. I have to say I found it! I am giving them 5 starts despite a small hiccup with my order, as it got resolved promptly and the staff is very friendly. I came around 9.30 am and it was already busy, but I got seated quickly (when I was leaving 45 min later there was a long line ). I ordered seasonal brioche, fresh fruit ball and tea. Fruit ball was fresh with very good variety and combination of fruits. Brioche was fresh and delicious. I will definitely come back during my next trip."}
{"text":"I love how this place feels! Very cozy and hipster - you'll know what I mean. The staff was very organized despite the place being very busy. We were given a place all the way in the back corner of the shop and I was worried that we would be forgotten - we weren't.   If you ever wanted to try that increasingly popular 1642 Montreal Cola, then look no further. I tried the grilled Cuban panini and it was good - crunchy and cheesy. The habibi chicken, in my opinion, was better. Anything tastes good with garlic, pickles, and dill. Also there are vegetarian and vegan options if you're not a meat eater.  If you're passing nearby the Old Port then you should definitely come by this place."}
{"text":"Croissants!  Croissants!    You really can't go wrong with any croissant in Montreal, but I have a new soft spot for the cheese croissants from Olive et Gourmando.  It's a little, yet spacious-enough-to-allow-a-decent-sized-crowd type of a place, and it's located sort of in between downtown and Old Port - if I recall correctly.  I *think* it was near the Square Victoria metro station.  I love the street it's on, as it's a narrow path with tall buildings lining it, and this shop is right on the corner.  The first thing you can do is get in line.  Then, you can drool over the display of breads and sweets they have behind the short glass in front of you.  Seriously, I was a bit peeved that I had to actually make a decision!  I saw \"croissant de frommage\" and if I learned any French while in Quebec it was the word for cheese.  I asked if I could get a breakfast sandwich made with that croissant and she said no.  Shucks!  Anyway,  I figured the cheese croissant would have a center-fill of cheese.  I also got an almond croissant.    Once you order, they tell you they'll bring everything to your seat.  You will pay afterward.  It didn't take long and the croissants arrived, with a latte (that I also had ordered, but this was just ok...  a bit lukewarm).  I tore into the cheese croissant and noticed nothing inside.  Hm.  Oh well, it's still a croissant and there ain't nuthin' wrong with that.  But wait, it tastes like cheese.  Ok, get this: They seem to have baked the croissant with the cheese having been kneaded *into* the dough.  So, there was cheesy goodness in every bite!  Because of that, the croissant was not overly flaky, but chewy and soft and buttery and complete perfection.  I didn't want it to end.  Oh, and they cover it with sesame seeds.  Yum.  The almond croissant is also incredible and truly almondy!  It just depends on if you want something sweet or savory.  Neither is wrong.  I sat against the \"bar table\" by the window, with stools.  It's probably where most of my seating was during this trip.  Loved looking outside while simultaneously relishing in delicious culinary experiences.  Once you're done, you get back in line to pay - and tell them where you sat.  I'm not sure how the heck they keep track of all this, but they know.  For a couple of croissants and a latte, it wasn't even $10.  I believe the croissants were $2.50 or $2.75.  I ended up getting back in line to buy some more to take back home with me.  My dad ate them all for breakfast, and didn't leave any for my mom.  By the way: They keep well in the paper package, and even when accidentally put in the fridge, they still are fine once you bring back to room temp.  Well, my dad said they were not only fine, but outrageously awesome.    Service is nice, but the cashier got confused by me a time or two.  It's ok, it's not the first time I'm not understood. :-D    I'll be back to try lunch here.  Next trip back..  Can't wait."}
{"text":"Don't miss this spot! Went here for lunch while visiting Montreal after reading the Yelp reviews.  It was so amazing that we went back for breakfast!  Absolutely delicious lattes and coffees, scrumptious pastries (I loved the almond croissant; the valrhona choc brioche was also amazing, tho extremely chocolatey), and delicious sandwiches and salads.  My cousins, who are from Montreal, almost died when we told them we found this place -- it is one of their faves. Don't give up on the long wait -- it moves more quickly than you expect and it's well worth it.  Special shout out to the lovely hostess (didn't catch her name) who was warm and friendly and remembered us when we returned the next day. We will most certainly return when we go back to Montreal."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the best lunch here! We stoped in after walking around town all morning! We were greeted right away and sat a few moments later. We sat right at the window sill, we had the warm sun beaming in on us and a nice view of the street. Our waitress was fabulous and the food was so delicious! I did a half sandwich, half salad combo! Amazing, the vegan 3.0 and their salad of the week! My husband got a sandwich and soup, the Gustavo and their soup of the day, a tomato basil. This place was incredible. We can't wait for us next trip back to Montreal, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Mango chicken sandwich with guacamole.  This is all you need to know about this place.  End of review."}
{"text":"The experience was pretty good. After a long wait to get in, we were seated in a beautiful, quaint, and bustling atmosphere. The service was quick and efficient. I ordered the Cuban sandwich which was Delicious. I would definitely come back. Old Montreal at its finest. The one underwhelming thing about the experience, was that the pastries were not appetizing enough to order anything. Nonetheless, it is old Montreal and finding an awesome café nearby isn't hard."}
{"text":"Olive & Gourmando is located in Old Montreal on Saint Paul. It is just a couple of blocks off of the river near the old port.  As other yelpers have written the place does a brisk business, mainly with the tourist trade. However, Olive & Gourmand is a pretty good place for fresh baked goods, good coffee and an excellent brunch. We had about a 20-minute wait for our table for 3.  The food we had was all very fresh and had nice flavors. I had the Goat Cheese Sandwich (Mild goat cheese paillot and caramelized onions. Served with their house made ketchup) and it was excellent. We also had coffee and some really special baked goods.  The prices are not too bad either being in the heart of the tourist district. Our server was really nice also."}
{"text":"I wanted an authentic breakfast and I found it! (or at least I think I did) Yelp led me to Olive and Gourmando and it did not disappoint! I ordered tea and it came in a teapot and everything. The chocolate croissant was delicious and so were the other couple baked goods we tried. Also, I am not remembering the name, but there was a panini (only one on the menu) that was incredible - a perfectly warm, lightly meaty, mega-cheesey panini! And who wouldn't love their slogan, \"eat, drink, be merry.\""}
{"text":"Perched in the old port and always a long line-up at lunch time! Cozy café with antique décor. Didn't try their coffee but the smell of it was heavenly. Grilled cheese yum yum yum! Simply love it despite its simplicity. Cubano is good but not what I expected. Would return a day!"}
{"text":"Your quintessential bakery cafe on Montreal. We had the ricotta marmalade on fresh toast and the egg panini with sriracha that complimented the desire for sweet and salty!  We were definitely happy with the food and service. Upon exiting, you can just get up and pay at the counter without the need to wait for your server. This is a plus for me!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, delicious food, great location. What more could you ask for? All the staff speaks perfect English as well as French. They serve lunch after 11, I believe, and the lunch salad I got from them the next day was just as good as the breakfast I had the day before!"}
{"text":"A nice cafe for food! I went here with friend for brunch. I had a chocolatine first while waiting my friend. It tasted sooooooo goooooood!! It was crunchy outside and soft inside. I should've asked to heat it a little bit, so that the chocolate would melt a little bit and it would taste better! After my friend arriving, I ordered oeuf coquette as brunch. The taste was ok, not as surprised as the chocolatine. The service was good and the ambiance was good too. Also, this place is very popular. Be ready for lining up for around 30 minutes...But as people say, good food is worth waiting."}
{"text":"Olive & Gourmando est un peu la madeleine de Proust des cafés-restaurants de Montréal. Bien sûr, le grilled cheese n'y est pas pour rien, avec son ketchup maison ! L'endroit est toujours plein, et il y a très souvent le line-up pour l'heure du lunch. Chanceux ceux qui travaillent dans le coin de pouvoir prendre à emporter. Sinon armez-vous de patience car l'attente en vaut la peine. Et une étoile supplémentaire pour le service toujours impeccable."}
{"text":"(*4.5) They are packed in the brunch hours. A standard 20 min wait to be expected. As a result, the service is rushed with the get in and get out mentality. Sandwiches & panini are delicious. The Cajun Chicken sandwich was sweet and savoury with the guacamole, fresh tomatoes, and mangoes providing a real fresh taste. We didn't order any but their salads looked extraordinary. Their prices are actually quite competitive considering they are in a posh area of town. They also have a great selection of baked goods. Overall, the quality and care put into the food does not go unnoticed, I just wouldn't rate it 5/5."}
{"text":"Wednesday we arrived in Montreal around 12 and the wAit was 45 minuets. Thursday we arrived around 11:30 and the wait was 20 minutes. We were seated towards the back. Grilled cheese for my son , soup de jour chicken soup with rice, my daughter and I split a Cuban sandwich and the mac&cheese. Wow we were in heaven."}
{"text":"Cool vibes and good food! Awesome staff there and they give honest recommendations! I would definitely try the Poached Egg Panini.. it was"}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautifully decorated with very attentive servers. I was there during lunch time so it was pretty busy, however, I was seated within 15 minutes and had enough attention from my server. I had the Cuban sandwich and it was amazing!! I definitely recommend trying it. I would be a regular at this place if I lived in Montreal!"}
{"text":"The breakfast panini was awesome! Fruit and yogurt bowl was also good. The chocolate croissant wad a but more like baguette bread than buttery croissant dough. They were packed the whole time we were there and our server forgot to put in our order, so we were there a while. Cute, bustling, and the lunch menu looks worth going back for."}
{"text":"This place is small yet very cute inside. Most people there speak French but English is available. They sale pastries up front which look delicious but sales out sooo fast since they open early. We ordered their panini sandwiches. It was THE BEST panini Iv ever had in my life. The egg poach in you face was soo cheesy and full of flavor!  Must try! The Gustavo was also very tasty, the chicken was marinated well!"}
{"text":"Yummy. Came in here at 11am on a Thursday. Trying to beat the crowd. That didn't happen. It was packed already!! We waited about 5 minutes to be seated. There were a lot of young and middle aged hip Quebecers at this joint. Strangers sitting next to strangers. Tight seating. Very enjoyable. This is a place people go for good food and a good sangwich. Menu is diverse with eclectic choices. I went with the grilled cheese and an espresso. It came to me promptly after ordering it. It did not disappoint. As I took my first bite and felt the salty crunch beneath my teeth I knew this was going to be good. Bite. Tangy onions. Salty cheese. Bite chew bite bite chew bite chew and some swallows mixed in there. I finished it quickly because it was so good and I just couldn't stop myself. The espresso had a nice burnt chocolaty taste. It was a good espresso. Not the best I've ever had but it was good. We didn't get pastries to to but there were an ample amount of them and they all looked good. I bet they all had a nice crisp to them just like my sandwich.   Go to this place and get a sandwich. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Adore the atmosphere and decor of this little shop! Very busy but still managed to snag a cozy table for 2 during lunch hour.  We had the pomme de luxe panini and Caesar salad, both fresh and well seasoned!  Staff was kind and attentive.  Slightly on the expensive side (e.g. $4 for espresso) but enjoyed the whole experience!"}
{"text":"Tout est parfait chez Olive et Gourmando. Tous les plats sont excellent, leur café est délicieux, l'ambiance est vraiment le fun et l'endroit hyper charmant situé dans le vieux-port, une localisation parfaite pour ce petit restaurant/café. C'est un endroit très achalandé mais qui vaut la peine si vous devez attendre un petit peu. De plus, les employés sont très courtois et le service est généralement rapide."}
{"text":"We had lunch at Olive & Gourmando after seeing so many wonderful yelp reviews.  However, I am astonished that there are barely any reviews on the vegan burger.  It was one of the best I've ever had!!!  The burger itself is a mixture of many ingredients and is topped with parsnip bacon.  It was incredible and a must for vegans (and all foodies) visiting the city.  I also had the raspberry lime beverage, which was delicious.  Highly recommend a stop at Olive & Gourmando!!"}
{"text":"We tried to walk in 3 days in a row, but there was always a 30 min wait. We eventually just grabbed some pastries and ate them in a park along the river. I love the feeling of the space they had and the pastries were pretty solidly delicious! Pretty crowded though."}
{"text":"Chill hipster vibe with great music and sights inside.  Menu is limited but very tasty.   Group service was efficient and friendly.  I had poached egg sandwich...I enjoyed it, but would have loved with a bit less cheese (I know impossible)."}
{"text":"The best sweet ricotta around! So delicious. The ambiance was incredible as well, and service was swift. We had a very pleasant experience here!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice selection of freshly baked pastries. For all the cinnamon bun lovers: they make the best ones in town!"}
{"text":"The paninis were absolutely amazing. Everyone in my family loved the Cuban the most, while I thought the Miami was the best. Both amazing though!!"}
{"text":"Olive & Gourmando quirkly local place to grab lunch if you're trying to save a buck. They're great for soups, salads, and hot or cold sandwiches which cost about $9. You can even get half a sandwich for half the price! It's a very busy place, especially during lunch time so expect to wait a couple minutes before you get seated. But once you are seated, you order from the counter, and it doesn't take long for servers to bring you your food.  They have soups and salads of the day which have unique but fresh and delicious ingredients. My friend had a tasty salad with cooked squash and zucchini. I had the Cuban panini which had ham, braised porc, gruyere cheese, and a delicious mayonaise made with chipotle peppers, pickles, lime, and coriander (I checked their website for the the ingredients if you're wondering. My tongue would not have been able to pick up any of those tastes. All it knows is good or bad). They also have a bakery with cookies and brownies and more. I had a brownie that wasn't half bad, but I've definitely had better.  The location is on a lively corner in Old Montreal. You'll see locals and businessmen walking by. There are also boutiques and art galleries galore, so after lunch, you can walk around and entertain yourself."}
{"text":"We were at Olive et Gourmando early enough to beat the crowd and got seated right away. If I had to wait for a table, it might be a 3 star review.  Great place for breakfast, as nothing beat some good pastry and coffee.  We shared a Chocolate & Banana Brioche and a plain Croissant. Cappuccino was A OK though on the more mellow side.  The tables are packed so closely together, not much privacy. Olive et Gourmando is good for something fast, but a place that you can really take your time and enjoy your food.   By the time we were leaving, there was so many people blocking the entrance waiting for a table.   I don't mind coming back for more treats or coffee but I doubt I would have wanted to wait for more than 10-15 minute for a table on on my vacation"}
{"text":"Masters of texture and spice, especially along the salty/crunchy/spicy taste nexus. The #5 (chevre) sandwich with grilled onions and homemade ketchup was fabulous and the #6 (pork, asparagus, cheese) was even better, blasts of flavor in every bite. Perpetually crowded so it's easiest to get takeout. Come early because they seem to run out of stuff quickly."}
{"text":"This cafe is such a little gem in an otherwise tourist-laden area of the city. The sandwiches are delicious and they offer many house made drink specials like fresh limeade or lemonade and they have plenty of options for vegetarians as well.  Be sure to get a baked good treat for the walk home!"}
{"text":"Super place en centre ville pour le lunch. Du choix et beaucoup de gout ! Bien que la line up soit de plus en plus loooong"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on Saturday. This place is popular. There're line to dine in and line to take out. I ordered Oeuf Coquette. It comes with poached egg, tomato, feta, crumbled house chorizo, avocado + Olive's grilled flat bread. I have to say I don't like the greens they put on top even though my friend loves it. The whole dish (other than the greens) are very good. It's a bit salty, but it goes good with bread."}
{"text":"Cet endroit est selon moi vraiment surrévalué. On ne prend pas les réservations, on fait la queue, et la table-bar nous tasse complètement au maximum. Difficile donc de parler avec son interlocuteur. Aucune intimité. Pour 14 $ le sandwich/panini hors taxe hors tips présenté dans un panier et vu la taille la taille ridicule du sandwich pour ce prix, je trouve qu'on se fout de notre gueule. La soupe du jour était moyenne. Rien d'exceptionnel."}
{"text":"Delicious and a great location  Swung by and seated by the window with a great view of the government building and museum across the street.  For starters we ordered the calamari. There were only two pieces super tender calamari with a yummy vegetable sauce.  The main course was the Cornish Hen for two. This was a deboned Cornish Hen prepared with a sous vide that was stuffed with risotto in a cast iron skillet accompanied with purple potatoes, brussel sprouts, carrots, beats, and broccoli. Upon serving, the waiter poured a cup of the sauce on the hen and it was fabulous. I wish there was more for the vegetables. The chicken was fall off the bone, if there were bones, tender. The best were the two drum sticks"}
{"text":"I read so many good reviews so I went and tried almost all their pastries. didn't like any of them and they were really expensive.  It's definitely not the best place in Montreal for pastries. I would give a 1.5star for the pastry section but their sandwiches are pretty good, hence the overall 3 stars."}
{"text":"Always crowded, and for a reason! Their soups, salads, sandwiches and, above all, their brownies, are all excellent!"}
{"text":"One place Montreal doesn't generally stack up well to my native New York is gourmet sandwiches. While the French breads make them all pretty enjoyable, when the flashiest topping is ham and cheese you eventually long for a little more excitement. This explains the popularity of Olive Et Gourmando, a small sit-down sandwich shop in Old Montreal which offers interesting sandwich combinations like garlic and yogurt chicken, smoked trout and pancetta, pork and gruyere. The seating is tight and waits can be long but the hipster French cafe vibe, creative sandwiches and local beer and wine selection make them worth putting up with.  Recommended: The Gustavo, The Smoked Trout"}
{"text":"This is the place and maybe the only place(even the locals believe) where they don't have the tourist trap system. The portion of the breakfast and their interior was beautiful. You can tell the place is highly recommended when locals and tourists are coming in and there are no space to sit. The place is busy but the food and the drinks came at a reasonable pace."}
{"text":"YUM! This place was great and we didn't have wait too long to sit. We got lots of plates to share and enjoyed everything. If I lived in Montreal I would eat here all the time."}
{"text":"So, so, SO cute that I wanted to love it but just couldn't. The breakfast food is fine, but not special enough to make up for the crowds and blasé service. The menu is pricey for what it is.  I found the coffee to be a bit astringent. (Many people were drinking tea, so maybe I should have taken the hint.) The homemade granola with yogurt was average, but the sweet ricotta with toast was a nice change from the usual. The lunch offerings look more interesting, so maybe I was expecting too much for breakfast.  O&G was recommended by everyone, but I'm beginning to think that that was part of the problem: a victim of its own success."}
{"text":"This is a declaration of love for Olive et Gourmando! Located in the heart of Montreal, Olive et Gourmando has established themselves as a quintessential cafe of Old Montreal. Delicious breakfast items...piping hot Panini...fresh cold sandwiches...a table stacked with amazing baked goods as far as the eyes can see....what more can Hungarians (not to be confused with the good people of Hungary; but rather, hungry patrons) ask for?   The flavor profile of the apple and parsnip soup with julienned pear covered with crispy bacon was truly divine. Needless to say, it was devoured within seconds.   The #24 Salad must be sent by the Herbivore God.  The amazingly competent dish is comprised of the following: buckwheat soba noodles tossed with sesame oil, toasted unsweetened coconut, black sesame seeds, pickled daïkon and carrots, fried shallots, roasted marinated tofu, fresh herbs (basil, mint, cilantro), peas, fenugreek sprouts, red cabbage, cucumber, strips of kale, mixed sprouted beans, and mix seeds and nuts (small pieces of roasted unsalted cashew).  The equally marvelous dressing consisted of rice wine vinegar, fresh ginger, organic cashew butter, some spicy chili sauce, sautéed onion, garlic, curry powder, cinnamon, cumin, fresh coriander and fresh lime juice.  \"Am I dead, Angel? Cause this must be heaven!\" O + G, I'd use cheesier pick-up line on you, but you're too smart for it."}
{"text":"So excellent, highly recommend. Pricing here is pretty reasonable and for the quality you get, you'll be pleasantly surprised! I got a cuban panini, and it was toasty and melty and crunchy in all the right ways. My friend ordered a specialty salad (it was a lot of grains and fresh vegetables) that was superb. Their latte was also very good. This is a must-visit in Old Montreal, and if I'm ever in Montreal again, I'm going to come visit."}
{"text":"How could this place, so highly rated on yelp and mentioned in many tour guide books be 5 stars?! Because it's so amazingly delicious!  We went on a Monday, but got to order from the brunch menu because it was a holiday. We had the tartine - toast with ricotta and lots of veggies - and the egg coquette - poached eggs in a tomato sauce with mint, chickpeas, avocado and yogurt. YUM! We also had a croissant which was perfectly flaky.  We took a chocolate chip pecan cookie to go which was fine. We probably should have tried a palmier instead.  Yes, we had to wait for a table. There are a couple of steps in, but I was able to get my wheelchair into the bathroom.  Do not miss a brunch or lunch here!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience;  amazing pastries and sandwiches.  Love the latte.  Great service."}
{"text":"Great place! Nice location, open space and clean. Busy for brunch and lunch - I just beat the crowds by 20 minutes. Waiters are attentive, work great together as a team. The food is fresh, made with care and attention - I'm picky for good restaurants - this one did the job! I met the owner and got to compliment on the place. I had the Chia Chia bowl - filling and fresh at the same time. Had a grilled cheese sandwich and a mocha. Loved it!"}
{"text":"For such a popular place, i am disappointed there's no gluten free bread, i used to love the sandwiches but a sandwich is a sandwich. I ordered the 24h salad, the greens weren't cut so while eating, the vinaigrette splashed all over my face. The gluten free coconut almond cookie was delicious better than the salad. I had to go home and replicate it. Also they don't have the french soap they used to, now it's a normal dispenser."}
{"text":"This was one of our favorite stops in Montreal! Seriously, such a hopping eatery, even on a tuesday. But the wait is worth it! I love the space and liveliness inside.   We shared their beet soup and cuban sandwich. The soup was so so good. A swirl of olive oil, dill and feta cheese made it delicious. And the sandwich was done well too: hot, gooey cheese and turkey between two slices of crunchy panini bread.  We also bought some pastries to go - the almond croissant, two scones and a blueberry danish. The blueberry danish was the best. The pastries were good, but not amazing."}
{"text":"Got the cuban sandwich and it was a lot better than some of the cuban sandwiches I've had at cuban restaurants. Also got a chocolate chip and pecan cookie from their pastries section and it was amazing. The portion size is just good enough that a little dessert afterwards puts you in a good spot. Place was very busy on a Wednesday afternoon, but we were seated within 15 minutes."}
{"text":"We had a very nice quick lunch at this well located establishment in the heart of the old town of Montreal.  The pace is fast and reminds me of the quick serve restaurants in Los Angeles.  We had their Cajun chicken sandwich (so big that we split it).  Was very delicious and the pineapple was a great touch.  We also shared a delicious cheese croissant and this delicious sugary fried croissant type thing that I can't remember the name of as of this review.  Only thing weird was their iced tea was sooooo small, almost like a shot."}
{"text":"Worth every second of the wait. I dream about this place. The mac and cheese is uhhhh-maze-zing. Go. Wait. Live."}
{"text":"The best cuban sandwich in Montreal according to me. And the best in North America, according to Anthony Bourdain.  In fact, all sandwiches are pretty awesome. But how to resist O+G's sandwich filled with gooey gruyère, ham, pork loin and their secret sauce? Feeling a bit more healthy? The \"24\" salad with asian flavors is a good choice too.  And how to resist their beautiful selection of baked desserts?  Did I say how I love O+G ? Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The first time I went here I loved it. I don't know what happened the second time. Its gotten much more busy and maybe I just didn't like what I ordered? Limited vegetarian options and I ended up with something rather plain. It was basically a grilled cheese with homemade ketchup. The ketchup was sooo clove-y. Really not my thing, clove flavoured dishes should come with a warning!   Not worth waiting in line for. I do love their sound system and decor though."}
{"text":"Avant même de changer de cap complètement, direction Montréal, j'avais entendu parlé d'Olive et Gourmando comme étant un des secrets de la ville. J'ai été super contente de finalement y jeter un coup d'oeil et goûter à leur sandwhich lors d'un lunch cette semaine.  J'ai adoré la nourriture, le décor et l'ambiance en plus d'être impressionnée par la rapidité du service même si les files étaient longues. Ça donne l'impression d'être dans un monde à l'envers où le service est plus rapide le plus de gens y sont!  Bien que j'aimais le style de musique, avec le nombre de personnes présentes dans le petit espace qui jasaient à cent mille à l'heure, j'avais l'impression que le système de son était juste un peu trop fort pour être confortable. Ça donnait certainement un buzz à la place aussi efficace qu'une bonne tasse de café!"}
{"text":"Oh MAN! Sandwich heaven is a thing and Olive & Gourmando has mastered the art.   Came here on Sunday around 1pm to a decent crowd. The hostess said to expect around 20 minutes but it seemed all the existing party of 2's that were waiting before us disappeared so the actual time was much less. Any party more than 4 would take a lot longer I assume, as the place is very tiny.   We were greeted right away and made sure to put in our 'appetizer' of a banana/chocolate pastry. We then ordered our dishes of the cubain sandwich & the Tartine.   Pastry - honestly nothing out of this world, but it was very tasty. Especially as you get more into the insides of the pastry where you can discover all the ooey-gooey goodness. 4 stars.   The Tartine - as I'm writing this a week later I'm in full depression mode. This thing was UNREAL. Check the photo below. Yes it's a bit pricey at $18 but they pile this thing up. There's no skimping. It was the most satisfying combination of sweet to salty to refreshing to filling. I'd recommend this over and over again. 1 million stars.   The Cuban - came to us fresh out of the oven, had to take a bit to cool. So much meat & cheese with some awesome - but not overpowering - sauces. If you like classic Cubans, this will not disappoint. 5 stars.   Service was quick, as they're trying to get customers in/out as quick as possible, which we preferred. Also perfect location smack dab in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"This review is from memory, so it's vague, but I had the best organic sandwich and tea at this place.  You can taste the ingredients in the food and it is oh so delicious.  I was convinced I had found the new culinary center of the world without jumping on a plane. love it!"}
{"text":"To get in during rush hours you usually have to wait around ~20 mins, and there WILL be a line. This place is usually packed and comes with it, the chatter, so it's pretty noisy which I didn't really like. Around 5 minutes in, our waiter came right away and she was super friendly and very informative about the menu. We ordered a grilled cheese and the reuben which is a smoked meat panini but it took a bit long for our meal to arrive. Once I took the first bite though i noticed that their panini bread was extremely crispy which made it taste so good! Everything tasted very fresh, so I do believe you're getting your moneys worth even though it might seem a bit pricey for a sandwich. I don't really recommend getting the salads though because they are quiet pricey for what they are. They also offer some baked goods so I took the double chocolate cookie to go and it was delicius! Lots of chocolate chunks yummm   Definitely a place to check out if you're around Old Port area or craving a good sandwich!"}
{"text":"There can be a long wait but they have the best Cubano in Montreal!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Super complex flavors on every plate. I had the egg on your face and my fiance had the french toast. Both were done amazingly.  The coffee was delicious and so was the bread.   There is always a wait, but its worth it. Staff was very friendly and helpful with the menu.  If the weather was nicer I would have gotten a coffee and pastry to go. and head down to the water.  If you are in Old Port, this is the place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Cute bakery/eatery in beautiful old Montreal. Opt for the pastries instead of the savoury meal options. I tried the almond croissant $3.75 which was highly recommended but it was just ok in terms of a croissant. I loved the elixir ice tea, it's a green tea with ginger, lemon and pomegranate. It was the most delicious ice tea I've ever had  - complex yet balanced flavours and just a touch of sweetness. Only sad part is that the very small glass is $4.    I didn't love the egg on your face $11.95 - Spicy poached eggs with herbs and mayonnaise, Comté cheese, speck, and slow roasted tomatoes. The panini was just too heavy with the mayo and cheese for a breakfast item (for me at least) and the sriachha just over powered the eggs.   I really wanted to like this place as it was so highly recommended but it didn't do it for me. Loved the ice tea and would return for that."}
{"text":"My friends and I ventured into O&G during a recent vacation to Montreal, following up on a recommendation in a Lonely Planet guidebook.  My bf & I split the cuban sandwich, essentially a panini that was delicious with a creamy, spicy sauce.  Our friends had the chèvre chaud (hot goat cheese) with caramelized onion and house-made ketchup, the latter of which was slightly sweet and a perfect compliment to the salty, cheesy sandwich.  But the star of the show was the soupe du jour.  When the server described it to me--barley, corn, etc--I was less than enraptured.  But I am SO glad we tried it anyway!  It had such a delicious, unique flavor... I'm guessing a result of dill and lime in the mix.  It was easily the best soup I've ever had.  We capped off the meal with an almond pastry, gooey, delicious and fresh.  If you're ever in Vieux Montréal, do NOT miss this place!"}
{"text":"The host at the door was the rudest person I have ever encountered at a restaurant. On noxious, aggressive, impolite. Regardless, we waited patiently for a table of 4, and we were finally seated after 45 minutes of waiting. We ordered our food, and fifteen minutes later, the waitress told us that almost all the food we had ordered was sold out. Being vegetarian, this pretty much left us with no sandwiches to order (what we came for in the first place). So we ended up waiting an hour for nothing to eat. No apology from staff, no compensation, and overall, probably one of the worst experiences I've had in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Came back last week and my old review still stands. Expensive for what you're getting, but the pressed sandwiches are delicious! The baked goods were a bit dry and not really worth getting except for the chocolate croissant."}
{"text":"At the risk of posting yet another redundant review, this place is great.   Tasty sandwiches, pastries, wine, beer and coffee.  Great atmosphere and a cool (albeit touristy) location near the old port.  The best compliment I could say give this place, beyond great food and drink, is that the pacing was perfect.  Although there was a long wait to get in on the rainy day, they never rushed us, and we felt very comfortable lounging for an extended late lunch.   As an American, it had a very \"euro\" feel, in a good way.    If I ever make it back to Montreal, i'll definitely head back here."}
{"text":"Meilleur sandwich que j'ai mangé de ma vie! Poulet mangue avocat, sur un ciabatta frais! Toutefois, le service est lent au comptoir, donc il faut prévoir un quart d'heure d'attente si on est sur l'heure de lunch!"}
{"text":"Poached egg panini is bomb. Breakfast/brunch was busy, and I found the overall menu very limited. Prices are high, but food was tasty."}
{"text":"This place is very cute. It's small with limited seating. The menu takes typical sandwiches and salads and kicks it up a notch with their own unique twist to add flavor. We enjoyed everything we ordered.   Grilled Chicken Sandwich with guacamole, mango, tomato on flat bread.   Caesar Salad with chicken, bacon, croutons.   They also have a take out section where you can get everything to go including everything on the menu, coffee, and trail mixes. They have a very good vegetarian selection on their menu Tofu sandwiches as well as soba noodle salad with peanut dressing.   This place takes CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Mac & cheese was so good! Very light with a good crunch. It came with a salad as well. The Cuban panini was also a favorite!"}
{"text":"I went here for an early afternoon catch up with a few friends over the Christmas Holidays and while the food was just ok, the cocktail and the service where fantastic. The place was packed, which in my opinion is always a good sign, and while waiting we had time to take in all the charming decor and the cozy ambience that this establishment embodies. Service here is top notch, we were never left looking for a waiter and as soon as our glasses were getting empty they were already offering us more rounds. The reason this place only got a 3 in my books is that the food was a bit of a disappointment. 3 out of the 4 of us ordered the Cuban Panini and one of us the Mac'n'Cheese. While the food tasted good it was too much of one thing and not enough of the other. The Cuban comes as just a Panini. No fries or salad. For the price I would have appreciated a tiny clump of lettuce on the side. It would have helped to balance out the dish too as the Cuban is a hearty and heavy sandwhich consisting of meat,cheese and bread...a little greens on the side would have complemented the dish nicely. Same goes for the Mac'n'Cheese, while deliciously rich and creamy, after a few bites it's almost too much without a bit of something to go with it. Again Salad or a side would have been ideal. I think I'd definitely give this place another shot on my next trip out to Montreal, perhaps for breakfast this time to try some of their pastries that actually looked quite appealing."}
{"text":"Always my go-to. My wife loves the salad 24 and I adore their soy lattes. Always so busy which makes it hard to grab a quick bite, but I've never regretted waiting."}
{"text":"Neat little shop in the old port. Their food is very good and of high quality. However, there is usually a long line to get in and it takes a while to order from the two different counters. The food is great though."}
{"text":"The Cubano sandwich is actually life-changing; a bit heavy on the grease, but otherwise spot-on. The daily soups are also worth a try. Get there early or prepare to wait."}
{"text":"I would eat here every day if I could. I really love the sammies, but honestly the salads here are not to be missed. In fact, the kale caesar salad is the best ceaser I ever had! A great spot for soup lovers as well. Great location, atmosphere, ingredients, and wonderful rustic breads as well as amazing coffee. I highly recommend Olive & Gourmando."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place and was pleasantly surprised. A long line outside, locals and tourists. Put our name in and waited about 15 minutes for a table around noon.   We ordered a Cuban and another panini with asparagus, pesto, cheese, and capicollo (can't remember the name). Both were amazing! Definitely recommend them. We also had the raspberry lemonade and ginger tea, which were refreshing. The staff was very friendly. Everyone from the hostess to the cashier at the end.  Wish we would have discovered it earlier on our trip as we would have loved to try a pastry for breakfast. If we ever make it back to Montreal, we will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Olive et Gourmando is part of the hip renessaince in Old Montreal. There is a set of new stores and new culinary destinations making names for themselves. Olive et Gourmand is an affordable gourmet sandwich spot amongst this revival.  Upon entering, a place to sit and eat is picked for you and you move to the back to order your sandwich. There are several options daily, using fresh ingredients until they run out. I chose the Chevre Chaud, which was an answer to the American grilled cheese. It was a pain blanc bun with chevre and caramelized onions, and then grilled on a panini. The bread was perfectly white and fluffy with a good panini formed crust on the outside. The cheese on the edges also became toasted and caramelized.  It was served with a homemade ketchup dipping sauce, analogous to tomato soup but served cold, a bit thicker, and a bit sweeter. It was the perfect counter balance to the chevre and the caramelized onions in the sandwich. The delightful sauce sunk into the sandwich like a glorious edible sponge. Each bite is a treat for the palette.  I loved Olive et Gourmando so much that I returned the following day."}
{"text":"Phenomenal croissant... True French experience. Going back to try the dessert version. Going to eat the cinnamon bon next I'm sure it will taste fabulous."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! My boyfriend and I stopped in here for lunch a couple days ago after spending an hour or so at the Biosphere (we actually meant to go to the Biodome but we mixed them up, ended up there, and were very disappointed to realize that we were in the wrong place and there were no penguins).  We got off the Metro at Square-Victoria and walked just a few blocks to get to O + G. They don't have a big sign out front, so for a second we thought we had gone to the wrong place....again. :) But alas, we were in the right place!  There was a line and we did have to wait about 15-20 minutes, but it was well worth it. The atmosphere was lovely despite the general hubbub. You order at the counter and they bring you the food. The menu is posted on a chalkboard and is written solely in French, so I had to do a little translating for my boyfriend before we could decide. As long as you have a basic knowledge of food-related French words, you'll be okay - Oh, and they do have some handy little chalk drawings surrounding each entree so you can get some clues that way.   We got the goat cheese panini and it was deeeeeeeee-lish! I'm usually not a big fan of caramelized onions, but this sandwich was seriously good. The homemade ketchup was really yummy and added a lot of flavor. We also got a bag of kettle style dill pickle chips, which they bring to you in a basket. I also ordered a raspberry limeade, which they make themselves, and it was simply divine! Both of us were very impressed with the food and absolutely loved the sandwiches. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Maybe I had so high expectations that it was \"that\" amazing. But i definitely want to come back for pastries. Their almond, chocolate croissant looked amazing"}
{"text":"The best food I had during my several day trip in Montreal. We ordered two sandwiches and a cookie and they were all excellent. It gets busy here but the wait and food and adorableness are well worth it!!"}
{"text":"This was the best food we ate in Montreal ..and New York for that matter.  I can't say enough good things about it. I had the best Mac N cheese of my life here. So good that we came back the next day and I had a deli siba noodle salad. My vegan friend had a salad she loved though I can't remember the name. She had it twice though and it had a Thai curry mango dressing with tempeh.  But that Mac N cheese will haunt me. I have tried finding the best Mac N cheese in Los Angeles, and U have been so disappointed in everything I've had. Nothing compared to this one Mac N cheese I had at a French restaurant in LA, but I can't remember the name. Every attempt to repeat it has failed miserably. That is...until I had the Mac N cheese at olive and gourmand in Montreal. It was even better! My eyes rolled back in my head as I ascended into foodie heaven. Go there. It's in the heart of Old Montreal. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"love this cute cute place for brunch.

{"text":"An Mtl classic. Probably one of the better places to do breakfast/brunch/lunch in the Old Port. Many good options - I like their housemate salty ricotta. Decent coffee. Price is not high but certainly not the best deal in town. I still love coming here on Sat AMs w my daughter (we're neighbours ;-))  The staff is friendly and hip. Lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went to Olive & Gourmando for lunch. It was a popular local eatery with a very long line. Some students brought a book to read while waiting. The menu was hand-written on the wall in French, which we knew very little. We ordered the food based on our limited understanding and a lot of guessing. We were starved after the long waiting and did not know whether we ordered the food we anticipated. Luckily, the sandwiches were delicious. I will definitely bring a travel dictionary next time."}
{"text":"Such a cosy, beautiful little place to escape the winter chill. I sat on a large wooden bench by the window, surrounded by sweet Christmas decorations as I looked out onto the snowy street.   I had a delicious quinoa salad and vegetable soup, finished off with a perfect almond milk latte. While they do serve meat, this place is very vegan friendly.    Love love loved it!"}
{"text":"I always avoid the touristy area in terms of dining at all costs due to the much stronger price/quality ratio in Plateau Mont-Royal or Sud-Ouest. Still, if you (absolutely) have to rest in a cafe that serves food/coffee after showing some tourist friends around, here you go- you find yourself the perfect resting spot at old port at a decent price and have a great montreal spirit (homey, french, creative...). If you don't mind the chains, Soupesoup is probably a bit better for bigger groups in the same area."}
{"text":"Une super chouette adresse à Montréal, enfin une !!!  Non, j'exagère un peu, mais on a quand même été assez surpris de voir que même si les adresses healthy sont présentes à Montréal, elles sont quand même très largement dépassées en quantité par des lieux bien plus bien grassouilles (pas mauvais hein, mais caloriques +++).  Bref, Olive et Gourmando, c'est sain dans l'ensemble mais gourmand tout autant, et fait avec des produits frais, et ça se sent vraiment dans l'assiette.  On a goûté un midi une salade du jour, et une soupe du jour plus salade verte, et le tout était vraiment une tuerie : super bien assaisonné, frais, et des recettes originales et pleines de saveur (et avec plein de coriandre et d'amandes effiliées partout, mon coeur a fait boum).  Par contre, ils ne proposent qu'une bière, qui est une bière bouteille jamaïcainne pas super intéressante, quel dommage dans la ville aux microbrasseries !  Nos voisins semblaient avoir pris le Grilled Cheese et d'autres sandwichs toastés et ça avait l'air au moins aussi bon que nos plats.  Niveau quantité, c'est ok pour un estomac moyen, mais je pense qu'un bon mangeur peut facilement se ruiner là-dedans car ce n'est quand même pas donné.  Oui il y a la queue en effet aux heures de pointe mais on a été vite placés. Le service était top, en tout cas la serveuse souriante et tatouée qui nous a servis était parfaite, nous n'avons pas été pressés et elle nous a même indiqué gentiment quelques directions pendant quelques minutes sans se stresser pour autant. J'aime !  On peut aussi prendre à emporter (et faire du coup une 2e queue), tout a l'air vraiment appétissant, sandwichs comme desserts (il paraît qu'ils font l'un des meilleurs brownies de la ville).   Une super adresse pour faire une pause après trop d'ingestion de graisses saturées, mais n'ayez d'y laisser quand même un peu trop de dollars :D"}
{"text":"was really excited to come here during our visit to montreal for the poached egg on your face but it was pretty disappointing. i didn't know it was spicy (it wasn't terrible, but i'd like the option of having it be NON spicy but they couldn't do that) and my egg was pretty much hardened through instead of poached :( didn't make me mouth tingle with pleasure so it was kind of a let down.  the wait wasn't *too* bad it was just around 30 mins but the space feels kind of cramped. latte was good though and there's plenty of street parking."}
{"text":"Sometimes the place with the most and best reviews is actually the best. This is one of those times....  The food was delicious and fresh. The staff was fast and attentive.   There is generally a wait so grab a coffee and stick it out."}
{"text":"So yummy! The BREAD...got a plane to catch and making this a priority destination stop for munchies later. The wait is super long but worth it. Good things come with patience."}
{"text":"TLDR: if you come, split a panini and get something else lighter like a salad. Great pastries. (4.5/5)  Ordered the Cubaine and Mr Miami paninis and a butter croissant. All were delicious but the paninis are excessively oily. The first 3/4 of the panini were absolute heaven, but the last quarter felt like a chore due to the oil-covered bread.   Also of note is the wait times. If you come at peak time, expect waiting for more than 30 minutes. Limited seating but you can do take out."}
{"text":"This is absolutely a must-try. When you visit Montreal (assuming you're not a resident), you have GOT to beeline for this place for your next breakfast. This place has the most amazing brioche I've ever tried. If you're not able to secure a table, be sure to grab a few of these to go. In terms of actual brunch items, we shared the chia bowl (amazing..just...wow) and the oeuf coquette. Both outstanding and certainly worth having again. Service is very friendly and this place gets packed...so be sure to show up at least 15-20 min before it opens to make the first round of seating."}
{"text":"This was my favorite breakfast in Montreal. I'm sure this place is more than a bit hyped up by its Yelp reviews. It's filled with tourists who have no doubt flocked here via Yelp, but the food is delicious. Strong coffee, excellent granola and very fresh fruit, and the egg on your face panini is wonderfully spicy and cheesy. The only downside is that the small parties often have to share tables. Normally my boyfriend and I are happy to do so but we we're seated with some folks whose conversation really annoyed us. Of course that's not the cafe's fault, but if you want a more private breakfast you might be put off."}
{"text":"Tres bon effectivement mais je trouve que la reputation est surfaite .. et le prix est elevé pour la portion servi donc si vous etes gourmand commandez double ... les tables sont collés l'un de l'autre: attendez vous à ecouter la conversation des autres .. a part ca mon grilled cheese was really good :)"}
{"text":"normally i do not go to restaurants in this area because it is highly trafficked by tourists and it gives the impression of restaurants that make it solely on location but no necessarily quality  but i was starved and i really wanted a sandwich so we decided to give it a try the place is super busy and there was a wait which they told us would be 20 minutes but ended up being 11  inside is super cozy we were seated on a counter by the window which at first i thought would be uncomfortable but ended up being so nice i had their version of a cuban sandwich and it was delicious with the added bonus of the most fantastic bread my husband had the mr miami and he greatly enjoyed it as well  this might become a go to lunch spot for us"}
{"text":"Stopped by this little gem this past weekend.  Got a poached egg sandwich with all kinds of goodies -- chives, cheese, ham, sundried tomatoes and sriracha sauce.  This was an amazing sandwich.  It had a great blend of flavor, spice and gooeiness and surprisingly not as messy as you'd think.  Also went 'fat boy' and got an almond croissant.  Very flakey and not overly sweet which was great for me.  There were two disappoints.  The place was very busy which I expected on a Saturday morning but they managed the traffic poorly.  It took us a while to figure out where the line for carry out orders started/ended and there were a lot of people there for dine in service that seemed to have a similar problem.  Overall though, the wait was quicker than I would have expected despite the initial confusion.  The other disappointment was the iced coffee...it was basically espresso over ice...had only one size which was a small and it didn't taste very good as it a was bitter.  I'm sure the hot coffee would is fine though as the coffee did smell amazing.  But really, the food is worth it and it still gets a 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Stopped here for Saturday brunch, we waited about 15 minutes to sit. Everything we had was amazing including the chia bowl (fantastic) and Oeuf Coquette (so good). Only thing keeping this from a 5 star was that we ordered a scone that never came, but we weren't charged and cannot complain really given how busy they were"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my friend who used to live in Montreal. I'm so glad I took her advice to try this place! Because it's located along Rue de Saint Paul, this place could get really busy. They don't take reservations and at one point, it had a long waiting line to get in.  We went to this place twice; for a breakfast and lunch. For lunch, I had OG grilled cheese and their big healthy salad. The salad was, so far, the best salad I've had in my life!! It was so good that I tried to have it the following day, unfortunately, they only serve it for lunch. Anyway, I also tried Montreal Cola which is less sweet than a regular cola.   For breakfast, I had their Acai Bowl and ham and cheese panini, which were really good.   Service was good. Ambience is very hipster. They big windows which bring brightens the room nicely. Staff were very helpful and fast. This is going to be one of my reasons to go back to Montreal!!!"}
{"text":"if there are 10 people waiting to go in this place must be good and good it was - the sanwich was excellent and so was the croissant and lemon square"}
{"text":"A must go to place for breakfast, brunch or lunch in Vieux Quebec.  My wife found it extremely \"cute\" and fell in love with the place.  If you go around 11 you will be in good shape for an early lunch or brunch.  Breakfast did not seem to be much of a jam on the weekday we went (we went twice by the way).   All the pastries are wonderful, especially the cheese biscuit which has a little cayenne kick to it.    Wifey loved the cuban panini.  I thought the filling was great but I personally am not a big fan of overly toasted bread (not burnt).  That being said, I would order one of their paninis again any day and love to devour some cheese biscuits for dessert.  And do yourself a favor and get a large cappucino.  Not really that expensive in comparison to all the tourist traps you could get sucked into in the Old City."}
{"text":"During that rainy day, we were strolling along the streets of Old Montreal.  It seemed like we were the only ones in the city as we were exploring the area.  Came across Olive & Gourmando, and it was packed with people!  Guess everyone was hanging out at this cozy little cafe.  Fortunately, we were able to grab two spots at one of their communal tables.  Did not try any of their sandwiches.  We wanted to try their baked goods.  They looked so mouthwatering delicious in their display as we walked in.  Purchased 4 items.  Brioche Choco Banana ($3.95) Almond Croissant ($3.75) Banana Nut Muffin ($3.75) Brownie ($3.75)  Each item tasted quite good.  No, \"Wow\" factor with regards to the taste, though.  Would try some of their many other baked goods next time.  Overall, Olive & Gourmando is a fine establishment.  Although it was a bit loud and crowded inside, I liked the ambiance.   Service and cleanliness was also fine as well."}
{"text":"Cutest little spot in town. Very small and cozy, so you might have to wait. But trust me it's worth it. Located on a very cute street, with really interesting decor. There are long windows by the tables looking out into the street, so it feels very European. The food was amazing. Small menu so anything you order is gonna be a specialty. The Paninis are amazing! Overall great experience!!"}
{"text":"So delicious and fresh! I got The Big Healthy Salad with a side of avocado, and my mom got the housemade ricotta served with fresh toasts and a tomato/corn salad.   Very cozy and welcoming atmosphere...definitely a must-go lunch spot."}
{"text":"Me. Miami sandwich was fantastic!  Grilled cheese was good, and so was the Spritz.  Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Sad for me, this spot is so popular that arriving at 2pm on a Friday was still too crowded to have a spot for lunch. After having lunch across the street, though, we came back to oggle the pastries and grab an iced coffee. It was definitely the smallest size for the highest price I had seen in the city, but it was also one of the tastiest.   Definitely worth stopping in, and good luck getting a spot."}
{"text":"Just lovely place that you can feel welcome!! Perfect for vegetarian.  Wonderful staff as well as food!!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait! Must visit breakfast place in Montreal! Amaaaaaazing food..excellent service and a great place to hang out. We had the tartine and the coquette. Both had very good flavor and tasted out of the world! They have a lot of options for vegetarians! Will definitely visit again !  P.S Try to reach early as they don't take reservations."}
