{"text":"This place is a little gem when it comes to dosas. Their parking is impossible to find so be prepared to circle around a couple of times. I find the quality of the food is pretty consistent. The servers themselves are a different story. It's a hit and miss with getting their attention. I have noticed that when I order the vegetable dosa that it sometimes comes stone cold. The staff has to be reminded to bring it hot. All in all it's good food. Their chutneys are very good (peanut, ginger, tomato, coconut) but the amount they give you with the dosa varies on each visit. I have visited this place numerous times and haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"The best place to have South Indian Thali in entire GTA!!!
Thali is only on weekends. Its a definite try.."}
{"text":"This review is for Godavari at Silver Creek Blvd. Cawthra/Dundas in Mississauga.  I really wanted to like this place - and while the  front desk staff seemed very nice, a restaurant will live or die on its food.  I ordered for 2 people. The potato curry and the vegetable korma and chapatis.  On arriving home, saw there were about 4  small pieces of potato in the potato curry surrounded by watery curry, with oil on top. It was cold, which surprised me. Tasted nice, but would better be called soup.  Impossible to eat with chapatis. Then, the vegetable curry.  You know those veggies cut in tiny cubes, sold in the frozen section of the supermarket, in bags? That seems to be what they used. On the plus side, the spicing was lovely, and the taste was good. But the portion size, as someone else mentioned, is a problem.  3/4s of a small take out container and 2 chapatis per person for $8 each? I had to have an apple afterwards to feel I'd been satisfied for dinner. Maybe other menu items are better. Cannot recommend."}
{"text":"It took a while for the hostesses to arrive and take order, followed by a long wait time for the actual meal. Due to my dietary restrictions, they said they were taken care of, but by the taste I could tell it wasn't. They refused to address the problem. I have had better food at some other south indian places. Along with that, Parking was difficult to find."}
{"text":"Really want this place to do good. Have recommended to at least 10 families. Been here 4 times now and the service and food are kind of on a declining scale as of November 2017.

Just yesterday, ordered mini thalli (weekend special) , specially asked if we can substitute plain rice with coconut rice for a cost. And we heard ayes. Thali then came with white rice only. On reminding that we asked for substitution (for a nominal cost) we were told, oh ok we will charge $2 less and substitute. Didn't understand the $2 less first, but then the final cost of thali was $10+ $6 =$16 for two mini curries, one chappati ! , plus coconut rice , white rice was taken away. Then we pointed out that it lists on the menu- \"Raita\" with Thali, but here it's thick plain yogurt.The server bluntly replies, yes its yogurt, that's what the kitchen gave me! , I don't know , the kitchen gave me this..,!!!! 
We then opened the menu and pointed out that here it states \"raita\". The server grabbed the menu, goes inside the kitchen and comes back with a tiny cup of raita and places on the table. Not even a single word is uttered! 

The thali itself is a big fail as the minuscule curries and one chappati + a bowl of rice, keeps you wanting for more curry or gravy. At least not so expensive, some sambhar or rasam might do justice to a South Indian thali! 

Although dishes were tasty , we felt like we were sitting in glorified takeout place with servers too busy to interact. On this visit, not even once, were we asked if we needed anything more, more water, sambhar or chutney ...we had to call for water twice and then in the end when plates were cleared we waited 15mins in the same empty room (on our table). My partner quickly nodded for cheque, at the peaking ponytail (of our server) from the kitchen area and we were told, you need to pay at the reception area whenever ready!!! How would we know? last 3 times they had brought the cheque at table. To add to the insult, there was a service charge added to the bill ( we were only two people). So we asked the same server for an explanation of the service charge. Reply was \"well we are asked to charge it by the owner, and some places hide it, but we like to show it on the bill\"
Ok, thanks, but what's it about?  we asked again. \"Well it's for using the on-premise services, facilities \"
We paid and walked out ..... wondering what exact services did we use - the embezzled washroom with silver faucets or the 20th century gramophone in the attic- none present! 

We really want this place to succeed , I have run into the owner twice before, seemed like a nice progressive gentlemen. Either things are very busy or the passion is declining. I hope they can train the staff and make this gem in the rough , shine !"}
{"text":"Being the first review to be posted about this newly opened restaurant, I'm happy about the fact that our first experience was a positive one..we went there for dinner on the first day and the place looks very clean and has a nice decor..it had a lot of seating..The menu has plenty to offer and we tasted a wide variety ranging from appetizers, dosas, bread and rice and the taste was pretty good...we were not big fans of the chutneys as the coconut chutney had a peanut flavour and there was also a sweetened version of the coconut chutney which was not our favourite..sambar was good and so was the mint chutney...The service could be improved to come back for water refills...Overall satisfied with the quality and taste of the food. Would love to return to the restaurant if they had dedicated parking spots....it's kind of inconvenient to use paid parking across the street...Anyway, if you are looking for a new restaurant in GTA that is vegetarian and offer traditional South Indian food, this one is definitely worth visiting!!!"}
{"text":"The worst experience ever!! We waited for an hour and half for our order only to be told that they don't have it any more!! Who does that??!!..avoid it and try some place else."}
{"text":"Food was good but on COLD side. We had eggplant subji and the taste was good but eggplant itself was not cooked properly."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic south indian food. Highly recommend them.Definitely try out their vada Sambar and any of their dosa's.Their service is pretty quick as well."}
{"text":"We were cautiously optimistic as we tried out Godavari's new location in Mississauga. We had been delighted by the quality of the food when it first opened in Brampton. Then we watched sadly as the food and execution deteriorated slowly over the next year each time we made our monthly visit. A few weeks before the Brampton location closed, we had decided not to go back again.

I'm happy to report that the food at Godavari 2.0 is back to that first standard - with the chef's delicate hand evident in the dishes we tried. The new premises are an improvement on the Brampton location. Godavari is now located in a house, with smaller rooms and decor (table cloths, for example) that provide a comfortable ambiance, rather than the banquet hall feel of the the Brampton site.

I'm worried a bit about the execution and logistics. As the old location declined, the menu became spotty, with thalis, in particular, not available. So we laughed on Day 2 in Mississauga when we ordered a thali and were told it was not available. If not everything was available, I might have created a smaller printed menu of what was (rather than the tired menus from the old restaurant with white tape over items no longer prepared). Or I would have informed each new table that thalis were not available yet, to avoid disappointing customers in a new venue. Instead we heard each new table order a thali to be told that they weren't on the menu that day.

All that being said, the food is very good. We had some of our faves - the Aloo Bonda had a crispy outer layer and spicy filling, the Onion Rava Masala Dosa was perfect, and the Sambhar Veda was fresh and tasty. Even the coffee (which had been disastrous towards the end at Brampton) was very good.

This location has what could be a very nice patio area. I hope they use it. The old location also had a patio but they never opened it and eventually just piled all the patio furniture up in a corner to ultimately become a big pile of ruined junk.

We'll go back again - we want a thali! I hope the issues that plagued the old location do not resurface."}
{"text":"They did not accept the yelp offer for a free sweet when I presented it to them! Decent food and good chutneys."}
{"text":"Hidden gem of South Indian food in the city. And what makes this place special is that you find some unique and authentic Andhra (state in India) food  that is not catered by some of the staple South Indian/Indian restaurants in the city. The restaurant has a rich variety of items on the menu with great flavor. We tried Idli, Karampodi Idli (spicy Idli), Rasam Vada (vada in a spicy soup/gravy), Andhra style Palak and Moong Dosa (Spinach and lentil dosa), Karampodi Pesarattu (spicy green gram dosa) and Yellow Moong Dosa (yellow gram/lentil dosa). Each of these items were well made and they were accompanied by well made chutneys and sambar. Mind you, you cannot find these items in any other South Indian restaurants in the city and that it self makes the experience amazing. You mostly find Masala/Rava dosa not the particular varieties you find here. Also the ingredients used to make typical items like Idli is slightly different which gives it a very different taste. The ginger/tomato chutney and the peanut chutney were items that I had never tasted before and were amazing compliments to the main dish. Above all the price is great and reasonable. 

The things that the restaurant needs to improve are the following: There was only one server for the entire place and made it a bit of a slow service (it wasn't bad) but the server needs to be much more groomed and dressed well to receive and serve customers. This needs to be a bit more pleasant. There is no hand-wash station in the main floor so it makes it a bit of a journey (upstairs) to get your hand-washed before and after the meal. Being a south Indian restaurant this is a must. The food is served in somewhat of high-durable plastic utensils. As a South Indian restaurant ever silver plates and tumblers, maybe with a small slice of banana leaf, would make it a better fine dining experience. Eating dosa and idli on plastic feels a bit weird especially in a sit and dine restaurant. Finally with items such as peanut in some of the chutneys, it is advisable to indicate these on the menu as many people are allergic to these things. 

Leaving the things mentioned above, it was an absolutely great experience. I would recommend every item on the menu as they were made to the authentic flavor that you would find in South India. Do not miss this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Good food. All five of us had went for lunch and had different menu items . The food was very good . I wonder why the restaurant has few reviews . Come on yelper's !!!! The dosas very really good and vadas too. Try ordering the 70mm dosa, that's one of the biggest dosa, u ever see in your life. It's a vegetarian restaurant , but the non -vegetarians like it too ."}
{"text":"Yesterday went to this restaurant loved the menu selection, I ordered andhra spicy coconut dosa, dosa tasted very nice but was not happy with the watery chutneys they offer with it..... Plus no coconut chutney but I liked they offer different podi n pickles with it..... There service is quick n nice...... Would love more if they give nice chutney with dosa"}
{"text":"Went for lunch here and sorry to say but the food was a let down.
We ordered Mysore Masala Dosa and a Thali. The dosa was below expectation in taste and chutnies were not fresh. Thali lacked variety and taste.
There are many places in GTA which offer better South Indian food than Godavari."}
{"text":"Food - 4 stars
Service - 3 stars
Menu (depth) - 5 stars
Overall - 4.5 stars

This is not your average run of the mill south indian eatery/dosa joint. They focus on Andhra style cooking so might not be for everyone.

The best Andhra food I tasted in Canada. Their chutneys are awesome, especially the ginger one. 
Ghee Karampodi Idli - the Idli was soft ad fluffy and they didn't skimp on ghee or podi. The sambar and chutneys were great too.

Black-eyed peas vada - It was very unique, as you wouldn't usually find it in restaurants here in Canada, but the taste was just okay. Wish we would have tried something else as they had so many interesting choices.

Paper Dosa - It was crispy and tasty. You can find this in many restaurants so it was nothing different, just nicely done.

Andhra Style Karivepaku Podi Dosa - It was something that you usually don't get anywhere. They applied curry leaf paste while making the dosa. The paste wasn't too spicy or salty. the taste was pretty good.

Bobbatlu - We tried this as dessert. It was a bread stuffed with lentil flour, jaggery and had a strong cardamom flavour. Pretty good.

We'll definitely return when we are in the area."}
{"text":"We went on Christmas to try this place. My husband and I are big fans of dosas. 
The customer service was ok, nothing to complain about. And the food was served quickly and efficiently. 

However, EVERYTHING lacked taste.. we order Chetinnad masala Dosa and Kodampodi Pesarrattu (green moong dal dosa) and black eyes peas vada. It all tasted Meh... the sambar lacked flavor as well. 

I love love filter coffee and the filter coffee here was the worst I've ever had."}
{"text":"I had bookmarked Godavari for some time and why not check it out? My usual and fave dosa place  ( you know what I'm taking about) was closed for the day, and is nearly impossible to get into without a booking.  What better time to try out this place? I was so not disappointed. 

In a nice kind of kitch/vintage part of Brampton, Godavari has authentic vegetarian South Indian food. Dosas , rice dishes, poori and a few curries. Simple but good. The chilli bhaji (deep fried spiced stuffed chilies) was  the BOMB DIGS, Dosas are plentiful with multiple options. We tried two dosas, both were good ( chettinad masala and karivappillai).  4 types of chutneys with a GINGER CHUTNEY! I love Ginger and this was so so good!  Dosas were light and crisp, as they should be! 

Mango lassi was in a big glass and the filter coffee ( which is a classic South Indian thing) was decent too. 

All in all- great. I Would come back to try a few other dishes maybe the rice dishes or something. Definitely worth a try especially if you're craving good vegetarian South Indian food. And especially if that other famous dosa place is too crowded. 

Very spacious place with ample seating. Good classic South Indian vegetarian food.

Vegans and hipsters will have no problem finding some food here. And for those wanting to try some decent vegetarian South Indian food, they've put a solid effort with great dishes!"}
{"text":"In many ways, this place is at least a 4. Large, open, nicely decorated decor. Very extensive menu with about at least 100 items to choose from.

I'm admittedly a novice when it comes to dosas. I'd have to say that it may seem that a couple of the chutneys were somewhat underwhelming, though. However, there are 4, so you should find at least one you enjoy. I ordered a my dosa with a spicy coconut side - it was almost the texture of a broth. That was quite nice and certainly not lacking any flavour. I also shared a black eyed pea vada. They had a great flavour and were a little more substantive than the dosa.

Going back to the rating, I have to say that I was still hoping for more - a little more flavour and to be more filled up. It may just be that dosas aren't my thing, but I'd be interested in going along with someone who could help navigate the menu, to find how to pick out complementary items and come out feeling a bit more full."}
{"text":"We went here just last weekend. Really cute restaurant. Food is good and fresh, restaurant is nicely decorated. There aren't many south indian restaurants in the area, so it's awesome that one finally opened up!"}
{"text":"Delicious, nice décor, quick service. My favourite new local Indian restaurant. The menu was a pleasant surprise because it is extensive, and a refreshing take on south Indian cuisine.  The coconut chutney variety is another bonus."}
{"text":"The food here was so delicious even though I'm not a huge fan of South Indian food I went with a big group and I was so surprised to find everything being incredibly delicious!!!

My husband and I got the cheese masala dosa and some of our friends got the regular paper masala dosa! These were delicious I think I would definitely come back and have the cheese one again. I think the spiced potatoes were delicious inside and the dipping sauces were so tasty!!!

I also got a mango lassi on the side and that was really delicious as well. We got a Madrasi coffee before we left and that also a highlight of our visit!!

We will for sure be back and can't wait to eat this again!!!"}

{"text":"The food is GOOD , price is ok ....

I  have  had  Masala  Dosa , Vada combos , etc.

Service is also good , not  perfect  , though  !

If  you  order  multiple  dishes , make sure  you

because  they  don't  bring  any  spoons/forks  with  

your  second  dish. 

 And it  gets very hot  , no fans , NO A/C ,

 so  after  sometime  you  just  want  to  run  away. 

Basically  there's  no  air  circulation  inside. 

Even  in  winter  , the  place  feels  muggy. 

I  have  been  there  4  times  over  a  couple 

 of  months  , nothing  has  changed  .

They  don't  even  open  their  doors  @  the 

time  mentioned."}
{"text":"Godavari is my favorite south indian place for Dosa, idli and vada. The closest tasting to anything back home . 
Loved the chutneys and sambar too. Decent service great food.
Going back there to try the Thali."}
{"text":"First time trying South Indian food, and I was very impressed! The restaurant is in a cozy house, so you feel like you're having family dinner in someone's home. 

Ordered a bunch of appetizers to split with friends. They each came with four sauces that were delicious and packed with flavour. The tomato one was by far our favourite.

I had the paper masala dosa and it was delicious. Like a thin and crispy crepe, coated with melted butter, and filled with a spiced potato mixture. The first few bites were like a dream. My only complaint is that the ghee (clarified butter) started to feel very heavy as the dish cooled.

Would definitely come back to try more things!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Dosa place in Toronto. They make awesome Dosa. These people run successful chain in India,  Singapore and other countries and now they are expanding it to Canada. 
They really take pride in serving freshly made Sambaar and chutneys. 
They have many types of Dosas and they all are different and tasty. Make sure you tell them spice level."}
{"text":"Argh. Alright, Godavari took over one of my fav restaurants in Mississauga (Cherry Hill House). While sad at that, I was hoping for something good, heard some great reviews. First the ambiance, yes I'm a little biased as I recall the gorgeous, warm inviting interior of it previously, but the place now is \"utilitarian\". Bland colors. Mauve color on the fireplace with a blue hue throughout...Not inviting by a long shot. The service, amateurs possibly fam, but not great, but no complaints. Still they were smiling, everything came on time, together! which itself is a big plus. Saves them from the dreaded 1Star. 

But as in all cases in all boils down to the food. It was sub par unfortunately. I've lived in South India for a part, so have tried a few things. First an foremost, the Sambhar was off. Just off. It was spicy, which is good, but just didn't hit the mark. Considering that's one of the, if not the most important item, that wasn't good. The idlis again same, the vada's were hard. The plain dosa's were frankly bland. The chutney's were left on the plate. 3/4 were not edible enough to even be called that. The onion uttapam (Rice/Lentil pancake topped with spices and onions), was bland, hard. and not crispy. 

The spiced spinach and gram balls were actually nice, as was the Andra Dosa (Crispy rice and lentil crepe stuffed with spinach, tomato and yellow lentils). The only issue, I had with my dosa as per say, was just the sheer level of oil that layered it. Too much. Fantastic filter coffee. (thank fully). Wasn't that busy, not that it is an excuse for bad food, but i wanted to point it out anyway.  Nit a place I would visit again. There are better ones."}
{"text":"The food was decent. I got some complimentary soup with some sort of inedible green vegetables inside. Literally...you could NOT chew them. Why are they in the soup?
On top of that...the price is ridiculous. Do they hate vegetarians, so they opened a vegetarian restaurant to charge them more for LESS food? For real, I spent over $20 and was still hungry in the end. 
Also, their curries are so watery. Like you can't even use the crepe to eat it, because it just ripped through the crepe. It's really not worth the price. I guess if you're a vegetarian and you have money to blow or don't eat a lot...this is a good indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Overall, it's a 3.5*.  Again, I've never had \"terrible\" dosa per se, so I'm not really sure what that entails - greasy, soggy, unflavourful?  Sometimes greasy, never soggy nor bland!

Atmosphere
Restaurant IS located inside a century home.  There are stories that it is haunted, but it's definitely a cursed spot because no business there, usually a restaurant, ever seems to last that long!  Entrance is around the back, near a small pho place, so park as close as possible to that area.  Be careful around the property because it seems as though some of the flagstone steps are crumbling.

As it's located inside a house, it is set-up more like an inn with different rooms, washrooms on the upper level, a reception desk that's separate from the dining rooms, etc.  A bit unusual.

Service
Warning:  They may *not* honour your Yelp check-in offer of a free coffee/dessert with a minimum of $25!  I showed it to the server and he said that that was for the previous location, he said he would ask his manager, and he said he would take it.  I was dining with a friend and he brought us 1 chai.

Due to the weird set-up, I kept on seeing the server's head pop into the dining room, quite often to see if we needed anything.  He did check-in a bit too often, but again, I think it's due to the dining room being cut-off from the reception area.

Server was very nice though.

Food
The idli/vadas were good and no complaints about the dosas.  My friend, who is Indian, said that she liked the sambar.  

I've been to Guru's and a coupla other places, so I think the food is on-par.  The chutneys that they offer here are a bit different.  They had a roasted peanut and a ginger chutney which I've never had in other dosa places.  So they were interesting.

Overall, no complaints, but the area/setting is a bit odd, but once you get over that, it's fine!"}
{"text":"In short- Awesome & Outstanding Andhra food with horrible service.

I love South Indian Cuisine, and Godavari has really authentic Andhra cuisine and they serve top notch food. But the service here is pathetic and that would be the reason, that even after have such an exceptional food they are not popular. The servers are not efficient and inattentive, they purposely ignore you, and there is not manager present at sight. Its a BYOW and their portions are large."}
{"text":"I lived in South India for 6 years before I moved to Canada. So I know my South Indian food. I loved that a new South Indian restaurant that focus on food from Andhra Pradesh (a South Indian state) opened in Brampton. It is pure vegetarian.

The space is huge. We went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. I got the poori and potatoes. I was not a fan of the potatoes but the poori was really good. It was light and not greasy. My sis in law got the vaangi baath (rice with eggplant). She liked it and loved the ginger chutney that came with it. My dad had a thaali and it was way too much food!

I liked the food. I wouldn't say it was excellent but it was good. I will definitely go back and try more dishes. Their filter coffee is one of the best I have had!"}
{"text":"Overall, the food is quite good. However, they messed up one of our orders even after telling them that we are vegan - they didn't bother to tell us that they cook Upma in ghee. 
We started off with Idli Sambhar which was really great. Idli was melt in the mouth. Instead of coconut chutney, they served peanut chutney and ginger chutney. Peanut chutney was really amazing. Ginger chutney not so great - way too hot. Sambhar was okay.  We also went for Rasam Vada which were amazing. Vada very soft. Rasam had a good heat. 
For the mains, we went for Andhra Special dosa and Upma Pesaretty. Andhra special dosa was good. Nothing great, no wow factor. Decent enough. Upma Pesarettu was okay. They didn't bother to tell that Upma is in ghee even after we confirmed several times about the use of dairy. We did order desserts but it was taking eternity, so we had to cancel the order.  
Overall, the service was okay. It looked like a house turned into a restaurant. No South Indian or for that matter, any other type of ambiance"}
{"text":"Indian food in a haunted house? Count me in!

They told us the location had just been open now for 6 months and used to be in Brampton before.
The dosas were so delicious and came to the table so quick I blinked once and it was ready! 
The top of the restaurant is vegetarian and the lower level serves meat- really thoughtful for those vegans and vegetarians!
The servers were very nice.
Clean and had a creepy vibe to it!
Not fancy.
Built on top of an Indian Burial ground and apparently haunted !! I've came here before when it was a small bar and i was told ghost stories by the staff who used to work here! 
We ordered the coffee and OMG - AMAZING!!

Will definitely be coming back! 
Very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"This restaurant has positioned itself as a South Indian one primarily Andhra Cuisine. The food is actually quite fresh and tasty, however what is most important is the chutnies and sambhar which do not make the grade. The mint one is too watered down and lacks flavour. The coconut one is watered down and sweet and the garlic one has too strong of raw garlic flavor and also is sweet. Do not know what the other chutney was intended to represent. The sambhar too lacked flavour and is too little. Most places sever it in a bowl.

In Brampton the price point is very important and these guys tend to be on the expensive side."}
{"text":"This review is for Godavari at Silver creek Blvd Mississauga.
Worst South Indian food we've ever tasted in Toronto.
Went for lunch on a weekend. First ordered Sambar vada. Couldn't cut the vada using fork n spoon. So hard. Mini meals is not sufficient for one person, that too not a South Indian meal. They gave one roti , little dhaal, one curry, little bit of rice, little yoghurt and Kesari. The server warned us while keeping the plate that there's no refill. For an Andhra restaurant it is a basic expectation that a pickle should be there in the meal. That was also not there. I ordered for an onion Oothappam. The server said it will take 20-25 minutes. I said it's ok bcoz I know how an oothappam is prepared. The onions layer have to get really crisp and batter should be cooked on a low flame to get that. After 25 minutes , there comes a so called oothappam , half cooked and not even one piece of onion was crispy. Then I told the server that the oothappam is not cooked properly. He offered me an replacement, so I ordered for a plain dosa. Any south Indian cook cannot go wrong on a plain dosa. But to my surprise n shock, I got a tasteless dosa exactly like an appalam/papad. 
Highly disappointed, wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Specially if you are a South Indian , disappointment guaranteed."}
{"text":"Everything here tastes like Mom made Home dishes.All the chutneys are yummy :)

Great Ambience. Must visit if you are a south Indian tiffins fan."}
{"text":"First time here. Located in the downtown part of Brampton, it appears they took over an earlier restaurant, since the interior decor appears different in style to the cuisine served here. What is the signature in their food prep is the extra influence of Andhra region, in the dishes served there. In that part of India, they tend to add a little of what I fondly call 'gun powder', which is a special mix of local spices, a bit coarse, flaming red & orange in color (not too hot) but yes, makes you drink a lot more water later (slow burn). 

Anticipating this, we shared the 'Dahi Vada' appetizer. This is pair of crisp lentil batter based large fritters ('Vada') in a dougnut shaped, soaked in whipped yoghurt ('Dahi'). They serve a lovely ginger based chutney on the side (this turned out to be my absolute favorite condiment! Highly recommended, works with just about anything). You can order this salty (my choice) or sweet, which also works quite well, thus it can satisfy any palate out there.

The second appetizer we did was 'Aloo Bonda'. This is also a pair of spiced boiled potato, mixed in with little salt and maybe a few spices, and then dipped in a thick batter made out of chick peas and deep fried. It is a very decent sized, which is good as the batter is usually thick and so had the right proportions vis-a-vis the potato, which allowed one to enjoy the taste inside. Of course, I was equally delighted that this was accompanied by my favorite ginger chutney/paste.

For the main course, I noticed they had a different type of 'Dosa' (a very thin and super crispy rice or semolina based crepe). They called it 'Pesarattu', in which they use green lentils inside of the usual yellow or other lentils. Locally known as 'moong daal'. Being the adventurous type, I of course ordered the 'Karampodi Pesarattu', in which they layer the inside of the crepe with the 'gun powder' dry spice mix. This came with 'Sambhar', also spelt sambar, a rich aromatic lentil-based vegetable stew or chowder based on a broth made with tamarind; and 4 other chutneys: tomato, coriander/cilantro, coconut and of course once again ginger chutney! Overall this was good, although they were rather generous with the dry spice powder inside the 'Dosa'. The 'Sambhar' was OK, could have been better prepared, but overall not bad.

My friend ordered the Masala (mixture of other spices) Rava Dosa, this is made from semolina inside of rice batter. I noticed they had a couple of variations in this category. I sampled a bit of his entree and it was equally tasty.

To top this all of and re-settle over palate, one should finish off with Madras Coffee, which is simply described as 'coffee' on the menu. This is super piping hot and prepared with milk and a bit of froth on top. careful as this is served in a  steel tumbler and has a dash of chicory in it, so that is what gives it the unique aroma and flavor.

Next time I will try the 'Thali' (literally plate) which is a combo meal, ie. a little bit of everything. Or the Chapatti (baked light flatbread)/Poori (puffed fried bread), combos. This seemed to be popular at many of the neighboring tables. I also noticed they had a few unique kids specials too, so will bring along the younger food critics next time. The interior could use a little more light and freshening up, they do have lots of tables and space and bonus of free 1 hour parking on the side."}
