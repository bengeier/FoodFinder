{"text":"The food is good, but expensive because everything is a la carte.  My son ordered a lafa wrap, which cost $13, and did not come with any side dishes.  My falafel tasted very good, but was mushy. Again, there were no sides.  I ordered a bottle of Coke, which was a small bottle and just barely filled one cup.   Lunch for two people cost $28, which I think is a lot for 2 wraps & 2 soft drinks."}
{"text":"While the menu was not extensive on the night we ate, our experience at Paprika was  fantastic! The food: Excellent. The Staff: Hard working and attentive. The owner: Very Friendly and Cordial. 

We had a large party of over ten people, and while I wish there had been a bit more available on the menu the night we came, our experience was very pleasant. They even gave us a free plate of food after they made mistake on one of our orders. 

I highly recommend this gem of a restaurant and it's kosher! We will be back next time we come to Phoenix again."}
{"text":"This place and Mozart are TOP QUALITY... the grilled chicken was the best I've ever tasted around the world.  Shawarma was done very well also.  I'd say the hummus was meh...  Pita is extra thick and fluffy.  Also, the young boy working there was sooo friendly and helpful.  I will be a regular here and Mozart."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Can't wait to come back! Chicken shawarma is juicy and seasoned to perfection.  Falafel, schnitzel, beef kabobs, were so great.  Sides r tasty! We feel like we r in Israel. The owner and his son are very charming!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They're very helpful, they will custom make a made to order meal for you,  the food is delicious and the portions are ample."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for this type of food and based on reviews we decided to try this spot. When we pulled up we realized it was owned by the same people who own Mozarts (which I like), but the food here wasn't comparable.

Based on the cashier's recommendations, we tried the chicken schwarma pita and the plate version. We also ordered a side of fries. As soon as we got home and opened up our meal we realized the fries were raw potatoes soaked in oil which we ended up throwing away. How do you screw up fries!? The schwarma was even worse. The chicken was super greasy, over cooked and not very tasty. The plate came with no veggies and was literally an expensive pile of meat. 

The meal was very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Paprika absolutely rocks. The shawarma is incredible, especially with a bit of shug over it.. and on the hummus. Plenty of food if you order a plate. Order a lafa and you will need to split it. Kosher, so the quality is extremely high. And the pricing is dead on, as well. Just a little bit northwest of the Scottsdale/Shea intersection, you cannot go wrong with Paprika. Haven't tried the ribeye, but it looked fantastic. Israeli salad, eggplant, baba ghanoush are all here. You should be too!"}
{"text":"The chicken shwarma was moist however, the Lafa portion is too large for one person. The falafel taste was great but the batch was slightly over-fried. However, this place is good for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Ok I'm kind of obsessed with this place! Their food is fresh & tasteful! The chicken shawarma is tender & moist!! Hummus is clearly freshly made everyday! Delish! Eat here!!  Bonus: staff is extremely nice!!"}
{"text":"Lovely service.  But more than that the food was delish. Full of flavor and cooked to perfection.  Not too dry. ..some ppl make shwarma very dry but this was on point.  The rice is wonderful.  Seasoned top perfection.  Although drink choices are limited water works just fine to compliment the great food. The presentation was beautiful and really shows a chef who cares about his kitchen.  And kosher top boot so I can eat here with my grandmother and mother."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal. Very high quality, very fresh and very flavorful. Reasonably priced this place will be my go-to for a quick, healthy bite. Service reminds me of being in Israel...."}
{"text":"First visit. Saw it reviewed in the Arizona Republic and it sounded good. We enjoyed the food. The falafel platter was great and the  mixed (chicken) grill was also tasty. The babaganoush and hummus were excellent. The spicy carrot salad good but not great. The Israeli salad was what one would expect. The beverages are all nonalcoholic. This is a small place. A table of 17 which included 7 loud and not well controlled children had a major effect on the ambiance. Service was good and apologized for the disruption caused by the large group. I think we will return."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and the shawarma brings me right back to Israel! Definitely order the shawarma or falafel, both are homemade and perfectly spiced."}
{"text":"Yes this place is under new management and better than ever. Have gone back twice with my wife.  Both times we had the beef kabobs plate and shwarma plate.  They are both fantastic. The beef kabobs are made from rib eye, the best kosher cut of meat, seasoned and marinated in ethnic flavors, and cooked in a traditional method on a metal kabob over heat.  The schwarma was tender juicy and flavorful.  Sides include choice of fries or rice. We also had the beef samsa which is a pastry stuffed with seasoned ground beef and onions...very tasty!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick bite before heading out for a girls' night, and it was quite an amazing experience. They had items on their menu that I haven't really seen often, which I was thrilled with since I like places with unique items on their menu. 

Unfortunately I wasn't particularly hungry enough to get a meal all to myself (I know, shocker, right?!), but the wonderful gentlemen working there bought us an order of hummus to try out. I gotta say, as full as I was, I was eating this hummus -- it was so fresh and amazing that I couldn't help myself. 

I will absolutely be back to try their other menu items... as well as get another order of that yummy hummus."}
{"text":"Friendly hole in the wall kosher meat restaurant with Russian/Central Asian flair.  Dumplings take 45 minutes but worth the wait.  Soups are good, too."}
{"text":"The shawarma tastes like turkey pastrami, not close to a delicious, fatty well-spiced shawarma.  The hummus is nowhere near a creamy, authentic hummus.  It's like an olive-flavored mortar.\", thick and pasty.  I dislike it when restaurants capitalize on being kosher and serve a significantly lower quality of food than one should receive for the price and this is a clear instance of that.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"BEST Falafel in town and great Shawarma too! 

This is  little store front, counter up front and bar stool seating.  Food ranges fro $6-8 plus sides and extras. 

I went with a Shawarma pita $8 upgraded to a lafa +$8 which included all of the salads i wanted in side. I kept it simple with shug and hummus. It Was fabulous, The flavors, the soft lafa the creamy hummus it was simply a divine experience, maybe because this place is also kosher. 

We also had a side of 4 falfel balls. They were amazing, a crisp exterior reveal a moist and flavorful interior."}
{"text":"PAPRIKA has reopened with a NEW Menu, New Staff and New Decor and still under the same ownership. The New Menu is different and features some Uzbek Russian Style Foods. I prefer the new decor it's much more roomy with only 6 tables and the counter is gone.

We tried the fresh baked to order Lepeshka Bread. A short time after ordering the bread a Hot piping fresh bread comes out to us. 

We shared a beef Calzone/Samsa. It was baked dough stuffed with tasty marinated beef and onions. They served it with a slightly spicy tomato sauce. This was very good.

I had the Chicken Kebob Plate. The Chicken was outstanding. Plump Juicy Flavorful Chicken with seasonings and tasty fresh dill and onions. A variety of  salads were on my plate and an enormous pile of very fluffy rice and maybe the best pita bread you can get anywhere.

My husband tried the Chicken Shawarma. The plate was set up the same way. I do have to be honest and tell you the Chicken Shawarma didn't seem like the chicken shawarma I had before here. It was very tasty but was on the dry side and wasn't nearly as good as the Chicken Kebob to me.

My old favorites from Paprika are gone but I think I can get them most of them next door at Mozart.

 Now I get to try new things I never had before. After watching other people I noticed many people ordering the soups and adding a condiment to it. I will try that next time.

Something new and different.

Portions were very large and I took most of the bread and half the food home.

Service was very good."}
{"text":"Solid Israeli fare. The schnitzel is very crispy and therefore GOOD.  Two main gripes:

1. No Doc Brown soda(s)
2. No pickled turnips

Enjoy."}
{"text":"More than disappointed... especially after the glowing reviews. 

I went in for lunch on a Friday with my family, simply desiring a sit down lunch for my children which didn't involve French fries. The lunch menu was quite simple-only five chicken selections with your choice of various side dishes.  

First I ordered the Shwarma... \"Sorry, we are out of that\" was the reply.  I reviewed the menu options and tried again, asking for the Kebobs. Only to be told, \"we are out of that too\". The cashier was apologetic and explained that they would be closed tomorrow, however I found it odd that they would not have nearly half of their small selection. I settled on a different chicken plate and was then asked to choose my sides. 

I took a look at the sides and asked for rice. \"Sorry, we are out of rice\". Uh oh, not this again. No rice?  I am seriously considering leaving at this point, but the reviews are so good I decided to stick it out. This time I ask for a side salad. Two guesses as to the reply... yep, out of salad too. I look around the establishment and see several other tables with people-Lord only knows what they are eating (since nothing in the menu is available)! The only options left are fries (exactly what I wanted to avoid) and Israeli salad, so I order that. 

My total for two lunch plates and two drinks, a whopping $32.  I couldn't believe it. Definitely more expensive than expected. 

Also, when I sat down there were no high chairs to sit my daughter. Oh well, I should have expected that one. The food that came out was not bad, but my experience had already been soured at this point. The food wasn't good enough to redeem the experience. 

I honestly can't understand why this place is rated so highly. There are far too many wonderful options in Scottsdale to waste your money here. Sorry."}
{"text":"Under new management. The place functions as a kosher meat restaurant. The food is good. Very courteous service. Give the customer a VIP ratio you really feel good atmosphere belongs personal attention. The food is good. Everything is fresh and attractive prices

Very recommended the ribeye stake shish kabob
The rice / salad / hummus/ chicken shawarma..."}
{"text":"Now called Paprika. This place is GOD awe-full. The menu is bare with no real anything. The place was filled with people praying and a very non-restaurant atmosphere. The food tasted old and the meat was simply terrible. DO NOT GO under any circumstance."}
{"text":"Worst food ever!! We ordered food to take out from this place based on the reviews.Obviously people who liked this food haven't tasted a real mediterranean food in their life..the chicken shawerrma is not even shawerrma it's just tasteless fried chicken. The hummus is nothing close to hummus in taste no flavor at all.even the fries and salad were tasteless. No flavor not even salt!!"}
{"text":"A coworker of mine often brings people here, so another coworker and I decided to try it for lunch a few weeks ago. It's a small little shop with a couple of tables inside, but there was no wait and we perused their menu deciding on what to get. They have a pretty small menu but I liked everything on it which made the choice a little difficult, but I decided on the chicken kabob platter with hummus and fries. My plate didn't come with the stated pita for the hummus but I didn't want to say anything so I kept hush, but the hummus was really good. I also really liked the chicken and it looks like they hand cut their fries (or at least they look like how it does when I make homemade fries). My coworker had the pita and she really liked it. She also got their hot sauce (not the bottle, they have a salsa type sauce) and she really liked it - said it was super hot. They don't have any alcohol (if you're looking forward to it with your meal), but I'd definitely return. We stopped into their cafe/bakery next for and their cookies look really good but we didn't end up taking anything home."}
{"text":"Very very small and tucked away but big flavors here. I had the chicken schwarma plate and the meat was marinated excellently and was cooked to perfection. I also had a side of the isreali salad (as us persians call it, shirazi salad) and it was also very fresh and well made. My only gripe was how pricey this was. My chicken schwarma plate with a drink and a side ran me $15.00. That is a pricey lunch. tl;dr: friendly staff, tasty food, $$ meal."}
{"text":"just an update: The spicy sauce is a Yemenite sauce that is popular in Israel, made of jalapeno paste, garlic, and about 400 other things, giving it a rolling wave of different flavors and episodes of heat, from the time it hits your tongue to the time it glides down your throat. It elevates an already spectacular shawarma to the level of high art."}
{"text":"FYI- Under new management - it's reopen

It was great before, and it's great now! Good kosher food, pita is tasty, and the meat is great. I'd recommend it, I go with my roommates."}
{"text":"Very good and run by great people from Israel. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Of all my restaurant experiences, the one today at Paprika sums it up as the most welcoming, friendly and warmest of all. Never having been here before, I thought I would venture out of my usual comfort zone and try this little tucked away Mediterranean bistro on the west side of Mercer lane in Scottsdale...

As I walked in the door, I was promptly greeted with a warm \"Welcome\" by Ari , also my soon to be server. As soon as I was seated, Ari asked if I had been there  before and also offered a quick overview of the menu. I zoomed in on the shawarma, which can be either served on a pita or on a lafa which makes the shawarma look more like a burrito.

For $ 9.95, trust me that you will be getting plenty of food and definitely enough for you to take home or even share. Today's shawarma special was veal and it was absolutely succulent and just perfectly spicy. Alongside the meat is out of this world hummus, Israeli salad, and served with French fries or a substitute if you prefer. Never having had a falafel, I told my kind server and he happily agreed to let me try a complimentary sample, which I thought was awfully kind.

I could not believe the size of the shawarma...it was truly unbelievable and bustling with nothing but fresh ingredients and just lick to the bone deliciousness. While enjoying my meal, I had the pleasure of meeting Gabi the owner who was just incredibly kind, friendly and warm just like any other restaurant owner should be.....truly outstanding in every respect.

For hours thereafter....my spirits were uplifted as a result of enjoying some of the purest and freshest tasting shawarmas I had ever had in my entire years of living....

Thank you for such wonderful hospitality..."}
