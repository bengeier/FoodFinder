{"text":"Came here with the family and almost  everything we had was bad!! French onion soup, nachos, chili was very bad. Wings were good that's it!"}
{"text":"Had lunch yesterday with my 11 year old grandson while visiting Cleveland Aquarium ...everything ok but just that-ok Irish pub...I had southwest corn chowder that was spicy good but boring. Grandson had nachos, which has great cheese and average salsa.  I thought draft beer choices were limited for an Irish pub. I had the shephard' s pie. Ground lamb was bland, and topped with shredded cheese, so dish did not seem authentic, like we have had at the Pilot House in Kingston, ON.  Old brick building very cool, with outdoor seating. Service was great.  Pricing fair."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and started with the house made root beer.  The kids loved it.   The fish tacos were a good size for lunch and very tasty.   The prime rib sandwich melted in your mouth, I would put their sandwich meat above any that I have had in recent years.   My wife got the corned beef and it was delicious as well."}
{"text":"Not a good experience at all. The food was decent but the service was terrible. The service was incredibly slow, the waitress very rarely checked on us, did not inform us that she could not separate the check for our group and then they were unable to give us change for our group because the cash drawer wasn't working."}
{"text":"Wow was the food amazing!  We called in a to-go order while watching the regatta on the river.  The lady was very friendly.  We had fish and chips- completely amazing!! Huge portion, perfectly crunchy on the outside and flaky inside. We also had pierogies which were also amazing!!! Definitely homemade.  I'm ruined forever with the frozen kind! My son had Mac n cheese which was also homemade.  Yum! Even the fries were fresh cut and they didn't forget the malt vinegar in the bag.  I wish I didn't live two hours away because it was really really delicious. Fair prices too."}
{"text":"To be fair I go to see a musician who I like a lot.  We arrived about 645pm and it was packed.  we were nearly refused seating because we did not have a reservation but the friend we were meeting was known so we were seated.    We ordered a couple of beers and when the server came back we placed our order.  While we were waiting 3 other tables were seated near us.  45 minutes later we still had not gotten our food although the 3 groups that came in after us were eating within a half an hour of arrival.    We asked were the food was and were told there were problems in the kitchen.  But I guess the problems did not extend to the 3 other tables who were waited on by a different server and got their food.  When the food finally came my bangers and mash were missing their signature gravy and the steamed vegetables were raw.  I was advised they were out of gravy.  She kept pushing the pasta on me but was not getting that I really didn't want pasta despite telling her this twice.  I then ordered French Onion soup.  I had it before and it was OK.  By this point it was nearly 815, and I was getting ill from not eating.  The soup arrived and it was black.  it was pretty clear that it had been sitting all night boiling away.  It was salty and burned.  Honestly they should be ashamed for serving such a thing.  I was planning on sending that back too but the server disappeared and didn't come back to the table until my friend arrived at 920.  I ended up walking over the the gas station and buying a pack of crackers to keep from getting sick.  Terrible terrible place."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! I came here a few months ago with my parents, who wanted a low key restaurant with good, reasonably priced food instead of the typical restaurants you would find in the nearby area, the Warehouse District. We came on a Saturday in the afternoon and there were only a few patrons. Our server was knowledgable about the menu and the surrounding area. The clam chowder soup and the fish and chips were delicious! The burgers were also good! I (and my parents do too, although they are from out of state) plan on returning!"}
{"text":"Ate there Monday, Dec 17th.  Husband ordered ribs...OMG!  Delightful!  The onion rings were amazing!  Burger was good, not great.  Loved the pasta salad!  Sodas are $2.50, a bit high, ber was cheaper.  Service was good, friendly, quick with the refills.  Will I return?  You betcha, only I will come with friends, place is good enough to share the love."}
{"text":"Was at the Winter Warmer at Windows on the River with my co-workers and spouses/friends.   The event was winding down and we decided that we wanted to grab some food and drinks. We called up Flat Iron and let them know that we had 16 people and asked if they would take a reservation. Not only did they accommodate our large party request on short notice, but they opened the upstairs level and pretty much gave us our own private room!!  The service was great and everyone enjoyed the different dinners that they each had. Overall it was a great experience and I look forward to doing it again soon!"}
{"text":"I came here recently for lunch and it seemed that they were understaffed for a lunch rush. We didn't see our waitress for quite sometime after getting our waters. The menu has a good selection of food and they always have daily specials. I ordered the french onion soup which was good and you could tell it was homemade. I also got a chicken wrap but there wasn't much flavor to it which was a bummer because I felt like it was something I could make at home. The space definitely has the Irish feel and they have a good size party space upstairs."}
{"text":"This small bar in the flats has great pub grub. It is a nice place to grab lunch if you are in the downtown area."}
{"text":"I came here to watch a football game before going to the Indians watch party at the stadium.  We were seated at our table for a while ordering drinks and food and the waitress was great.  We had beers and ordered the nachos as an appetizer.  The nachos were pretty basic but exactly as advertised.  I ordered a French onion soup and house salad for my mail.  Again, the salad was pretty basic but exactly as advertised.  The soup was delicious, flavorful and cheesy, but it was served more room temperature than hot.  Others at the table ordered wings, a Ruben sandwich, and chicken paprikash (the nights special) and everyone seemed pleased with their order.  All in all a great place for beers, bar food, and watching sporting events."}
{"text":"Great Irish Pub for lunch.  Very yummy chili and great fish & chips.  The beer is always cold, the servers always friendly, and the decor is cool.  Parking is metered outside."}
{"text":"Come on, Flat Iron! You lost two stars! We went with 15 coworkers. We had a reservation and scheduled the transport. They picked us up and the driver was nice. They seated us at two tables. One table got their order taken in a timely manner. The other waited...and waited...and waited... There was a disagreement over who was in charge of our table. It was an hour before we got our food. The other table was already finished with their meal before we got our... It was completely unacceptable. This is a favorite among our coworkers but we won't be returning again. One coworker felt her French onion soup was terribly watered down and didn't finish it... Ew."}
{"text":"As someone who just recently moved to Cleveland, this was the first place I went to as it is a block away from where I live. I walked in and instantly loved it. The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming, telling me all of the things I need to see and do as the new guy in town. It really shows that they appreciate their customers when they take the extra time to make you feel welcome.   As a huge fan of Irish pubs and restaurants, the Flat iron is one of the best I have been to. Although it doesn't have the traditional Irish pub style, you know you're in an old-school American Irish pub, which I really like. There is always a game on TV, whether its one of the major sports, or an international game of rugby or Australian rules football. There is always something interesting to watch. The jukebox is always on unless there is a big game for one of the Cleveland teams. Definitely a great place to hang out with your friends after work or before a game.  They also provide a shuttle service to all of the home games for the Browns, Indians, or Cavaliers. The only requirement is to spend $8 at the bar, and who doesn't spend at least that before going to a game?! The shuttle service runs an hour before the game and picks patrons up when the games are over. It is really convenient, helps you avoid traffic, and prevents you from having to worry about driving so you can really enjoy the game.   The food at the Flat Iron is great. I have tried most of the items on the menu, and have never been disappointed. The first thing I ever ordered was the wings. As someone from Upstate NY, my expectations weren't very high, but they ended up being some of the best wings I have had. They are big, breaded wonderfully, and the sauces are great. The Iron Sauce is a hot, barbecue and if you want to taste it after your done eating, it leaves the flavor on your lips, which is great since it tastes delicious. The Irish dishes are amazing. The Shepherds Pie and corned beef are great. They have a great burger selection (I recommend the cajun or black and bleu burger). There are always specials and they don't constantly repeat the same ones.   I definitely recommend the oldest Irish bar in Cleveland to anyone. If you happen to stop in, odds are I will probably be there!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  A consistent, reliable Cleveland mainstay.    Nothing fancy here, just a great place for a bite or a drink.  The staff are always knowledgeable and treat you well.  The food and drink are consistent and always enjoyable.  The atmosphere is inviting in a time-honored way.   The room upstairs is a great place for a reunion.  This place has been around a long time.  Establishments have come and gone in the surrounding buildings.  I hope the Flat Iron will be around for a long time to come."}
{"text":"I've been past the Flat Iron many times, mostly to pick up my wife after events down there.   The other day, we stopped in and I was really impressed. Now, mind you, this was a week day afternoon, so there were no crowds, no craziness, just a warm afternoon by the river, and I was glad, because I got to sample the hospitality and warmth of this Cleveland institution.    The sandwiches and wraps we got were really great, as was the service and the atmosphere, which, if I didn't know better, was some pub right out of a London street. Everything is warm and woodgrain, with a touch of the Irish influence, but the menu and the alcohol selection are diverse and tasty. There's a few nearby lots for parking and also on the street, and as far as cost goes, I'd put it up there with most of the middle-end places; in other words, it won't break you to take someone special here for a bit, a brew and a bit of a getaway.   All in all, the Flat Iron DID NOT...leave me flat:)"}
{"text":"My inner evil tells me not to recommend this place and write a cranky review so that I can KEEP IT ALL TO MYSELF!  But my angel side says TELL EVERYONE SO THEY CAN SHARE THE BLISS!   The \"Flatty\" is within walking distance and Thank Goodness for that. After searching in the suburbs for that \"neighborhood Bar\" for 20+ years we finally found our place here with Dave and Ryan, the working owners!     Hubby and I love coming in and feeling at home.  No Matter what our mood, the staff always makes us happy with my Harp, Cider, Smithwicks or Guiness.   And who can say no to the daily specials? I prefer the Nacho's and wings and hubby loves the fish.  THIS IS NOT BAR FOOD PEOPLE!  This is our GO TO place and we love taking everyone here.....See you there tonight guys!"}
{"text":"Good food, good selection of beer and nice people... A good all around neighborhood pub. I normally go here when there is a sporting event of some kind to watch. They have several large TVs."}
{"text":"Small local bar/restaurant that's been in Cleveland in the Flats. Good food good beer selection.   Friendly folks the restrooms are newly remodeled.   Local fresh fish. Lake Erie perch."}
{"text":"On a typical Friday night, a few friends and I head down to see some of their live entertainment. Specifically the wonderful male nurse-turned-irish-entertainer Donal O'Shaughnessy. We sit and immediately order drinks. For me, it's my go-to Irish drink. Keep your Guinness, make mine a Smithwick's.   From there, it's time to eat, and I've got to tell you, I've never had a bad sandwich here. The Pittsburgh Primanti is a tip of the cap to Primanti Bros., of Pittsburgh, except better. The Whiskey Island Burger is heaven, topped with barbecue and bacon. The Potato Skins would have ol' Paddy devouring a plate or two in no time.  My face starts to feel warm, so, I order another Smithwick's. My head gets warm, so, I order another Smithwick's. The corners of my mouth turn upward, and my cheeks start to hurt, so, I order another Smithwicks. Only this time, I start to get a little light headed. So, I add a little whiskey to help weigh me down. And then, there's singing and I feel my voice start to get sore from shouting. So, I order another Smithwick's.  And then, I order another Smithwick's, so, I order another Smithwick's, and then I order two more.  And then to celebrate the delivery of my Smithwick's, I order a water, an aspirin and a cab.  And then I wake up in bed with a fog settling over my brain, a dull ache in my face and stomach and my cheeks sore. There's a feeling of euphoric bliss that's come over me that I'm not used to. There's a slight, dull ache in my forehead and cheeks, and I'm leafing through medical journals wondering why.  Now, I've drank Smithwick's before, no problem. I've eaten fantastic Bacon Barbecue Cheeseburgers before, no sweat. I've glugged whiskey, no issue, sang songs while drunk, cursed like a sailor, danced like an idiot, each with no problem.  My official diagnosis: I am allergic to the Flat Iron Cafe.  But, don't worry about me, friends. Medical science has the tools and technology to help keep this allergy under control: I just switch to Guinness halfway through the night and I'm good to go!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  The bartenders are wonderful.  Always remember names and very friendly.  My \"usual\" Chardonnay is pretty much waiting for me by the time my coat is off.    I absolutely LOVE their Whiskey Island burger.  I'll get it to go once in a while (even though I wish I could eat it every day!!).  They messed up my order once and accidently gave me a Mushroom and Swiss burger.  I was pretty bummed, until I took a bite and realized it was ALMOST just as delish as the Whiskey Island.    Bonus they have PhotoHunt!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I never reviewed FIC years ago. This bar has always been one of my low key favorites before a show at Jacob's Pavillion. The drinks are cheap and are served by friendly staff. Parking right across the street is 1.25$ for the night. What can get any better? Well, Flat Iron has a very cozy vibe and is never filled with flats rats, shooters people, or strip club patrons. It's one of the best kept secrets in the Flats. The food is standard. If you stick to the basics like a cheeseburger or the rueben then you'll be fine. The french fries are always served hot and crisp with a little grease (delicious grease) dripping from them. Oh and a shot of jack daniels is $3"}
{"text":"Being the oldest Irish pub in Cleveland, I had high hopes. The interior gives a nice feel with wood work/ exposed brick and the drink selection is great, but I don't think I would go there  being hungry ever again unless I wanted to eat nothing aside from bar food. I ordered the perch platter and seeing as how the menu states it has been on the menu since 1910--I expected it to be 100% perfected ( I mean, they have had over 100 years to do so) and boy was I wrong!!!! It was the worst perch I have ever had & I am a frequent perch orderer. The taste was all off and I felt like I was eating cod. Gross! I was not the only one, my fiancee could barely choke down one piece of it and we were splitting the dish. I don't know if we had a bad batch or what but not only did it not taste good, my stomach was off for the rest of the night :( Next time, I will opt for fried pickles or the french onion soup."}
{"text":"The luck 'o the Irish was with us tonight! On this day in early April we woke up to 3 inches of snow and gray skies. By 5:30pm we were taking a scenic ride down through the flats and the sun was out, the clouds were gone and the thermometer was approaching 50. And it was Friday. Score!   The Flat Iron was full of patrons but there was one table left. Score again! And it was in the corner by the window. Two more points! We noticed a band was setting up and when we found out it was Cats on Holiday, a band I've been wanting to see, we knew the luck o' the Irish was with us tonight. What a great band! And kudos to whomever controls the volume because not once did my companion and I have to strain to hear each other.   We orderd a few draughts that came to us cold and frothy and with our view of the river, a great band, and good beer, how much better could it get? Our winning streak continued with our food because I ordered the Flat Iron Burger that comes with bacon and BBQ sauce. Sure it had a million calories but boy was that puppy good! Yum! My friend got the Fish and Chips and it came to us piping hot with the batter just-right crunchy and it didn't overwhelm the taste of the fish.  He even liked the coleslaw which he usually doesn't like.   All in all, a great evening at the Flat Iron Cafe and can say without a doubt that I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, the service was alright, the atmosphere was outstanding! Went here on a Friday night with the girlfriend thinking we would grab a quick dinner with an Irish twist. Walked in, and it was VERY LOUD, live band jamming out, people singing along and they cram you in there pretty good. The place put out some very happy vibes, you could look around and just tell the different groups where here just to kick back and have a good time. Sadly I wasn't really prepared for that and only had one beer. Next time we go I'll have to get a couple more or go with a group."}
{"text":"This place has so much characters. Been around forever. Great pub. Best things on the menu- Tues's Steak special. Wed's wing special and many more. These are my favorites."}
{"text":"More than an hour for food on a Saturday night.  20 minutes for drinks.  Food was great, corn beef is worth it.  Bummed they took so long because it was delicious food"}
{"text":"Came here for French opinion soup and as you can see from the photo....where is the cheese? I said something to the person that delivered the soup and she looked at me and says \"it's in the bottom\" ooohhh-Kay.... worst and coldest bowl of French onion soup."}
{"text":"The oldest standing Irish bar in Cleveland and I had never been there? Oh, this had to change, and it had to change now.   For some reason, I wasn't expecting much from Flat Iron. Maybe it's because I used to drive past it all the time and it looked empty inside. Little did I know that this place is one of those \"Cleveland Gems\" that sticks around forever. Why? Because it's good. Simple and true.   You walk into this place and you can sense the history of the Cleveland Irish. It's covered ceiling to floor in Ireland's colors, flags, emblems, you name it. Hello, St. Patrick's Day, 365 days a year! The location lends for a pretty small space, but nothing that's bothersome. Plus, let's face it. Flat Iron is one of the only good things left in the Flats these days.  My first impression couldn't have been better. I stopped by on a Saturday afternoon after checking out the youth regatta in town. I don't think they were expecting the crowd of families that came through, since I only noticed one bartender and one server. These guys absolutely busted their asses making everyone happy. You would never know they were under-staffed. On top of that, the bartender was also serving tables and didn't skip a beat. I would have been one crabby gal if I were in his shoes, but he wore a big smile.   The food was very tasty. Typical of your Irish pub grub, but it fulfilled my craving for something artery-clogging good! In fact, everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their food too. I'd love to go back and try some other things on the menu. Honestly, you can't ever have too many places to find legitimate pub grub. Especially when it's good, simple and Irish!"}
{"text":"Oldest Irish pub in Cleveland... Nice folks working.  Amazing food!!  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Just had a small 15 yr HS reunion here last night.  I planned the entire thing from Florida, where I now live, and the team made it super easy.  We utilized the upstairs space, which was nice and intimate, but can easily accommodate way more than the 20 of us there.  The food we ordered was delicious (Italian sausage, fruit & cheese platter, chicken wings, and pizza) and we also had our own bartender who was great and she definitely fit in with all us girls.  The best part, for me, was that I didn't have to pay our bill until that night and nothing up front, which was so convenient, as I was able to collect money that night.  I will definitely frequent this bar on return trips home."}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place. Great live bands and awesome happy hour specials. They are always happy to hold any fantasy football drafts upstairs but call ahead. The menu has a good selection and the food has always been good. I say leave work at 5 & instead of sitting in traffic downtown....pull in here and have a pint or four"}
{"text":"Been here a few times since moving to the Flats. 9 out of 10 times the food was excellent. Normally I'd never order meatloaf (this is crazy good with homemade onion gravy and mashed potatoes) or shepherd's pie (made with locally sourced lamb) and both were excellent. Grilled chicken sandwich (on a grill, not flat top), wings, you can't go wrong. Seafood salad wrap? Yum. Laid back vibe and all ages here. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good peeps.  Drinks, food, band... Great place to stop in for a beverage from the summer Heat."}
{"text":"We ordered the fish plater. Fish was about 3 inches long by one half inch wide! The perch should have been thrown back in. WAY TOO SMALL!! 7 or 8 pieces and old. 21.99 for the plater. Beers and onion rings were good! Service was okay!"}
{"text":"I'm a Clevelander and this was my first time frequenting this establishment and I'm absolutely impressed! The food, the service and the atmosphere get an A+ from me!! Me and my sister split the Rib and Fries appetizer and literally got full! The flavor was amazing! The ribs were tender and well seasoned; the fries were piled up in the basket. Lastly, the Homemade Guinness Ice cream (for $3.50) was the home run! It was delicious and we'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"It gets a 5 based on the awesome pour of the black and tan!! (See pic)  As a local, I love places like this in Cleveland and while there are times tourists or neophytes may populate this place there are some seriously dedicated locals who make this bar special.  When other bar tenders come here to relax and have a beer to decompress that tells you all you need to know.  And as an example, when I ordered the black and tan the 7 other people drinking some sort of fruity shots had no idea what the bartender was pouring for me. I'm not trying to be snobby, I'm just pointing out that this place attracts a kind of eclectic crowd depending upon the day - which to me adds to the fun of this place."}
{"text":"To be honest, I didn't have super high expectations going in to Flat Iron. The reviews were good, but it just doesn't seem like it would be anything that great. However I was proven wrong! Our server was attentive and helpful with recommendations. We had a party of 6, and we ordered a ton of food, and she handled it all very well. I ordered the pirogi to share, and I kind of wish I just saved them all for myself. They were really amazing. They were not a cheap frozen product, and came with caramelized onions and sour cream. I could have eaten a ton of them. For my meal, I ordered the french dip and it was awesome. The french bread was fresh and crusty, and there was a lot of roast beef and cheese on it. The au jus was also very flavorful. I also tried a wing or two with their house sauce, and they were really good as well. The only real issue any body really had was some of the food came out a little on the cool side. This place is also kinda out of the way so I feel like it wasn't that busy when everywhere else was, which was nice. Overall a great dinner with cheap drinks and some local craft beers. I would probably go back next time I'm in Cleveland and in that area."}
{"text":"I was at Flat Iron for a game watching get-together and end up loving this place. Very inviting, has lots of history and definitely a place to go on St. Patty's day or any other day for that matter. I tried the potato skins and a off menu chicken wings. They were both very good. Best thing there though was that my black and tan was perfectly poured and rapidly consumed."}
{"text":"Flat Iron Cafe is a hidden gem! The restaurant is a decent size equipped with a full bar. My boyfriend and I dropped by on a Sunday and the restaurant was relatively empty. My boyfriend and I decided to sit at the bar and were greeted right away by the friendly bartender. She offered food recommendations, which was lobster bisque soup and Cobb salads. The lobster bisque was sooo tasty. Ahhh my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The salads were also tasty! Anywho check out Flat Iron Cafe if you're in the flats you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing Bloody Mary, fantastic onion rings, perfectly cooked burger, friendly staff. We went there before an Indians game to get the free shuttle over to the stadium. Not that great were the buffarito pirogies, too dry. Clam chowder had good flavor but it was a little thin, maybe because it was earlier in the day and hadn't thickened up yet. I would definately go back."}
{"text":"Located in the Flats, Flat Iron is the oldest Irish pub in Cleveland and has been around for over 100 years.  Now, know going into this that I'm by no means Irish or a huge drinker. But the Flat Iron has that friendly Irish vibe that makes you want to drink a beer with a stranger. In fact, it's easier to have several beers here and not know the passage of time. They also have an Indians and Browns shuttle, and will even come pick up your party at a downtown office for free for transport to them.   Flat Iron also has regular live music, which is hard not to appreciate. In general, this is a great place to hang with friends or grab a drink before a game. Every Clevelander should visit at least once! Also, try the Shepherds Pie or Bangers and Mash if you're in the market for some Irish eats."}
{"text":"Not a bad little Irish pub with friendly service. Food is typical pub grub with a decent drink selection"}
{"text":"We just moved to Cleveland and this was our first dining adventure out.  This place was recommended to us by someone and we are very happy we tried it.  I got the wings in their signature iron sauce, which was phenomenal.  Best wing sauce I think I have ever had.  Only wish you could get the wings without the breading!  My husband had a burger which he said was great as well.  Wish the French fry portions were larger, but they were excellent fresh cut fries.  We will return again soon.  Good prices and our waitress was as nice as could be."}
{"text":"One of the best kept secrets in Cleveland. You can sit on the tables outside and see the very location that started Cleveland. You can tell from the first step inside that it has been well visited through out Clevelands history. The food is really authentic to real Irish food. They also have a bus to downtown. The wait staff has usually always let our dogs sit outside with us which is great."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Half of our group's food came out cold. The wing sauce was extremely spicy although not described to me that way. I would overlook this but since everything else was bad about them it's worth mentioning. They were not crispy at all, they were cold, and they were drowning in sauce.  The breading also didn't stick well on the fried pickles or onion rings.   The ranch is good. It's homemade. The claim chowder was also pretty good. It had a thinner broth which I actually like but I do wish it had more chunks of clam and potato."}
{"text":"we were out-of-town visitors on a historic tour of the neighborhood, and this was the logical (and only visible) spot to lunch when the tour ended. It was pretty darned good!  Huge burgers in lots of varieties, good staffers too. If you're in that area (the Flats, at the swinging bridge), I recommend it."}
{"text":"I would come for the food any day, but on a sports day this place is fantastic.  Easy walk to Browns, Indians or Cavs games, or take the shuttle they offer for Browns or Cavs.  Friendly, fast service with fantastic Burgers and Fish.  Looking forward to trying more from their menu.  Had a great time there yesterday before and after a Browns game.  Keep up the great work FIC!!"}
{"text":"Good local spot that is a bit under appreciated for lunch.  I've eaten here a couple of times and wasn't disappointed in the quality of the food. I hear that they usually have a very good jambalaya on Mondays, but they were out when I arrived to sample it. I'll be sure to update the review if I ever get it.  The place was highly recommended by some trusted foodies and I can attest to the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff. Don't be fooled by the bar atmosphere. The kitchen puts out a good product."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Best wings!! It's a quaint little bar right in the heart of all the downtown excitement! One of the best parts is the door-to-stadium shuttle... love it!"}
{"text":"Come here regularly during basketball season. Typically service is slower, but still okay enough given we usually all come in once after the game. However, tonight was staggeringly understaffed. Though the bartender was clearly in the weeds, she was very pleasant. The only waitress was completely overwhelmed and not so friendly. The kitchen was incredibly slow - only one cook we were told, and whenever he came out he smelled like wacky tobacky. Food took over 40 minutes, which bartender told us when we ordered though it wasn't too terribly crowded."}
{"text":"The Flat Iron Cafe is a wonderful gem in the flats. With a myriad of drink options and an even more diverse menu. Regardless of what your craving is, The Flat Iron has it, burgers to bangers and everything in between. With its roots dating back over a hundred years, you are entering not only a landmark but also a tradition.  The bartenders are well versed in their drink repertoire. For an Irish pub they even have all the Irish whiskeys you could dream of, from special release Jameson to red bush.   I had one of their specials of the day, the Heart Attack burger, with half off burger night, a $7 burger with two grilled cheese that melts in your mouth is beyond worth it.  The vibe is fun and friendly, especially for a Monday night. Come in with an empty stomach and an open mind and leave happy and feeling more Irish than you ever knew you were. I'm"}
{"text":"This pub is so great! They have great beer options, I got a flight so I could try a bunch of their Irish beers. I also got a cup of chili which was awesome as well. My friends come all the time and get their sandwiches so I heard those are great.  BUT! The best part is every Home Cleveland Cavs game they give you a FREE shuttle to and from the arena!!! It was so perfect and saved us a lot of time and money. They pick you up right outside quickens and the owners are so nice.   Absolutely recommend stopping by here, there's parking, it's not as overpriced as bars downtown are and you can get to and from the games so easily. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Excellent beef soup, ok salad (one slice of cucumber), good perch plater for mainland. Kids: burger was pretty average, maybe even poor, but the chicken fingers were very good."}
{"text":"Just in town for a cheer competition, staying downtown there aren't many restaurants that are inexpensive and good for kids. The food is reasonably priced and the burgers, onion rings and clam chowder were delicious. They had live music and he was pretty good. Food comes quickly and the wait staff is very attentive. Would definitely visit again"}
{"text":"The Flat Iron is one of the few surviving long-time bars or cafes in the Flats (and it's both). I don't recall it being \"Irish\" in my younger days, but it's within sight of the Potato Famine memorial (that Celtic Cross you see by the replica of the Lorenzo Carter cabin), not far from \"The Angle\" (the historic Irish settlement area), and also not far from where my Irish great-grandfather had a bar in the days before the Flat Iron existed.   The Flat Iron used to more of a classic dark, bar-like place, but now has an open, loft-ish set-up and makes a nice impression on a warm spring day, although it lacks the kind of character it once had. The clientele has always been diverse--judges, businessmen, and longshoreman in my memory and on this visit, it included bikers on Harleys, wide-eyed middle aged suburbanites who probably are amazed they don't get mugged downtown (a rare event even in the bad old days), and fratboy junior business types who probably live in nearby condos.  The service was quick. The fries were first rate (a blessing in a world where they often are not). The burgers were fine--cooked to order with good quality beef and toppings but not memorable. Looking at other reviews, I wonder why anyone would order the French onion soup (something that's often awful in actual French places) or even the wings (usually industrial chicken with supermarket sauce that reminds me why my parents' childhood poverty stigmatized wings for us).  So..not a gourmet place and one whose conventional decor may disappoint those who've heard how legendary it is, but a really a nice place for Saturday afternoon people watching and probably a good lunch spot during the week. The Guiness is on tap, so I'm sure evenings and Irish music work well here, too."}
{"text":"Not super impressed which makes me sad it's right down the street from our apartment. Onion soup so salty couldn't eat it. Hubbies burger was delicious my salad nothing to write home about. Also think waitress was having a bad night. Loved the music. I think maybe an off night. Will try again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Irish pub in Cleveland. Great good, great selection, and the friendliest staff in the city"}
{"text":"This place was just ok with us. We visited the Aquarium and were told by one of the employees that Flat Iron was the place to go for lunch. Assuming that the recommendation was a good one, we went for it. We started out with the onion rings, which were quite large, you could almost make a meal out of them. Not bad tasting, but really big, thick onions. I ordered the Cajun Burger, which was ok - prepared well, but I actually expected it to have more bite to it. They serve their sandwiches with either pasta salad or coleslaw, fries are 1.00 extra. I found this odd just because every place you go generally offers fries with the sandwich and you can get pasta salad or slaw as an add on for an additional charge. The pasta salad wasn't bad but I think fries would have been a better choice. Our waiter was really friendly and took good care of us. The atmosphere was nice too. (I really like Irish Pubs)"}
{"text":"Driver brought us here. Waited over an hour for our food. Mostly cold.  Bay leaf left in soup. Uncooked chicken . WTF   Will not be back"}
{"text":"If you love horrible service, watery pasta, and flavorless food, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This is in regards to \"renting\" the upstairs room, not the downstairs restaurant or bar.    In the past three months, two of my friends have rented out the upstairs.  It's a great open room with bright green carpeting, a dance floor, bathrooms and a bar.  The best thing about it is that you can rent it out for free, the worst thing is that all those extras add up.    We've had a DJ both times and 1 or two bartenders.  The service was great, but the food is a bit spotty.  Don't order the pizza (worst in town!) or anything not on the menu.  My one friend had a Mexican themed party and wanted a nacho bar.  They had great chips and toppings but the nacho cheese was a large salad bowl filled with cold gelatinous crap.  She'd also asked for bottle service - two bottles of Cake Vodka.  At the end of the night, expecting to pay for two $75 a bottles, she was given a $500 shot bill.  Surprise!    Overall, I think it's a great venue - especially for bachelor parties since Diamonds is right across the street.  Just know what you're ordering in terms of food and alcohol and it will be a great night!"}
{"text":"Classic Irish pub. Service was friendly and professional. French onion soup, clam chowder and onion rings were all excellent - as good as we've had anywhere and the soups were both served in crocks thar kept them nice and warm. The best, most diverse beer list I've seen anywhere in a long time. With the Columbus street bridge back up you can get here quickly from anywhere on the west side."}
{"text":"I don't know if this place is open anymore - I hope so. Nice place to stop in for a beer and sandwich and it's right on the river, a short walk from the flats and not too far from the warehouse district. You can usually park across the street under the viaduct.  This is basically just a local bar so don't expect fancy. The food is good and they have many beers on tap - especially Guinness. Gets a good crowd on game days (Football, Baseball, Basketball - take your pick). shuttle service to Jacobs Field.  Go during the day and take a short walk to see the swing bridge - a really neat engineering marvel. Get lucky and watch a freighter make it's way up the Cuyahoga - they don't call it the crooked river for nothing."}
{"text":"First time visit at the Flat Iron was for lunch.  Ordered pirogies, perch plate, steak salad for dine in and a corned beef sandwich to go.  All of dine in choices were okay, nothing really stood out as great.The sandwich to go was probably the winning choice.  Really good quality corned beef.   Anyway, I would try them out again to see if maybe it was just an off day in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I have been coming to the FIC for YEARS.  They are one of the few remaining establishments from the glory days of the Flats.   The food is good, the bartenders fun, the atmosphere 100% Cleveland, and the beer cold.  What more could you ask for??"}
{"text":"The Cleveland Primanti = freaking fantastic! Corned beef, coleslaw and fries toasted in sand which heaven! Yes! It sounds weird as hell, but it's fantastic! It came with their beer battered onion rings? Layers of tasty onions with a beer batter, I tasted the pale ale they used and my taste buds danced so hard, i wanted to make it rain.   Angel's Lake Perch Sandwich = the best perch I've had in a very long time! Probably the best perch i have had anywhere! It's breaded in some sort of corn meal breading and it's light and fluffy!   The sandwiches came with home made coleslaw, a perfect blend of creamy and cabbage. Wasn't really sweet and not overpowering. It was pretty refreshing!   They have a great selection of beers and spirits, of which i did not take part. However, when i come back, I'll definitely try a Great Lakes brew!   CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!!!!"}
