{"text":"Generally the food was very good. But the service just ruined the night for us.  Slow, slow and a bit of slow to go along with that slow on the side.  

When we arrived there wasn't room for 5 of us on the patio.  There was a table of 4 open, and a table for 5 with 2 people at it.  The waitress was of no help.  Left us standing there trying to figure out if we wanted to go inside or not.  So we nicely asked the 2 men if they would move, as their food had not yet arrived.  This was fine with them.  So we settled in and began to discuss the menu and what to do when our 6th friend arrived.  This was about quarter to 8.   We told her we had a 6th coming and she mentioned maybe we better steal a chair from another table while we could.  When my hubbie arrived he perched himself on the window sill temporarily.  She came took his drink order and then returned with his drink without asking him if he might want a chair.  We asked if we could get a chair for him. She looked around and wasn't sure what to suggest.  We asked if we could snag one of the extra chairs from the table for 4 where the 2 men were sitting. She said no that it was reserved for later.   She then offered to look inside for a chair.  Finally problem solved. 

My hubbie asked if there was any non-alcoholic beer. She said she'd check if they had any.  Then came back with an open one.  It happened to be an O'Doul's.  The one my hubbie really doesn't like.  Oh!  Hubbie took a sip and decided he would just suck it up and drink it.  Seemed logical to me to come by and say what they had and check if he wanted it or not.  Not just bring him one.  It really isn't like ordering a coke and getting a pepsi.  And I'msure she would not have done that if someone had asked what they had on tap and she had to check.  

Anyways, I won't bore everyone further with the blow by blow on how it took us until about 9:30 to get our meal.  She didn't come back to see how our meal was, so my bro in law had to walk his steak back into the restaurant because it was blue rare and he had ordered medium. Was quickly fixed, but we not sure why we bothered as the rest of us were done our meals by the time it arrived.  And we were charged for all of it anyways (weren't expecting it free, but a little something to help make us feel our business was worth something).

What was good - my wild mushroom fetticini.  My hubbie's calamari.  The chicken and ribs.

Oh and they don't take interac. 

Interestingly we left to have dessert elsewhere.  We went over to Murrieta's.  Apparently they are owned by the same people. And it was like night and day.  FANTASTIC service and dessert at Murrieta's (will review separately)."}

**NOTE: Was busy and I'm just starting to upload my old reviews. This review is based on my visit in Jan. 2011**

After finding out Rose Garden Thai was closed my friends and I proceeded to go to Tribune pub a couple buildings down for lunch. My first impressions was that I thought Tribune was going to be pretty pricey because of its classy decor, but after looking at the menu the prices were quite reasonable for being on Stephen Ave and for what you're getting and the quality is justifiable. It's about $15-$18 for sandwich and pasta dishes and around $25 for steak. The drinks however are pretty pricey, around $8 for a pint and a glass of wine starts at $7. Not exactly a great place for cheap drinks, but it's definitely a nice atmosphere/place to sit and catch up with old friends. 

Tribune exudes this old England feel with lovely dark brown hardwood floors and trimmings, stone walls and black cushioned chairs. We came as a group of about 8 and if it wasn't for the fact that we went on a snowy, cold weekend we probably wouldn't have been able to get a big enough table. They have a lot of small individual tables and bar tables scattered around; not too big of a place despite it having two floors. Right when you walk in you see this majestic -like bar smack in the middle.

Our server was super friendly and made several good recommndations for food and wine. I ordered their lunch special which was a Philly cheese steak ($15) with a choice of fries, salad or soup. My meal was very tasty with big/decent portions of flavorful meat, a little dry but I still enjoyed it with my wine. Everyone else enjoyed their meals and it all looked appetizing. 

Overall, I enjoyed my experience here and I suggest a visit if you don't mind spending a bit of money for good drinks and food."}
{"text":"I've only been to Tribune the once, and it was on an expense account. I mention this because while I enjoyed the food a lot, I peeked at the bill upon leaving and nearly had a heart attack. It wasn't THAT good, and I'm not really into selling my first child for a decent meal.

I would definitely go back on someone else's bill. As mentioned, I found the food and the wine very good. We sat downstairs which had a few benefits. The downstairs is very contemporary-cellar, and we could see their excellent selections of wine. It also doesn't seat a huge number of people, so our group of eight was able to enjoy some rousing and audible conversation. 

The food that really stood out for me were the lamb shanks, the crab cakes, and the garlic prawns. They had some really standout vintages of wines. While I can no longer remember its name, the red we had paired excellently with the food.  

The servers were helpful without being intrusive and a couple were very charming. Overall, I really enjoyed my night."}
{"text":"I had the privilege of eating at the Tribune on a business lunch.  We ate downstairs and I was surprised that the restaurant had 2 levels.  I noted the ceiling at the Tribune and admired the old ceiling.  

 We went straight to the main meal.  I had the 8 oz Steak; it came with roasted potato and vege of the day, which was bok choy - 2 pcs.  I really enjoyed my steak and the potato.  The bok choy is so-so.  Why can't they give more than 2 stems??  My business colleague ordered the Steak Frites and he really liked his meal.  It was huge!  

Dessert for me was the 2 kinds of creme brulee.  It was yummy!  My guest had the white chocolate cheesecake.  He liked it."}
{"text":"The porter style duck for two is great.  The other menu items I had were less memorable.  It's a cozy place, decent food, but nothing that stands out in my mind to want to come back to spend that kind of food. 

However, not bad to try out if you're looking for an alternative and haven't been here."}
