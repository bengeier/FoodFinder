{"text":"Great Greek and Italian restaurant! I took my in-laws from NYC to Dino's and they loved the food!"}
{"text":"Dino's has the BEST Greek salads. I'm addicted.  Super fresh ingredients. And generous with the feta. They have great customer service.  Very friendly. I like their pizza too."}
{"text":"sorry to say but looks like Dino's has gone down in quality and quantity. my family and I have been going here since they open, we like to go to locally owned places vs franchises. In the beginning food was always tasty and authentic. at best now, tastes like it is right out of a can. So disappointed. Service has always been a problem with constant turnover. Owners seem like real nice people, but can't always see what is going on with wait staff from front end. Will give them one more try, if not improved, we do have other options in the area. Please Dino's get back to your good Greek roots and gives us some tasty food!!!!"}
{"text":"Second time Dino's patron, first time Dino's reviewer. 

Service: I was really hoping the service would be a little better the 2nd time, but it wasn't.  It was actually slower because the waitress gave my order to another table. We waited about 40 minutes for our dinner. 

Food: I ordered the Gyro Pita plate. It was absolutely delicious. Perfect temp, right amount of flavorful sauce. My boyfriend ordered chicken parm. I sampled it and it was just so-so. The sauce wasn't very flavorful and the pasta seemed kind of stale. 

Atmosphere: nice little strip mall restaurant that reminds me of places you would go up north. 

Will I return? Probably not."}
{"text":"Looks like a small pizza shop but they actually have a very extensive menu including pasta dishes, burgers, and gyros.  This place is perfect if you want to avoid the traffic and long waits in the university area of Charlotte.  Everything I have had there was delicious.  The owners are very friendly good people."}
{"text":"So far I have only been here twice and may I say both times were very pleasant! The lady whom I presume owns the establishment came off as very friendly as well as welcoming, which makes for a better environment regarding any type of business. I've yet to try the pizza, but the Gyro and Calzone were delicious! The price is not too bad it's like any other restaurant, comes to about $20 for two people."}
{"text":"Service was horrible.  Food was decent, but was cold by the time it came to the table.  I have eaten here several times and the service has gotten worse over the years.  I only have an hour for lunch and it took 40 minutes to get our food after we ordered.  To make matters worse, two of the folks that ate with us ordered the special.  I would not recommend Dino's."}
{"text":"This is one of my kids absolutely favorite restaurants to eat at. Dino and Elizabeth are so sweet and wonderful and if you are lucky enough, you will get to try her baklava!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy food and the service... needed some comfort lasagna and my friend enjoyed a steak hoagie.  The service from the kitchen was fast and the food was hot!  The ladies working our table did an excellent job make sure our drinks were refilled and fresh."}
{"text":"Great visit yesterday to one of my favorite places in Harrisburg for Sunday lunch after church!  We had a calzone, a meat lover's pizza and a chicken souvlaki at our table yesterday and everything was VERY good.  I had the chicken souvlaki and the tzatziki sauce was dead on this time...YUMMO!Waitress was great and our glasses were never empty or any need unattended!  We also placed a to go order for some friends who were coming back into town and the waitress had it timed perfectly to be hot when we were ready to check out!  Great food, Great Service, Great Overall Experience!  You should really check it out :)"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to trying this place for a while and finally went last night with my husband to meet another couple there for supper.  Given the other ratings here, I was surprised at how disappointed I was at the end of the evening.  Now, admittedly we were eating there pretty late (shortly before 9:00 PM) which may have accounted for some of the issues we had, but when we arrived there were several other tables occupied so it's not like we were the only ones keeping the staff from closing.

First problem-- our server.  She was very pleasant and friendly, but she was definitely trying to rush us through supper.  We had barely touched our salads when she was bringing out the entrees.  One of our party had to consistently ask for refills on her coffee, however, and the server had to be reminded more than once of items we'd requested.  I guess I can attribute that to the fact that she may not have been very experienced (she was quite young) and maybe also somewhat tired since we were eating late.

The other problem was the food.  The so-so service would have been easier to bear if the food had been great, or even just really good.  I was underwhelmed, however.  My Greek pasta was lackluster, with no seasoning that I could identify... Garlic, where were you??? This was Greek food, after all!  The feta cheese was tasty enough, but the pasta was swimming in olive oil and tasted old-- like it had been sitting around all evening, and had been microwaved right before it was brought to me.  I salted the hell out of it to give it some flavor, and some grated parm on the table would have been welcome, but there wasn't any.  I didn't bother asking for any, either, because the ancient-tasting pasta couldn't have been helped much no matter what.

My husband ordered a favorite of his, lasagna.  It looked good, but he said it wasn't anything special.  This man LOVES lasagna in all forms and is not really picky about it, so I know it must not have been much better than my pasta.  Our friends ordered a pepperoni calzone that looked fabulous (there was definitely a LOT more crust than filling there, however) and an order of wings.  The wings also looked okay but I didn't get a chance to ask how good they were.  We finished up with the chocolate cake, which *was* delicious. 

The place is nicely decorated and in a very convenient location for us.  The owners were friendly and greeted us when we arrived, and there's a nice outdoor seating area.  The menu is extensive (but not ridiculously so) and there are lots of choices to suit almost every taste.  The prices are very reasonable, and the portions were decent.  I'd be willing to give it another try, but I'll probably have to twist my husband's arm if I want him to join me.  If I do get back there, I'll update my review.  For now, though, it really rates only two stars based on my experience last night."}
{"text":"Dinos.....you were a surprise.  Upon recommendation from my boyfriend, I tried the Harrisburg location.  He rather enjoyed the Calzone from the Afton Village digs.
   The pita bread and hummus were better than I expected.  I was mostly surprised with how good the pita bread was.  It was warm, light and fluffy unlike most other restaurants.  It definitely overshadowed the somewhat plain hummus, which wasn't bad but it was just ok.
   I ordered the Gyro for lunch and my dad ordered a Grilled chicken salad.  I was pleasantly surprised at the lack of salt added to the meat in my Gyro.  Usually, it's way to salty to stomach at most other \"Greek\" places but this was just right.  Unfortunately, it was way overloaded with Tzatziki sauce so if you order this, ask for them to go easy on it.  The grilled chicken salad was this size of a Medium pizza.  It looked pretty alright and I didn't hear any complaints so I guess I'd recommend it.  
   Service was good.  Waitress was very cheerful and attentive.
I will definitely be back for the hummus/pita bread at least."}
{"text":"If you like generous portions, attention to detail, FRESH ingredients at a reasonable price with good service you can't miss with Dinos.

Unlike many restaurants with extensive menus with only a few items being outstanding, Dino's does everything right and not just the pizza and pasta. It's much more than that. Their Greek and Traditional American menu selections are unbeatable as well!  DId I say generous portions?"}
{"text":"Awesome food, pizza is loaded with cheese and good quality toppings. Beats pizza hut anyway!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Dino's since it opened.  The owner recognizes us as \"regulars\" and always chats with us.  We have been a bit disappointed with the billing.  As vegetarians, we usually have to alter menu items.  Certain waitresses charge us $1.00 to add jalape√±os to a steak-less cheese steak.  Really?  Subbing peppers for meat costs a dollar MORE?  Seems like it should be a dollar less.  When it has been questioned at the register the owner does correct the bill to the menu price.  Consistent quality food.  Not the best Italian/Greek you've ever had, but passable for NC."}
{"text":"The food here was only mediocre. The breadsticks were pretty flavorless and over-oiled. The lasagna that my father got was just average. However, the pita bread, Greek salad, and Gyro meat that I got was fairly good. It really depends on the dish but the prices were pretty comparable to most Italian restaurants at $10 a plate or so. The place was busy but not packed nor was it really noisy."}
{"text":"This place SUX!!  Food is awful, service, which you never see the same server when you go back, is even worse than the food. To top it all, the Greek lady is rude, mean to her staff, and will overcharge you if you don't pay attention. As another person said, it's all canned food heated and served."}
{"text":"In the mood for a ridiculously large Greek salad???  Then head here!!!  This is our spot for salads- so yummy.  Excellent flavor and portion. 

My only gripe to take away a star is the price....my salad with chicken costs $13.99.  Pretty pricey for a salad at this type of restaurant.  We would go more or if was slightly less.  They also load it with feta cheese- maybe less feta would equal a lower price.  :)"}
{"text":"Love it! Have never had anything here less then really good. I have sent people here and always hear good things back. I love the pizza but had a taste of a calzone  my daughter came home with and now I may have to change my standard order. Not a fancy place but a nice clean place with great food."}
{"text":"We love Dino's!! They have a very large menu and so far everything we have tried has been great. Pizza is always a favorite but the Stromboli's are AMAZING!! They are full of toppings and lots of cheese. My husband has also tried one of the big sandwiches and he enjoyed that. The mozzarella sticks and breadsticks are also great. Dino's is a great family favorite. We
still have so many menu items to try. Servers can be hit or miss but they do a good job... For the most part."}
{"text":"The BEST place to go for pizza, and Gyros in Charlotte!   Love this place, because of the owners, Dino and Elizabeth!   Family owned and operated, and the food is excellent!  Tell them Bexx sent you next time you go!"}
{"text":"Totally becoming one of our family's favorite supper spots.  They're super nice to the kids, the food is fantastic, service is mostly pretty good, prices are fair.  I love the small-town feel and it's not a chain-woohoo!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest,  if the pizza wasn't so dang on good I probably would never frequent the place again.  Most times I think they could care less whether you're there or not.  The owner can come off as a bit cranky but I think it's all part of her warm disposition... Or I've just worn her down with my continuous patronage and she's finally decided that she can't get rid of me no matter how much she ignores me.  I think she's finally learned my name after only going there every Friday for about a year now.  I suspect they have a problem keeping employees who aren't family because on those rare times when they are fully staffed the atmosphere is pleasant.  So I'm going to say they are overworked and exhausted.  But man if you like a pizza crust that has great flavor with a bit of a chew and toppings that leave a little greasy residue (like pizza used to be before gluten,  dairy,  meat, and pretty much flavor free become all the rage) then this is the place to get it. Just don't expect them to be happy you're there giving them your hard earned money.  Heck,  I guess they think they've earned it cause they work hard too!!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. The pizza is amazing and also the Cal zones. The guy who makes these things must be a dough artist.   We have brought many friends here and left here amazed and satisfied.  I highly recommend the cal zones, will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Waitress brought out 2 meals, then forgot the other 2 dishes. Not to mention she never put in 1 dish which was a calzone for my daughter.  Chicken parm dinner was over peppered. Never will return."}
