{"text":"My absolute favourite in Montreal. Their service have always been inviting, the atmosphere laid back, and does justice to the best produce (bad talents) Quebec has to offer. Never have I found any of the dishes bland or mundane. Without loosing the \"homely\" warmth of dishes, their flavours have always stood out in their own unique \"O'Thym\" way. Not all restaurants can establish their own palate, and do it so well, but O'Thym never ceases to surprise. Although I personally prefer their winter offerings compared to summer ones, the price to quality ratio is (in my opinion) the highest in Montreal, also BYOB!"}
{"text":"Had their delicious duck tartar and foie gras. Outstanding! Beautiful presentation and friendly service. Prices are a bit higher but it is absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"Ditched friend's recommendation for another restaurant, followed all the yelpers and went to this place. It was an absolutely amazing meal. Very friendly staff. My rave about this place has been said by fellow yelpers. But I want to point it out that this place closes early on Friday (I think 6pm) and does not open for Sat. and Sun. Thank God we got to Montreal on Wed and called to make an appt for Thursday night at 7pm, the person picks up the phone and misremembered the day and thought that they are closing early next day. But I said right away tomorrow is only Thursday and he laughed and gladly made the appt for me. (I guess you can tell from my voice that I was determined to go to this place no matter what. :-))"}
{"text":"Ca c'est ce qu'on peut appeler un excellent restaurant! Ma douce m'y a invité pour ma fête. On devait être douze. Le service fut impeccable du début à la fin, malgré un si grand groupe, et la bouffe simplement parfaite. 

Bref, si vous cherchez un resto de fine cuisine, n'hésitez pas, à voir les reviews, il y a peu de chance que vous soyez décu et je confirme."}
{"text":"This tiny restaurant served one of the best meals I've ever had! Amazing. Salmon tartar, rabbit two ways . My dining companion had the duck tartar and the haddock special and we shared a platter of 4 Quebec cheeses. So good. Go. It's worth it! And don't forget to bring your own wine. 

Make reservations as the place is tiny."}
{"text":"BYOB. Always bring more than one bottle. The deer chop was amazing. First time having deer meat, but served rare and juicy. The crème brûlée dessert was rich and creamy."}
{"text":"What can I say?  This was one of the most spectacular meals I've had anywhere I've traveled.  The fact that we could share it with our kids was very special -- we shared 7 entrees (appetizers) and two desserts, plus a cheese plate.  The waitress asked us to trust her and we did and were not disappointed -- from the frois gras, to the Quebec cheeses to the sweetbreads and scallop ceviche ... all was beautifully prepared and sweet to the palate!  The interior was very modern and clean, which we all appreciated.  All in all, a hit!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Unpretentious, delicious local ingredients cooked in classic French style. The food is top notch, but bringing your own wine allows for a fabulous dinner at a much reduced price (no restaurant markup on the bottle, which is a big difference). Ambiance and service are pitch-perfect. Is it loud at times? Is it crowded at times? Maybe, but if that's what it takes to allow more people to experience this gem, so be it. I'll be back."}
{"text":"2e visite à ce charmant petit resto et toujours aussi satisfaite. 
C'est agréable et plus rare de pouvoir aller manger de la fine cuisine française et de pouvoir y apporter son vin. La nourriture est impeccable et nous avons en prime eu la surprise d'avoir un potage comme mise en bouche offerte par la maison (Citrouille, pommes et carottes quand j'y suis allé. Excellent et parfaitement de saison pour cette froide soirée de novembre.)

Côté bouffe, les 2 tartares en entrée (saumon et boeuf) sont excellents, bien que le boeuf nécessitait légèrement plus de sel, mais pas de quoi en faire tout un plat. En plat principal, le carré d'agneau avec sa purée de patates douces est un incontournable. Sa cuisson était parfaite et l'assaisonnement de la purée sublime de même que les légumes grillés en accompagnement. 

Une bonne bouffe à la hauteur des attentes, dans un décor tout à fait chaleureux autant pour une soirée en amoureux qu'en groupe."}
{"text":"This place is good but not amazing, at least not by the new 5 star standard set by Les 3 Petit Bouchons. It's also incredibly loud. We were seated at a small table by the front window and had to really raise our voices just to talk at the table - I can't imagine having been seated in the middle of the restaurant.

We shared a few starters and one main. The empanada, a seasonal special, was definitely the standout item. We also had the salmon tartare (which, to our surprise, was actually *smoked*), the trous Normand and another off-menu item, the veal in chorizo sauce. All was satisfactory, but with the slight exception of the empanada, the refined flavour combinations and certain extra special quality that sets the extraordinary apart from the simply good or above average was not there. 

No issues with the service, whatsoever."}
{"text":"The Foie Gras starter was the best I have ever had. Absolutely glorious.

I had the lamb as a main and was a bit disappointed. The sauce tasted like a good base sauce with a sprinkle too much curry powder (of all things) which had not had time to properly cook in. 

Service was excellent.  I would go back to give them a second chance for sure."}
{"text":"This was our first dinner in Montreal and we waited over an hour and half on the side walk, but the food made up for it! Service was so-so and we felt pressured to go down the street to buy a bottle of wine by our waitress because it's BYOB and we didn't get the memo, and they also kept pressuring us into ordering appetizers. So I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5, for service. 

I had the mushroom pie, with a spinach and lentil salad. It tasted so much better then description and that I was thrilled about. I couldn't stop eating it and finished every last bite. I can't for the life of me remember what my husband had, some sort of beef, or pork..? Whatever it was I remember he raved about it and enjoyed his just as much as I enjoyed mine. 

Overall this place puts out some tasty dishes and is definitely a must try when in town!"}
{"text":"Consistency is their problem.

Was a regular at this place but lately their food has gone down the hill.
Last Sunday 4 of us ordered foie gras, all burned and overcooked.
Then came the fish of the day. Undercooked. Inside was raw, and had absolutely no flavour/salt at all.  My deer was lack of seasoning as well. 

Almost,almost sent the dishes back to the kitchen, but didn't wanna taste chef's 'special treatment' after people send food back to the kitchen if you know what i mean. 

I'm not going back here again."}
{"text":"Our Saturday brunch was absolutely stellar.

My partner took the veggie thali, which was remarkable in its creativity: fried squash croquettes in a guacamole lime sauce; a savoury hummus tartine with artichoke heart, kale and pine nuts; all pulled together with a delightful almond milk barley pudding spiced with cardamom and crunchy spicy black sesame bar crumbles.

I had the fried eggs, which came with a bright pesto and crunchy fiddle heads, potatoes with lardons, and a wonderful fresh salad. It just exuded spring. Everything in harmony. 

The chef is an artist. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"So many of the restaurants in Montreal, while great, have some pretense and attitude.  Not O'Thym.  There is a nice open feel to the restaurant without feeling cramped.  Wait staff was friendly and prompt, but the food was spectacular.  Had the Magret de Canard which was flavorful and well prepared.  Wife had a flank steak that was also quite good.  The palate cleanser \"Trou Normond\" while enjoyable probably wasn't worth $7 IMO.  It was especially refreshing to bring our own wine rather than to continue to get baked by restaurants for wine that is either too expensive or not worthy of the food.  Refreshingly, there was no horse on the menu, but I realize as an American that I am biased.  

There are a million great restaurants in Montreal, but I think for the price point and quality of the food that dining at O'Thym is a pretty good option with which you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"All 3 dishes I ordered were perfect! Today's beef tartare was excellent, the duck was out of control and the creme brûlée was insanely good!! Highly recommended. It is BYO ONLY so remember to take wine with you!!"}
{"text":"My first question is:  why is this not more popular on Yelp??

We found this restaurant through Urban Spoon, and the menu really appealed to us.  We were looking for a great French-inspired meal, and we found it.

We were offered soup as a starter, and it was a vegetarian blended soup.  We then moved on to a mixed board, which included Chorizo, chicken liver pate with a port jelly, duck foie gras with a maple liquor, and a duck rillette.  Fantastic.

We opted for the \"palate cleanser,\" which was a lime sorbet with a citrus vodka.

For our main course, we ordered the veal shank, and one of the day's specials, the veal rib chop.  Both were absolutely mind blowing.

Finally, we finished with the molten chocolate cake, and a layered desert which had cooked pear (if I'm not mistaken) with layers of marscapone.   

Overall, this was one of the best meals I have had in the area.  However, there is one big con:  Bring Your Own Wine.  While this is great for locals, for those of us on the road, it can present a challenge when we're short on time.

Overall, excellent food, and I would come back in an instant!"}
{"text":"Another byow restaurant to definitely try! The duck I got was so tender! The mushroom pie was very good as well...to be recommanded. I won't give a 5 stars because of their dessert..."}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful french food in NA sizes. We ordered poisson du jour which was an iceland cod with lobster bisque mousse and fennel salad with turmeric mousse, and then duck breast cooked to perfection! Amazing."}
{"text":"I had such a great experience here! Dinner was great - I had the salmon tartar for starters (amazing) and the trou normand (a palette cleanser and an absolute MUST!!). They bring you a great soup of the day if you order a main. I had the bison ribs for dinner, I wouldn't give them 100% but they were tasty. 

Plus it was a BYOW!"}
{"text":"This is not a tiny place, it seats 30 people easily. It is open and airy, the restrooms and kitchen are in the basement, further contributing to a sense of openness and space. There is a one page menu featuring the standard French fare. There was an effort to use unique ingredients such as fiddleheads (in the middle of May?) and sea urchin, as well as cheese and beef from PEI. Bring your own bottles of wine.

Food: The food is above average. I ordered the octopus appetizer. It was grilled perfectly and presented beautifully on the plate. The entre I ordered was bison ribs. I had to send it back to the kitchen. The brick-heavy lump I was presented with was a tough hunk of meat. Like chewing a baseball. I complained that it was overcooked but the waitress corrected me to say it was actually not cooked long enough. Either way, it was inedible so they graciously replaced it with the duck which was perfect. For dessert I tried both the chocolate torte and creme brule. The chocolate was not too sweet and I would recommend this dish.
Service: Our waitress frequently rolled her eyes at customers within our view when other tables asked questions about the menu, or made requests. My dinner companion reminded her of a forgotten order which resulted in more eye rolling. I felt this disdain of customer requests and questions was not acceptable or appropriate.
Pricing: Generally a good value. The menu items are priced well at approx $15 for appetizers, $29 for entres. I tipped 15% but as we were leaving, the waitress pulled me aside from my group and implored me to give her a higher tip. I interpreted this to mean she wanted me to include the undercooked entre returned to the kitchen. Being flustered and non confrontational, I paid for both entres.
Ambiance: One of the best things about this restaurant is the openness of the space. It is clean, modern, and simple with plenty of natural light."}
{"text":"Chose to try out this place on a celebratory dinner date after reading rave reviews on Yelp, and so glad I did. I found the space to be surprisingly compact, but the atmosphere was bright and bustling. It was not the most intimate or romantic of dates, but we really enjoyed our time here, mainly because the food was so good.

I had the scallops for starters, and they came in a delicious but heavy-ish sauce. Although I appreciated all the flavors of the dish, to me scallops should speak for themselves, and I thought these scallops were hidden a little too much by the big flavors of the rest of the dish. However, my date disagreed with me completely and unequivocally LOVED this dish, so what do I know?

For mainsies I had the venison medallions. What made this dish so great was that the medallions were cooked to perfection -- As in, they literally could not have been more perfectly cooked. When I originally moved to Montréal, I was surprised to find I had difficulty getting a steak in a restaurant that was cooked just the way I liked it -- they all tended to come out overdone. (To be fair, I may have been going to all the wrong places, but it was such a frustrating experience that I actually stopped ordering steak all together.) The venison medallions at O'Thym, however, will stand out in my memory as one of the best-executed dishes that I have ever ordered, in Montréal or elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nous avons diner dans ce resto aujourd'hui, après avoir consulté le menu du midi très varié,

nous avons pris le potage du jour au navet, un plat de morue, et finalement le dessert au menu.

Ces entrées étaient tous délicieux, parfaites et bien présentées.

Le service  était hors pair, le personnel sympathique et finalement le choix de menu du jour était très abordable.

à bientôt"}
{"text":"Just shit on Au Pied, so thought I'd give O'Thym some love. Got to bring our own wine to a place in a beautiful part of the city and eat a perfectly prepared filet served by a personable and knowledgeable server. It was as it should be, and more."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend of mine, the vibe was great, server was nice and had a good knowledge about all the food there,especially daily special,which is very good.

We had the canard de confit which was  quite flavourful but on salty side,a bit disappointed .
The foie gras was really tender,just not exactly my type of food,so no comment on it,just take a look at the pic we took
I got the magret de canard which was not very good,the duck was too dry and soggy for my taste,and also too salty.
 The best part was the asparagus salad,the dressing they are using was amazing!It had baby arugula and some cream cheese inside, got all the flavour it was suppose to be! totally highlight of the night!
Oh one more thing,they are BYOB Resto,so just don't forget grab a bottle of your fav wine b4 you go there."}
{"text":"Last summer I took a spontaneous roadtrip to Montreal. No plans. Just got in the car and drove 6 hours due north from NYC. Arrived. Checked into a hotel. Then it hit me...in being so spontaneous I now found myself sitting in my second favorite city in North America sans dinner reservations, and my two staples of Montreal trips, Au Pied de Cochon and Joe Beef were, naturally, booked solid. Suddenly my spontaneity seemed to be my downfall.

It's difficult to have a bad meal in Montreal. There's a lot of great food there. That being said, there are also a lot of tourist traps. The last thing I wanted was to blindly head to just any restaurant, spend a lot of money, and get ripped off. I spent an hour or so wandering around, and nothing felt right. Then, I happened to be walking by O'Thym just as they were opening for the evening, and though they were booked for their first seating, they had a cancellation and were able to squeeze me into one of the tables towards the back. I wasn't sure how to parse the white walls and Thierry Guetta prints...I liked the minimalism, but it felt \"cold\". I started wondering if I had a made a mistake...if this was going to be one of those uber-pretentious places that serve you thimble-sized portions with an ingredient list longer than most Samuel Beckett plays.

However, all of my worry disappeared as soon as I had the first taste of the complimentary chilled cucumber soup. It was incredibly refreshing (it was really hot outside), and left me wanting more. The best sweetbreads I have ever eaten were at Bayona in New Orleans. The sweetbreads at O'Thym were a very close second. Up next was a palette-cleansing sorbet, followed by my main course, a Venison loin. I love venison. My father used to hunt deer, and I spent a good chunk of my childhood and adolescence with deer meat in our freezer. It was a staple food growing up. Unfortunately, most people don't know how to cook it. I am not exaggerating when I state that this was the best venison, by leaps and bounds, that I have ever eaten. Not the least bit gamey, as tender as most filet mignons, incredibly flavorful, perfectly cooked. Even though I have eaten venison hundreds of times, I honestly did not know that venison could be like that."}
{"text":"Explanation: 1 star = overall experience ruined.
We were a group of 6. 
The perfect review opportunity.
Unfortunately, one main course was not edible, so it was sent back.
Not a big deal, it happens all the time...
BUT... O'Thym doesn't have a Manager on the floor, so the issue was handled very clumsily.
First, a free replacement was offered... then they wanted to fully charge... and finally, no charge was the best they could do- back and forth they went... and meanwhile, I have guests to entertain. During all of this, the original plate was re-presented cold and was disected to try to convince us it was ok... another poor mistake.
One of our guests had eaten there before. She came for her bachelorette (8 people) and explained to us that her whole group was kicked out, so that O'Thym could turnover the table. Not a nice memory... so, this was the 2nd service gaffe in two visits for her.
Here's the problem: If you have an issue, the only person to help you is a glorified waiter who has no authority to take care of the matter at hand- sadly, that's the best scenario. 
The Owner/Chef, stays in the kitchen, as he works hard to produce plates- so don't expect him to come out to help you- he will simply use his waiters as messengers.
The result is that \"we\", as customers, suffer.
O'Thym has proven to be too risky to bring groups when you consider you're paying top dollar for a BYOW that can be hit or miss on customer service.
When there is so many things that could go wrong, especially with groups, this is not a risk I am willing to take again.
In these cases, it doesn't matter how good the food is, when a bad experience can quickly smack the good flavour out of your mouth and eliminate your appetite.
Main thing: don't expect the service standards of a top downtown restaurant when you dine here and avoid for special occasions."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly, not stcku up service, in an attractive setting. Good decor which lets the food stand out even more. Enjoyed two apps (foie gras is a MUST HAVE!), two entrees.We plan to head back to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"Definitely the best BYOB French you can get in the city.

I had the veal sweetbreads and they were amazing.  The other 4 diners at my table agreed.  The salmon tartar was good, too.    For the entrées, I would recommend trying the sweetbreads!  Having tried lots of different things, but not a huge fan of organs, I was really surprised.  Sooo good!

As for the mains, the bison is very good as is the newly-added duck-confit leg with barley risotto.  Unanimous around the table as a great main. 

I would recommend the second service as there is little pressure at that time to leave the table.  That being said, the service is not very fast, however the staff is very nice and knowledgeable.

For your BYOB needs consider paying about $10 more for your main to have great food.

Will return.

One sad note is their website needs a makeover.  Just a detail."}
{"text":"Pretty good overall.  We had brunch here and ordered vegetables entree with poached egg and steak with bread & duck egg.  The orange juice was amazing fresh (dark orange colour and tastes so fresh).  I would give this restaurant 4.5 stars (Yelp, time to allow us to give half stars!)   I'd recommend this place.  Nice ambience and great service!"}
{"text":"Went here on a friends recommendation and am very glad we did.
Food was tremendous, service great and bringing our own wine with no corkage fee was priceless!
A must visit while in Montreal."}
{"text":"Best hidden Montreal gem. I moved from Montreal when I was 24, and I have to say this is hands down my favorite restaurant. It's an amazing byowine place that changes is menu based on what food is in season. Service is amazing, they make you feel like and king and I have never been let down by the food. They even got me into eating baby deer. One thing that is annoying is that certain nights (or all nights) they only take seats at 2 times."}
{"text":"One of the best Bring your own Wine restaurant in Montreal.... along with Quarter General"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner!  

Appetizers: foie gras with lavender garlic and scallop ceviche with cucumber (outstanding!)

Sorbet: lemon vodka (great)

Main courses: Lamb sirloin and venison signature dish (both cooked perfectly - medium rare) served with great accompaniments.

Of all the meals we've had during our visit the past 3 days, this was the best and we definitely plan on returning next time.  The staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"The tartare and ceviche appetizers were fantastic! The lamb main course was better than the duck."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch and friendly staff! Highly recommend! It is a BYO place which makes it nice as you can chose to bring whatever wine you want. Best meal I had in Montreal"}
{"text":"For the last night of our honeymoon, we were looking for something special. We found it and more at O'Thym. We were staying nearby, popped in to make a reservation, and were told that dinner seatings were at 6 and 9. We chose 6, and were greeted by a gentleman who was kind enough to warn us off of the table near the door,\"because of the smokers\" and seated us near the window. Our waitress Vanessa was cheerful and helpful in a genuine way, not with a forced smile for the American tourists.She was very busy but attentive, an excellent waitress. We brought our own bottle of French red that we had purchased earlier, I only wish we had brought a better wine to complement the delicious food. We started with an entree, my wife had a veal liver dish with pistachio and star anise, I had foie gras in a pastry with fig sauce. The flavors were intense. The Trou de Normand, or palate cleanser, was a lemon sorbet in  citrus vodka served in a martini glass with rind and a sprig of mint. It was the ideal setting for the next course. My wife's lamb chop plat was superb, and my filet mignon was the finest piece of beef I've ever had. For dessert we both had a concoction of spiced pears, Cointreau, tamarind, and cream that was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal. Any anniversary visit to Montreal will certainly include a return to this place, it was a consummate ending to our week of celebration."}
{"text":"Very average French food. My bf's entree bison was cold. My duck marget was barely warm enough and I thought it was too chewy. The fois gras was excellent. The service needs improvement. I honestly wondered if they had the regular chefs and waiters/waitresses working the day before New Year's Eve. I feel disappointed by the evening since it was our last night of only two nights in Montreal."}
{"text":"The location was a stretch for us. Quite a ways from Centre Ville and the Old City. But the food is worth the trouble! It is a lovely BYOB - so we splurged on a bottle of sparkling wine. The scallop ceviche appetizer was good, but the rest of dinner was superb! We shared the lemon vodka sorbet as  palette cleanser and it was truly delicious. The amuse-bouche was a cold cauliflower soup that was especially tasty. A real treat. I had salmon and for a commonly prepared fish the preparation was extraordinary--the fish soft, tender, and flaky and buttery. The sauce very distinctive and delicious. We were too full for dessert but they looked wonderful!"}
{"text":"Once again, all you great people on yelp made me the hero! We had dinner here after the Montreal Grand Prix. It was fantastic! Big note*** BYOB!!!! Four of us in our group and everyone was very pleased. Bison was so good I wanted to order another serving. They were very accommodating to English speaking."}
{"text":"Mon nouveau restaurant préféré a Montréal. 

O'Thym a été d'un professionalisme exemplaire lors de la soirée d'anniversaire que nous avons donné en l'honneur de mon copain. Nous avions réservé pour 13 personnes, un mardi. Le service fut d'une qualité exceptionnelle : honnête, chaleureux et discret. Le menu présenté sur une ardoise semblait déjà alléchant mais quand notre serveur nous en a fait la description détaillée nous avions tous véritablement l'eau à la bouche !

Le service fut rapide, tous les plats sont arrivés en même temps. Tous les mets ont eu un franc succès. A la table, les gens s'échangeait des bouchées et commentaient favorablement la qualité des plats.

Le concept apportez votre vin nous a permis de vraiment se laisser aller dans la nourriture sans compromettre la qualité du vin ($). 

Définitivement, nous y retournerons pour une prochaine occasion."}
{"text":"Before going to Montreal for the weekend, my husband did some research for a place where we could bring our own wine. O'Thym was recommended by several people. 

We arrived about 45 minutes early and thought we might be able to be seated early. Little did we know \"2 seatings per night\" means one starts at 6 and one starts at 9. We had to come back. Which was fine because we had the chance to explore the \"bohemian\" neighborhood where O'Thym is located. 

Just before nine, most of the earlier customers had left and groups of people started pouring in for the second seating. The waitresses methodically opened bottles while describing the menu items. The small staff of 3 worked the room with precision and pleasantries. 

The food was new French with many of seasonal and local ingredients, but prepared with a freshness leaving some of the richness of traditional French food behind. 

I had zuchinni flowers stuffed with mushrooms served over a bed of sweet peppers drizzled with a red pepper sauce. My main course was bison steak and served with too many supporting dishes and flavors for my liking. (a small portion of potatos gratin was so cheesy that the cheese took over the flavor of anything else with it).

My husband had ceviche for his entree followed by a filet mignon which he found to be cooked perfectly, but a bit rich for his taste. His meal was served with the same host of side dishes. 

There was a nice surprise - a palate cleansing course of melon sorbet served in a martini glass splashed with vodka. MMM!

The place had a good energy. We would go again!"}
{"text":"Had supper here for the first time last week and overall it was a pretty good experience. The food is all \"à la carte\" and the whole meal was delicious, from entrée to dessert. Plates came with a complementary gazpacho. The only reason this place loses a star for me was the service. We had a reservation and upon arrival, we quicky noticed how tiny this place is. We were greeted by a very stern waitress - no smile or word of welcome. Once we were seated, it took forever for her to come explain the menu, then to open our bottle of wine, and finally to take our order. Overall service was very slow. Due to all the fantastic reviews, I'm definitely willing to give this place another try. Already have a reservation to try the brunch out! To be continued..."}
{"text":"Un tres bon restaurant à Montréal! Ce qui ma marqué le plus, c'est que les assiettes etaient trooooop belles !!! De plus, les plats au menu sont variés et très bon ! 

Pour moi , ils proposent un menu de style francais un peu trop traditionnelle, mais il le font bien alors si vous aimez la nourriture francaise cest un endroit parfait pour vous :)"}
{"text":"Excellent resto à MTL. La cuisine est parfaite à tout coup ! Super service, endroit sublime, bref j'adore ! En plus, c'est apportez votre vin :D ! Vous devez absolument essayer ! Par contre arrivez tôt ou réserver car c'est souvent plein !"}
{"text":"Arrived in Montreal on Sunday evening and we were able to make a same day reservation for 730. Very much enjoyed the food and the service. I had the \"fish\" of the day--which was scallops. Lots of interesting flavors in the dish--not sure that I loved it, but liked the creativity. For dessert we had the chocolate ganache--very yummy.Service was great."}
{"text":"Fantastic from start to finish. The food was exquisite, and the service very good. Lovely, romantic setting. English friendly! Would absolutely return, it was a real treat."}
{"text":"This place had one of the best dinners I've ever had in my life. The service was amazing, very kind and welcoming despite the fact I didn't speak much French or very good French. The meal was flavorful and filling, and it's located  near public transport, if you aren't driving in Montreal."}
{"text":"Très bon. C'est un apportez votre vin donc idéal si on en amène du très bon. Clientèle du village. Petit resto. Réservation a l'avance."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I've review this already, since I've been here a few times while in Montreal. But I don't care. This place is ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL and deserves this 5-star review.

This little resto tucked away behind Le Village is probably where I've enjoyed the best food I've ever had in my life. I don't know how they do it! Everything is ridiculously flavourful, yet the flavours don't necessarily come from overwhelming sauces, but rather from the food itself. The quality here is top-notch, and the prices are surprisingly reasonable. It's also BYOB (I don't think they have a liquor licence), which makes the meal even more affordable compared to an equally spectacular dinner in Toronto (if that's even possible!). 

I'll keep this short and sweet, but if you want to taste what Montreal culinary awesomeness is, go to O'Thyme!"}
{"text":"We spent 10 days traveling (and eating) throughout Quebec and this restaurant was our favorite. All aspects (service, food, atmosphere) of this restaurant should receive 5 stars (save wine service since this is a BYOB). The servers were so friendly and informative.  They were also very passionate about the food being served; knowing it and describing it perfectly. A friendly welcome often sets the tone for the whole experience and these folks win here. The atmosphere is energetic bistro with enough sound dampening to allow for a pleasant personal conversation. The food was to die for: exploding with the primary flavor of the dish yet complimented by herbs and spices. I had the sweetbreads as an appetizer. These were served with a light, slightly sweet sauce of fruit and maple and topped with coarsely prepared herbs that was so light yet exploded with flavored and textures. We also had a brilliant Halibut with black garlic and mango that was perfect for a warm summer night and delicately prepared. We trusted the chef so much we had creme brûlée and a trio of sorbets for dessert - things we would NEVER order in lesser hands -and they did not disappoint. The creme brûlée was rich and delicious and the brittle crust perfectly executed. My sorbets were anything but the usual; they expressed their flavored to a T: pear, fennel and blueberry. In addition there was an amuse bouche of gazpacho and an interlude of lime sherbet in vodka all part of a perfectly paced (2+ hour) meal. Add the fact that you can bring and have a wine you couldn't afford from most restaurant wine lists and you have an exceptional night out. This place is a must."}
{"text":"Very good.  The deer shoulder (poor Bambi!) was the highlight of the meal.  The only thing that could have made it better would have been roasted Thumper as a starter."}
{"text":"Flavours ! They nailed it.

I've been wanting to come here for a while and finally my boyfriend took me here as he's a big fan of this spot I am not a huge fan as well.

We had a great waitress who came over and explained the menu with a huge smile and knew all the ingredients and didn't miss a beat. She did a fantastic job and really made our dining experience great.

So besides the fact that it's a byow it's a little loud but what would you expect? It was very classy and food was well priced for a byow because they usually hike the prices up but they didn't. 

We started with the scallops which were seared perfectly and the crumbled chicken skin was a nice touch. We then had the fiddle head salad which was served on a chic pea pure. It was my first time trying this dish and it's filling so I would suggest you share it like we did with all of appetizers. We then had the sweet potato which was really little so that kinda sucked but it was very good. It's served cold with a little cream on top with a a nicely cooked hot arancini. The best was the foie gras of course! It was served on a carrot cake with rhubarb with fleur de sel.

The main we shared was the duck it was nice the what and sauce but the duck was over cooked. But since the service and experience was great I wont knock off any stars. 

The menu just changed for the season so keep your eyes peeled for a new menu in a few weeks."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the top ten restaurants in Montreal!  I had the salmon tartare, bison w/frites, and creme brulee with maple syrup flavor and the meal was incredible!  The salmon tartare was creamy and smokey.  The bison was tender and easy to cut and extremely well seasoned and flavored.  Coupled with a couple of bottles of red from the SAQ and good friends, it made for a very memorable night.  I would recommend reservations because even on a rainy Tuesday evening this place was hopping."}
{"text":"Belle place pour souper en tête à tête. Belle ambiance pas trop bruyante, la salle à dîner baigne sous les rayons du soleil de fin de journée. Le personnel est très sympathique. Le menu est très varié pour les amateurs de viande et plus timide pour les végétariens. Personnellement, les restaurants de cuisine Française de Montréal m'ont offert souvent de savoureux mets végétarien, et ce resto est de ce groupe sélect à l'écoute de sa clientèle. L'entrée de gnocchi de patate douce et la tarte fine champignon + humus de lentille m'ont charmé. Tandis que ma compagne s'est régalé d'un tartare de cerf en entrée et d'une pièce de cerf légèrement saignante servie avec de savoureux légumes grillés. Le tout accompagné d'un rouge qu'on venait tout juste de prendre à la SAQ à 3 coins de rue sur SteCatherine. Les desserts dont la crème glacé à la bière, le pain perdu fruité et la crème brûlé ont terminé en beauté cette belle expérience. Je souhaite voir un jour un 2e choix végétarien au menu principal."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous!  Every bit was absolutely delicious for me and my guest.  We had an amazing experience here and I look forward to visiting again when I'm in Montreal again.  

Again every bite was savoury; the vegetable root soup that was on the house, blood sausage with fois gras, she had a fish dish and I had a bison ribs dish along with dessert.  Just the thought of it is making my mouth water!  

Hats of to the chef!  Next time I'll be sure to bring a bottle of wine as they are a BYOB establishment; the first time I've seen such a place!"}
{"text":"What a way to start off my visit to Montreal! Delicious.

I called and made a reservation for two 45 minutes prior to our arrival to allow for enough time to stop by the SAQ and pick up some wine - BYOW, what a great way to dine! Buying wine at the liquor store we were able to drink VERY well - Chateau Margaux and Chateauneuff du Pape!! Must have saved over $100 compared to buying those wines in a restaurant.

On our way to the restaurant, my sister called and asked to join us, and O Thym accommodated no problem: we had to wait 15 minutes for a table for three to open up, but our waiter was happy to seat us and open one of our bottles while we waited for my sister to arrive and switch to the other table. Being Ville Marie (or The Village, depending on who you talk to) it is nearly all Francophone. The menu was chalked up on a board entirely in French, a lovely characteristic, but our waiter was happy to bring us an English menu - not even of a flutter of snobbery. Throughout the meal he made a much-appreciated effort to speak to us in English, and did a bang-up job at it, topping off our fabulous experience.

Now, to the food! Oh the food - scrumptious. I started with the sweetbreads while my fellow diners had the smoked duck salad and the salmon & avocado tartare. Forkfuls exchanged around the table, all quite tasty. We followed that with a palate cleanser of sorbet, and then I had the venison and the rest of the table the filet mignon. Once again, all delectable. For dessert we shared a cheese plate, the creme brulee, and the flourless chocolate cake. No let down here either! The meal was paced perfectly, and we were the last ones in the place.

Coming away from a meal like that without having broken the bank was just so refreshing. The BYOW along with mouth-watering food and top-notch service all in an unpretentious setting: this is bistro dining at its best!"}
{"text":"It was a solid meal.  The restaurant was able to accommodate our party of 6. However, we arrived a bit early and there were a ton of open tables.  We were all left wondering why we could not be seated.  Come to find out they only have a 6pm and 9pm dinner seating.  Although pretty strange concept we went with it.  Very cool thing about this restaurant was is that he it is Bring Your Own Wine concept. 

Starters:
- Foie Gras
- Salmon Tartar

Entrees:
- Duck
- Flank Steak (probably the best dish of the night)
- Fish of the Day
- Bison  

The only complaint that I have about this restaurant is that the servers were not that friendly.  They need to put on a smile and pretend like they care."}
{"text":"Food: Fois gras and sea snail (19) was delicious, the sandwich glace (10) and entre chaude (16) were rich; paired with some house-recommended wine. With this entre chaude, with bright blueberries and a thicker torched crust, it is so sweet and creamy, I recommend bringing a dessert wine especially for this. A rich red could also serve to balance such sweetness and give consistency to the meal.
Service: Turns out its BYO... the environment makes this a must visit for a bevy of occasions. I'll be prepared with wine on my next visit. Total for two was $56 with tips included in the bill, so a good amount considering the quality and amount to eat -- You'll need it for exploring the area.
Seated quickly. Was 2, could have easily been 4 or 6, the total number in our party.

{"text":"Montreal is over-saturated with French bistros. Seemingly hidden on every side street and kitty-corner, they should be approached with caution. I generally pause to parse over the menus and maybe glance at the laminated reviews in the window as I walk by them. No more than that. Most are pricey and I'd say they aren't worth it but I haven't eaten at enough of them to make that judgment. But on my modest income, limited budget (if I ever bothered to sort one out) and meager debt-ridden existence, if I'm going to go out and spend 50 hard-earned dollars on a meal, it better be worth it.  There's nothing worse than a disappointing and expensive meal. Okay, there's a lot worse than a disappointing over-priced meal (like cancer) but you know what I mean.  

This brings me O Thym, a bistro that stands out amid this cluttered market. First things off the bat - it's BYOW. This already makes the price of a meal that much more reasonable since wine can tack on at least a dollar sign or two to any meal (and who wants to eat at a French bistro without a bottle of wine? It's like eating corn on the cob without butter. And it's even better when you can bring two or three bottles and feel extra extravagant without paying forty bucks a bottle). But, yeah, there are other French bistros that are BYO (specifically on the Plateau which has about six of them that I can name off the top of my head) so this plus has to be backed up by the food. And this unassuming bistro off of de Maisonneuve in the Village is the best BYO bistro I've been to (better than Au Petit Plateau, Colombe and a few others I forget) . The decor is minimalist and tasteful (it actually doesn't look like much from the outside - could be a fancy sandwich joint) with a daily menu chalked on a large blackboard. Prices are fairly reasonable considering it's French and BYO (something like 22 to 35 for main courses). I had the best ostrich I've ever had in my life there.  Sure, that may not say too much since I've only had ostrich a handful of times in my life but this one was cooked to absolute perfection. Great food, good unpretentious service and the bill only worked out to forty per person with an appetizer and main course (including tax and tip)."}
{"text":"We stumbled onto this place after a long day of show during Jazz Fest.
Unheurseument nous n'apportez pas notre vin mais c'etait bien! (They don't serve wine/alcohol so you need to bring your own.

Anyway, I remember I had the duck breast and it was fairly succulent. Don't remember what the lady had but I think it was pasta which fairly good too.

Service was fine but I really liked the decor - simple, modern, understated but cool all the same.

I wouldn't mind returning here next time around."}
{"text":"If you're opposed to delightful food, friendly service, and BYOB, don't go here. Everyone else, do it.
My friends and I went here on our last night in Montréal and it was an awesome goodbye. I mean all the food we had in the city was great, but this was definitely a peak. 
We each had an entree, two of them special entrées--swordfish and veal--but I believe mine, the duck, was a dinner menu staple. All of them were delicious and worth the slightly more expensive price tag. (As an aside, compared to NYC prices, we felt so thrifty. Going back has been a rude awakening...I miss you Canada). 
We also had 2 desserts, a creamy and delicious creme brulee and this amazing shortcake with meringue and citrus fruit. Seriously, don't pass up on their desserts. 
Tl;dr version: you'll want to eat here."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here based on the Yelp & UrbanSpoon reviews. While I thought the food was very good, I don't consider it the most memorable meal and the wait between our appetizer and entree was unacceptable. Probably 45 minutes and the waiter never checked on us and seemed oblivious to the fact that our meal had not arrived. The scallop ceviche appetizer was lovely, summery, light and balanced.  My daughter loved her salmon fumee with couscous and seaweed butter. I thought my husband's fish special with lobster bisque, sweet peas & wheat berries was the best dish of the evening. While my duck with celeriac, beets & lemon-thyme sauce was nice, it was similar to many dishes I've had elsewhere. As I said earlier, the entire evening was marred for me by the long wait. I think they are understaffed with the servers washing dishes, slicing bread & refilling water on top of running downstairs to fetch the food."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch. More of a 4.5 for food, but the service was exceptional enough to round up. Lobster Benedict, awesome. Croissant Wellington, very good, but not sure if I'd order it again. Maple Brulee, totally amazing. A must try.

Again, service was spectacular."}
{"text":"This place was just amazing!   The food in Montreal has been phenomenal, and so far this ranks up there.  Small, quaint and friendly, but even more important is the food.  We started with carrot and parsnip bisque, beef cheek with peas and curry, then had the Magret de canard (so yummy) and ended with the apple tart.  Everything was sooooo delicious."}
{"text":"One of the best, if not possibly the best, meals I've had in Montreal. The restaurant accommodated our large group (and many bottles of wine). We didn't encounter the loudness issue that other reviewers mention-- we could all hear each other fine and enjoyed the fun atmosphere in the restaurant. They offered us a delicious gazpacho soup to begin our meal. I ordered the braised bison, which I found to be incredibly tender, juicy, and delicious. My boyfriend went with the fish dishes, which were excellent as well. Basically judging from the many different plates in our large group, every dish was a winner. Some even ordered the palate cleanser sorbet to have in between the first and second course, and we all enjoyed passing it around and tasting it. 

All in all a lovely evening with delicious foods and a great atmosphere. Fantastic."}
{"text":"I ate here as part of a bicycle tour I did with a friend. The food was delicious and worth every dollar spent on presentation, taste, and enjoyment. This is definitely a special occasion place to eat, but if you have something to celebrate, definitely come here!"}
{"text":"Came here for bunch awhile ago. Delicious food. Best lobster benedict I've ever had. Beef wellington was 4/5, it was a little too salty but still delicious. Also, awesome service."}
{"text":"Within 5 mins of arriving our server had smashed a wine glass on top of my bare stilettoed foot and just about knocked over the girl sitting at the next table. Obviously a relatively new server who needed a lesson in slowing down. I started with the salmon tartare which turned out to be atrocious! It was ceviche NOT tartare and was void of any taste except for the lemon juice it was bathed in. Big time fail. For my main I had the rack of lamb which was far better than the tartare but still lacking in the flavour department. I ordered it medium and it came out blue. I'm not sure what all the hype is about but this is one resto I would recommend to avoid. With so many other delicious options in the area, there's no way I'd return."}
{"text":"It was our first French meal in Montreal and the food was awesome. We were the first customer of the day for dinner and lucky us that we had a table without any reservation. We had two special appetizers of day and two main courses to share. The service was warm, the dishes were great! Would love to come back again before we leave the city!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite BYOW restaurants. The food is always good, and I mean always. I won't go into what's good about it, it just is. Try it. If you don't love it, come on back and let me hear about it. I've been about 10 times and I'll probably be going back soon! As far as price, well it's about as fair as you can hope for considering what they serve up on the plate."}
{"text":"My husband and I just might have had the most wonderful meal in all of Montreal at O Thym during a recent visit.  We found this place quite by accident, after realizing the place we had wanted to book for dinner was closed on Mondays, so after a bit of searching on his iPhone for BYOW places, we selected O Thym.  What good fortune for us that we got reservations.
The place itself is in a residential/business area.  There is a pet shop and hardware store across the street.  We were staying in Vieux Montreal and walked there, Metro'd home from the nearby station. 
Love the water menu.  Loved the modern/simple decor.  Emphasis here is on delicious food and good service.
For starters I had the salmon tartare with pureed avocadoes.  Fresh and superb products.  Husband had rocket salad with smoked duck and parmesan.  Wonderful touch of balsamic reduction--killer good combination of flavors.
We then moved on with our meal: my main course was the lamb chops with roasted garlic.  Cooked rare, just as I requested.  He had the filet mignon (bleu--and it was) which was served with wild mushrooms.  How spectacular were these meals I cannot even tell you.  Perfection.  
Dessert--we shared a wonderful creme brulee.  Heaven.  
At the end of our meal we told our server that our meals were exceptional and he remarked that he is the owner of this place and 3 other similar ones, and gave us the business cards.
On our next trip to Montreal I hope we have the chance to try them all.  Fantastique, eh!"}
{"text":"I whole heartedly agree with the most effusive reviews posted for O'Thym. Excellent food, friendly-not fussy, nor snooty-service, in an attractive setting. Simplistic decor which lets the food stand out even more. Two of us enjoyed two apps (foie gras is a MUST HAVE!), two entrees, the divine palate cleanser and dessert for $145 including taxes and tip. We,re only in Montreal for a week, but we plan to head back on our last night to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"Didn't know it was BYOB- so come prepared to accompany the great food here. Menus are printed on the wall in French which adds to the decor, don't worry they hand you an English version of the menu, the layout of the space allows for service and attention. I ordered the flank steak which was done just right on a bed of oyster mushrooms. The price was unbelievable too for such awesome food, service and ambience. Definitely worth the trip"}
{"text":"I want to relive this meal over and over again. When we heard there were BYOB's in Montreal we were more than excited especially since we went a little crazy at the wine shop on our first day in the city. O'Thym was recommended by the lovely Risa D and we were not disappointed.
The space is so clean and bright I was expecting it to be a little darker than it was. The restaurant isn't very big so definitely make reservations for a popular night. Service was great we never wanted/needed for anything during our 2.5 hour dining experience. 
Upon arrival our first bottle was popped and glasses filled to the brim with cava while we overlooked the chalkboard menu. Our server explained the day's specials the salad of the season, sea bass and veal rib. We were brought out a cold melon soup which unfortunately I couldn't eat since I am allergic but it looked very good.
Entrées- 
I started with the Salad if the season that featured asparagus, ricotta cheese, roasted peppers and herbs drizzled with balsamic. The fresh and bright flavors went very well together and everything had been seasoned to my liking so I didn't need to add any addional salt. My dining companion thought it fitting to order foi gras since we were dining at a French restaurant. It came along side figs, and caramelized onions. I being the worst vegetarian in the world tried foi gras for the first time; it was interesting that's all I'm going to say. KP seemed to enjoy it very much. 
This is only one of the few places that charges for a palate cleanser but it had vodka in it and was so good I forgave that $7.00 fee.
Plats-I chose one of the specials sea bass it was amazingly good. Two perfectly seared pieces of sea bass atop quinoa and bean salad. There was a purée on the plate could tell you what it was but it was delish. I cleaned my plate (something I rarely do).
Dessert ended our meal and the crème brulee was absolutely delicious. This was one of the better meals I've had in recent memory. I would highly recommend coming here it's worth every penny and you actually won't spend that much. It's priced just right in my opinion for the level of service and food preparation."}
{"text":"Neues Konzept kennengelernt: bring your own bottle (wine). Hatte das tataki, das sirlon beef (awesome!!) and the maple creme brule ( ). Die beiden   Besitzer (schien mir so) waren super.. wir haben uns den ganzen Abend Mega wohl gefühlt !! Danke"}
{"text":"This is a great BYOB restaurant where the bread and fantastic food kept coming. The special appetizer was duck heart tartar and it was delicious, so good that we had to order another one. Make sure that you make reservations! Coming from Toronto where BYOB is not an option, this is one of the best experiences we've had!!"}
{"text":"Waited about 15 min with a reservation but it was so worth it. They were very patient and explained the dishes even though I knew no French. Bring your own wine but well worth it. 

Appetizer: salmon tartar: scrumptious!!  Crisp potato chips with chopped salmon, creamy sauce and pieces of green apple. Yum!!  Scallop ceviche: very fresh with no fishy smell. Hubby loved it but I didn't care for the foam which tasted like sweet cucumber.

Entrees:  duck magree: so good!!  Medium rare with some fat and skin. Don't be fooled. You are out to enjoy yourself so dive in!  All the flavor is in the fat. I didn't really like celery purée but the asparagus kale and potato were very good. Deer Madellions: medium rare no gaminess very mild and tasted amazing.

Dessert:  chocolate cake: more like a very creamy ganache bar. Yum but I couldnt do more than 3 bites. Creme brûlée: crunchy sugar outside with yummy custard inside that has just the right amount of sweetness and creamy dreamy... Yum.  I drooled a little just thinking about it. Hubby said one of the best he had. He also had an espresso to go with it. And this s after pastry hunting all day. 

Service: very patient, very attentive , and accommodating. One of the best.  Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"My rating is a 4.5 but rounding it up is a no brainer...this place is excellent! (and I rarely give 5 stars). Bad stuff...there wear a few flies around and the air conditioning was right at our feet...this is the half star deduction. Good stuff...everything else!  The food was spectacular, we skipped any fish apps since we had ceviche and mahi mahi 3 hours earlier. We started by sharing a main course mushroom tart that was excellent. My wife and I then each had the lemon vodka sorbet to clean our pallet ;) - must have. My wife had the lamb and I had the deer entree - excellent. We finished with a cappuccino, a double short espresso, and a special pumpkin dessert that had more ingredients and sides than you could shake a stick at!  Service = phenomenal. Atmosphere = energetic. By the way, it's a bring your own wine establishment which is awesome cause you bring the wine you want and you don't get charged double for it. 
Yes, we recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Definitely the best and most delicious food to find in the Gay Village. It's tucked away at a parallel street from Ste. Catherine, and the menu appears to change everyday. The food simply put, blew my mind. Something drew me to the Tempura Blood Pudding, something I would traditionally never order, but no regrets whatsoever - it was one of the most delicious appetizers I've ever tasted. Perfectly mixed with vegetables and a complementing aioli, it was perfection embodied in an appetizer. The codfish was every bit as joyous, perfectly crispy skin and soft and buttery meat in a delectable olive oil sauce. Wish we had more space for dinner. It's byob so come prepared - for us it was a nice 'recovery period' from the afternoon spent drinking in the village!"}
{"text":"Super nice food and stuffs! You can always enjoy \"Petit appetizer\" before serving your meal:)"}
{"text":"O'Thym is a great BYOB place! Even for brunch! You can bring your own bubbly to make bottomless mimosas. :)

The food is absolutely delicious. They often change up their menu to feature fresh ingredients. I had bavette and duck eggs for brunch, an interesting twist of steak and eggs. :)
The decor is industrial and clean with high ceilings. Very nice place for celebration or special occasions!"}
{"text":"We were a group of 6 and came here for dinner on Saturday night. Everyone was given a small cold potage to start with. It was refreshing and unlike any I've had before. I had the scallop and leek appetizer (under the tartare menu), and the sous-vide steak for the main. For dessert I got the favourite, maple creme brulee. So creamy and smooth! 

The plates were beautifully presented, and the food was perfectly cooked and savoury. Another restaurant that showcases Quebec produce to its best. 

It is also BYOW, and we easily finished off 3 bottles of wine :) Would love to come back here for their brunch menu!"}
{"text":"Le décor est très sympathique mais c'est assez petit donc on s'y sent un peu à l'étroit. L'endroit semble très populaire car il était bondé à craquer! Je conseille donc de réserver à l'avance.  Le gros plus c'est que c'est un apportez votre vin.

Notre serveuse était très gentille mais semblait débordée donc nous parlait très très vite et on comprenait à moitié. Il y avait définitement un manque de personnel cette soirée là. Il y a eu des oublis et des confusions dans la commande, mais rien de majeur. 

Les entrées:
- tartare au saumon: génial, frais
- ravioli géant aux crevettes: bien
-palourdes: extrêmement petites.., pas très goûteuses. 
Les deux entrées qui devaient être chaudes, étaient très froides.

Le repas principal:
- Le poisson du jour: un flop
- La bavette de boeuf: très tendre
- Le bison: excellent, vraiment à essayer
- Le saumon: excellent"}
{"text":"Bon petit resto apportez votre vin. Idéal pour une soirée en tête-à-tête. Nous avions réservé un mercredi, pour deux et avons demandé à garder la table toute la soirée pour éviter de se faire demander de partir à 20:45 pour le deuxième service.

Côté bouffe, le mise-en-bouche, offert par le resto, une petite soupe froide.. perso, je l'aurais préféré chaude, mais mon amie a bien aimé. L'entrée, tartare de saumon, excellent! Les saveurs et les couleurs m'ont beaucoup plu. Comme plat principal, le choix (ardoise) était difficile. J'ai opté pour la bavette et j'ai un petit peu regretté. L'assiette, présentation, mélange de saveur et goût étaient super, par contre j'ai trouvé ma bavette très tirailleuse. Je fais un peu ma difficile, mais à 26 ou 28$ la petite bavette, j'aurais bien aimé pas avoir autant de nerfs dans mon morceau de viande. Si je reviendrais, oui, pourquoi pas?"}
{"text":"As the name suggests, O'Thym is a  herb lovers paradise.  it is a really cute mid to upscale BYOB French Bistro with a post modern minimalist decor.

It was very cute and a great place to have dinner for 2 or 4.

They have a very European approach to dinner.  They have 2 dinner shifts that are each 2.5 hours long.  They bring courses out in a staggered manner, so everyone who is dinning with you is on a similar dinning schedule.  This adds for a great environment, since everyone is in the same stage of their meal and really sets a good ambiance,  

Everything that we ordered was very good. 

We ordered the shrimp ravioli appetizer.  This was a really exotic play on the ravioli as it mixed many herbs with shrimp to give a very earthy and herbally taste.  This is the type of dish that a wine pairer dreams of.

We also ordered the smoked salmon dish and it was to die for.  This was a very traditional french dish loaded with herbs and captured the perfect nodes for a Bordeaux.  This was by far the best dish we ordered.

The other entree we ordered was the risotto white fish special, which does not appear to be a regular menu item.  This dish was good but a little heavy for my liking.  The risotto was fantastic but the fish was a little to subtle of a taste to be paired with the a rich rosotto. However, we really liked the fresh beans that were mixed into the risotto.  This created a very nice texture to add alongside the risotto.

The service is excellent and the wait staff is very nice.  I will definitely go back on a future visit to Montreal.

It is also reasonably priced for the food and ambiance."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fabulous. The service was good, the food was outstanding from entrée  all the way to dessert. The  ambiance is relaxed and cozy.
Do try the \"Cerf de Boileau\"!
I highly recommend it. 

And best of all: it is bring your own wine."}
{"text":"Had a just plain orgasmic meal here last week, thanks for the tip Yelpers! Having now eaten at Wellington, Smoking Vallee and this Gay Village gem by the same crew I'd be hard pressed to pick a favourite but will return to all three repeatedly. For ambiance this one holds my heart - there is some wizardy in managing to be both bright white and sexy soothing dim at the same time. Lighting designers were involved in this sleight of hand I imagine... 

The foooooood! Filet mignon came with a soup starter with a cauliflower base and some slow build kick to it of.. white pepper? I think? Lovely. Stop-and-talk-about-it lovely, which is saying something at table full of best best lady friends. The steak itself was perfect, melt in your watery mouth, and the tiny mushooms, puree of something, tiny perfect root veggies and brandy gravy.. good lord. That is all. The chocolate dessert and the erable creme brulle were outstanding.

We had no problem getting a reservation the day before for the 6pm seating which was perfect for hitting a show at National well wined and dined after dinner. Very very highly recommended. Try not to sit at the table by the stairs down to the bathroom if you don't want to get your chair kicked (sorry for kicking your chair nice madame.)"}
{"text":"Délicieux, rien à redire, choix de plat différents, cuisine fine, service sympa, regal pour le palais, un must!!!"}
{"text":"Average French food. Maybe because we were there for lunch? Nothing stunning. But it was still quite good"}
{"text":"The host at our B&B recommended this place for a modern take on French cuisine.  He tried to explain how the name \"O'Thym\" is a play on words, but I don't remember how that worked out...  We loved the atmosphere and I remember thinking that it felt like we were in NYC or back home in Chicago.  I can't really speak as to the quality of traditional French food, but it tasted real good, looked real good, and we felt real good sitting in the space.

As tourists in the city, it is a safe bet that this place will set the mood for a wonderful evening in Montreal.

We'll go back."}
{"text":"This was another recommendation by our B&B hosts.  We made 7:00 reservations and walked over.  We were greeted warmly but w/ the concern that we knew we were to bring our own wine, a concern that was echoed by our server.  We explained that we did, but only one of us drank wine, so it wasn't practical for us to bring a bottle.  Had we known before dinner at Steak Frîtes a couple of nights ago about bringing our own wine the bottle would likely have lasted me three dinners.

We were brought the English menu and our server explained which dishes were no longer available and what had replaced them.  We decided to share an appetizer of pumpkin and walnut ravioli and grilled calamari.  Alan ordered the fish special (a white fish, the type I can't remember) and I ordered the rack of lamb.  We were brought a sliced baguette in a graceful Nambé-like elongated bowl accompanied by a small ramekin of butter.  Unexpectedly we were both brought bowls of a squash-cabbage soup.  It was thick and beautifully seasoned.  Completely delicious.

The appetizer arrived and we were very sorry we hadn't brought the camera because the presentation was so beautiful.  The calamari was atop the ravioli and artfully arranged atop the calamari were delicate sprigs of herbs.  Under and around the ravioli were finely chopped tomatoes and tentacles.  Alan took the calamari and cut it in half while I took the ravioli (I should say raviolo because there was a single one) and cut it in half.  We exchanged halves and sprinkled some tomato and tentacles on top.  It was very tasty and we enjoyed it but would have appreciated a bit more generous portion for the price, like two ravioli.  We used the last of the bread to sop up the delicious sauce in the bottom of the bowl.  We were offered a lemon-vodka sorbet as a palate cleanser between courses but Alan declined and I didn't have any either.

When our mains arrived they were again beautifully presented and accompanied by an interesting assortment of vegetables.  My lamb had a couple of small potatoes that had an appealing smokey flavor, a couple of barely cooked baby carrots and a mixture of shredded red and white cabbage.  It was a wonderful mélange.  The lamb was cooked medium rare and it was very tender.   Alan's fish was accompanied by thin slices of kumquat and a variety of vegetables.  He loved it and the bite I had was excellent.  After all that we had no room for dessert.  We had a lovely conversation w/ the people at the adjacent table, Swedish parents visiting their college age son here.  It's the kind of conversation you sometimes fall into while traveling.  Service was seamless, personable and smooth.  The noise level was a bit high because the ceilings are high and the walls are brick.  We enjoyed our evening here.  4.51 rounded up."}
{"text":"Best meal my wife and I have ever enjoyed .
My wife started with the fried ravioli which was so tasty. I started with scallops which just the melted in my mouth. 
Main course wife had the duck which was cooked to perfection and garnished beautifully. I had the bison which was a first for me and man I was not disappointed. Better then filet mingon. For desert we had the a layered apple crisp with ice cream. We toped off the meal with cappuccinos . We both agreed best meal we both have ever enjoyed out. Our waitress was super nice and ambiance was perfect. We like taking our time when out, so this was perfect. Sittings 6 & 9"}
{"text":"Creative, Delicious, Unpretentious

For fans of the Montreal restaurant bring-your-own-bottle of wine experience, the three of us made this our first dinner reservation of a two night stay. This is my fourth time there and it never disappoints. Had the foie gras appetizer with lentils and chips presented on a small chopping board, followed by the veal which was juicy, marinated and a joy to eat, and the mushroom pie with duck confit, with a side order of frites with spicy mayo. - from a July 2016 experience"}
{"text":"Pour les amateurs de Bistro français, le O'thym est parfait! Les plats qu'on y sert sont goûteux, beaux (genre les assiettes sont folles!) et bons! Ça reste des plats vraiment traditionnels, mais tous les ingrédients sont de qualités! Les prix sont acceptables vu la qualité des plats présentés! Le menu écrit à l'ardoise est sujet à changement. Nous avons mangé en entrée un morceau de foie gras poêlé (je vous le recommande fortement) ainsi que les curs de canards (bons, mais peu goûteux!). En repas principal, nous avons goûté le cerf (excellent!!!) et la bavette, qui manquait de pep à mon goût!

Sinon, c'est un apportez votre vin, donc on se ruine pas dans l'alcool! 

Je le recommande!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, byob, slightly pricey, but the quality really overwhelmed the cost. A small menu but one built to cater to a broad range of tastes or dietary restraints.  Our scallop appetizer was perfect- and the fish (Lake Ontario walleye) was done just right and was very tasty.  Bistro atmosphere with an attentive and friendly bilingual staff - wish I could have written this en Francais!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  After a terrible 'fancy' meal the night before, I couldn't have been more impressed with this place.  At first, we couldn't get a reservation (we were calling at 19h30 on a Sat. for a 20h30 reservation, so totally understandable), but they called back and got a table for four in.  It was Apportez Votre Vin (BYOW) so we were able to get two nice burgundies for less than you'd normally spend for shit wine.  Important note here, there is a well stocked SAQ next to the Beaudry Metro stop that we should have hit up (we hit an SAQ Express near the hotel instead)

The service here was incredibly warm and our server stuck to French with the three of us who wanted French service but still spoke English with the person who did not speak French.  I thought it was a nice touch.

We ordered the Oyster special (4/5) which would only have been better if the oysters had a little more flavor, but they were served with a delicious pickled cucumber/radish salad and another salad that I can only guess the contents of but that was so tasty.  

The drop dead dish of the night (and the one I'm going to try to recreate at home) was the Foie Gras, Shallot, and Fig Tatin.  The Foie Gras was cooked perfectly and the flavors blended really well.  I was sad we only got one to share between the four of us. I would seriously go to this place and just get two and then hide under my napkin while I eat them.  

We had four 'Trou Normands\" after our apps, and I thought they tasted great. It was a lemon sorbet sitting in a pool of vodka (so technically not a Normand according to my friend, since that requires Calvados and apple sorbet) but it was good nonetheless.

For the mains, two of us ordered the Lamb and two the Deer Shoulder.  I loved the deer shoulder, which was the perfect medium-rare I'd asked for, and was served with a really delicious sauce (kind of tasted like balsamic reduction but don't quote me) and root veggies.  There wasn't anything left.  I wasn't a fan of the lamb, but I don't seek it out typically and the two lamb eaters were happy.

Overall, I'd say this is my best overall restaurant experience in Montreal. I highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"A must to dine in when in Montreal, Delish, great service, great food and great price. Plus BYOB makes it so reasonable. However, you must make reservations."}
{"text":"The only reason I am withholding the 5th star is because the ambiance was a little tough. Our table was wedged between two others and up against the kitchen - not the most romantic location. The restaurant was very loud (hard to hear conversation across the table) and very dim. However, the food.... It was entirely worth everything previously stated for more of that! Everything ordered was a good life-choice. Everything was fresh, everything was divine - even the water tasted good! Highly recommend...well it all changes based on fresh foods, chef's opinion, and whether you can read French. So, just order what sounds appealing, it will be great!"}
{"text":"I would give the food a 3.5* but since it is a bywo i give it sn overall of 4*.

Although I remembered the food being a lot more tasty when I came here for a private wine tasting and the restaurant was serving small bites.

All dishes come with a cold soup; taste was a bit blend. 

Took a scallop entrée and it was alright,  but didn't like the cucumber mousse that came with it. I don't like cucumber do didn't enjoy the mousse...but you might.

Took the salmon as a main course and it was tasty. it was semi cooked which I like ane it had great flavor."}
{"text":"If you like creativity in  menu , this restaurant is for you. Everything was amazing. I will highly recommend this place ."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and brought everyone from the most strict vegetarian to the biggest meat lover, and everyone has left wishing to come back!

Service is fantastic, BYOB is always a plus, and the food has a unique Quebec flavor to it.  It may be considered french, but you'd be hard pressed to find most of these dishes in your standard french cuisine.

Menu is pretty consistent, with a few specials each day, but the chef will cater a dish to whatever you need.  Although almost nothing on the menu is vegetarian, friends of mine have had dishes made by the chef many times and always loved it.

Make sure you get the Trou Normand in between courses!  A delicious palate cleanser, share at least between 2 people.

A great place to stretch your boundaries, anything on the menu is guaranteed to be great!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good bistro near the B&B i was staying at (Le Simone) and the reviews on this place, though only two, seemed quite good. I tried to walk in and get a table Saturday evening but it was booked up so set a reservation for Monday night. As with many places in the area of Montreal where I was staying it was BYOB but not too hard to find a Couche-Tard close by to get a few bottles of wine.

The place has a great atmosphere and the night I went it was  raining and my group was by the window. Being from Arizona I am absolutely fascinated by seeing rain so for me, a great spot, but it is a long restaurant and I am sure if asked one could get a table toward the back.

All the food my group of four ordered was delicious. One person ordered the salad with sautéed  duck gizzards and they were melt in your mouth tender. I had to try the foi gras (might have spelled that wrong which on this night was served room temperature and mixed with a bit of honey that gave it a slightly sweet texture (the other option is the more usual sautéed version).  I was on a duck roll that evening and also had the grilled duck breast that was served (correctly) quite rare and sliced thin and then fanned out. Two other people at the  table had the salmon and thought it was well done.

I liked this place enough that when I go back to Montreal I plan on a return visit. It has that classic bistro feel that makes you feel that you could just as well be in Paris as Montreal (viva la France!). I promise you, if you go, you will not be disappointed! :-)"}
{"text":"I wouldn't dare rate this place after only 1 visit. BYOB is great. Server was great. Food was very good but to be honest my entree had so much going on that it was hard to taste the ingredients. Place was packed when we went. I was only visiting so I cannot return anytime soon. Be sure to tip the bouncer a couple of bucks. Wait, wrong place."}
{"text":"Place is BYOB which is awesome! Though the food is definitely high quality, the decor/ambience is more casual and even a little hipster. The restaurant was pretty loud and a bit crowded (probably due to the BYOB).

Had the lamb with honey and cumin. Lamb was perfectly cooked and very flavorful. Portions were also generous. The foie gras appetizer was amazing. Also had the duck gizzard as an appetizer which was less impressive."}
{"text":"Flawless experience. I was seated right away, and my server didn't assume anything about my language skills- he asked if I'd prefer a French or English menu. Of course I wish I could read French! I tried my best. 

Everything on the menu is seasonal and fresh, so there were a few specials. I thought the Fish of the Day (cod) would be amazing since it came with morel mushrooms, but my server was careful to check for any dairy content. The sauce for the fish is a cream sauce, so I ended up getting the seared scallops as my appetizer, and the celery root with chanterelles as my main. I asked to add morels to the celery root dish and it was fantastic. I loved the crispy fried chickpeas that were sprinkled on top of the celery root dish. The umami of all the dishes was incredible. 

The big windows were a great way to watch the storm roll in, and enjoy the warm atmosphere inside. I would really like to come back for brunch!"}
{"text":"Loved O'Thym.

There must be some magic here cause the anything with eggs is good. 
The desserts were great and the main food on point."}
{"text":"Called last minute - was browsing and google searching for good foie in the surrounding area. Note that it is a BYOB.

This restaurant came up on a Montreal blog. Called and was greeted by a friendly staff member - they were happy to accommodate us.

Arrived at 9pm to a packed house. Ambience is clean, simple, but appealing. Decor was fairly simple but effective (simple wooden tables, some hanging lights, and a few mirrors on the wall)

As we have seen at Joe Beef and Liverpool house there is a chalkboard with the menu. Pleasant surprise when we were offered an English menu. 

Appetizers were of course a double helping of seared foie gras that we shared. Prepared with onion confit purée, pear, sunflower seeds and lentils. Delicious. Juicy. Yes please!

We also had a lamb fried sweetbreads served with endive salad and pumpkin seeds and honey & aioli. Found this to be tasty but a little rich for my taste.

The fish of the day was a haddock served with carrots, fiddleheads, Brussels sprouts and a grain the name of which eludes me at the moment. This was an absolute triumph. Great texture, and the fish was light, flaky, and flavourful. This combined well with the texture from the vegetables and accompaniments.

10/10 would repeat. Also very reasonably priced with apps in the 13-19 dollar range and mains in the range of 25-35."}
{"text":"The food here is hit and miss. When they miss they miss big! 
I have eaten here on several occasions. The food is usually good but have had some bad experiences. We kept giving them the benefit of the doubt and going back because it is so close and bring your own wine. The meal we had there on the weekend will be our last."}
{"text":"Excellent well balanced delicious dishes, service and experience! Had the fiddlehead salad, celery steak w lentil, duck confit, beef shoulder sous vide, and chocolate ganache w blueberries for dessert."}
{"text":"This is one of the hidden gem of the Gay Village. I am surprise I don't go there often. The place is not huge but the food is delicious. The service was pretty neat and the ambiance was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Fabulous brunch spot with local organic fare, done with artistry and care. We started with the beet salad and a side of the O'Thym smoked trout...which we ate before I remembered to photograph. Fresh juice of the moment: red & yellow beet with pear, excellent coffee. Our party of four ordered: the Vegthali with quinoa porridge, Wellington Beef of chopped Wagyu & chorizo - or as we thought, \"pain au chocolate but with a delicious meat filling...\" Yum!, grilled cheese with curds -wow!, grilled flank with sweet patatas bravas and Guinea fowl egg -awesome! The steak was perfectly heated until it tasted good.
Next time we will bring our own wine/cava to mix with the fresh squeezed OJ!"}
{"text":"heard about this restaurant from the owner of the B&B we stayed at - make sure to call ahead for a reservation or else you might not get in. there is a SAQ wine shop right off the Beaudry metro stop you can stop at first to pick up a bottle of wine since it's BYOB, and it's only a few minutes walk from there. 
so glad we braved the cold and windy weather to get dinner here, the food is delicious. the menu is in both french and english, and the servers will also tel you the daily specials in both languages, when we went, the tartare of the day was duck (which we got), and the fish of the day was cod (which we also got). 
highly recommend the dishes we ordered - seared scallops, duck tartare, cod and risotto blend, deer with mushrooms and blueberry sauce, and don't forget the dessert! we shared the crime brûlée with maple liquor, omg so good. 
some notes - it was my first time trying deer and this dish did not disappoint. I ordered it medium rare and there was NO gameyness (sp?) at all - it just tasted like a very very very tender piece of
meat. the sauce was very nicely seasoned and the mushrooms really balanced out the dish well. 
we also got free bread and butter for the table, as wel as their complimentary soup, which was squash and cardamom. I didn't love it but it was a nice gesture. also, they will ask if you want a palate cleanser in between the two meals, we didn't order it but did see the tables eat it. 
enjoy - we certainly did!"}
{"text":"Fantastic French Canadian bistro with local seasonal cuisine that was excellent! Loved the flank steak with fiddle heads (new to me, delish!). They also served a gazpacho as an amuse bouche which was great. We tried their scallops and a fiddle head salad, both yummy. Bonus is it is BYOB so we brought a Chateau Grand Jean! Perfect!"}
{"text":"We spent an evening here and between five of us had most of the items on the menu. Rave reviews for everything, but in particular the scallop started and the duck main. In all, a wonderful, well curated menu, excellent ambience, and warm and helpful staff. And with a bring-your-own wine policy, this restaurant is excellent value."}
{"text":"Amazing food,  my boyfriend and i totally loved it! The atmosphere is good, the decor is simple but nice. The service was so-so but it was a friday night and the place was full. We would totally love to go back and experience it again!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant 10 years ago during college and i remembered it was scruptious. Now 10 years later, same quality and i am astonished that they managed to maintain the great food all these years. My starter was so delicious, a sea snail with foie gras. The entre i ordered was a delicious perfectly cooked wild meat that was cerf i believe, and to top it the chocolate cookie sandwich was D licious, the creme bruler was also good."}
{"text":"This restaurant gets essentially everything right for me.  First it is byob - something popular where I am from in NJ but less so in Montreal.  I love the option of bringing my own bottle and I am sure that the clientele of this restaurant does as well because every table had brought a bottle.  I wish more restaurants in this wonderful city had the same policy.
But on to the food!  We started with a cauliflower soup.  It was on the house and very much appreciated.  For an appetizer, I had the scallop ceviche and my friend had a roasted cauliflower dish to start.  Both were very good - complex, fresh and ample.  I appreciate that the restaurant had about 6 appetizers.  By not trying to do it all, they are able to focus on doing well what they do. This approach is their success with main courses of which there may have been 7 or 8.  I had the duck and my friend the salmon.  Again, delicious, complex, fresh and ample.  There were three desserts and we had two of them - the maple crème brûlée and the ice cream sandwich. These desserts were as delicious as they were simple.  If I could make just one suggestion in terms of the menu, I would include one appetizer salad.  Although I enjoyed a number of the options, others might prefer a little less animal protein.  
On to the service!  The waiter was attentive, cheerful and helpful.  Another member of the staff opened up beer that we had brought.  It was clear that the wait staff was working together and team-oriented.  An upbeat, professional staff always sets a good tone for a good dining experience and this group enhanced the evening.
Finally a word about the ambiance.  The restaurant is open and the ceiling is very high.  The lighting was calming and attractive.  The wood floors are a vintage touch yet the mirrors seemed more modern.  The only suggestion would be to rethink the music.  The same jazzy background music track played essentially all evening and became a bit tedious.  The restaurant should consider switching the music up a bit.
I am giving the restaurant 5 stars and will certainly be back on my next trip.  I really enjoyed my evening there!"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. I especially liked the deserts. You can bring your own wine which is great! The food was a little more expensive than I expected, I paid $65 Canadian for 3 courses, which is not bad at all, but slightly more expensive than some equivalents in Montreal. If you like good food, it is definitely an address to keep in mind!"}
{"text":"Wonderful meals and stuffs! The dishes are artistic!!!
Please be noted that they don't offer any alcohols at the restaurant."}
{"text":"It was a random choice of that day to walk in here, but it turns out to be one of the best brunch menus i had so far in Montreal :) Croissant Wellington had a very good balance of the sauce and the crispy coat of the croissants . My friend had the dougnuts with pork bacon or something and that was super good too. Overall, the service and the food are amazing. I wikl definitely go back."}
{"text":"There are 3 types of BYOB restaurant I like: 1) Good value (like Khyber Passe or Pajab Palace)  2) creative & comfort food (smoking valee)  3) classic french (Quartier General)
This place definitely embodied all 3 types of BYOB restaurant i like! 
I had the deer tartare and the duck main dish, both wonderfully flavored and very fresh. My boyfriend's deer steak was at a new high level - it was better than the one we had at Chez Chose, which is my favorite restaurant. 
Can't wait to come back and try the brunch as well."}
{"text":"Très belle expérience en groupe pour l'anniversaire d'un ami. Excellents plats, vraiment tout était bon. Service un peu lent. Possiblement le meilleur AVV à Montréal."}
{"text":"great great place to eat in the village. One of my favourites French food restaurants. Nice menu, affordable and bring your own wine."}
{"text":"Exceptional meal! The food, service and atmosphere were all great. The food was delicious and service was efficient and attentive. 

I went for brunch with my sisters and we were all pleasantly surprised. Although we didn't bring any alcohol many tables brought a bottle of bubbly to mix with their fresh pressed orange juice. 

My sister ordered the grilled cheese that they serves with a kale and Brussels sprout salad topped with a poached egg. They got a 13 year old that hates kale to eat and finish the salad!

Their dish of the day was eggs baked with boudin noir with an Israeli couscous with cheese and potatoes. Once again delicious. Every dish really highlighted the quality of the local ingredients. 

I will definitely come back and try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"What a top notch BYOB place!! Have the tartar - but menu changes often! For a 6pm sit down, we came early at about 5:45 and they were happy to allow us to sit and start with the wine. Everything about the place was excellent. Service especially was great! For a place with two sittings, they did not rush us at all - all the food was perfectly timed for us even though we were at a different pace than others and were splitting dishes"}
{"text":"Very good food. Meat heavy and loud place, but the quality is there and the price is right. It's BYOB, so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"O'Thym, o wow!  Subtle, simple but so tasty.  I had a hard time choosing just one main dish because everything looked interesting. I got the lamb chops with honey and cumin.  I expected it to be smothered in sauce but it was done with a light hand which really let the quality of the meat shine through.  My dining companion had a beautiful filet mignon with a cognac and garlic sauce. The portions were the perfect size to satisfy but not make you feel gorged. Our waitress was great, very patient and well-informed.  She brought us a free starter of cold carrot turmeric soup which beautifully set the stage for the rest of the meal.  The maple creme brulée was divine.

O'Thym is BYOB but there is a SAQ right across from the Beaudry metro stop and they are open until 9 pm."}
