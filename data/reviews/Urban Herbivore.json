{"text":"Rude service. Generally un-organized and messy management. You can clearly see that their utensils are not sterile as the water containing the utensils is brown and floating with leftover food particles."}
{"text":"I got the lunch soup and salad combo, but the same lunch deal at Hibiscus nearby was cheaper and better-tasting. The made-to-order salad that the girl in front of me got looked really good though!"}
{"text":"I make a point to stop by here whenever I am near the market.  I am a huge fan of the muffins, coffee, and tempeh \"BLT\".  As others mentioned, it's not cheap, but you get what you pay for, and what you get here are large helpings of vegan food made with delicious, healthy, quality ingredients.  To me, that's well worth it.   Contrary to other reviews, I've always found the service here to be quite pleasant."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. I ordered the lunch special, which took a really long time to arrive and was not good.  The tempeh was burned to a crisp, and the greens had an unpleasant metallic watery taste. And while I was waiting I saw a prep cook put his hand in his mouth and spit on the ground like he had just picked something from his teeth with his bare hands, then went back to prepping food.  Disgusting.  The service was slow, and the food was bad.  I can see no reason to go back."}
{"text":"Totally worth it, amazing ingredient choices for the bowls and the portinos are huge! I usually get a takeout bowl so i can eat then make another meal out of the other -- done like tht, the price is a great deal. I've come here many times and never been disappointed with the food.   Only problem is they don't have enough staff for the lines they get, so the women at the cashier leaves to makes salads or vice versa leaving you unattended for a while.  Also Beware the muffins -- the salads are super healthy and very low calorie for the portions, but the muffins are over 1000 calories each!!!  For salad quality, definitely a stape for a healthy, filling meal for me."}
{"text":"overcharged by $21. how did they miss that when it happens all the time, they claim, due to people mistaking the tip process. ??  who gives a tip when there's no server. going up to a counter to self serve is not service.  I returned twice to sort it out.  1st time - she said it happens all the time & they usually pay back people right away. Although I had my MC statement to show date & amount billed she didn't offer to sort it out & told me to come back with the receipt. OK. I left but discussed it with another store manager who said having the credit card statement was good enough, that they pay people that way all the time if there's a dispute discovered, that I should return & get my money back so I did.  2nd time - they waffled & whined making me wait while she called Encore - the owner. I waited & waited. She had the money counted out to give me but suddenly changed her mind deciding to wait for the owner's OK.  I felt very uncomfortable. If they had paid me what they owe me I would've left it at that but they made me wait for nothing. It is very inconvenient to have to return there. I don't live near there.  I will call MC & not pay them at all. I don't have more time to waste on this. I dispute the amount & due to their playing around, whining, waffling, wasting my time, not taking me seriously as a future customer - they lose my business.  I'll let MC sort it out with them.  I'm not paying for what appears to be deliberate deception on their part knowing people are unaware of a tip fee at a food court vendor.  I'm a vegan outreach activist as well so it is very hard to limit my food options even further in a meat dominating world.  They wanna laugh about wasting people's time they lose. Not good business practices."}
{"text":"I've left old review from a few years ago below, but today i've come back to drop a star.  I used to love this place for their amazing portions and variety of options, but sometime last year they reduced their portion sizes and made all the amazing options they offered \"extra\", meaning you have to pay 1-2$ each to add them onto your salad bowl.   Very disappointed and don't go back much anymore. Feel cheated to know how good it was before and to see what they give offer now (or to know to get the same i have to pay more)..  Not what they used to be..."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed going here today for the first time. As if the gluten-free vegan food wasn't glorious enough, exceptional service and charming encounter with a certain charismatic staff member, a tall blonde-ish gentleman [you know who you are]. It's a pleasure to meet others who appreciate the delight maraschino can bring. Thanks for making our day- we'll definitely be back because of you!"}
{"text":"I had a sandwich to go and even though the server told me he cut it in half, only one slice of bread was cut, the other was still in one piece. It was impossible to eat, I had oily veggies all over my hands and chin. The bread was nice but the filling was very bland and I did not enjoy my lunch at all. I guess I could try the salad some time, but then again there's Hibiscus close by so why would I get my salad anywhere else?"}
{"text":"I eat lunch here a few times a week.  Portions are very generous and the food is always fresh and delicious.  I usually get the salad bowl and it's enough food for two meals.  The house made kimchi is the best.  Their soups are also great - tasty and hearty.  Everything is organic and prices are so reasonable.  The staff are friendly and efficient so you never wait long even when it's busy."}
{"text":"As a long time vegetarian, and long time fan of the Kensington location, I was appalled by the quality of the tempeh sandwich I got from the Eaton Centre location.  The tempeh was incredibly dry and tasteless - it barely resembled tempeh - and the sandwich had no interesting additions -- simply some lettuce and tomato. If not for the dressing, it would have been inedible. I'm doubly saddened by the quality, as this type of food will not encourage non-vegetarians to seek out veggie alternatives.  Unfortunately for Urban Herbivore, I will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Food portions are relatively big but food itself not sanitary, service is horrible.  The food is completely not sanitary; you can see the tongs being used over and over again and immersed in the same container of water, making the water full of left-over food particles from many different customers.  Do not come to this place if you would like to be treated like a customer. The blonde girl who served us was frowning the entire time and had an attitude so impatient you'd thought she was the customer. You might be tired from work but if you can't handle proper customer service, don't work in the field."}
{"text":"Really good portions but confusing service (are they smiling at me or are they smiling and thinking piss off?) and sandwhiches are very messy and difficult to eat overall. Kinda not well cleaned as well. The cups are often not cleaned properly with lipstick stains and grime at the bottom... etc. But PORTIONS!"}
{"text":"I'm done with this place.   Every time I go something is wrong or something is out even when I'm ordering lunch before the rush.   If I order something that is burnt I'm told it's supposed to be that way. Burnt doesn't taste good.   The person at the cash didn't know what juices are in the ice box in front of him.    I also think that the pricey juices are all watered down.  And getting a receipt is an ordeal too.   The food is ok and some of the staff is helpful but you can easily find a vegan sandwich or bowl somewhere close enough for cheaper.   $35 for a take out lunch with watered down drinks  for 2 people  is not worth dealing with abrasive staff."}
{"text":"Really big salads, decent price. My only complaint is that when I went they had run out of tofu. A fairly big oops for a vegetarian place."}
{"text":"I am addicted to the Possum bowl. Legitimately addicted!!! I have it once a week. All of the sandwiches and drinks are amazing too... that coconut bacon!! Ugh so good. I crave it almost every single day (lol) not to mention the cupcakes!! Those devilish treats are soooo sinfully amazing.. Don't kid yourself a cupcake is a cupcake even though it's vegan ahah :) this is my go-to spot for food in this area. The staff is super fast and efficient, always friendly and on the ball. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"First day in town, first meal: first ever bout of FOOD POISONING from a Tempeh sandwich with Grapefruit juice.  Server/cashier had awful attitude, there was some construction work in the back --loud enough to hear inside due to the open design between spaces.  1,000% avoid at all costs!  (Regret not having a sweet potato burrito across the st at Big Fat Burrito)"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for lunch. Full stop.  For $11 inc tax I get a large delicious fresh salad bowl and a giant spelt muffin. I used to get their sandwiches, which are huge (always leftovers) but since I've become wheat-free the salad bowl does it for me.   For a salad bowl, you choose your greens (a mix, arugula or spinach) then six different ingredients (most of them have been flavoured or dressed up) to go inside: barley, tofu, shredded carrots, beets, satueed mushrooms, asparagus, potatoes, chickpeas, cabbage, broccoli, roasted red peppers, artichokes, etc. Although most of the staples stay the same these change from time to time. Then to finish it off you can choose to put some nuts and seeds on top and a dressing, I prefer the citrus.   Because I'm always playing around with the ingredients, it's like having a different dish every time and each ingredient is a flavour explosion in my mouth on its own. It's also a way for me to experiment with flavour profiles.   I've never had the grain bowl, but I like to take things slow.  They have three kinds of muffins: apple/cranberry, sweet potato/date and or the apple/walnut. They are large and delicious although sometimes can be a bit on the dry side.  All the ingredients are made fresh in-house. If you want to go all out, get one of their fresh juices. To treat myself because another $5.50 is stretching the lunch budget I had a blueberry, citrus and mint one and it was so sour, the squish your face till wrinkles in your forehead develop kind of sour, but then it hits you with a refreshing kick and you're like, \"whoa, this is the best fresh juice I've ever tasted!\". Those also change daily.  I'd give them a 5 star but all of their tempeh contain soy which has wheat and they don't always have non-soy tofu either. I don't know why they don't use wheat-free soy if they're already going the extra mile to be fresh and healthy."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a a mocha cupcake and mango ice tea for a snack.  Very delicious as vegan junk food goes!  Not all  vegan food is good for you for those none plant based customers , everything  in moderation!  I will be back to  try a grilled veggie sandwich."}
{"text":"Awesome avocado sandwich!  A great place if you are eating alone as you can sit at the window seating and watch the world go by..."}
{"text":"Had the tempeh sandwich the other day at the market location. Totally delicious. The salads look amazing too. Decent prices for what you get."}
{"text":"Had the avocado sandwich. Super delicious, slightly overpriced (but did come with a lot of avocado). The service was friendly, but the wait time for my sandwich was ridiculous. Waited almost 15 minutes. They have to work on that."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for awhile and the service is 90% really bad. Attitude problems, unfriendly, not enough service, always out of ingredients, out of dressing, inconsistent plates (one day it's well prepared, the next it thrown together in a mess with meager servings), they often forget who's next and at lunch time it's complete chaos.  If these guys could get there sh*t together it would acceptable. As it is be prepared to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had the avocado sandwich on the whole wheat bun - a great lunch choice! I liked how the sandwich came with a small side of salad.  Love the bright interior and seats along the window. It's great for people watching while munching on your food or chatting with friends.   There are additional seats (larger tables) behind the counter towards the kitchen. The only inconvenient thing was that you have to pass through the kitchen to get to the washroom."}
{"text":"I love Urban Herbivore - they have a variety of fresh lunch options, such as sandwiches, salads, grain bowls, and soups.   Sandwiches: - come on olive or whole grain ciabatta with pesto and tahini - good flavours: bbq tofu, sesame tempeh, celery root, avocado, grilled veg - my fave is the celery root!   Salads: - Mix of any six ingredients (can only choose one of tofu, tempeh, celery root), plus lots of fun mix-ins - black bean salad, sesame snap peas, asparagus, broccoli, beets, chick peas, cabbage, etc... they're all very flavourful - not just plain, raw veg.  - pick any dressing - i love the citrus - they recommend ginger.  - pick your greens: mixed, spinach/arugula or just spinach  They also have awesome large muffins - my fave is the sweet potato/date. If you're getting soup to go, you can buy one of their large mason jars of soup.   Only downside is that it can be a bit slow on busy weekends - You do have to lineup twice, people are SO slow when choosing what they want on their salads."}
{"text":"It's great to see a place selling healthy tasty food in the middle of a food court.  The price was reasonable, and the tofu sandwich was more than enough to fill me up.  Plenty of fresh salad as well, but watch out for the juices, they can be a bit tart"}
{"text":"What happened?  You uses to be delicious. My husband just bought me back a grain bowl. I was so excited because they used to be delicious but it is aweful. Are there new owners?"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, a little pricey but worth it overall in my mind"}
{"text":"This place used to be great. But we're talking years ago. (Like, 5+ years ago.) Over the past handful of years, there has been a gradual, consistent decrease in food quality and service, and a gradual increase in prices.  The food has never been great. But when you used to be able to get a huge sandwich for $9 (including tax!), it was worth ignoring the so-so spreads and toppings, and the sometimes-stale bread. But now the prices are much higher, the sandwiches are much smaller, and the toppings remain mediocre.  Years ago, there also used to be a much friendlier 'vibe' inside the restaurant. But these days it's just not very friendly.  I'm giving an extra star because Urban Herbivore used to be good!"}
{"text":"I would give this spot 5 stars, except they have TWICE sent my bf into extreme allergy reaction. We have told them he is allergic to nuts when we go and only one of the three times he's been there he has walked away safely.  I am a selfish girl though and go on my own now and love it. But be warned you poor nut-allergic people!"}
{"text":"OMG. Avocado sandwich. That's kind of all I have to say. But really - all their sandwiches are amazing (grilled tempeh is delicious too!) and worth the price. The curry bowls and juices are great too. One of the best vegan spots in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing!   Service is seriously questionable.  I absolutely love this place but lately I can't believe how I'm being treated when I go there. There are two girls in particular who are so rude. Miserable in fact. They have both been there a while. The new staff are friendly and always smiley.   Twice this week I gave gone there for lunch and asked for a grain bowl with quinoa. Both times the quinoa wasn't ready. Today The girl at the cash says, quinoa isn't ready yet and walks away to do something else. I ask how long it will be. Her answer... Its not even close to being ready. She then proceeds to give me a miserable look.  Normally in a customer service setting, one might say something like - no sorry the quinoa isn't ready yet, it will still be another 30 minutes or so. Can I get you something else?   Service as of late makes you feel like a total inconvenience to some of these staff. They obviously don't want to be there and they sure make it known.   Not sure who is managing this place but they should have their staff wear name tags so that we can advise them of those who are bringing their business down.   I know my issue sounds menial however this has been a long time coming. I come twice a week and have been for over a year. The customer service is getting worse. And as a regular return customer, I and everyone else should be treated better. Management needs to address this."}
{"text":"Usually get the grain bowl which is amazing. Tried to coconut curry today with tempeh. Tempeh is good, curry is okay, not spicy though or flavoured enough. Squash chunks are kind flavourless. Would have preferred chickpeas or lentils or whatever they put in thai curry."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in awhile, and by that I mean maybe a month and a half which is an abnormally long time for me to go without my Urban Herbivore fix!  I am OBSESSED with the grilled tempeh sandwich, in fact I'm craving it right now and desperately wishing that they were open right now and that I lived closer to the market. The service is usually pretty good. The staff is usually pretty friendly. The restaurant is very eco-friendly, utilizing sky-lights as a light source and fans in the summer. They also ask you to bring back any jars from purchased sauces, jellies, etc., so they can reuse them. Yay, recycling!   And although I could rant about the tempeh sandwich for hours, I should mention that everything there is quite delectable. They also have a selection of yummy vegan and gluten-free baked goods, AMAZING and refreshing juices, salads, other sandwiches.   And there is a washroom there although it's not quite obvious. Ask the staff and they'll point it out. In the summer there is a bit of seating outside, but no matter if you're in or out people watching is easy to do (and c'mon it's Kensington Market...the best people-watching place in the city).   Definitely recommend that you try this spot out!"}
{"text":"I work just around the corner from this place, and I have to say I smile a bit when I know i'm gonna pass by for lunch or even just to swing by to grab those delicious sweet potato date muffins.  great food, and good times :)"}
{"text":"Yummy. Really fresh stuff, great bread LOTS of variety in terms of vegetarian and vegan food."}
{"text":"i am a member of og yoga and regularly buy drinks and food at uh, but sadly i feel i will need to not give them my business anymore.  the low level of service that exists in what seems like all of their staff is horrorifying.  i have now watched the girl who is working (i think her name is caroline) send mulitple people away (6) because she closes at 7...the 8pm closing time listed is apparently when she is free from the apparent cage she is in and no one will get in the way of her freedom.  i have heard the owners are concentrating on their new location in the eaton center because the reviews have been great for food but bad for service, seems to be a pattern.  good news for sunshine across the street where i get served with a smile and thanked for my business."}
{"text":"At first glance the prices seemed a bit high ($10 for what I expected would be a small rice bowl), but after getting our meal it was actually a bargain! The portions were huge, the food was very fresh, and the ambience was great. And very kid friendly!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I discovered Urban Herbivore. Great, fresh food for any Vegan eater."}
{"text":"10 years ago the food was much better. The portions were larger. The prices were lower. But these days it's way more common to get small, often stale meals.   Plenty of other good vegan options in Toronto at this point!"}
{"text":"Dearest Urban Herbivore,  I simply had to write this on here. I used to love and still do all of your food, especially the Moroccan and Thai curry stews with the power grains. Your Eaton Centre location has become one of my to go places for lunch! However over the last couple of months, your orders have become a true hit and miss. Over the last couple of time I had ordered the stews, there was so little stew compared to the grains that it ended up being a dry moroccan stew flavoured bowl of grains. I went back several times and had a bit more stew added. Today (May 26 2016) I went for lunch there again after a 2-month long hiatus and took the Thai Curry stew to go. Once I opened my bowl, I realized that there was half the usual size of stew and grains. I was actually shocked. I am wondering what has changed over the last several months at your Eaton Centre location. It is not hard to standardize the number of spoons/ladel scoops that is acceptable for one standard portion size. I am very sad to admit, but I have to say that you have lost one very devoted customer as of today. I hope you take this little review of mine into consideration! [the 2 stars are for the stinginess and not food quality and taste!]"}
{"text":"Rude staff and not too fresh. For salad go to Hibiscus instead!"}
{"text":"How in God's name have I not written a review for UH yet, when you can see my face there at least 3x a week?   You: \"3x a week, and you only gave it 3 stars??\" Me: \"Thank you, Captain Obvious. I'll tell you why.\"  There are two things on the menu that deserve 5 star ratings, and the two things that keep me coming back:  1. MUFFINS. MUFF. INNNS. Delectable, huge, unparalleled VEGAN MUFFINS. Crunchy on top, often still warm, beautiful muffins. My favourite is blueberry flax, or any variation of apple. The sweet potato date is not to be missed, but too rich for me to eat on the regular. 2. Jarred soups. I love the tomato basil so much.   4 star selections: The grilled avocado sandwich is delectable, but sometimes hit and miss for me. I much prefer making my own at home these days. They also grind up some nice juices.   2 star selections: As far as their salads and grain bowls - meh for me. Those are the kind of dishes I like to have complete control over, and make them at home. Also, sometimes I think the servers hate their job because smiles do not come cheap.   Once during pedestrian Sunday, Herbivore was serving up vegetarian burgers outside. I had one, and want more. Please do that again, Urban Herbivore. You don't even have to smile."}
{"text":"I don't see why NOT to give this place a 5 because it offers me convenience, fast healthy nourishment and an intact wallet. I've never really been a \"regular\" at any place but I felt like I was starting to become one here so sometimes I lower my head as I walk by and reluctantly get something else at the food court...  Favourite things to get are grain bowl and salad bowl. For folks who argue that salads can't be a meal - I'm tellin' ya, I may be small but I've got food endurance and good chewing skills that lets me be a champ and eat lots! Their salad is filling!   I love that there's so much choice in toppings - tofu, artichoke, raw beets are must haves for me. They have avocados sometimes at no extra charge (what!? subway should learn this trick) which is just bloody brilliant. Dressing-wise, I've tried the whole lot and I now stick to EVOO, balsamic and sriraccha. Winning meal right there; you're welcome.  Also have tried their Moroccan stew which had great flavour but would not easily replace my bowls.  I was about to say super friendly staff - but I can see that not everyone might click with them. However I've stood in line and observed them deal with pretty tricky customers with a lot of patience, so, I think they are golden."}
{"text":"Typical Hippy attitude to running a business - always out of stuff you would like to order. Staff is super slow. Food is OK, under seasoned."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant.  Among the worst service I've ever experienced in a restaurant. I asked for a citrus drink form the menu. The cashier snappily asked what flavour. After I asked which flavours were available, the cashier pointed to a bowl behind the counter and said 'Look!'. The lady making my food bowl seemed very distracted and I had to correct my order multiple times. On top of all that, they lost my receipt.  The food portions were generous and the selection was varied. The taste mixed - some of the items were good, though some (asparagus, beets) did not taste fresh."}
{"text":"This place is a vegan heaven. Large salad/grain bowls, gluten-free in house baked bread and freshly squeezed lemonade. I recommend the avocado sandwich, which comes with a side salad of beets and greens. Everything is delicious, and portions are very reasonable. I find that the service varies depending on who is at the counter. Seating is sort of limited if you come for lunch. My only downside is the prices, compared to other vegetarian restaurants, is kind of high. That being said i still go here regularly. You should too."}
{"text":"I stumbled into Urban Herbivore on a Tuesday after discovering that Hibiscus was closed (tragic moan). UH is no Hibiscus. Its menu is made up of hearty veg fare (big grain bowls, soup, stews and sandwiches) that's fresh and decently flavoured. The food won't blow your mind, but it's filling and reasonably priced. Seating is limited to a few tables upstairs and counter seats along the windows. It's not the most comfortable place to eat, and service can be brusque, but this is an order-and-go kind of place. As I was eating my barbecue tempeh sandwich (good but un-noteworthy) I couldn't help but think that I could've made something better in my own kitchen."}
{"text":"I'm always so happy to treat myself to some Urban Herbivore. I do have to allow myself ample digestion time because they are very generous with portions and the yummiest things like the sweet potatoes and tofu are pretty heavy so you kind of just want to nap afterwards usually.  I find everything here to be fresh, flavourful and filling. I really enjoy the bowls, I like the amount of options to build your own. They can be a little scatterbrained about the orders sometimes and some staff are better than others. But there are some long term staff who are AWESOME and I always look forward to our brief interactions. I'm just happy I feel that I know my food is going to be vegan & delicious in a food court.   Also, wtf, their cupcakes are the best... ever? What kind of magic are they wielding there."}
{"text":"The food is ok, but could be better. Ie: the Moroccan stew - why NO fresh herbs or greens? It's screaming for colour and a piece of cilantro/parsley  (anything) would go a long way!"}
{"text":"Please note this review is based ONLY on the cookies!   I had their cookies today at an event which brought them in. I have not been to the actual and can't comment on the price. The cookies (I admit I tried them all) were delicious! You could tell they had lots of wonderful quality ingredients and they were moist, chewy and oh so yummy......I've been thinking about them all day!"}
{"text":"I ordered a custom bowl for $10 including tax. The portions were huge that I only ate half of the bowl! Very reasonable pricing considering all the ingredients are vegetables, rices, salad, etc. I would recommend this place for anyone who is looking for a healthier option in the Eaton Centre. The only downside is the service. I was confused where to pay after I received my food. The staff took a long time to realize I was ready to pay."}
{"text":"Ok, I will start off by saying maybe this review is not that fair, because it isn't based on my experience, but more my 5 year olds.  We go here and my 5 year old daughter is \"excited\" by the selection of peas and carrots.  So being the awesome parents that we are, we decide to ask the servers if we can order a small portion for her.  I don't care about paying for a small portion - I will pay, but I know she is 5 years old, she won't eat much, so why waste food.    We are told NO, you can only have a honking huge portion in our extra large container.  Seriously?  WTF...ok, so we order this huge salad, which could feed her entire kindergarten class.  Does it taste good?  Not really, probably because we let her pick all the toppings...haha...maybe that was not a good idea.  Anyways, I am giving Urban Herbivore 1 star because they don't like kids who are excited about vegetables.  Any place that doesn't give a 5 year old a high five for loving vegetables deserves 1 star (or less).  So next time Urban Herbivore, please hire people who encourage kids to eat healthy...not a bunch of stuck up idiots..."}
{"text":"I used to go here for lunch all the time and have been really pleased with it. I always found it a bit pricey but was willing to pay the price for a big bowl of veggies.  However, since changing their menu I must say I'm quite disappointed. They decreased the number of toppings available for the salad/grain bowls from 7 to 6, and are now charging an additional $2.50 if you want tofu, tempe, grilled veg or avocado on your bowl...bringing the overall price to $13 or more.   I heard another customer expressing disappointment over the price increase while decreasing the available toppings, and the staff member looked at her blankly and curtly said, \"food is expensive\".   So, overall, although they have a decent product, the price increase combined with the staff's \"I don't give a shit about you\" approach, I may find a new lunch spot."}
{"text":"Much much MUCH better than the eaton store location.  Good on-the-go vegan cafe, and ill definitely keep coming back. The salads are huge- they take me like 45 minutes to finish. The sandwiches are also very good.  You need to try their lemon tahini dressing, it is DIVINE.  Just, love!"}
{"text":"Epic portion: epically delicious and sized. I ordered a salad on foodora and it was enough for 2 meals. The ingredients were very fresh and the combination was interesting.  Fresh peas in a salad... this may be my new fave!  I'll be going back."}
{"text":"A salad done right, can be the best thing ever. This place does their salads right. They are so filling and full of flavour, they make you feel energized, and give you that radiant, healthy glow. I always get a salad, but I've gotten a sandwich once which was just alright. I've never tried anything else on the menu because the salad is just so good. The baked goods are quite good from the many free samples I've had and 1-2 cupcakes I've bought but I'm not much of a sweet tooth so I don't normally buy them.   When you order a salad you choose your greens (baby mixed greens, kale, and possible arugula/spinach). I think you can mix them as well. I always get simple mixed greens, and I get the BBQ tofu which you pay extra for as well. It's the best tasting tofu I have ever tried, I even ask for extra sometimes. Then you can choose 6 toppings. I usually get kimchi, the very finely shredded carrot mixed with something else (not to be confused with the julienned carrots), avocado, beets, marinated mushrooms and cucumber. Then you choose nuts (I just get the mixed nuts), and a dressing (I always get the carrot sesame which is so delicious and really makes the salad).  The portion is huge, very filling, and you can definitely share it with someone. If it's just myself, I usually save some for later. I believe you can get half portions as well which is a good option. It's about 12$ for the full sized salad.   The atmosphere is really nice, has high ceilings, hard-wood floors, big windows, a lot of light, hanging ferns, and definitely has a yoga studio vibe. it is in the Octopus Garden holistic health centre and yoga studio, so there are lots of yoga-type people coming in and out of class. Sometimes it seems a little exclusive, but I'm too busy enjoying my salad and nice atmosphere to really care that much.   You can also get ready made juice which was made that day or the day before, which is usually quite good, but pricy and there are usually only 2 options to choose from. If you want a fresh made juice with the ingredients of your choice, I would suggest first buying your juice at the Sunshine juice bar/health food store across the street. It's also pricey, but organic and you have more choice, and it's delicious every time. Then bring your juice to Urban Herbivore and drink it with your salad.   This is a casual, take out atmosphere, and a good place for quick solo lunches on the go. You can also get it to go in a nice box."}
{"text":"I am the furthest thing from a vegan but thought this would be a good place for a quick lunch. I had the rice bowl after being told that they didn't have quinoa.   Fine, no problem they have a list of things you can add to your bowl so I named off a few \"no, we don't have that, just order from what you see.\" Umm what? Isn't that a menu? You advertise 20 things as possible ingredients and have 11 or 12 of those? Not impressed.  The bowl itself was good, as was the banana bread I bought. However they need to get there stock correct in order for me to return."}
{"text":"Blasé, non-chalant service. A blatant imbalance between food quality and food price. Mistakes (i.e.: forgetting food requests) are not apologized for and not compensated for (the only redeeming quality about Starbucks is that they go above and beyond to appease a cheated-feeling customer).  This place disappoints continually, and that is especially disheartening for a vegetarian whose healthy options are already so limited.  This place needs to kick the hippy attitudes and pick up the slack, full stop. I'm not alone on this sentiment."}
{"text":"I've had some great sandwiches here, in the past. But the food I used to enjoy is spoiled by the grumpy, elitist, and often jerk-ish staff. Never had a confrontation with them, but they never so much as look at you when you are in there, and will often ignore your presence (yet they seem to have a tip jar??). Furthermore, the sandwiches seem to be getting smaller and smaller for the same ridiculous price, while being shabbily thrown together by the apparently miserable folk who work there. Another market dud, and that is truly sad."}
{"text":"I had a sandwich and a cookie here. I thought it was ok, but nothing to write home about. Maybe I'm just so used to over processed restaurant foods? I thought it tasted healthy (yes, you can make healthy foods taste delicious and not like your scrimping). Soapbox. Either way, just ok."}
{"text":"This time I got the Coconut Curry Stew with Quinoa, and again it was a huge full bowl, which was way too much food. Plus they added a side salad and offered a bread stick. I should have taken neither. The salad had nice greens but the dressing was strange and bitter. It reminded me of what dandelion milk looks/tastes like. Maybe it was. And the bread spear was almost biscotti-like in dryness, and yet somehow a little oily. I ate it anyway. It was nice covered in curry and quinoa. The stew and the quinoa were great, though, and while there was a lineup around the mall for the burgers next door, there was no lineup at 6:00pm on a Friday for vegan cuisine. Too bad. It's always good."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it opened years ago when I lived in Toronto and worked close by. Happy to see despite some mostly minor changes its still good quality vegan food for a reasonable price. I had the tropikale smoothie today which was perfect, and the bowls looked as good as ever. Good for a casual, quick but good bite."}
{"text":"Finally a good lunch option for veggie or vegan food in the mall.  Also the baked goods are filling and delicious.  My favorite is the coconut bar."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and I am embarassed that this place exists. Just because you are a vegetarian/vegan business does not mean you can conduct yourself with any less dignity than a regular business - you still need to deliver quality food and service at a fair price in a clean, pleasant environment, and Urban Herbivore does none of these things.  You guys are not doing a service to the vegan/vegetarian community or gaining us any respect by serving crappy, overpriced food in an unclean venue.  I honestly don't understand why this place is rated so highly on Yelp. Do all the hipsters of Toronto secretly have trust funds that they can't find enough things to waste money on? Who else is actually buying stuff here?!  [ food: 5/10 ] Bleh. No flavour coordination whatsoever. You might as well grab some of the day-old vegetables being thrown out in Chinatown and drench them in whatever liquids happen to be sitting in your fridge.  Sandwiches are mediocre. I've had the BLT and the tofu sandwich. Both were meh-worthy and not worth paying for. If a five year old kid made this and served it to me while playing chef I might stomach it and eat the whole thing with a smile, but come on. This is (supposedly) a business run by adults.  At least I've never gotten food poisoning here, but I wouldn't be surprised if I did.  [ service: 3/10 ] Good god, could the people here care any less about their jobs? Having entire conversations and ignoring me while I'm standing at the counter? The employees at McDonalds usually show more attention and respect.  Maybe they should use some of their conversation time to wipe down the tables every once in a while, judging by the food scraps and crumbs sitting all over the place.  [ place / decor: 3/10 ] Could this be any more poorly designed? They have a massive kitchen space (dunno why since most of their food isn't even cooked) but very little sitting room - this narrow little unfinished wood bar that's probably supposed to give a \"natural\" look but in all honesty simply looks cheap and like someone gave up halfway through building it. Leftover food crumbs on the tables aren't swept up. I felt gross eating here.  [ pricing: 1/10 ] Nothing here is worth half the price that they're charging for it.  [ conclusion ] The worst of what Hipsterville, Toronto (Kensington) has to offer. Don't bother going here. Would give zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Affordable, tasty vegan fast food in a convenient location for any downtown lovers, and it's healthy to boot! I often opt for their Zebra bowl. This food fills me up for hours and costs about $10 with tax included."}
{"text":"As good as it gets at this casual, grassroots grub hub. The produce is organic as is the dining party, abstaining from fur and leather( huge faux pas at this Kensie spot).   ENOUGH ABOUT THE ETTIRE!  A little pricey for lunch? Sure! Worth every penny? Absolutely!  The well thought through ingredients create an amazing medley of tastes that you can't help but dream about while at your desk at work. Often times the Chef will emerge from his sanctum and inquire about the level of taste ? One can't help but tell the truth to this ernest, self assured man...\"yes its amazing\" !  If wanting to try their most popular sandwich (BBQ TOFU) come early as they run out of the tofu mid day due to overwhelming popularity.  Vegan or Meatatarian, you'll be hooked. 9/10 friends whom I introduced to Urban Herbivore have fallen head over heals for my personal Utopia!!!   BON APPETIT!"}
{"text":"I go to Urban Herbivore on almost a weekly basis.   The reasons why I enjoy going to Urban Herbivore are: - salad bowls are delicious and consistent - it's close to my work (walking distance) & the lines aren't usually too long - price is not too bad ($10) for a healthy bowl that will fill you up - the variety of toppings are usually pretty great, especially to change things up if you go often and want a variety. Swapping between salad & grain bowls is also a nice option.   The reasons why I dread going to Urban Herbivore are: - amount of toppings vary depending on who is making your bowl. Some are much more generous than others. Usually the more pleasant ones give you more toppings (go figure) - the service is always hit-or-miss. Sometimes you will get friendly service, and you leave happy and feeling like you're a good person. However, sometimes, you get service that literally makes you feel like you just harmed someone's child. If you catch them on an bad day, you will literally be barked and yelled at if you ask a question or if you ask them to clarify something. Sometimes the eye-rolls that you get from the staff defy physics.  - having to always tip-toe your way around in fear of getting attitude is not the way service should work in a restaurant. As a customer, you shouldn't be afraid or intimidated to ask a question or for a little extra tofu without feeling like you're asking them for their last kidney.  All-in-all, I'll keep going back because it's tasty, but if the service was better I would definitely go more often."}
{"text":"never disappointed! I love their daily combo deals so today I ate a delicious tempeh and avocado sandwich, arugula and spinach salad and creamy tomato soup I'm hoping to become vegan in the near future and you won't even think you're eating vegan here - it's simply delicious :)"}
{"text":"It must suck to be vegan, this food is horribly bland. I got a build your own salad bowl and perhaps I made some bad flavour combo choices but will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of kensington, this cute vegan restaurant has what every vegan wants most, flavour!! The food is delicious and healthy, and they have cookies for anyone with a sweet-tooth. There aren't many places to sit and eat so i recommend getting it to go unless it's not busy. The prices are a little on the high-side for lunch but its worth it for the taste and portion size."}
{"text":"I work near the area so I usually only go in if I am in need of quick veg meal. The food is okay, the location is great, and the staff can be surly.   The quantity and presentation of your food really depends on who is making it. The service really is hit or miss. Sometimes you are greeted, the staff are friendly and are responsive. Other times, you get an evil eye or two for asking them a question, or for simply ordering. I've also seen some eye rolls and blank, disinterested stares. Funny how you don't really have to say anything to make your customers feel shitty, your eyes do all the talking. Friends who eat here also say the same about the staff, which I'm noticing is a recurring theme.   Food is okay overall, it's bland in flavour, but it satisfies. The location and decor is pretty sweet - I love the shaded area in the outdoor patio and I love the long wooden tables."}
{"text":"The service at this location is consistently passive aggressive and borders on hostile. The ability of staff to make even a salad bowl is not consistent and you can end up paying an awful lot for a substandard salad."}
{"text":"I have been to this place at least thrice and Mr.H is a huge fan of the salad here. And most times I end up coming here to pick it up for him. My recent visit however left a sour taste in my mouth.   As we all know, Eaton Centre food court is very crowded during lunch hour. There is absolutely no place without a queue, Urban Herbivore was the same. There were people in line to pay and then there were people standing in front of salad bars waiting for service. After I paid I noticed we were all crowded (people paying and one who had already paid) around the pay area and hence I moved forward to the second salad bar (in front of the centre table). The man in the 2nd salad bar was helping another woman and I waited till he got done (note: I was the next in line anyway, the lady behind me was using the 1st salad bar). Once he got done he stands right in front of me starts calling for the next customer, I'm staring right at him and saying\"Hi! Hello! Excuse me\" and he totally ignores me. He points to a blonde lady behind me and she being a nice woman points at me and says I'm next.  And this is what happens: Me: I've been standing here this whole time. Server: I can't serve you cause you are not standing in the right place (so rather than telling me that he chose to ignore me??) Me: Huh?Where am I supposed to stand? Server: You are supposed to stand next to 1st salad bar cause I may not be making a salad next. We have rules. Me: (Huh?) Well why didn't the lady at cash tell me where I'm supposed to stand, especially if you have rules! Also, there is no place to stand cause it's so crowded. Server: I'm sorry, I cannot discuss this any further.   (I move away and then he calls me back saying 'ok I'll help you this time')  He proceeds to make my salad and starts telling my about the rules and why I was wrong to stand where I stood (after telling me he was done discussing). I just tell him to make my grain bowl so I can leave.  I have stated this before and I'll state it again in my review, whether I pay $100 or $10, if I'm not being treated well at an establishment, It's just not worth it! I refuse to pay someone to be rude to me.  I will not and never will be going back to Urban Herbivore again."}
{"text":"Fresh, whole foods. The staff was not friendly and didn't wear gloves when making the BLT and touched food with bare hands. Gross!"}
{"text":"I really want to like it. I do. But if I am downtown and I am only a few blocks away from Kupfert and Kim, Imma go there and chow down on a Oxaca salad because it's about the same price and it tastes better.  I took the Tempeh sandwich, which was pretty delicious but not filling enough. The mini salad was not tasty (it was dressed but it wasn't flavourful), and the sandwich itself was tasty but that's because I love soya sauce and pretty much anything with soya sauce will taste good to me.  They marinate the soybeans in their soya sauce and then glaze it with some sweeter teriyaki glaze. That tasted pretty good but it kind of fell apart in my hands. The tempeh was quite natural in the sense that I could taste the soybeans, and was pretty tasty.  I wouldn't say that I'll never eat here again (it's convenient) but if I had the choice, I'd walk to K&K and eat there instead for the same price."}
{"text":"Food: Good. Service: Bad.  But bad to the point of making me ignore this place, even though I enjoy the food. I have had a similar experience to many other people who reviewed here. The staff are just so bloody miserable. They are often out of many ingredients, and if you ask if they have it they look at you with malice.  I once went up to order, and after staring at the menu for a couple of minutes, I asked for a grain bowl. \"Oh, we're out of grains\" says the girl behind the counter. Okay, wish you had told me that while you were looking at me staring at the menu, but I'll move on. I'll have a salad then, and I think I'll have it with romaine lettuce. \"We only have mixed greens\" as she's putting it in the take out box. Again, do you think you could have informed me of that when I said I'll move to salad and stared at the menu contemplating the type of lettuce.  I'm not saying it's a big deal. I certainly lived to tell the tale, but when you're in the service industry, you can't be an ignorant jerk. Pay a little attention. Smile. Try to pretend like you don't hate your life."}
{"text":"Always love my stops into Urban Herbivore. A giant grain bowl packed full of tons of veggies and delicious seeds is super satisfying. I've also really enjoyed a few sandwiches there and the BBQ Tempeh was delicious. Compared to what other reviewers on here have said, I think the portions are great. Everytime I'm at the Eaton Centre food court, if I've tried somewhere other than Urban Herbivore, I always regret it. You can't get a meal there for much under $10 and it's never as good as a wicked grain bowl.  Ignore the negative reviews and just go enjoy this place. It's delicious and you'll get more nutrients from here than ANY other place you go to."}
{"text":"Wanna watch Kensington Market pedestrians with a friend over a large lunch ? Come here.  I can't tell if I am inside or outside because of the large windows.  In fact I can't tell what is better: the colored pedestrians, my friend or the lunch itself.  No, wait... it is the lunch.  Huge sandwitches and dark green smoothies available here for about $7."}
{"text":"Let's be real here- this is a vegan restaurant in a food court.  We shouldn't expect Michelin star flavor with a full level of service/ambiance.  Nonetheless, the portions are generous- a salad bowl is good enough for two people to share... as I did with my partner.  The flavors are a combination of vegetables and dressing, very light on the carbs.  The coconut bacon is a nice touch for some additional flavor."}
{"text":"Although this place has excellent food, I have to comment on the service and atmosphere. First, the seats have no back and are uncomfortable.  The tables are never cleaned.  We have to wipe our own tables.  They are often out of many ingredients, most often: avocados.  I don't see how that can happen since this restaurant is in the heart of Kensington Market and most fruits and vegetables are accessible within a few metres.  Then, there's the loud electronic music playing most of the time to accomodate certain staff or patrons who smoke marijuana.  I can often smell the fumes coming in the restaurant when the kitchen back door is left open.  Almost every time I go there, I have to argue with staff to get them to wash their hands with soap before preparing my salad.  I see them handling the cash register and then moving on to food preparation without washing their hands.  Last night around 18:00, I stopped in and used the downstairs washroom.  I had to wait a few minutes before hearing the toilet flush and seconds later saw an employee come out and head straight to the kitchen.  Although there was no paper towels or hand dryer, the door knob was wet.  I thought, that was a two second hand wash. Then I realised the soap dispenser was completely empty!  The employee never bothered to refill it and went straight to the kitchen!  I had to go to main level to use bathroom and use soap."}
{"text":"I love the concept of the place and in theory, the food is amazing (the ingredients are fresh and the way they put together the bowls are delicious) but this place is a bit of a disaster. The girls working there were nice enough but one tried to talk me out of a custom bowl by saying \"well, we *could* do it for you if you really wanted\", as if she didn't want to do the extra work (?) involved in this. Then I ordered a sweet potato soup but bc of miscommunication, both girls made one each so I got 2. Then I had to stand around for another few min waiting to pay, watching then wander around aimlessly before they figured neither had cashed me out yet. So then I get my Hippo salad to the car and I look at it and....yuck. There was WAY too much dressing and it was soggy :All those nice, fresh ingredients were wilted and mushy and the colour of the salad was now brownish :(I maybe had 5 bites before feeling sick and had to toss it. The cookies were good but a little on the dry side. The best part was the soup, but even then, that was awkward bc the girl had stuck the spoon through 'sip' part of the lid, and had bent it completely and it was covered in soup on the handle part. LOL wtf? Why not just put the spoon in the bag? So weird.  Oddly, I would actually try this place again bc the food does look good, if I asked them to tone down the dressing. Hopefully, it was just an off day for the workers and it's not like this all the time otherwise I'm worried to see how they'd handle a crowd of more than 2 people."}
{"text":"I debated a 2 or a 3 star rating here.  Pros:  Ok service sometimes.  Convenient location.  Provide gluten-free muffins.   Cons:  Not organic but pricey for what you get.  Food is VERY bland. When I say bland, I mean almost no taste to my palate, and this includes the Moroccan stew. A tip to owner: give people sprinkle containers of spice to add to dishes.   Not wheelchair accessible and layout has obvious safety failures like stairs not clearly marked. Management and owners seem to be obnoxiously oblivious to the stairs lacking a railing and have no interest in the obvious tripping problems present. One trip-and-fall would fix this problem assuming it didn't put them out of business.  For many months, failed to have several dressing (which of course are all very bland) that they have listed."}
{"text":"This place has such healthy, filling food.  There are few places you would have a salad as an entire meal and feel you need to take some to go, and this is one of those places. Staff have always been friendly and patient when trying to decide from the smorgasboard of salad options.   Their juices are also healthy and creative, and most of their pastries are made from organic ingredients.  It is a bit expensive, but that is because the ingredients are generally fresh and high quality. It's almost satisfying to see all of the other restaurants in the food court and feel like \"yes, it cost more, but i'm treating my body well with that extra couple of bucks\""}
{"text":"I am a vegan and have been one for 20 years.  I eat in veg restaurants all over the world.  You can serve food that tastes like sawdust and I would support your establishment and give you a good review.  This is the only vegan restaurant in the world I passionately detest.  They RUN OUT OF FOOD EVERY DAY!  THEY LAUGH ABOUT IT!  OBNOXIOUS AND OFFENSIVE is my review.  Want to waste your time?  Go to UH expecting to find FOOD?!  I have been there five days in a row.  Every day they have run out of food.  Its obviously too difficult to stock enough bread.  In a sandwich shop.    The owners should go run Target Canada since they like empty shelves so much.  I have spent the last week trashing this establishment to every vegan I know.  Who runs a restaurant like this????  Who runs a CHAIN with THREE locations and cant get stock inventory.    They have wasted so much of my time I truly cannot wait until they go out of business.  Good riddance.  I am afraid if I eat there I will get infected with whatever is afflicting the owners.    Do not waste your time they will have no food."}
{"text":"The first vegan restaurant I've ever been to and I'm happy to say it won't be the last.   Stopped by to grab a quick bite to satisfy my belly before a late dinner that night, so  I only tried a few items on the menu.   Soup of the day - Black Bean Soup (3/5): Typical black bean soup with tomatoes, corn, onions and a variety of spices. Nothing out of the ordinary but the \"small soup\" I ordered was generously sized and satisfied my hunger until dinner.   Apple Walnut Muffin (4.5/5): Fellow Yelpers recommended the muffin, so I had to try this. It is made of organic ingredients and sweetened with cane sugar. The muffin top was rightly crunchy and the bottom was soft and moist as it should be. If there were a gluten free option available I'd give it a perfect rating.   Carrot & Ginger Vegetable Juice (3/5): Awkward combination of sourness and over-sweetness. The idea of carrot and ginger sounds great, but the actual juice was way too sweet and simultaneously too sour for my liking. However if your saliva glands like a challenge, you may end up liking this drink.   They also serve salad, sandwiches and cupcakes which I didn't try this time, however you should note there are no gluten free options available for the sandwich bread.   Going to the rest room is an interesting experience. You will need walk through the kitchen and then downstairs to find the single stall bathroom. This was the first time I've had to walk through a kitchen to get to a bathroom, but I'm happy to see their kitchen meeting Toronto's cleanliness standards.   Overall, this is a cool joint with bar stool seating. It's located in one of the corner streets of Kensington, which provides for an interesting view. The staff are friendly. I would come back.   Ratings:  Food (averaged) - 7/10 - see above Atmosphere: 9/10 - Great corner window views but the restaurant is a bit chilly for my comfort  Service: 9/10 - Would like the staff to be more knowledgeable about the food"}
{"text":"I loved my visits to Urban Herbivore in the funky Kensington market.  I have great memories of wonderful food in the bright sunny patio/dining room.  I wasn't sure my high opinion would be sustained in the new Eaton Centre food court which, despite all the hype, is still a food court in a mall basement.  Despite the lack of sunshine on a glassed in porch, the food at Eaton's Herbivore is still excellent.  Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared.  I am a fan of the avocado sandwich on rosemary focaccia but I asked the server what else was excellent.  She led me to the barbecued tofu sandwich and it was, indeed, terrific. Lots of fresh veggies and tofu that doesn't taste like tofu.  A nice side salad with a zingy ginger salad came with the sandwich.  I am not a vegan but my daughter is, so I have cooked and eaten vegan stuff for years.  For an omnivore, I have a pretty high standard for vegan food and urban herbivore continues to exceed my expectations."}
{"text":"Fun, fast, and fresh vegan food that makes carnivores jealous.  The avocado sandwich on some amazing, rich chewy, flavourful, herby, seedy flat bread is unmatched.  Their baked goods are lovely.  Nice fresh juices.   It's exactly the place you want to hang out on a sunny weekend day but there isn't a ton of seating so you can't be too particular about where you perch. Also, the washrooms are located through the kitchen - a bit strange but also a great opportunity to see the vegan chef-ery in action."}
{"text":"Another favorite of mine for a filling lunch or awesome desert. Their carrot juice with lemon is awesome too. 5 stars, my go to when I'm by the eaton centre. I recommend the curry bowl, avocado sandwich or make your own rice bowl"}
{"text":"Hands-down my favourite place to get a custom salad in Toronto. I know they offer more, but every time I go i'm lured in by that gorgeous spread of ingredients waiting to be combined - sesame tempeh every time, baby. You get a good number of 'toppings' to pick from for the price, and the finished product is quite filling. I've yet to try the grain bowl options rather than the salad, but I imagine this would be killer in the winter.  Because of my salad blinkers i've only ever really tried one of the other offerings - the delicious (but slightly overpriced) BBQ tofu sandwich. Bursting with flavour, it's good for a light lunch - perhaps next time i'll have to try one of the soups on offer to expand my horizons and fill my belly.  If it's not obvious by my salad fixation, I think Urban Herbivore is more of a summer destination - longer hours and much nicer to sit out on the adorable patio and watch Kensington Market float by. And the lemonade that is usually on offer tastes far better in the sunshine."}
{"text":"Horrid service. Would be nice if I was asked what I wanted as a base for the curry order - as opposed to just assuming rice. And then get mad at the customer for questioning it?  Could not be less friendly.   I've always wanted to try this place but was extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"It's so WEIRD that there's a vegan place in a massive mall food court in downtown Toronto. So weird! But it's pretty awesome being able to get a proper bite to eat while flailing about through the masses of shoppers and loitering teens.  The basics on offer are pretty much the same as the Kensington Market location (salad and grain bowls made custom, curry bowl, and a stew, plus a handful of sandwich flavours). They also have muffins/brownies/cookies prepacked if you're just after a snack.  I'm slightly disappointed that they don't offer water to drink here like in the beginning, leaving you to choose from pre-prepared (and unlabeled) juices. Sigh. Also, the food court itself can be a little overwhelming, but at least Urban Herbivore is in a little island and kinda out of a lot of traffic - however people standing around waiting for orders can cause a bit of clutter.  Overall if you want a healthy option, and something vegetarian that's not an unholy mound of iceberg lettuce, you'll be pretty happy that Urban Herbivore's hit the food court scene."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this place is still open!!! During the Reno I came by and thought it was closed down. It's up and running smoother than ever! Good quality still awesome, the service is great! The prices are amazing for the quantity of food. What a wonderful place to enjoy healthy meal in the market.  Bonus they got a few new sit down tables for groups, which is easier for conversation."}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious food you can feel good about. I only ever get the bowls, and am always well beyond satisfied. I often opt for the pre designed bowls, but their selection outside of this is also great. Their drinks and juices are also super tasty. And their vegan cookies, unexpectedly, are also really good, allowing my lactose-intolerant self to indulge in a great cookie once in a while! The staff at both Toronto locations are also incredibly friendly and both knowledgeable on and passionate about the vegan fare they offer."}
{"text":"The BBQ tempeh sandwich was excellent, as was the quinoa salad - this is a good place to find great, nutritious fast food."}
{"text":"Wow, the service here is awful - the staff really seem to enjoy yelling at their customers.  I went there for the first time today during lunch.  First thing I noticed were the staff constantly screaming at customers to get into the correct line up.  You'd think screaming is an exaggeration, but that's what they do.  Worse, if you are in the wrong line-up and make it to the counter to order your food (after waiting 10-15 min) they don't serve you and tell you to go to the other line-up, so you have to re-wait.  My thoughts?  If you are constantly needed to tell your customers this, maybe your process isn't clear.   I was lucky enough to have chosen the correct line, and ordered my food to go.  I ran into a friend, so I ate in the foodcourt instead of taking my lunch back to the office.  I didn't finish the meal, and I went back to ask for a bag on the way out.  Instead of just handing me a bag, the girl at the counter starts yelling at me about how that's not environmentally friendly or good for the planet.  \"Think about it!\", she screams, in front of the crowd standing there.  I was shocked and started to walk away, but I couldn't deal with the fact that this chick was so rude to me, so I went back telling her that I refuse to be scolded like that.  Does she apologize?  Nope -- she calls me a \"crazy lady\".  And better yet?  She's the manager!  Anyway, the food was okay -- not great, but not bad for what you pay either.  There are a plethora of these vegan/vegetarian places opening up, and I don't think it will be long before another one opens up here and hurts their business.  I'm not the first one to complain about service, based on the other yelp reviews, so it's clear the owner doesn't care."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the quality of the food here, heard it was a good place for vegan sandwiches.  Definitely doesn't compare to other places in Augusta, especially Le Ti Colibri which also offers vegan sandwiches."}
{"text":"Their muffins are SUPER delicious... since they have continued to raise their prices I don't seem to go as often for the grain bowls (as an ex-dutchess I used to go here quite frequently.) However is saddens me to find out that their delicious muffins contain almost 1,000 calories. WHAT? WHAT WHAT WHAT???  Ok, so I guess I'll be going even less often now?  http://www.thestar.com/life/2013/03/01/organic_vegan_muffin_is_nutritional_nightmare.html"}
{"text":"excellent healthy unique food...non pretentious...earthy hairy armpit crowd...very cool place."}
{"text":"Morrocan stew is great.  Gold veggie juice is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is overrated. It has so much potential, too! What a bummer. It is somewhat overpriced, but nothing surprising for the area.   Here are my two main issues:  The food is pretty inconsistent. This is a major turn-off for me. I'd like to know that when I am ordering the same thing I ordered last time, I am going to get something that looks and tastes pretty much like what I ordered last time.   The service is enough to make me not want to come here again. Honestly, people working at Urban Herbivore: get over yourselves. You *do know* that your job entails taking people's orders and answer their questions, right? At least pretend to care, or .. something? I've worked in food service before for many, many years; it is honestly not that hard. And ffs: answers customers' questions. The abysmal service is the main reason I am not going to come back. Actively being made to feel like you are a nuisance is annoying, to say the least."}
{"text":"Being vegan your options when eating out can be less than amazing... so glad that this place is available in a mall food court! I've been here more than once, and I've had fairly good service at all times. Never have had a bad experience, but they sometimes seem a bit too busy and flustered which takes a toll on their customer service.   I had a build your own bowl today and it was really good. I loved their soy-sesame tofu, their sweet potatoes were great and overall I was pretty much in food heaven because (it being a custom bowl) all of my favourites were in it.   I've also had their sweet potato soup, it's good but a bit one note. It's quite sweet. But it is sweet potatoes... I enjoyed it overall.   Their sweets are tasty, and since it's a bit harder to come across vegan baked goods I always get something. The prices are quite standard, I've had great service and mediocre service, and the food is satisfying!"}
{"text":"I've been to Urban Herbivore many times and it never fails to disappoint!   The formula is simple - pick your type of meal (salad, sandwich, grain bowl, curry bowl) and pick up to 6 delicious ingredients, plus seeds and nuts, and dressing and walk away very happy!   The incredients are not run of the mill items like tomato (although you can get tomato) but include roast sweet potatoes, bbq tofu, tempeh, roasted red peppers, and many more. And in my experience, they are not stingy when they toss the ingredients in.   This is the kind of place you can walk into and leave feeling healthier and pleasantly full for less than $10. And if you're there in the summer, grab a lemonade, they're refreshing and delicious.  A lot of people seem to question the cost of the meals here ($8.50 for any of the options) but it's totally comparable to (and in some cases cheaper than) places like Sandwich Box and Freshii. And if you are a vegetarian you're getting delicious instead of plain protein options.  The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because I find having to walk through their kitchen to use the washroom a little strange AND they only have counter seating which is a pet peeve of mine. Still, this place is totally worth checking out - I always leave happy!"}
{"text":"Excellent food but their new order preparation process is much slower than previous way. Ordering is quick but waiting for your food to be prepared in the kitchen takes much much longer. Disappointed they made this change.   Otherwise excellent spot; great food, fun music and super polite staff."}
{"text":"Hard to say TOO much about a mall foodcourt place, but for what it is, this place is damn good.  If you're vegetarian or vegan and in need of some decent and moderately priced food, then you'll love this place.  It was fresh and the portions were great.  Too bad it's in a mall surrounded by consumerist gluttony.  If you work in the area, this is probably somewhere you should frequent.  If you're just passing through, keep moving."}
{"text":"My colleague is vegan -so we hunted down this location of Urban Herbivore in the Eaton Centre located near St. Michael's Hospital. It was so hard to find this location initially because the GPS kept on taking us around Trinity Park. As a non-vegetarian, I love Vegan dishes because you can't go wrong with a good healthy meal. There were many salad bowl, sandwich and burger combos available. I thought they had more variety than Copper branch. I ordered the potato club with \"coconut bacon\" and cheeze sauce, with a beverage and orange creamsicle cupcake (chocolate cupcake more with an orange icing-didn't taste like an orange creamsicle but still so good!). The portions were so large- couldn't finish the sandwich! It was kind of messy eating the sandwich especially with the sweet potato puree overload coming out of the sides.  The whole combo plus cupcake came out to 14$. That's what you call a value meal!"}
{"text":"This power bowl is delicious! I'm super glad to find a healthy place that offers big portions. The only thing that tasted bad was the shredded broccoli (or whatever that nasty green shred was) and the sprouts, which universally turn people off eating veg food. The tempeh and the sauce were both good. Service was fab from the two guys but terrible from the girl in the vegan hat so I could see how that might turn people off. Butafter tasting this bowl today, and still having half for supper tonight, I'd take that chance."}
{"text":"I ate here on a Friday on a lunchtime date with a friend from school. Leaving the office on a Friday afternoon makes it extremely difficult to want to return to the office, but the Eaton Centre food court is so packed and afterwards, I was kind of happy to slink away back to my peaceful cubicle. I ordered the lunch special which was a sandwich and a half salad. I believe the total was around $11.00. The service was strained and rushed. I left a tip anyways because I understand the pains of working a food counter.  The sandwich had veggies and a pile of bean sprouts which I ended up taking off. Okay, I don't think I'm describing it properly because it wasn't bean sprouts but some other sort of mossy, grassy item. I'm a vegetarian so I suppose I should know my greens and leafy items but it was just bland. The salad was delicious but portions were so small that I could have ordered another eleven dollar meal all together. I think I'd like to return and give it another chance and try something less sprouty."}
{"text":"Yikes. Their menu update is stab in the heart to any regulars.   Things that have changed:  SIZE: -------------------------------- Maybe a year ago, Urban Herbivore (UH) changed their take-out packaging size. I thought maybe I remembered it wrong, but I'm glad other reviewers noticed it too. Now, their eat-in bowls are about a third smaller, which bring it in the \"not quite filling enough\" category for me, but for smaller stomachs and diet chasers, it is probable a welcome change.  PREMIUM TOPPINGS: -------------------------------- UH tried to secretly discourage customers from choosing their more premium toppings months ago by moving them to the back where people would not be able to see and that new customers would otherwise not know to ask for. With the new menu, the premium toppings cost $1.50 each, including avocado, BBQ tofu, fried vegetables, and a few others.    DRESSING: -------------------------------- There are more choices now, but they got rid of old ones, including my favourite Red Wine Dijon. I had chipotle. That was a no.   NUTS & SEEDS: -------------------------------- What was once \"nuts and seeds\" is now only \"seeds\".   TIPS: -------------------------------- I still forget this even after over a year of visiting this place: get your forks, spoons, and napkins when you pay. Counter-intuitively, but most likely due to their layout, you have to grab cutlery before you get your food.  What used to cost me $11.50 would now cost me at least $15. While the taste is still great, the price is a bit steep for a casual lunch. I haven't visited their competitor, Freshii, in a while. However, I'm inclined to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Lots of option to customize. I had the soup of the day and a beet smoothie. My friend had the customizable salad bowl. It was a bit pricey and the service was subpar. The counter wasn't able to answer simple questions about the menu and the staff had a negative and broody vibe going on. However, interactions with staff are minimal and only to get your food. Once dealing with them was over, it was still nice to be able to sit and look out the window at the happenings of Kensington Market."}
{"text":"As a vegan, I was super duper excited to become a regular at this place. I work in the mall and was delighted to hear that an Urban Herbivore opened up. That being said, the service is quite disappointing. I have given them more than 5 chances to change this opinion, and every time it is terrible. They are often sold out of common items such as tempeh, but that is the least of their problems. They SERIOUSLY need new staff who understand a basic level of guest service.   I have a story for you.  One day I came here at precisely 3:05pm and asked for the lunch deal that I was super excited to try. Half avocado sandwich with coconut curry soup. Sounds amazing, no?  Well, I'll never know. The cashier asked another coworker if the deal was still available, and the coworker casually said \"nope - no sandwiches left\". I look up at the menu, and at least half of the menu is sandwich based. I asked if that went for ALL sandwiches and she said there isn't any sandwich bread.  I can see a 3rd coworker in plain sight making himself a sandwich at the sandwich table next to the large box of avocados and stack of sandwich bread.   I wasn't real impressed, and left empty handed. I avoid this place except for their Hostess cupcakes which I periodically crave. Otherwise, I prefer the pitas at Extreme Pita in the food court who are always kind and gracious towards me."}
{"text":"I'm a fan!  It took me a couple of tries to open up to this place, but now I'm hooked. The service you get here isn't the fastest, but that's only cause they're assembling ~2lbs of food for you. The bowls and sandwiches (comes with side salad) are super hearty, and last me a good meal + snack. You can customize your own bowl or choose from one of their 6 bowls named after animals.  I love getting the tempeh here, and will often ask for it to be swapped in place of the BBQ tofu (which is a bit watery).  Protip: also a great stop for vegan desserts and fresh juice!"}
{"text":"Ate here last week. If you have a long day ahead, I would start here. Excellent choice of food for the vegan. Sumptuous portions and decent service. I liked the presentation and the right blend of spiciness and embellishments. Unless supplemented with some amount of spices - pure vegan food sometimes can become unpalatable. I thought the chef struck that right balance. I would go here again."}
{"text":"my vegan friend and i decided to try out this place and oh my god was it the best decision we've ever made. although im not a vegan, id recommend this place to every person i talk to. i ordered the customized salad bowl and it was so filling! they have tons of toppings and dressing to choose from. the prices are pretty reasonable considering how fresh all the ingredients are (for example, my salad here was $10 = 10 piece chicken mcnugget meal at mcdonalds $10). the worker there was super kind, the atmosphere was relaxed, plus they even had a sample of their vegan cupcakes to taste. this place has definitely got me thinking about going vegan"}
{"text":"Ok, I literally live 75 ft away from here and I normally dread going in. I hate all the barefoot, enlightened nightmares in there and on top of that, the blonde that usually works behind the counter is HORRID, so disinterested and terse. BUT this new guy (looks like a tattooed teenager) is so fucking nice and helpful that I'm actually writing this while I eat, he's that nice. He's such a relief from the usual. He made my bowl perfectly and put the right amount of sauce and I didn't have to tell him fifty goddamn times. I literally never like anyone. He's changed my whole experience at this place and I hope he gets a thousand raises and never finds another job."}
{"text":"Been here twice now it is absolutely FANTASTIC! Both times I got the salad bowl let me tell you that the portion is HUGE.  it is legit enough for lunch and dinner haha and I am a BIG eater.  I always clear my plate wherever I go out to eat and I cannot physically finish this in one sitting. Yes, you are paying just under $12 bucks for a foodcourt salad but its worth it :)  i need to comment on 3 toppings in particular.  the kimchi cabbage is SO good. Also, the roasted cauliflower is a-mazinggggg. I might consider getting double next time. Lastly, the roasted veggies oh-my-god divine.  There's eggplant, peppers, zucchini, and sweet potato and it's perfect in the salad bowl.  ask for double!  Complaints. They lie when they offer avocado as a topping.  Been there twice now and both times they happen to have no ripe ones. really I think it's because avocados aren't cheap so they don't want to give it to u.  2nd complaint is that the food leaves a stronggg aftertaste in my mouth even hours after i was done, but it's too good to even care!"}
{"text":"The best salad and grain bowls in the city! So satisfying, flavourful, and healthy. Can't go wrong with this place, it just never disappoints. :)"}
{"text":"Okay this is going a bit back, but I went to UH on a trip to Toronto 14 months ago. On surprisingly warm (for winter, maybe +3C or +4C?) day in January on a trip to visit my sister and her children, my girlfriend and I took a little day trip down on the Spadina streetcar to Kensington Market, and we stopped by this establishment to have ourselves some lunch.  To be honest, I don't remember exactly what I had because I can't find a menu anywhere. I THINK it was the avocado. Anyway, it was quite good. The sprouts sticking out provided a great texture, the veggies were fresh, the bread was delicious, and the tomatoes were delish. I was pleased with my meal and would definitely return next time I'm in Kensington!"}
{"text":"On the main drag of the Kensington market is Urban Herbivore with its big windows and tons of 'bar like' seating along the outside.   A short menu of vegan items. I had the apple raspberry muffin (which is quite tasty!) and also the green juice. Both cost me $7.50.   When I had my first drink of the green juice I had the same reaction as when I took my first shot of Johnny Walker (Black Label). Shut your eyes, shake your head side to side quickly, and say 'whoa!!'. It's SOUR. I didn't expect that. Definitely one of the most bizarre green juices I've had, I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Not terrible, but the food is mediocre. Nothing amazing here. I've been here twice, not really impressed either time."}
{"text":"yummy sandwiches! mmmm delicious! focaccia bread + tempeh! about $9. also desserts - cookies/muffins and other baked goodness=) soups and stews and more! friendly stuff and bar stools facing the streets. definitely love this place and coming back again!"}
{"text":"Had their tomato soup, it was ok, nothing to write home about. A tad above campbells. Service was terrible, venue is not organized very well. Would not repeat..."}
{"text":"I had a really good salad here the other day. The ingredients were fresh and it was HUGE. My favourite was the dilled cucumbers. And $10 flat was a good value.  I was somewhat put off by the service, though. The guy who served me was abrupt and I felt like I was bothering him by ordering my food. From what I could hear the customers behind me got the same treatment.  I may give it another shot - we'll see!"}
{"text":"Another great spot in Kensington for wholesome and healthy food to go. The one and only minus is that I wish it was not so pricey. At close to $9 a sandwich, it's not a cheap lunch. But on the flip side, their menu is big (both in size and variety) and the space has a nice open air feel and actually reminds me a little of \"maoz vegetarian\" chains (they really need to get one of them in Toronto!). I keep ordering their avocado sandwich which is very filling and pretty big in size. One time I got their grilled veggie sandwich which I was not expecting to love (I've not had great experiences with grilled veggies) but my take on grilled veggies took a 180 turn thanks to Urban Herbivore (which is also such a cool/fun name in my opinion by the way).  Each time I've walked in there it's been very quiet so I've never had to go through what Vivek says is a confusing ordering/lining up process, but I could see that being confusing.   In conclusion I would love to branch out to their other options, but I can't really make this a place I visit very often."}
{"text":"Horrible experience -- within 30 minutes of eating here, my girlfriend became violently ill!   The full story: we came here for lunch, and she ordered a custom veggie bowl. (I didn't get anything.) The bowl was flavorless and watery, but she powered through because it was so expensive ($11  + tax).  10 minutes later, as we were walking around Kensington Market, she became extremely nauseous. We sought refuge in a nearby cafe (Fika = great experience), where I ordered a coffee while she was violently ill in the bathroom. Afterward, she described it as the worst food poisoning of her life.  All in all, a total disaster -- steer clear of this one, folks!"}
{"text":"I was disgusted after my experience at The Urban Herbivore. Rushing to find something to eat I decided to try UH. I've seen it in Kensington a million times and figured it would be a safe call from the other artery clogging choices in the urban eatery.  I ordered an avocado sandwich and added tempeh. The sandwich was ten dollars and came on focaccia  bread with a side salad. It took awhile to make but I didn't mind as I always love a sandwich with heart. This sandwich was lacking heart, good flavor and ingredients. Not to mention the side salad was wilted lettuce with no real dressing on it.  So it's called an avocado sandwich yet there wasn't much avocado. Looked like half a  tablespoon smeared on each half. I decided to bring it up to the waitress thinking there was some mistake. Boy was I wrong. Not only was she rude and not accommodating she basically confirmed that they don't offer a lot of avocado on AN AVACADO sandwich - end of story! She said if I want more I can pay, then rudely walked away.   I don't mind spending money on good food but it's so disappointing to see companies who try to market themselves as the exception from other sub par eats, deliver the same poor food and service. I'll never be eating at Urban Herbivore again."}
{"text":"Maybe because I'm not a vegetarian, I found their menu confusing.  I ordered the TLC sandwich and was told they were out of coconuts.  That was disappointing since the main ingredient is coconut 'bacon'.  I was given a substitute item...no idea what it was.  But it was tasty.  The service was slower than expected and the prices were kind of high.  At least the sandwich came with a few greens.  The patio area was nice with an overhead shade tree.  I'd be willing to give the place another try."}
{"text":"I was at Eaton center and I decided to give this place a try since its vegan. They have an express line for those who don't want to make custom orders which is genius and I think more establishments should start doing that. I ordered their chicken sandwich. It comes with a salad. Quick and friendly service. Mock meat is delicious. Their sweet sauce and avocado adds a great flavour to it. They do have vegan cupcakes that looked delicious but I didn't try them, Maybe next time.  Overall delicious sandwich. I strongly recommend it. Check it out if you are at Eaton center."}
{"text":"I got the Balugo (sp?) bowl.  They plopped hummus on the top so the entire bowl was soggy.  It tasted like a pile of mush.  instead of having new utensils at each station, they use the same one and tipped it in the same filthy water each time.  I threw out about half the bowl.  Also for a vegan dish, $13 is a hefty price tag."}
{"text":"The only vegan option in the food court.  The custom. Bowls are a great offering.  Some of the soups tend to be too salty. Which take away from the health benefits.   The cupcakes and muffins are calorie bombs and are not the tastiest.    Portions are massive."}
{"text":"I LOVE URBAN HERBIVORE. Ok, I am a carnivore but this place made me 'think' about becoming a vegetarian while I was enjoying my salad.    I ordered a salad bowl. Here's how it works. You pick your base, 6 toppings, and a dressing. I went with quinoa and beluga lentil salad with artichoke, sesame tofu, chickpeas, beets, snow peas and avocado. I chose cranberry dressing. Oh yeah , nuts/seeds are free, so I asked for little bit of everything.   WHOA, I was completely blown away by the weight of that salad (fully loaded, make sure to grab your bowl with two hands) and the taste. Ingredients are uber fresh and the salad is delicious and nutritious.    People who work there are super nice, friendly and patient. I took my sweet @$$ time picking the toppings. The lady who served me was patient and never stopped smiling. She offered nuts/seeds and she was quite generous when she sprinkled them over my salad.     I couldn't even finish half of that salad so I asked for a box from one of the guys in the kitchen. I got one right away and with a big smile.   This is the feel good place that serves great, fresh food with daily dose of smiles."}
{"text":"I got a salad bowl, and it was tasty! It was comparable in price to other healthy places offering this type of food. It came out to about $11 including tax. Would definitely come again whenever I'm in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Food - 3 stars. I had a Belugi power bowl (around $12) which had purple rice, avocado, sprouts, bbq tofu,green peas, arugla and some other stuff and was a huge portion. It was $11.73 though.  However, my experience with vegan food is that $11 to $12 can get you a  small portion.  This was not the case.  See pic.  However I didn't know that, so I got a split pea soup for an extra $3.50 or so.  The total with tax was $17.  Yes, that's expensive for one person and at a food court no less, but this actually enough for two people.  In terms of the taste, it was okay. It tasted like it should and not too unhealthy (a decent but not overwhelming amount of dressing).  Soup was pretty good though.  Service - I don't know what all the complaints are about. This guy and I were talking and said the line was confusing and one of the girls (Sarah) said very politely \"do you have any suggestions? I love hearing them\".  So service was friendly.   While the food is only 3 stars, I want to give them props for being sustainable (biodegradable takeout containers, using the entire vegetable and composting 95% of their waste), so just for the ethics, an extra star."}
{"text":"So this used to be one of my favourite places to eat after doing Yoga in my favourite Yoga studio but ever since the changed Managment this place has lost considerable quality. The sandwiches are not as good and not made with as much heart as before. I think they are also skimping out on portions now. Their line up system is all over the place and they are borderline rude if you don't know their new system. The people behind the counter are not as customer friendly. The place was empty and I was standing there for sometime at the counter as the pixie blond girl sauntered by me three times just \"doing her thing\" as I was clearly waiting to order. No, she was not busy as there was not anybody waiting for their order. It was clear she was avoiding eye contact because I was staring right at her. It was getting a bit embarrassing so I just walked away. Why show up for work when you don't want to serve customers? It's not like she could not see me standing at cash. Octopus Garden, please bring back the old management! These people just don't fit into the culture of the place."}
{"text":"As a regular customer here I have noticed some considerable changes over the past few visits that have inspired me to update my review. I don't like downgrading one of my favourite vegan chains in the city, but this location needs improvement. Here's what's lacking.  1. I am consistently served by the same ambivalent blond who can barely muster a smile. She acts like she would rather be anywhere else than serving people and I am surprised her tenancy has lasted more than 6 months already. She regularly skimps on portion sizes, has personal conversations with friends in the yoga studio while customers are waiting, and doesn't listen when I'm placing my order, which is the same thing I always order. I've had to tell her I want the rice more than once a few occasions.  She is 50% of the downgrade with this location and she seems to be the only one there Monday - Friday. Have they completely forgotten this location or do they have a severe staffing shortage?  2. UH put up their prices a few months back at all locations, once again making healthy vegan food, slightly less affordable to the dining-out masses. A grain bowl now sets me back $11. If I felt like my take-out container was over halfway to full, I might not mind the $1+ increase but now it just feels like I'm paying more for less food.  3. I've now visited the newest Urban Herbivore location in the Eaton Centre Urban Eatery twice and have been served significantly larger portions with better, *surprisingly* quicker service. It makes the College location seem pretty lacklustre.  I don't get it. This spot has all the makings to be great, but the bad Monday-Friday regular server, combined with the small portions and price bump is really irking me.  They now make all the baked goods in the basement here (I found this out from one of the cheerier, weekend staff) which means a nice selection of vegan cupcakes, donuts and tarts but these items are available at all locations.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan, I'm not even a vegetarian.  I love this place. I wanted to get a ricebowl, and they had what I needed. The ingredient selection here is amazing. Tofu, Tempeh, Beats Lentils... love it. This is probably one of my favorite places to in the \"Urban Eatery\".  I totally loved what I got. It tasted good, I liked the combination of flavours with the dressing. I would totally go back"}
{"text":"We ate here, and had soup and two juices. They staff was really nice, I asked for some bread to go with my soup and they gave it to me, I also wanted to try their cashew mayonnaise, and they gave a spoon of that to me too. Their service is excellent, the soup was delicious, and this is saying something, because it was sweet potato soup, and I normally am not a fan of sweet potatoes. The soup was nice to sit in, I liked the decor, and the things around were pretty interesting.   I would probably go back, especially if I was in the area with vegetarian/vegan friends.  *Note this place is vegetarian friendly (obviously, I just like to note this in my reviews so I can index)."}
{"text":"They just recently redid their menu. I used to be a regular but won't be returning. The famed boxed salads as photographed by Yelpers in the attached pictures have been changed.  You can no longer get bbq tofu, tempeh, roasted veggies, or avocado without paying extra for these \"premium\" toppings. New salad dressings too. Also, they now measure your salad. Every scoop is measured and then the salad is measured into a tiny bowl. Big rip off. Also, they don't appear to have a choice of nuts and seeds anymore. They just have a mix which when I tried it tasted very bitter.   Also, I agree with some of the customer service issues people identified. The employees are either space cadets or rude.  Methinks the long lineup here will soon be dwindling, especially since the new changes to the salad bar no longer justify the rude 'tude."}
{"text":"Fantastic bowls but pretty pricy. The grain bowls are amazing and can usually last a good meal and half. They don't skimp out on the portions but at over 11 dollars id hope not. The barbecue tofu and cauliflower are personal favourites of mine with the fantastic carrot sesame dressing. I really like the variety you get from here and how I'm able to choose exactly what I want in it. The only thing is often the service is less than desirable. Sometimes I will just stand at the counter staring at the guy before they will take my order and do not try coming anywhere near their closing because they will make it clear they do not want you there. As well as the knives are kept in a pretty gross water ball. I know food prices are going up but it's really hard to watch the prices go up and up and up every couple of years it's already a bit on the pricy side for a quick take out place. Overall the food is just too good for me not to go back. It is healthy and fresh and just plain delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place for vegan salads and sandwiches. Very filling but healthy. There isn't much seating here but theres often a spot open."}
{"text":"Full vegan spot right in the Eaton Centre. Quality is great and portions are filling. Great spot for healthy food when you find yourself stuck in the food court."}
{"text":"Okay. I'll be honest, I was not convinced with the curry bowl and juice I paid almost $12.00 for. I mean, in my opinion, when it's counter-service, prices like that seem a little steep. I tried to chalk it up to the fact that, yes, everything (as far as I know) is fresh, organic, and all those good things you like to hear about what you're ingesting. However, despite my surprise at the expense, the curry bowl was amazingly tasty (and turned me on to curry), and the juice was incredible.   On the weekend I was feeling blue and I knew I needed an ample supply of substance in my tummy as I would be headed out to drink loads of alcohol, so I headed over to this place to grab a sandwich. I had been saving the chance to try it until I really needed it. I got the BBQ Tempeh.  Now, this is not an exaggeration. The sandwich I ate that day was possibly the best sandwich I have ever had in my life (except for those little packaged sandwiches you can buy in delis in England.. oh man). And I love sandwiches. I love bread. As a vegan, it is really difficult to find good and interesting sandwiches. This thing was big and kept me satisfied until 5 AM.   You know, when I think about it, the amount of money I spend on shitty food that has no nutritional value (protein, vitamins, etc.) is vast in comparison to the money well-spent at Urban Herbivore.   Just go, seriously. Do it."}
{"text":"Toronto friend M W* was only under a little pressure to bring me somewhere yummy. There are too many other options in that neighborhood.  She did good.  Urban Herbivore has a simple menu.  5-6 sandwiches, same with salads, with the option of salad wraps (but not on Sundays-boo!), and a small selection of soups and fruit smoothies.  The smoothies aren't like Jamba Juice, though, as they are more fruit and pulp.  I got an apple, lemon, ginger smoothie.  M W got pulled a yellow fruity drink from the silver tub by the register.  It was pineapple, plus finely diced fruit, slivers of basil, another undetectable juice, and ice- perfect for a sweltering day.  Our sandwiches were ginormous.  I don't recall what M W got (but you can be sure it was veggie!) but I got the sesame tempeh.  Not just any tempeh but one with avocado, walnut-spinach pesto, date-olive tapenade, lemon tahini, tomatoes, greens, alfalfa on a house-made multi-grain.  Hot damn.  I also grabbed the pink counterpart to her yellow fruit/basil drink, since my smoothie was annihilated.  The fruit bits that didn't make it into my straw got greedily eaten later.  Move over boba tea.  This is my new drink obsession (and hubby approved)!  *Full name is omitted to protect the innocent.  And protection for me.  She'll probably kill me if I get her obsessed with yelping!  (This review was originally posted on 6/10/2008 when yelp had not yet expanded to Toronto.)"}
{"text":"A bit of a let down. Got the coconut curry, which should be the easiest thing to make, and but it was not ok. Really disappointing, especially since vegan food can be SO good and meals like this really don't help the cause."}
{"text":"I'm vegan and love this place!  Thirteen dollars gets you a HUGE amount of food.  The bowls are massive, and with so many components to it, you get a different flavour profile in every bite.  The ingredients are always fresh.  Sammiches and salad bowls are terrific.  The staff is always friendly.  The cupcakes are a disappointment though.  Not very flavorful and extremely dense.  I haven't had any of the other deserts; I rarely have any room left, the portions are massive."}
{"text":"I always order the salads so this review will only be based on the salads. This is my go to salad bar for lunch when I'm at work. For the huge portion of salad the price is really good. They have 3 different types of greens you can choose from; kale, arugala (not sure to spell it lol) and spinach mix. I always get the kale and arugala (other salad joints charge more for kale but not UH) and they are the only salad bar I know of that has pickled toppings and they are the best. I add it to my salas all the time. You get 6 toppings included with the salad bowl.. I usually get pickled cucumbers, Kim chi, pickled beets, cooked broccoli, avocado and tofu. The pickled toppings make the salad taste so much better and because of that you don't even need a heavy salad dressing so I usually get olive oil. The salad is so big sometimes it's enough for me for 2 meals.  Also ask for what they have at the back that you can add to the salads... For some reason they never post those items. It's items like tempeh, grilled vegetables, bbq tofu.   Some times if u come in the morning they have samples of muffins or cupcakes for tasting and they are so yummy."}
{"text":"UH Sandwiches= Freakin Finger lickin good!  I cant wait til next time i visit kensington, to try their salad bowls and grain bowls, and not to forget those yummy looking spelt muffins. :D"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying I'm a carnivore. Also let me point out I was raised by a mother who is a vegetarian. So I'm no tofu snob and I understand that you can have a good meal with no meat. My travelling companion was a vegan and we were meeting up with her vegan blog buddy so needless to say. . . it was \"Vegan place HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\" This place was suggested by fellow Yelpers and it was right around the corner for both us and her friend. So we made our way there and worked our way in. It was crowded and I found out why. I ordered the avocado with olive ciabatta sandwich. It was delicious and only about 9 dollars!!!! Piled high with sprouts and avocado I could hardly finish it! I can see myself coming here especially with my non-meat friends and family."}
{"text":"Vegan!   I recommend their combo meals. There are 4 combo options - some come with a dessert pastry or smoothie. I ordered the soup + entree combo (cedar). The soup was warm and delicious - today it was a sweet potato, carrot, coconut milk based soup. Unfortunately it was completely smooth, no chunks inside. The bowl was huge!! I ordered the Alpaca bowl, which was 1/2 bowls that doesn't come with brown rice/super grains. It has sooo many different ingredients, including hummus, chickpeas, carrots, fresh spinach and parsley, cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, raisins, and tofu steaks. It was topped with coconut, chia seeds, and nuts. I actually wouldn't order this bowl again because I'm not huge on herbs and onions and it was pretty bland even with the dressing. Came out to $17 (rounded).  There is free wifi here! TP something and no password :)  Lost 1 star for being so expensive :'("}
{"text":"3.5 stars - only because I stopped by briefly for a cupcake.  Pros:  - Staff were friendly. - Delicious vegan red velvet cupcake. - I really like the interior and ambiance - it was very relaxing, especially with the wooden bar table, hanging potted plants and the fact that most of the restaurant is surrounded by glass.   Cons:  - Pricey - especially for the bowls."}
{"text":"Decent food, but not the best. The sandwiches are super messy to eat. I like their smoothies. Unfortunately they're overpriced and the service can be lacking."}
{"text":"Wanted yet another veggie option and found a lot of positive reviews about Urban Herbivore, so I told a veggie loving friend to join me.  What a mistake, in a city like Toronto, and that right in Kensington Market, my expectations are higher. I ordered the moroccan quinoa stew but sadly it tasted like a tired chili that Tim Hortons might serve. The quinoa was way over cooked and the stew was for lack of better words mushy.  My friend had their grain bowl, which looked ok, but again with over cooked quinoa, fresh veg and salad dressing, you will be eating soggy salad and no one likes soggy salad.  I'm sure at some point this place was legit fresh and good and maybe they still are but my visit was lack luster. Also, get off your vegetarian high horse and don't tell my friend how to order, when he's reading ingredients on your board vs looking at them, if this is not how you want customers to order, don't put up a board."}
{"text":"I'm here about once a week and I always get the salad bowl. It's a little pricey but I'll pay for a big, good salad.  I enjoy sitting outside or inside by the window. The only other seating area has big tables and uncomfortable/awkward seats.  The staff is a little surly but it's part of the place's charm. lol"}
{"text":"Food was decent, and I appreciated finding real vegetarian food after a week of travelling throughout the province eating overcooked soggy vegetables, iceburg lettuce and ranch dressing.  But for a place specializing in somewhat innovative veg food, I was a bit underwhelmed.  Food was good but not great, and it was expensive.  I got the moroccan stew with tempeh. It was close to $12.  I wanted quinoa instead of rice which would have been another $1.50 but they were out.  It was just as well, as $12 was already too much for what it was.the stew consisted of mostly carrots and kabocha, with a few chickpeas, half of the bowl was rice (at least a mix of brown and black rice) and with 2 crispy pieces of a cracker/toast thing.  I like carrots and kabocha and toasty crackery things- a lot, but a veg place should know a little more about veg nutrition and the importance of getting enough protein. Had i not added tempeh it would have just been a bowl of carbohydrates with 5 chickpeas. I already ate a month's worth of carbs the week before I got here and was hoping for more.  I shudder to think of the nutritional profile of what I ate.  Mostly carbohydrates and not enough protein, and no green veggies except for the topping of 7 leaves of baby spinach.  Tempeh was okay but thinly sliced and perhaps baked and some pieces were too crispy.  The sauce in the stew was okay but on the bland side.   seating was limited and a bit of a cafe / modern diner vibe.  not super cozy or anything.  but big windows for people watching.  service was decent but a bit amateur, the kind of place where all servers seem especially young with limited people skills.    The neighborhood is AWESOME and I'd love to come back.  I'd give this place another try since there are so few real vegan / veg places around and the food was fine, just pretty basic and something i could make myself.  But I did notice a vegetarian chinese place, kings cafe,  a bit further south down the street and might give that a try instead  edited to correct spelling :)"}
{"text":"I love you, Urban Herbivore.  As a vegan traveler, I'm always stoked when I can find something that's vegan and tasty.  Boy did they win at that.  The staff is super friendly and awesome, too.  Great all-around.  I wish I had come for a larger meal because everything on the menu looked amazing.  I was only in Toronto for 2 and a half days and I came here twice if that tells you anything.  The first time I came in and just had a muffin and some tea in the afternoon after attempting to eat the worst meal I've ever been served at a restaurant elsewhere.  You know it's good when this muffin was so amazing that it totally changed my mood.  I had a pear-raspberry muffin and wished I could have eaten 5 of them, it was so good.  Big chunks of pear on the muffin, too.  Oh, yum.  I'm salivating just thinking about it.  We also came here again to grab some food to eat on our flight home.  Again with the muffins.  We got a few apple-cranberry muffins and a blueberry-flax muffin and a chocolate chunk cookie.  Yum, yum, yum.  Seriously, best muffins I've ever had.  I wish Urban Herbivore was in Vancouver so I could go more often.  I'll definitely make a point to come here whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"I went to the one at Eaton Center, and ordered the BBQ Tofu sandwich and it was so good I love it and the service was very friendly! :)"}
{"text":"I had the Beluga Bowl and then didn't eat the soup they sent because it wasn't yam as I'd ordered. They also sent along a bag of cookies I couldn't eat. If places are going to make substitutions, please ask first! Tons of us are avoiding certain foods and order specifically to our needs. So... 20 extra minutes on the chat with Foodora.   The bowl was messy, though had good stuff in it (I skipped the dressing). It wasn't particularly fresh and the sprouts were full of bacteria (gross) -- you can tell by spraying them with a 3% H2O2 solution and watching it bubble and hiss.   This is the 3rd time I've tried food from here; it's like the McDonald's of \"healthy\" and I'd eat it again in emergency only. Impact is way better."}
{"text":"I'm developing a little pattern when I stop in here.  I usually come by, post visit at the hair salon (chura).  Today, I ordered a grain bowl, with the bruschetta (which I think is my fave topping), avocado, tofu, beets, red peppers and snow peas.  It was super tasty.   I had their avocado sandwich last time, but today, the bread wasn't ready yet.  I'm glad I had the bowl, it was delish."}
{"text":"I really like the location in Kensington market and this one I like way less.  I feel like they are stingy with premium ingredients and also I guess the food court at the eaton centre gives it a far more assembly line feel.  The ingredients are fresh though and it's just as tasty as the other location.  You have to ask for things like avocado and tempeh etc.  They won't always offer it even if there is an extra cost associated.  I guess this can be remedied by getting to know their menu really really really well.  That having been said it's a unique offering as far as a food court goes, so it's good that way."}
{"text":"Vegan sandwiches are one of my favorite things to eat so I was prepared for guaranteed love for this place. But the selection is so utterly uninspired, I had trouble figuring out which option was the least boring. I went with the roasted vegetable, and at $10, I was not super pleased. Would have been better off ordering the ubiquitous \"veggie sandwich\" of any 'ole place where a sandwich may be purchased. Though, the bread was better than average. According to the counter-staff-person, all of the sandwiches have the same bruschetta topping and tahini dressing, except for the TLT. So my first suggestion for improvement is to make each sandwich more unique by dressing them differently. Special sandwiches \"of the day\" would also be appealing for those who would be frequent customers. Then, at $10, at least give a small side like some slaw, or even just a pickle spear. And one last thing, potatoes are an unpleasantly weird thing to include on a sandwich.   I guess this is perhaps an excellent place to get a salad, but I think I'd just pick up fresh veggies from one of the many affordable produce markets in the area and throw that together myself."}
{"text":"This place has okay food but the service is so abysmal that I'm not coming back. I've been here a few times and it's always the same rude service, they ignore you for like five minutes and then act like you're a nuance. Don't go here there are a lot of better options in the market."}
{"text":"Consistently bland food, with little seasoning and no oomph. Salad dressings taste watered down, marinated tofu is flavourless, ingredients are sparse and slightly wilted. The staff....well, the girl who served me today was a grumpy little twat who was speaking to me like I was a 5 year old. So I gave her the good ol' death glare that could have burned a thousand villages and got her to back off. This place sucks and is way too expensive for nothing special. Skip it."}
{"text":"I was pretty unimpressed with Urban Herbivore. I ordered a salad bowl, and while it's a pretty big serving, you only get a choice of six topics.... But what if you're indecisive like me and like a little bit of a whole bunch of different things?!   At the price point of $11.50 for one salad, I could have gotten a better quality salad from  Freshii. When in Kensington, I almost always go to Hibiscus, but decided to mix things up this time. A decision I definitely regret. Although Hibiacus has raised their prices slightly, it still would have been cheaper than this bowl from Urban Herbivore.  The staff at Urban Herbivore just added insult to injury. Both workers behind the counter were surley and did not look happy to be there at all. They minimally engaged with customers and simply barker \"1.... 2.... 3....\" Etc as customers added each topping to their bowls.  I doubt I will return. Hibiscus remains my Kensington Market staple!"}
{"text":"I got one of the salad bowls- it was fantastic. The sauces on it were delicious. It was so large in size that I ate the rest for dinner! Would definitely eat eat there again for fast healthy food. The food court is too busy for my tastes, but this is perfect for a quick lunch or take away."}
{"text":"I used to rave about this place. I loved going to the one in the Eaton Centre because of their daily deals, which includes half a sandwich and salad or soup. Compared to the shitty options in the Urban Eatery, I loved this place.  However, coming to this location, they didn't have any deals, and the service was pretty terrible.   Cons:  - rude service. The servers here are not where near as delightful as the servers in the Urban Eatery location. - Muggy/no air conditioning, especially on a hot day  - OVERPRICED AF. I swear I can make a much better salad with more flavor for a quarter of the price.  Pros: - Good option if you want to eat healthy (although there are cheaper and more flavorful options)  - Good for baked goods as they are the only things that my boyfriend can eat.   Overall, I won't be coming out of my way to visit you guys again. Maybe if I have to eat at the Eaton Centre, I'll come - but never to this location"}
{"text":"Cute little spot that can easily go unnoticed at the corner of Kensington Market. Portions are huge, but the prices reflect that. Had to split my meal into 2, so in the end it was worth it :)  You can pretty much build your own salad so customize to your liking/taste.  The only thing I didn't like about this place is the lack of seating and the bathroom that is not even in the same building.."}
{"text":"The vibe: Vegan, eco-friendly, hippie spot (and I mean that in a good way.) There's a sign on the door that says No Fur. So if you're dressed head to toe in leather, fur, or a graphic tee with a Hummer on it (I hope those don't exist), you might want to stay outside. The service is friendly, sometimes a bit slow, but that's how things should be in the market, so I'm not complaining. There are a few spots to sit along the windows to watch the people in the market.   The food: If you're feeling like you might be on the brink of scurvy, perhaps you should come by here and stock up on some vitamins and a variety of healthy stuff. You can get a big salad with all kinds of healthy toppings and yummy dressings. The sandwiches are also a great option.   The drinks: Delicious freshly squeezed juices and lemonades for a hot summer day.   My go-to meal: The avocado sandwich on the olive bread. So filling. So delicious.   Secret: If you ask nicely, you can have lettuce AND spinach on your sandwich. Score!"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place, but for the past year it's been going further and further downhill. The staff are often surly and throw things together haphazardly. The muffins are always either burnt or (like today) undercooked and mushy. The chance of it being good these days is about 1 in 5.   It's really disappointing because I loved their food so much and was happy to pay the premium price, but I am pretty much giving up on them :("}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times and really like it. This place is a refreshing choice in the Eaton Centre food court.  Their prices float around $10. You can build your own bowl and load it with highly nutritious veggies! Kale, broccoli, super grains, sweet potato, carrots, kimchi, you name it! I like the tahini dressing.   The value for the quantity is worth it. Plenty of food packed into that container - I always feel stuffed eating the salads from here.  Completely underrated location. It's never busy... This was the only place in the food court without a lineup on Boxing Day. (McDonalds had 30+ employees working shoulder-to-shoulder that day.. a memorable sight.. these workers were just like minions..)."}
{"text":"Was pretty stoked to stumble upon this place while at the Eaton Centre -- a healthy option at a mall food court! Sadly it can't quite escape its location and my few experiences have been pretty middle-of-the-road.  I've grabbed the coconut curry stew a couple of times and it's pretty good. They go a little mental on the amount of rice, but it's quite tasty on a cold winter night. I once had the Hippo bowl which seemed to be missing BBQ tofu, which would have made it stronger -- so if you're getting takeout you might wanna double-check your order. I've had the Panda bowl in Kensington (which I liked) but this mall version didn't taste quite as good, but overall I've enjoyed everything I've had there.  Staff can range from awesome to I-hope-they-get-my-order-right. I guess with it being in the mall the turnover might be as quick as their fast food neighbours.   If you're at the mall and wanna eat healthy then by all means eat here -- I'm sure it's your best/only option for vegan grub at the Eaton Centre. The prices are decent as well and you won't feel like garbage when you clear your tray. Certainly much better above-ground options nearby though."}
{"text":"hello there.  every Vegan or no Vegan  human kind should try this amaizing place  not to pricey good food accely delicious .im eating this amaizing food over 6 years . and still love it . staff are always changing in good wich is a good sign the owner realy cares about they're guest's . and if you ever are disapointed wich i hope not tell to a Urban Herbivore staff what  is you're complain about and for sure they will try serve you better . the best dish is tlc sandwich on fresh Rosmary Fecacia. yummy. ill enjoy one right tomorow ."}
{"text":"Vegetarian sandwiches are usually pretty predictable (grilled veggies with some sort of cheese) and sometimes if you don't eat dairy, you're out of luck!  well, not at Urban Herbivore!  I had a great bbq tofu sandwich with tons of avocados and lots of other veggies.  Also got some of their green juice which i think is the same as the one at Fressen. Definitely worth every penny and probably the best veg sandwich in town!  Also, i think Its great that they use eco takeout containers."}
{"text":"Great concept but the smoothie wasn't made fresh it was sitting on ice I got the smoothie with kale the first few sips were amazing and the rest of the smoothie was just thick leafy residue that I couldn't even drink had throw it away. All and all if they freshly blended the smoothie I'll be back."}
{"text":"Bought a \"freshly squeezed\" orange juice for $6 and it tasted watered down. Just buy a 2L tropicana."}
{"text":"After my second trip to Urban Herbivore, I was less impressed than the first time. Even though I got there before 1pm, they were running out of a lot of their stuff (ie. bbq tofu) and had none to replace it. I also found the staff to be a lot more unfriendly. The woman who was serving us seemed like we were inconveniencing her. This made our visit rather uncomfortable. Maybe she was having a bad day? Either way her eyes glared at us in a \"what the hell do you want?\" kind of way as we stood there waiting to order. I don't know if I'll rush back to this location anytime soon. If I'm paying $13 for quinoa and veggies I expect service with at least a hint of a smile."}
{"text":"Visited here again and ordered the coconut curry  on quinoa. This dish was amazingly flavourful, hearty and had surprise! Pineapple in it!  A satisfying and generous portion for $9. Best food court experience ever!"}
{"text":"I happened on this place during a walk through Kensington Market.  I was initially intrigued by its roof of sprouting vegetation.  My husband was the one who pointed out its a vegan restaurant.  I ordered the moroccan stew and an almond cupcake with chocolate frosting to go.  When I finally got a chance to eat it, I thought I died and went to heaven.  Warning...one order of stew is enough for 3 people.  Warning...be seated and firmly propped up when eating the cupcake."}
{"text":"Kensington market on a beautiful sunny day, a bowl of quinoa with tofu, tempeh, artichoke, grilled veggies, mushrooms, avocado with sweet & spicy dressing. The bowl was so heavy I was able to eat it for lunch and dinner! Now that's a good deal. I haven't tried their muffins but looks filling and delicious."}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times. And every time the service just keeps getting worse.....  I love the food but the service is terrible.  The employees seem soo unhappy, aren't helpful, and are just in general BAD.  The one time they even forgot my protein for my salad that I paid for!!!   There's so many delicious vegetarian/vegan places in the neighborhood, UHerbivore better step up their game!"}
{"text":"Bringing someone here is the exact opposite of how to expose them to vegetarian cuisine.    The FOOD:  I've been here twice and tried a soup, a stew and a sandwich.  The lentil soup was just inexplicably bland.  The sandwich somehow seemed to extract the flavor from the vegetables.  Vegetarian food normally is very flavorful, both well-spiced and well-seasoned; however, this is quite a miss on that account.  The SERVICE:  Wow, the counter agents are unfriendly.  Not helpful, no smiles, impatient.  They had run out of dishes, so only oddy sized dishes were available to fit on the tray, which did not fit.  So basically it turned out to be a difficult exercise to eat.  Even worse, the dish return area had not been cleared.  The stack that was building looked like it was from a Chinese Acrobats showing.  Almost impossible to balance anything else.  The seating was also a disaster, uncomfortable chairs, overly full.    OVERALL: I see that this place used to be good, but right now, I would call it a disaster. It's perhaps the worst food I've had in Toronto.  In fact, I brought a vegetarian colleague here the first time I came and he only finished 1/3 of his plate...that said more than enough.  Very embarrassing for me."}
{"text":"Okay so this place was incredibly good. I'm stuck in between a 3 and a 4 and it has nothing to do with the taste; I just can't believe I spent that much money on fast food (almost $20) I realize that's whole other rating scheme on here but I have to justify it as a whole experience.   Some days out of the year I don't eat meat (religious reasons) and I stumbled upon this place because it seemed easier than trying to weed the meat out of a meal elsewhere. Not evident by my yelp visits, but I also like to eat healthy on most days. I ordered a bowl and it was so filling that I had to eat it in three sittings throughout the afternoon. It was delicious! There wasn't a portion of it I didn't enjoy. I'd definitely recommend it, whether you're vegetarian or not! But it's not a cheap eat, so if you're looking for something quick and easy, you're only steps away from good old  mods!"}
{"text":"Went by this place to grab some food today with two of my friends. Even though the place is slightly small, it had a great atmosphere. I had the Tofu Curry Bowl with black and sticky rice; my friend got the handwich (which was adorable) with coconut; and my other friend got the Moroccan stew with black and sticky rice. Really would recommend this place for all vegans out there."}
{"text":"I find it hard to explain to people why I love Urban Herbivore, given that my visits there basically entail my paying $12 for a large box of vegetables with some tofu and dressing thrown in there. But honesty, aside from the slightly inflated price point, I can't see what's not to love - Urban Herbivore is all about simple, fresh, and delicious food, and at the end of the day, that's what counts for me!  As I mentioned, I always opt for a grain bowl or a salad bowl when I visit. The portion size is MASSIVE (which, if you're like me, is a very good thing indeed), and the ingredients they use are always high-quality and tasty. The staff are perhaps a bit on the sullen/quiet side, but they've been very kind to me in making some exceptions to their topping rules before (you're not allowed more than one pick from this one group of proteins). I have it on good authority that the sandwiches are to die for - I will definitely be sampling one next time I come by! Also a promising baked goods selection.   Bottom line: No, you don't go to Urban Herbivore for a fancy meal out, but you DO go to Urban Herbivore for a mountain of all-natural goodness. If you're in the area and you're feeling flush with cash, then it's a great place to grab lunch."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian living in a not-very-vegetarian city (meaning, there's always a veggie option but it rarely involves any creativity beyond salads and grilled cheeses), I have a serious love-on for this granola soup, sandwich and salad shop in the Kensington Market.  Your base-model options involve veg-friendly ingredients that range from user-friendly like barbecue tofu, to the more adventurous but delicious items whose descriptions involve stories of boiling, baking and packing 'grain proteins' and other things that hardly matter once slathered with pesto, miso mayo, and fresh veggies. Slap it between whole grain or olive foccacia loaves and you've got yourself a winner no matter how you swing it.  At $8.50 per sandwich with additional toppings (from roasted vegetable medleys to celery root) coming at an extra cost, it could get pricy depending how fully loaded you like your hogie. Still, it's a delicious, messy, sunny day lunch option that's just waiting to happen."}
{"text":"This laid back vegan spot has been on my \"to visit\" list for a while. I had the moroccan stew on some seriously good quinoa. Clearly I'm cooking the stuff wrong at home. I didn't really understand the handful of greens on top of the stew or that I told them it was to stay and got my meal in a to-go container (especially considering the eco angle they're going for) but my food was hot, delicious and came to me quick, which is all I really needed tonight. Girl behind the counter was helpful and friendly.   Word to the wise, don't wear your fur trimmed anything to this joint as they expressively forbid it in their space."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Florida so I'm trying to hit all the vegan spots while I'm here. Am I ever glad I stopped into Urban Herbivore. Great menu. As soon you walk in the door the wonderful aromas permeate your nostrils. I ordered the Moroccan Stew with grilled seitian. It was absolutely to die for. I was completely stuffed. I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for vegan food. Flavors aren't exceptional, but the food seems fresh. Portion sizes are HUGE, I barely managed to eat half my bowl. They also get a little crazy with the sauce, so ask for light sauce/dressing unless you want soup. I also got a cupcake which was pretty good. Not too sweet or dense which I appreciated because most vegan baked goods are both. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Not bad for a fast food place at all. I wish they had more locations. I've had a few dishes from here & they've all been good. Nothing amazing, or that your crave after the fact but still enjoyable, nutritional & convenient. When you're out & about running errands, shopping it's a good place to refuel. It's not the cheapest but it's also not the most expensive option either. Check the place out to see if it's your cup of tea."}
{"text":"First off I am the farthest thing from a vegetarian or vegan. I love meat, I love burgers, I love cheese, etc. however after trying their $10 small salad and sandwich lunch combo, I am going back many times. Their salad has tons of flavour, their sandwiches are filling and very tasty. Never thought I'd say that as an omnivore at a vegan wannabe restaurant! Best place ever!!!"}
{"text":"Our family (2 adults + 2 kids) are regular customers, we visit 2-3 times per week after our kids' lessons at the near-by YMCA. We have always had a very positive experience at this location, the staff are accommodating and super nice, our favourite menu items are delicious and nicely prepared.  We recommended this location to a few friends who are now regular customers."}
{"text":"Love their salad and sweet potato soup! Their toppings are mostly marinated so your salad is extra delicious with all the fixings. Salad usually is never filling for me but this as a dinner is more than enough."}
{"text":"For my first experience, I am not impressed. But I am willing to give this place a second try. Why? Because this is one of the few places that serves all vegan menu items. Anyway, I didn't really feel welcomed. I sort of felt like an outsider for some reason? Maybe the girl at the counter somehow knew I didn't live in Kensington or rarely hung out in the area. But I love Kensington, so it's not like I had any pre-judgement walking in. I just wanted to try some great vegan food. And judging by everyone else's reviews, that's what I should have got. Instead I got the moroccon Stew with millet and black beans. It was like something I would have been served in a third world country. Ok. Maybe that's rude, and over exaggerated, but that's the first thing that comes to mind. This was an over priced, small portioned bowl of gruel with winter root veggies and it was not impressive. Plus it had so many damn fennel seeds in it I cringed nearly every bite. People don't like fennel seeds!  Maybe I should have just stuck to a sandwich. But I figured I could make a sandwich with the same ingredients on the same type of bread at home.   There's not much seating in this place. You basically are stuck sitting along bar stools facing the window. Lot's of people seem to come here and maybe find it reliable for juices, salads etc. But to me that's nothing special. I wanted to try one of their large muffins or the banana bread, which looked delicious, but I was so bummed with my bowl of millet and stew that I figured it wouldn't be worth the money.  I don't know, maybe this place is for that lazy vegan that doesn't want to make their own food at home and is ok with paying more for mediocre stuff from a cafe where their friends work. But like I said, I'll try it one more time when I'm in the area and see if that was just an off day at Urban Herbivore."}
{"text":"Urban Herbivore is one of the few healthy options in the food court at Eaton's. So, I decided to take this opportunity to try vegan food for the first time. I ordered the coconut curry and the shicken sandwich. For something that's mostly veggie, I'd expect to still feel hungry afterwards. But this wasn't the case here - surprisingly, both of these options were very filling. Taste-wise though, I didn't fully enjoy it. The coconut curry wasn't very flavourful. I was mostly eating a ton of sweet potato and quinoa which didn't have any bold flavours. The shicken sandwich consisted of tofu that looks like chicken, tomato, lettuce, and sweet chili sauce. Maybe I'm just not a huge fan of tofu, but I felt like there was flavour missing here as well.   I probably won't come back here but it's great to see that there is a healthy establishment for those who want vegan food in such a convenient place!"}
{"text":"Hmm, they've just increased their prices AND it now costs $1 extra if you want your grain bowl with quinoa (vs. rice). Dislike.   I come here regularly and service is highly variable. Like the last time I went, I commented \"oh that's new\" when she charged me $1 extra for quinoa. The chick had this grumpy face and just said, \"yeah, we increased all our prices and quinoa is really expensive.\" Would it kill her to crack a smile? On other occasions though, I find the staff super-nice and cheerful, so I guess it depends.   It was a toss up between 2 or 3 stars, but I still give this place 3 stars because despite the fact that it's expensive, they do use really fresh ingredients and it's one of the few healthy options in the food court. And their muffins are really good!"}
{"text":"BEST place to get a salad, its massive filled with a variety of vegetarian (vegan?) options for an affordable price. I wish I lived closer because it's SO great!"}
{"text":"Pretty delicious stuff, I must admit. Also not expensive, very fresh, and fast service  I am not vegan or veggie but this is good, and very filling I got the monday special - a half tempeh sandwich (OMG yum what is tempeh I love it) and a small salad with carrots, beets, spinach, artichoke, peas, quinoa and bbq tofu (again- omg yes)  Very filling and all together 10$+tax I also had a pineapple lemonade. Which I AM IN LOVE WITH"}
{"text":"Pretty delicious bowls and portions at fair price points! Urban herbivore is located in the foodcourt at Eaton's, and offers a wide range of healthy and nutritious vegan dishes and desserts. I got the oaxaca bowl and a side of sweet potato soup. The bowl  was pretty delicious filled with alot of fresh vegetables and lentils, topped with a flavorful vingearette. Though what I liked best about UH's bowls are the portion size: they're huge! You can easily split a bowl into two filling meals. The soup was just ok, nothing special and I wouldn't get it again but I'll come back for the other bowls!"}
{"text":"My first time visiting. I asked Zach who was the person working behind the counter what was a good option for my preferences, which I stated.   He told me none of their options would be good for me ( I wanted something light ) I ignored him and asked what was the most popular. He said all their options are popular. I made my choice and paid.   I found him extremely rude and not helpful at all. As I was putting my card away he went up to the girl who was making the food. He whispered something in her ear and she looked at me. They laughed.   I'm not an idiot and I know he was saying something about me.   She made my salad and forgot about my preference for no hummus. I had to ask her to remove it.   I do not appreciate rude service from a teenager with attitude.   Extremely rude, unhelpful and demoralizing experience."}
{"text":"Seriously one of my favorite beyond favorite places to go for lunch or just grab for take out. The seating space up stairs is so nice and roomy. Love going up there and grabbing some free WiFi or playing my 3DS. I usually get the same thing there, the Beluga which is amazing. I don't know how they do their BBQ tofu but it's to die for! The hummus and peas, everything is always so fresh! Once the avocados were a bit weird tasting but I didn't care. Everything else was delicious as usual!   The servers are always really nice. I always make sure to tip them even if its a dollar or something. Sometimes I get a combo with a smoothie or a muffin top! Their cupcakes are amazing too! Some of them are on the citrus side which I'm not crazy about, like my classic flavors, chocolate, vanilla, etc."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a late dinner just as the mall was closing. So many hearty options you have to double check it's not meat! The juice is fresh and delicious. The portions were huge. I could not finish even half of my bbq tofu sandwich. The service was also very friendly. I came just as they were closing but they were not bothered (or at least didn't let it show). My only complaint is that the prices are a little steeper than they should be, and this is much better for grab-and-go because I don't like busy mall food courts."}
{"text":"A co worker introduced me to this place that I never knew existed at the eaton centre food court.   The BIGGEST let down was when I realized that you can't add grilled chicken breast, or steak, or pulled pork to your salad. I was upset and wanted to go for a burger beside UH, thinking that it's such a rip off to pay $10+ for just veggies. Before I was able to make up my mind, it was my turn to order. Line moved exceptionally fast.  I customized my bowl to get the most out of it (trying to be positive). I added all my \"preferred\" veggies, even though I don't prefer veggies in general at all. I got lentils, baby kale, brown rice, carrot, corn, avocado, etc...I felt like a rabbit! Since I was being so healthy already, might just stick to it till the end. I got the ginger and pineapple dressing to finish my customized bowl.  Surprisingly, I didn't hate it at all. I felt neutral about the taste, and amazing about my health. All ingredients tasted fresh and clean. Everything went well together. I recommend their brown rice and lentils, so good!   Still don't think it's worth ~$15 for a bowl of veggies, but this will definitely be my go to spot for salad."}
{"text":"I love the food I've had here. However that's based on availability, they are always out of some thing whether it be tempeh, tofu or avocado or all three. The soup is great but they rarely have their better ones heated up, the place is severely understaffed as well and results in longer wait times."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful along with the staff. I would highly recommend coming here, from their sandwiches to their cupcakes everything is delicious. Oh and everything is vegan, the best part!"}
{"text":"The avocado sandwich was the first I tried. It was soooo good! I got it the first few times I went, and then tried the sesame tempeh one. The bread is delicious. Some of the best sandwiches I've ever had! It's been awhile since I've gone, so I don't know if they still have it, but the apple pear juice is very very yummy!"}
{"text":"The fake chicken is better than real meat! Wish I live in dt so I can have vegan sandwich every day!"}
{"text":"Not bad, Not bad.  Limited seating (this is not a sit down restaurant)  just bar stools along a counter. Better to go on a nice day and get your food to go in the park. Good assortment of veg sandwiches. I've had the avocado and the tempeh - both pretty good. But ya, its still just a sandwich! I will have to go back and try one of their rice bowls. But sometimes the whole - make your own combo overwhelms me!!!"}
{"text":"love it  already try the burger and it was way more good than fresh one . i'm also an addict of their brownies which are so biiig and sooo gooodd"}
{"text":"I've been going to UH for over a year now and everything about it just hits the spot. From the combination bowls to the portions to the price! And most importantly everyone who works there is super friendly and hardworking. My favourite is the Tiger bowl it's absolutely filling and portions are ginormoussss! So much better than Kupfert and Kim or iQ that are overpriced, poor customer service, and small portions (I'm still hungry after eating one of their boxes). Keep up the great work at UH!"}
{"text":"Delicious vegan options that make you feel both healthy and full. The salads feel a little pricey until you see the sheer size of them, and the ingredients are generally really good quality. The sandwiches are delicious. More than once, however, I've gone a little bit before closing and they have either already cleaned the sandwich press so they won't make you one, or have run out of bread (!), which is always a little saddening. Still, I'm glad this place exists."}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian but it was definitely worth trying a few months ago. Wanted the Teriyaki Tempeh sandwich for dinner but they were out of tempeh so I just ordered the BBQ Tofu sandwich which came with a pretty tasty kale slaw. The sandwich was quite filling and delicious overall. Not the cheapest option but it's well worth it. I would return to try other options (especially salad bowls and cupcakes) next time I am in Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"I'm still sticking with a solid 5-stars on this one... I decided to deviate from my usual coconut curry and try out a sandwich. I was pretty hungry and I usually get the grilled vegetable sandwich but the last time I had it, it wasn't quite as orgasmic and it made my desk at work a huge oily mess.  Today I went with the Tempeh sandwich and... oh god... another sandwichgasm. Better than the first one I ever had. Wow... Okay sorry... having a moment in front of my keyboard as I recall the sandwich I just devoured.  I've never had tempeh before but after perusing the reviews it seemed to be favorable so when I was looking at the menu, I decided it was time to dive in and try a new sandwich. I asked the girl at the counter what came on it and she told me the Tempeh, sprouts, lettuce, bruschetta mix, olive oil and one other sauce. Compared to the grilled veggie, it didn't sound like it had much going on but I went in head-first anyways. Holy crap was that sandwich huge. I'm always amazed at how the one girl there, very short, kind of tiny, manages to cram so much into a sandwich with little to no effort.  My sandwich stood at least three inches tall in its packaging and held up (didn't fall apart) as I ate it. The flavor was incredible. I swear, if I could eat like this every day, I would go Vegan in a heartbeat. But I like bacon, so that's not gonna happen.  I also decided to get one of their cookies because people had been noting how good they were. I tried a muffin last time and it was dry but tasty. You really need to have it with coffee or tea or something to wash it down. But the cookies - I'm drooling staring at the other half of my cookie. I forget what this one was called, I want to say Muddy something, but its incredible. What a great desert - first of all, you could easily split this with a friend and its still huge (we ended up cutting it into eighths to devour). But MAN that's one of the best cookies I've had in a long while. I don't have much of a sweet tooth but it had a really good balance of sweetness and its almost like a cross between a cookie and a brownie.  Gets better and better every time I come here!"}
{"text":"Super, great selection. Great for novice and advanced vegetarians. Yummy soups. Down-to-earth atomosphere."}
{"text":"I stop in Urban Herbivore every time I'm in Kensington Market.  I've only had their pastries, but they are always extremely fresh (usually still warm) and delicious!  Haven't tried their lunch, but I plan to next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Rude service. The girl kept rushing me. I asked for broccoli and didn't realize there was fresh or steamed/boiled so I asked her to switch it for me and she said \"well it's already in.\" So I asked her to take it out. Any normal person would've just changed it without freaking out about how they had spooned the boiled broccoli in already so it was too late to put the fresh. Like, how long does it take to spoon out broccoli with the same spoon you just put it in with? Even if it was double the time it would've taken one second more. Less time than telling me she's too lazy/angry to do it. The food is mediocre. I was recommended to try the lemonade. It's good but not that good. Unique with pineapple. Very mediocre food. Not that I expect to get blown away by a salad but honestly I was like \"this is it?\" Dressing is very lacking. I expect more from a restaurant. I can mix a better one up at home. Rude service and mediocre food. Not worth the $4 for the lemonade even though it was unique and had pineapple and mint. First and last visit. Rude service is unacceptable. The girl at cash was nice though but then the girl who makes the food gets to leave her lasting impression. It's sad because the angry vegan stereotype is perpetuated in this place. Not fair to other not so angry vegans. There is a small patio that's nice in the summer. I like the option to eat outside.  As an update, I recently went for a juice there and it was quite yummy. I've changed my 1 star to 2. They were quicker with service and the juice was good, but this doesn't make up for the horrible experience of last time."}
{"text":"Yeah, I've heard of UH before but never made it down to the other location. I have to say they were doing steady business this Saturday when I was down there. The urban eatery is overwhelming though. I felt like I was an itsy bitsy ant in a gigantic ant hive.That's how many people were there. It was a madhouse. But the UH was more organized than the rest with quick service.   I had the BBQ tofu sandwich that came with a small side salad, homemade orange juice & a chocolate chunk cookie. It was pretty pricey but the portions were huge. The food quality was good, just a tad too much BBQ sauce in the sandwich. I took home half of the sandwich & cookie, it was so large. I don't know how they called it a cookie, it was as big as a full sized muffin if you smushed it flat. I wasn't impressed with the homemade orange juice, firstly it leaked all over the place anytime I touched it & the taste wasn't that great. All in all though, it was an ok meal."}
{"text":"The best salads and muffins ever!  I'm a OG member and I regularly can't escape without buying a muffin.  I love all the flavours...first I loved the sweet potato and date and now my fav is the apple cranberry.  And the green juice is to die for.  Best morning snack ever after yoga: green juice and a muffin."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is so f*¢king awesome! I can't even.....  .....Highlights  *Goodlooking and superfriendly not to mention enthusiastic staff  *They serve this PHENOMENAL beverage called Pineapple Lemonade which is like undiluted tropical sunshine served in a (compostable)cup. Bonus points for this beverages' non-aggressive laxative-esque properties  *You have the option of adding Kimchi to your salad, because Kimchi is the best thing to happen to salad since croutons dammit!  *The Bbq tofu sandwich served on two gorgeous slabs of rosemary focaccia is like the most kickass  delicious and filling sandwich ever, I mean it could taekwondo and muay thai box the f*¢k outta any Quiznos or Subway crap easily with it's hands tied behind it's back!  *The portions are ginormous, for example the takeout salad weighs as much as a small child...ok, I'm exaggerating, but it could take three sittings to eat this beast, unlike the over iceberg lettuced shite salads from some other places, cough cough Freshii, Magic Oven  *They have vegan cupcakes!!!   Ok I gotta stop right here because I'm fangirling way too hard on Urban Herbivore and this review is looking more like insane ramblings of tips. If you're ever in the Eaton Centre (god forbid) and you need to find the ONE decent if not freaking awesome place to eat, go, NOW, RUN!! to Urban Herbivore."}
{"text":"Done with the place and I am sad. This was my go to lunch place for a long time...till they changed their menu recently. Previously you were able to pick 1 \"premium item\" with your salad bowl, but now that will cost extra ($2 I think). Also they have changed their serving size - you now get half of what you used to get. That is a big no no in my books. You can change all you want in the menu but did you expect regulars won't notice the drop in serving size. Sure changing the take-out packaging may mask that for a few people...but how many can you fool?  Thank you but no thank you - I am taking my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"This surprise find is located at Urban Eatery food court of Eaton Centre.. Although I may not be a big fan of food courts, I must say this one took me by surprise.. I tried Urban herbivore as I wanted to try a different sandwich.. Ordered a Chicken Avacado sandwich..(which is actually Vegan sandwich with soya patty lookin just like chicken). Being a Vegan place, their sandwich had a really good taste to it.. The sauces, roasted garlic, fresh veggies, avacado made really delicious with toasted brown bread.. The portion was big and appropriate for price of $10.85 with salad along with it.. Though a bit pricy, liked it.."}
{"text":"Ordered my first grain bowl from Urban Herbivore and I was pleasantly surprised. 5 star for the food and 3 stars for their service and lack of information on their food.  The menu was not as informative as I would expect and I was glad that I checked out the menu online before coming here. For example, the sandwich menu does not list the items that are in each sandwich and for the salad/grain bowl, there isn't a list of toppings available (although you can physically see them). Which means that you will have to constantly ask the server what some of the mysterious food are.  I must say that my first time here was quite intimidating but the food was delicious and the portions were definitely generous (although it does cost around $12 including tax).  For those who think that vegan food is not tasty, Urban Herbivore will definitely prove you wrong!   P.S. The BBQ tofu is to die for!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Tasty all natural food. Kensington vibe. If you're vegan or vegetarian, you will definitely be happy. This is your place.  I'm not fully vegan, but I enjoyed their food. I felt full afterward, but not heavy in my stomach. If you're craving something light and natural, foregoing killing any animals that day, this place is a sure bet. I suppose when it's hot outside, it's nice to eat one of their salads. But even when it's cold outside, they always have some sort of soup of the day that'll keep you nice and toasty in your belly :)"}
{"text":"My first time in Toronto and I knew I had to try this place! I ordered $50 worth of food and juice through Uber Eats and started munching away in bed in my hotel room! Of course, I barely made a dent in it... and think this meal is going to be a 2 day journey. Very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Quite a disappointment. Definitely can be avoided and they are pretty much wasting the food with incomprehensible taste combinations and gigantic portions.  We went for their Beluga bowl (if I recall correctly) and the Tiger Bowl. The veggies were good - quite a healthy combination - but didn't taste fresh at all, something very important in a salad, otherwise, it just kills the whole bowl. The Tofu, in both the bowls, was prepared too badly - slightly rubbery and they perhaps tried to roast it or something, not sure, but it ended up very badly. There wasn't much taste to it. The dressings didn't help much to lift the taste. For drinks, we went for their Kale Smoothie and a Blueberry Smoothie. The smoothies were good actually. The blueberry one seemed to have a hint of cardamom in it.  The staff is quite good and friendly. But still, I can definitely skip this place next time."}
{"text":"Great improvement, quality food and service! Thank you for listening...I'm now a fan of both of your locations"}
{"text":"Super big salads and very vegan friendly.  Beans, greens, grains, and salads plus juices.  Healthy and tasty."}
{"text":"Small cafe with a decent sized salad bar.  I was disappointed that their fresh juices are pre-made and just sitting on ice.  I was expecting it to be freshly juiced upon order.  Their vegan muffins are really good though.  I tried both the sweet potato one and the apple/blueberry one, and both were super yummy!    There are usually one or two people at the counter, one taking orders and another making the salads and sandwiches.  Service can be a bit slow."}
{"text":"Great vegan place in the Eaton Center food court. Had a big bowl of Moroccan stew for 10$ which was well worth it's price. They also carry a large selection of vegan pastries! Recommended."}
{"text":"The staff wasn't that friendly upon entering. Being the first time I visited, which I announced, I thought I'd get a rundown of how it worked. I should have asked, but just wanted to order and get done with it so I wouldn't have to deal with the staff.   Sesame tempeh sandwich was good. It comes with salad if you eat-in. I didn't get a choice of dressing unfortunately. The focaccia it was served on was a little much.   All in all it was okay. I've learned a few lessons now for if I ever go back."}
{"text":"Soup Takeout...  I went in to purchase one of their super yummy pre-bottled soups: sweet potato, coconut, carrot, onions, ect... (unfortunately my bottle wasn't labeled so I am going off the top of my head).   The mason jar of soup was $5 plus $1 deposit."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I'm suffering from mild food poisoning from lunch at Urban Herbivore.   I was really excited to see such a healthy, honest, and ethical restaurant within the mall, so I knew I had to try it out. The menu was quite diverse with salads, soups, and protein-rich sandwiches. I ended up choosing the Tuesday combo special (spinach salad with mushrooms, quinoa, lentils, tempeh, peas, carrots and a a sandwich of what should have been avocado and tempeh). The total cost surprised me at only $11.30, because such healthy food was being offered at truly competitive prices.   The portion of the meal was huge, and I couldn't finish more than a few bites of the salad after having finished the sandwich. However, I did notice the sandwich only had avocado and alfalfa sprout in it, and no tempeh. The salad, as good as it looked, didn't actually taste very good in my honest opinion. The tempeh was just gross and the carrots were horribly salty. I could only down the peas an quinoa.   Minutes after finishing my meal, I felt the sudden urge to puke. A few hours later, I am still in pain from the food from this joint. I'm not quite sure why, but something hasn't settled well in my stomach. Not sure if I will try this again due to this experience, but three stars for the price, variety, concept, freshness, and portion size!"}
{"text":"Eating at Urban Herbivore just makes you FEEL healthy! I enjoyed a lunch on the Kensington patio with a coworker today. I normally get their grain bowl (which is HUGE, usually have to take the other half to go). But today I tried the avocado sandwich which was better than expected!Lots of avocado and tomato, super yummy and juicy. Comes with a side salad. Paired it with a pineapple mint lemonade (I totally recommend this) and I was good to go!"}
{"text":"Mmmm delicious vegetarian food! A great lunch spot -- you can grab some freshly made soup or assemble a salad for under $10 and then just sit and stare at people walking down Kensington. Sounds creepy, is actually really entertaining.  This place is tiny but has a pretty devoted and huge following. And it makes sense. If you care at all about the food you're putting in your body, you'll appreciate the small decisions Urban Herbivore offers you to make your meal healthier. So many different kinds of fresh bread, the option to put all sorts of vegetables and proteins into your salad, a fresh soup that you can tell has nothing artificial or sketchy in it.  If you're visiting Toronto and you want a delicious lunch that won't slow you down with grease, stop by and grab a power lunch and a smoothie. And if you live here and you haven't come by yet...what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan or vegetarian but there's something that draws me to these anti-meat establishments.  I think it's a combination of their rarity, the creativity that goes into the menu, and of course the confidence that you're doing your body good.  The Menu:  It's everything a vegan or vegetarian could want.  Salad bowls, rice bowls,  sandwiches, curry bowls and soups.  You can customize the first three to your liking by picking (A) your leaf / grain / bread (B) your \"meat\" replacement - tofu, tempeh, veggies, etc (C) six toppings (D) dressing.  Seeds and nuts are a bonus:)    Our Order:   My boyfriend had the salad bowl, I had the rice bowl.   We choose things like roasted veggies, asparagus, tempeh, artichokes, tomatoes.  The dressings, carrot sesame ginger and lemon tahini, were fab-u-lous."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious! I always come here for the salad bowl and it is always so large and delicious with any ingredients I choose! The lemon tahini dressing is a definite recommendation! My fiance had the Moroccan stew and it was delicious as well! Definitely recommend this place to all! Oh and the yoga studio in it (octopus garden) is the best I've been too!"}
{"text":"I went in two days ago, in search of a quality gluten-free meal. It was my first time in UH, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  The service made my night. As a recently diagnosed Celiac, I'm *really* careful about what I eat. At this point, I was very frustrated and upset that I couldn't get a GF meal in Kensington (every other place was either closed or being renovated), but the server's professionalism NEVER wavered, she took it in good stride and was the epitome of kind and pleasant. She  was very knowledgeable about what was 'for sure' GF and what wasn't.   It really impressed me, as most places don't seem to understand how easy it is to get contaminated.  The bad news: only two items on the salad bar were GF. I'm not sure if this is common, as we were there at the tail end of their business day. I certainly hope not! I would have given a 5 star review if they'd had more options.  The good news: all the cupcakes are GF... and absolutely delicious.  My partner (who is not a celiac) had the Moroccan Stew and pronounced it delightful (even though he didn't enjoy the bread).  I had a carrot cake and a double chocolate cupcake for dinner.  Cupcake-based dinners are the best kind of dinners!  I can't stop raving about these cupcakes; so moist! Fresh! Tasty!  They had a great crumb and weren't heavy and grainy like many other gluten-free options I've been tortured with. I even called a friend about them, so she could buy them for a GF relative.  Needless to say, I'll be a regular there soon.  My only regret is that i didn't get the server's name; she is a real asset to the restaurant, and deserves the accolades. Because of her, I'll be a fan for life."}
{"text":"Even before ordering, the guy at the register tells me that they don't have half the things on the menu. Been here on previous occasions and they also said they didn't have certain things (last time they said they didn't have any bread -- sandwiches are essentially half their menu...). How hard is it to make sure you have the supplies you need?  Anyway, got a BBQ Tofu Sandwich. The helping size was nice, but the sandwich was incredibly BLAND. Like barely any flavour at all. It also hurt my stomach and I really don't usually have problems like that.  Plus it's located in what must be one of the busiest food courts in the world. Not a nice place to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I've walked by Urban Herbivore many times but this was the first time I ever manned up and ordered something from Kensington Market's umpteenth vegetarian resto. With a little moral support from Ben \"Mr. Halifax\" B we stopped here for lunch.  The menu is quite a sight. There are soups, salads, sandwiches, \"bowls,\" and other veggie and vegan delights. It's all displayed in glorious white comic sans on black, so try not to stare for too long.  The ordering process is messed up. You step up to the counter and place your order. Then you line up AGAIN, and repeat your order to someone behind a sneezeguard who will make your food. Why am I repeating my order? I might try skipping the payment part next time just to see what happens. (Perhaps I will land in vegan prison.)  If Ben B hadn't ordered the BBQ tofu sandwich, I would jumped on it. That said, my Chimmichuri protein sandwich was an excelent choice if I do say so myself. My assumption that it came with grilled vegetables (leading to a weird conversation with the guy making it) is totally their menu's fault not mine, but nota bene that you can add extra toppings on a sandwich for $1.50. We both devoured our sandwiches in no time. The ingredients were fresh, and the wholewheat ciabatta (doused with pesto and miso butter) was perfectly soft and didn't destroy my mouth like so many breads have done before. (Lousy breads! Am I right, people?)  There are only window-facing stools inside. You'll probably want to take your order to go, or grab a spot on the patio if it is available. Under the shade of a tree, it's a lovely spot to watch the Kensington parade on a summer afternoon.  Obligatory Title Pun: Get HERBIN' at URBAN.  Menu Readability: Comic sans. This isn't funny.  Need to mention: It's cash only.  What this place teaches me about myself: I wonder if vegan prison cells use Larabars. (MEATFREECOMEDY. I'm here all week. Try the Tempeh.)"}
{"text":"Sometimes my under-nourished abused body that normally is forced to live on bags of popcorn, falafels and alcohol really craves a salad. And when that happens, I usually make a point to detour to Urban Herbivore on my way home.   Great location with huge windows and seating that doesn't make it awkward to sit by yourself. If it's a nice day take your meal outside and people watch on Augusta. I like the fact that you can choose five things to put in your salad. Fun, delicious and new every time! Plus it will fill you up for about 8 dollars, and the staff are really friendly! You can't go wrong.   To be honest I only took one star off because every time I've been in here I've had to wait about 10 minutes to be served because of line ups. Great for them, bad for me!"}
{"text":"I can't even begin to tell you how to get here once you're in the mall but the trek is worth it. Delicious chickpea Caesar sandwich, spicy black bean soup, cupcakes, macaroons - all mouth-watering and all vegan! I do remember it's in the food court and I had to go down, down, down to get there."}
{"text":"Incredibly tasty soups and sandwiches that are so massive in size you'll be able to re-enjoy the leftovers for several meals afterwards. I like to order the grilled and marinated tofu sandwich and save half of it for the next day's lunch!  Urban Herbivore is always bustling with activity and has a loyal clientele that keeps coming back for healthy, tasty lunch and dinner options."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place because some of the reviews through me off but M suggested it and we went with that. We were both so glad that we ended up eating here! The service was okay (didn't blow me away) but the bread that the burger was on was ammmmazzzzzzing. It was a focaccia bread (my absolute favourite) that was baked in house. We both ordered two different burgers and spilt it in half. We had a shicken burger and a faux beef with avocado burger. The shicken burger was a bit bland. It could have used some sort of chipotle or something just to take it up a notch. The faux beef avocado burger was delicious! We were both really really happy and surprised on how good everything tasted. It came with a side salad (wish they had fries as an option) the chefs that brought the food out let us know where the cutlery and napkins were. Another amazing feature about this restaurant is that they have a fountain that you can refill your water bottle with!!  I would come back here and try a wrap and probably a dessert or smoothie"}
{"text":"Was it my leather wallet that upset the staff? You could tell that Urban Herbivore takes Veganism seriously even prior to you entering the place. There is a crossed-off fur sign (Canada Goose Jackets beware!) on the door that we thought was a symbol of their devotion to the cause.  However, there isn't as much devotion to the food. We had the Moroccan Stew with Quinoa and while the portion was huge the taste was somewhat bland and lacking.  Have you had a dish that you simply stopped eating because it was way too boring? Yes... this stew did not exactly set our taste buds to vegan-disco party.  And although it's a big portion the prices ($10) were not comparable with the value you are getting out of it, and for that price you could try out other Vegan food places in Kensington Market e.g. Hibiscus' Vegan Savoury Buckwheat Crepe."}
{"text":"Who can resist the urge to eat health food? Seriously. It struck me again, a week after my first review of Urban Herbivore.  After my mind blowing, unfathomably delicious rendezvous with the salad bar, I was back for seconds. I strolled in and spotted their refrigerated items and discovered that UH sells soup for $6. You can take it home and have an equally mind blowing, unfathomably delicious meal in the comfort of your very own kitchen. I am doing this as we speak.  I also grabbed a lemonade with chunks of pineapple and julienned mint. I am no stranger to this beverage, but I am reaffirming that it is delicious.  Then the trouble began. Originally I was going to get salad but then I spotted for $2.50 less a \"handwich,\" as in a sandwich with bread slices shaped like hands. This particular handwich had toasted coconut, a tomato, and cashew pesto (or something like that). This was tempting. The woman at the cash register said it was something like a vegan BLT. Sold.  The sandwich was not like a vegan BLT. It was more like a tomato sandwich with heaps and heaps and heaps of toasted coconut (hurray!) with a heavy cashew influence. I didn't love it, to be honest, and it had that vegan-y taste to it, if you know what I mean. I wish I had gotten the salad that I wanted, but hey, live and learn. At least it was a healthy experience.  Get the soup!  PS I asked what the deal was the website and the cashier just kind of laughed it off and said it's always been in shambles. What a shame!"}
{"text":"With Hibiscus right down the street, I don't know why anybody would waste their time at this place. The service is always horrible the portions are pathetic and the meals aren't even good. Take the time to enjoy Hibiscus right down the street and enjoy good food good service and good value for what you get."}
{"text":"Amazinnnng salad. I've tried their Rhino, beluga and tiger... all very delicious options. Their bbq tofu is really good"}
{"text":"I love urban herbivore and find myself visiting all the time! Both at the mall and the one in Kensington market! I get excited when I'm at the mall at lunch time because you can always count on me to get a bowl.  Their staff are always amazing! Super friendly and accommodating. I'm always swapping out ingredients from my bowls that I don't want. I usually get the bowls, switching between tiger and alpaca, and I've tried the hot curry dish before! Everything is amazing and I always have leftovers!!  I'm DYING TO TRY THOSE CUPCAKES THOUGH!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is decent, service is deplorable.  Staff were very unfriendly, and did not smile once. It felt like I was ruining their day by speaking to them. Two of the staff were standing at the back counter, having a very aggressive sounding conversation. It took a half an hour to get my food. I have honestly never had such unfriendly service in my entire life. I had the avocado sandwich, it was good, but not amazing, and very messy to eat. They clearly had not cleaned their panini press in a while, the  bottom of the sandwich had big charred pieces on it. I tried the vanilla cupcake in order to bring my mood up after being disappointed by such atrocious service - but the cupcake was also pretty disappointing. Whoever is running this place should really ensure that the staff are trained on how to appropriately deal with the public. I realize that customer service is not an easy job, but if they find that it is making them so miserable,they may be suited to a different job that does not involve customer service."}
