{"text":"Went last night with some friends, specifically because I had researched its' vegetarian options.

The atmosphere and service is humble and the food is great! What I appreciate most about the menu is the variation and options, as well as the in depth description of the ingredients used in the broths. This is particularly useful should i decide to bring someone with one or various allergens to specific ingredients.

I personally had the Shio Plum ramen, while my partner had the curry steak Tsukemen (dip ramen). I'm always a super big fan of Tsukemen so finding a place with a couple options of it always  excites me. I however opted for a brothed ramenthis time.

The Shio Plum Ramen was quite light and balanced, perfect if you want something not overly heavy. Prices are fairly standard and fair ($10-15 average?)

I imagine competition can be fierce with Kinton Ramen a few store fronts away on Baldwin. Definitely would go there again despite it being a little out of our way."}
{"text":"Hands down best ramen in the city!

Rich, deeply flavourful broth, the most tender sous-vide meat, and sweet complimentary sauces that accompany each bowl will transport you to pure bliss.

This is what all ramen should strive for."}

I first came across Ryus Noodle Bar during the Summer of 2014. I was in my last semester of undergrad, in between finals, and I just wanted to eat something before studying again. The little village on Baldwin Street is a place I love a lot because it is quite like Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, except much smaller. There are many Japanese restaurants run by Japanese people (you'd be surprised at how many aren't in Toronto) and the village has some of the best gelato in the city.

As Ryus Noodle Bar was only a short walk from the main campus, I decided to try it out on a whim and I was hooked since. In 2014, the noodle bar was fairly new to Torontonians so it was relatively easy to grab a spot. When I visited a week ago with my husband, it was so popular that we were barely able to secure a spot for the two of us. A waiting list started not so long after we were seated. Talk about great timing!

The availability of ramen here is very unique and creative, which is why I love Ryus Noodle Bar so much! Though not shown here, you can have a variety of oils (even truffle oil) to add to your ramen to really customize it the way you want to. I find the price of the ramen here a little more expensive than other noodle houses in the city, but the price doesn't bother me too much as I prefer quality and creativity over price. Their entire menu is available here on their website, and I think you'd be surprised at how unique their menu is! If I lived in Toronto again, I'd go back to Ryus Noodle Bar in a heartbeat to try their meat platter and other ramen!

Did you know that you can upgrade to the large size for the same price for the Cold Salad Ramen? I opted for the regular size as I didn't think I could finish the large one, but if you have a big appetite, I'd definitely recommend that you go for the large size.

The salad ramen has a variety of fresh toppings, from mushrooms, chicken, slow cooked pork, and much more. The noodles are very well cooked despite being cold and it is very chewy in texture just how it should be. There is a dipping sauce that it comes with (sweet chili & sesame), and it is very much like a salad dressing in flavour. I suppose you can choose between dipping your noodles in the sauce bowl or you can pour the dipping sauce over the salad ramen like me. There is no proper way of eating it (at least I think - correct me if I'm wrong please!:D) and it's delicious and healthy no matter how you eat it.

My husband decided to try their spicy miso ramen which was very hot indeed as he opted for extra spiciness. The broth was very thick (probably the extra chili flakes!) but tasty. The ramen came with a side of dipping oil. There were 5 types of dipping oils to choose from, and hubby decided to go with what our waiter recommended (garlic oil) and it definitely added another layer of flavour in the ramen. The only downside there was to the spicy miso ramen was that it was rather too hot even for us Koreans. We don't recommend opting for the super hot (4 chilis) because it really is too spicy and it slightly takes away the authentic flavours of the ramen.

Another reason why I like Ryus Noodle Bar is that it has more than just your average miso, pork and chicken broths. Here, the traditional Japanese broth is also available, made with shiitake mushrooms and kombu which is edible kelp. These two ingredients are also very commonly used  in Korean cuisine to make broth for many soups!

So, if you're a lover of ramen and you haven't tried Ryus Noodle Bar yet, you definitely should give them a visit. They have a great patio as well as many tables inside so if the weather is nice, their outdoor patio is a good option. Their service is consistently great; the workers are all very friendly, polite and helpful. The food does take a little longer than other places and as I've mentioned before, it is a bit more expensive than other ramen restaurants. Overall, the uniqueness of Ryus Noodle Bar is what draws me back everytime. I can't wait to be back when I'm back in T-dot!"}
{"text":"This is our favourite ramen place in Toronto. Japanese-run and quality is right up there with Sansotei. Great rich tonkotsu broth, perfect texture noodles, and pork done just right. Most options have no bean sprouts which is our preference. Some nice variety on the menu with nice rice combos and special seasoning oils. Only ramen place I know of that has a patio. Kid friendly because they have real chairs not just benches or stools and there isn't a huge wait all the time. Shoyu is our favourite!"}
{"text":"They are usually super busy on weeknights. I was put on the waiting list the first time i went there with my friends (4 in total), and they are kind enough to give you a call when they have space for you. But by the time they called, it's already been more than 30 minutes. The place is small with canteen style seating arrangement - means it's difficult to sit in groups. 

The servers are very attentive and friendly. I ordered the spicy ramen (comes with 4 different spicy leve) with xo sauce (yum!). You can also choose the texture of your ramen (hard, medium and soft). All the ramens (except vegetarian) comes with pork,chicken and HUGE chunk of cabbage) They also have 2 vegetarian options.

The food came very quickly after I placed my order. I am not too crazy about the ramen noodle, maybe I should try hard ramen noodle next time. The broth is thick and super drinkable. I am not too sure about having a mixed of pork and chicken bits in my ramen. They feel like fillers to the ramen just to make it looks like there's a lot of ingredients in it, which I think is unnecessary. Dislike the huge chuck of cabbages in there, which is way bigger than the pork and chicken is you managed to fish out some. 

They have those loyalty reward card that allows you to collect stamps for every ramen you eat there. I am not too sure if I will ever be able to get a bowl of free ramen from them especially since there's so many other ramen places around the area."}
{"text":"Went here because Kinton was full.
Tried the shoyu and gyoza lunch combo. 
I like the stuff they blended in with the noodles (e.g. Bamboo shoots). Noodles were a lot thinner and stretchier than Kinton's. Gyoza was alright, but nothing out of this world.
Pricewise, it's slightly cheaper than Kinton, but then again, the size of the bowls are proportionate.
Overall, the ramen was pretty decent, and I would go back again. But it was just not \"amaaaazing.\"
They do have a stamp card program and customers can receive free toppings or noodles when they ate here for a certain number of times."}
{"text":"You can never get tired of this place! I love that they have a make your own ramen option. The service here is great too."}
{"text":"I like it here! I've been to Kinton a few times, but for low key peeps like me, Ryus fits the bill just right.

The set up is relatively conventional, with a few two-tops and a couple of bench-type bars. One long bar in the middle of the dining room has regular chairs at regular height, so that slurping doesn't have to be accompanied by awkward seated positions. I'm getting old, bar stools are dangerous!

There was plenty of seating on a Friday night, meaning no lineups and no yelling at your dining partner over loud music and loud patrons. Halfway through our meal, a group of 4 came, but there was nowhere for them to sit, because there are only two-tops and long bars. Not sure why they didn't push two 2-tops together.

The service was friendly, honest and attentive. Our water glasses were refilled without request, and when I asked about the spice level of the spicy dish, the response was, \"I love spicy food, but the level 4 heat is too much for me.\" This is probably one of the more helpful answers I've gotten.

I had a spicy miso tanmen, which come with tofu and pork for the protein lovers. The spicy oil had a lovely nutty flavour. I did add it in halfway through as suggested, though I think you can consume it however you want and it'll still be delicious.

Boyfriend had some un-spicy pork noodle soup with the ginger sauce. Guys, it's grated fresh raw ginger, so be warned.

I still prefer the chewiness of Kinton's noodles, but the spicy dish is far superior to Kinton's spicy garlic ramen which really only tastes like garlic.

One huge star off for no functioning website. Come on guys, it's 2013."}
{"text":"I like all the Japanese ramen places in the downtown Toronto area, but I visit Ryus the most.  I got hooked on this place when they started offering the Angus Roast Beef with Shio Ramen combo.  It is the shio ramen garnished with arugula, white fungus and bamboo shoots with a side dish of sliced angus roast beef done medium rare and chilled slightly, accompanied with truffle oil for dipping.  I add the garlic shallot oil halfway through my ramen to the soup.  Delicious and very filling.  Soup base is full of flavour and the noodles are appropriately bouncy and chewy.

This is the only Japanese ramen place that has a patio, which is nice on a summer evening.  They also offer a stamp card so when you eat enough bowls of ramen, you get a free ramen.  Another great bonus: as you progress along the card, you can get smaller rewards like free sauce (e.g. garlic shallot oil, XO sauce, truffle oil, etc.) or free topping (e.g. egg, white fungus, veggie, etc.) without it interrupting your goal of getting free ramen.  The staff are great at reminding you when you haven't claimed a reward on your card."}
{"text":"Baldwin Village is a unique community just north of the Art Gallery of Ontario and east of Chinatown. Reflecting both its neighbours, this area is comprised of small ramen, sushi, dumpling and vegetarian restaurants among residential housing, which manage to attract AGO visitors and OCAD students alike.

With the more famous Kinton Ramen right down the street, Ryus Noodle Bar competes for serious business in this eclectic area: ramen wars have caused these small venues to provide more and more variety.

Ryus Noodle Bar is small yet charming. A lone waitress handles all orders attentively, and the homemade \"Follow us on Twitter\" signs suggests the restaurant doesn't have anything to prove.

The waitress helps explain the menu, and as a first-time ramen eater it was nice to have some guidance. Each bowl comes with a broth-the meat options ($9.50-9.95) come with a pork and chicken-based broth with bits of meat mixed in with vegetables and secondary sauces, and vegetarian options ($9.50-9.75) include a variety of vegetables like napa cabbage and shittake mushrooms among flavours of sesame and garlic.

Unfortunately, the vegetarian options fall flat.

Secondary sauces like sriracha, shallot & garlic sauce, sweet & spicy ginger paste, house made chili oil, or truffle oil (add $0.50) accompany each dish in small bowls on the side for an extra punch of flavour. Ryus recommends adding a bit of your choice of sauce to your dish once it's half finished.

Ryus Noodle Bar separates itself from Kinton down the street by further inquiring about your noodle preference: soft, al dente, or firm.

Draft beer-Sapporo-is only $4.95, and pop refills are free. In all, Ryus Noodle Bar is humble and unassuming, with unparalleled service. It is comfortable and welcoming, and a good place to grab a quick snack should you crave fancified ramen noodles."}
{"text":"My favourite ramen place. For some reason, I love the soup base here. It's not too strong, it's smooth. Noodle is done just right, the toppings are nice and fresh.

This place has the unique soup base I couldn't taste anywhere else. 

Staff is very nice and friendly, very polite and delightful. 

I would recommend the vegetable portage, it has unique soup base that I never tasted anywhere else. 

The winter special spicy tantan? Was also very nice. It was very smooth, thick broth. And the green crispy vege thing you get on the soup is a nice treat."}
{"text":"Not good enough anymore in Toronto. We've moved on from the dark days when Kenzo passed for ramen... the char siu and broth are not really what they should be, and what is chicken doing in my ramen??

Kinton is only a few doors down, so no reason you shouldn't go there instead. I personally would go down to Dundas for Sansotei."}
{"text":"I just had dinner there for the first time with a friend. The place is very nicely setup and cosy, with friendly waitresses. I ordered the shio ramen with garlic sauce. The thing to do here, as recommended by the menu and waitress, is to eat half your ramen, pour in your sauce, and continue eating. I picked the black garlic sauce, which was heady and a little sweet. I didn't put much thought in my choice so I didn't really like it, but the dish was quite good before I added the sauce. I'm definitely not a ramen expert so I couldn't say anything about the broth or noodle type. My shio ramen was good but not as outstanding as it could have been perhaps. Just one large slice of pork and chicken each, a lot of bamboo shoots, and some arugula leaves in my bowl. I wasn't too impressed by the serving size. At other places I've been to I've struggled to finish the bowl, but here I was swirling my soup around, trying to find any last scraps of noodle. You can order extra noodles but I didn't feel like it since I was no longer hungry. I would definitely return next time and get a combo (you can get your ramen with a side of rice or veg and free refillable soft drinks) and maybe try that spicy tofu ramen instead.

TL;DR
Food: 3.5/5
Service: 4.5/5
Atmosphere: 4/5"}
{"text":"I like the rice dishes. Recommend to chill-out meal."}
{"text":"It's always good here. Whether the tsukemen (dip'n noodles) or a bowl of shio, you will leave satisfied. They make the noodles in-house and their chicken breast topping on the shio ramen is so tender. I love that their ramens already come with a lot of toppings included. So much effort goes in behind the scenes to make a good bowl of ramen as they do here. 
A strong staple amidst the flurry of new ramen shops and chains popping up all over Toronto.
Also, their draft pint of Sapporo is super cheap."}
{"text":"Came here twice, I just don't think it's my style.

The place is clean and well lit. Servers and chef are polite and patient. I usually come here when Kinton is full.

I had tofu and beef curry at this place. Both times the food portion it's lacking. I always feel hungry after devouring my bowl. The taste on their menu items are not bad but the specials are a little bland."}
{"text":"Every time my friends wanted to eat ramen, I always groaned because I didn't understand how they can like it so much. I went to kinton and santouka a few times but didn't enjoy it. They weren't bad but they didn't wow me either. Ryu is the only ramen place that I'm happily willing to go to now! Their shio and hot and sour is delicious. Their creme brûlée is also good but the portion is tiny. Service is always friendly and extremely quick."}
{"text":"If you don't like to sit with others or avoid long line up at Kinton, then you can come here to sit down comfortably at a table and enjoy their Ramen. Their broth are not as salty and fatty like Kinton, but creamy and thick with strong pork flavour. They also serve creamy soda with a scoop of ice sream on top. There are more choices on their menu and you could order either ramen, rice, or side dishes."}
{"text":"I wanted a nice quiet place for ramen over the head banging music of Kinton next door and this seemed like a decent alternative. The place seems authentic Japanese. Their ramen comes with a side order of oil or sauce which they recommend you to put halfway into your ramen to try them out. I ordered Shio ramen and a side of the AAA Angus beef. The beef was horrible. It was half way between a rare steak and beef sashimi but without the flavour of a steak nor the texture of shashimi and was a big miss.

As for the ramen:
- Soup was amazingly full and flavourful.
- Noodle was too chewy and not soft enough to my liking which is a key to the ramen. I think they rushed the order and did not cook the noodle properly.
- Meat was barely there, they had the least amount of meat per ramen bowl I have ever had at any other ramen places!!!

I had the ginger sweet sauce which was a nice and refreshing idea but not enough to cover the big misses of the skimpy portions of protein and hardness of the noodle. I would definitely stick to Sansotei next time."}
{"text":"I love how Ryus has so many different ramen options beyond just the three standard types (miso, shoyu, shio). 

We started off with a round of gyoza which were so good! They were even loaded with soup, so be careful taking your first bite!

I chose to make my own ramen which has a base price of $5.95, with each add-on ranging from $0.75-1.25. I added shio soup with nori, seasoned egg, bamboo shoots and two servings of cha-su. The pork was good but I still prefers one at Kinton. One thing that really sets Ryus apart from competitors is the option of adding the oils to your broth. I chose the garlic oil ($0.25) and added it halfway through my meal so I could experience two totally different flavours. While it did taste really good, it made the broth a lot richer and it was hard to eat after awhile.

Everything was delicious and the service was superb, however, it is a bit more expensive than the other ramen places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Had a lunch here with a colleague. The place was busy, nevertheless we got seated right away. And all in all, service was great. And so was gyoza. However, the Shoyo ramen I ordered was just ok, but not really good. Broth was too salty and greasy, but lacked flavour."}
{"text":"Having tried Kinton for too many times, I am pleasantly surprised by this place, albeit having been a skeptic since it opened. First, it's more peaceful vs. the loud music, hyperactive staffed competitor. Second, staffs here seems nicer. Now the most important part, the soup here is awesome both shio and shoyu, boiled egg not as runny as other places but the taste is fantastic. Only suggestion would be to replace thin noodle with thicker version and more chewy would be nice. I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Had Shoyu with garlic oil and Tsukemen (dipping noodle), which is on their special menu.
I think only a few places use bonito in broth in town and they are one of them. We really like it!.
Shoyu ramen was blur at first, but after adding the garlic oil, it became much better. I want to try other oils if I have a chance.
They have combo menu as well. Any ramen, 5 pcs dumplings and Sapporo beer for 18.50.
Staff were very kind and friendly. We visited the place before noon so we were able to find a table easily but people who came after 12:30 had to wait for a while to be seated."}
{"text":"Price - 10/10
Taste - 8/10
Service - 10/10
Ambience - 7/10
Quantity - 7/10
Overall - 8/10 (Will come back for sure)


Price 
For a place that is located close to downtown Toronto, I was surprised of the cost of my bill for girlfriend and I ($22 before taxes, rounding up) We've both had ramen (miso and seafood)

Taste 
I've tasted both since we always have a rule to order different dishes so we can nibble on each other's dishes. The seafood was 10/10 and the Miso was 8/10. I was really impressed of the ramen that was used since some places you can taste the uncooked ramen. 

Service
It was on point and authentic Japanese accent (which I loved). I like going to restaurants where the staff share the same ethnic cuisine. My server knew the menu inside and out and knew what to suggest with other dishes. 

Ambience
If you are looking for a romantic place to take your date, this is not the place, it more of a gathering of 4 friends (Max) and a place to grab something quick to eat. The layout is is tight since the restaurant is small by default. 

Quantity
This is a tricky category for every restaurant but the default sizing of the ramen was small for my liking so to anyone who is going here, do not come starving just to eat the main course. There is no additional sizing of your meals (If I remembered correctly)

Keep up the good work people!"}

{"text":"We have been to Ryus Noodle Bar many times now. Today (Sunday April 12th, 2015) I just received a free ramen from all the stamps I collected each time I ate there. 

I love ramen noodles. Toronto has many ramen shops. For me, Ryus is my favourite of all. 

Venue: bright and comfortable most of the time. When crowded, the bar bench and the tables on the other side can get a bit too close. Having said that, most other ramen places put diners even closer. $$$$

Food: I always have the Gyoza Combo which is ramen, gyoza and pop with free refill. I have had gyoza at all the other ramen shops in downtown Toronto. Gyoza here is very very good. Their ramen usually comes with one piece of pork and one piece of chicken but if you prefer pork like me, you can ask for pork only. The specialty of this place is with each ramen, you get to choose a sauce to go with it. My two favourites are Garlic oil and Truffle oil (extra charge). The oil really adds a lot of favourite into the broth. Their noodle texture is tender but not mushy. You can choose your noodles thick or thin. Both are good. $$$$$

Service: Excellent! Ichiban! The staff there is always pleasant. Their smile is infectious. We are always made to feel welcome there. That's probably one reason we keep going back. $$$$$"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a bit fan of ramen .. I find it too bland for my taste or too much like instant noodle.. but I was fairly impressed with the amount of flavour in the broth. Also the noodle was gooey chewy making it absolutely divine. Also a bit of a mess to eat, I had broth splatter everywhere. Also spicy is really not spicy at all.. but I suppose this is after all, Japanese food."}
{"text":"Hi everyone!

Last sunday, JW and I walked around the Baldwin Neighbourhood to grab a quick lunch. Then, we were surprised to find out there was a newly opened ramen restaurant called Ryus Noodle Bar ! Debating between Kinton Ramen (see our review here!) which was a few steps away and this new noodle bar, we couldn't bring ourselves to miss out something new.

When we first walked into the restaurant, it was quite empty, partially because they had only opened for a week or so. Also, there wasn't air conditioner so it was kind of hot and humid inside the restaurant even though it was a rainy, cool sunday. I cannot imagine how hot it will be when eating a hot ramen there in a hot summer day.

In Ryus Noodle Bar, a special oil or sauce will be served along with your ramen. Half way into your ramen, you can add the sauce/oil and it is supposed to give you a different flavour. Interesting.

JW ordered the the AAA Roast Beef Ramen with Shoyu Sauce with seasoned house spicy oil.

:: Normally, pork is served with ramen. The roasted beef was an interesting twist and the taste and texture went pretty well with the ramen. The beef was tender and we could taste the black pepper that was lying on top. What surprised us the most was that it came with TRUFFLE OIL mixed with salt !!  Although delicious, it is better to treat the beef was a side dish as the truffle oil  will disappear once dipped into the soup.

:: The ramen and broth were very generic and nothing special.The spicy oil had a hint of sesame oil and it smelt delicious. We actually couldn't wait until we finished half of the noodle to add the spicy oil. Once we added it, the ramen transformed and gave it a wow factor. Although not very strong in taste, the spicy oil gave a nice change in flavour from the ordinary broth.

I ordered Seasonal Shoyu Ramen with garlic & shallot oil. Again, nothing special with the ramen and broth. But the garlic oil was to die for  ( I am sorry that I forgot to take a picture of the garlic oil. Please watch the video as I caught a shot of it !). It smelt and tasted amazing and again transformed the ramen into something extraordinary. Also, we actually enjoyed mixing the two oil together.



verdict:

Roasted!

We like the special oil/sauce idea very much. We would probably add the oil at the beginning next time.

{"text":"Been here many times. Definitely the best ramen place and my fave restaurant. Amazing service. Very clean and food is always delicious."}
{"text":"I had the vegetarian bowl! Yummy, just right for me.. I prefer it to Kinton's veg. bowl.
 
I really like the atmosphere! 
Service was very nice and attentive, was a great meal to have with some out of town friends. 

Ps. ......Bathrooms are really cool. Toilet seats are heated. Crazy."}
{"text":"Hmm another ramen joint in town. They have the usual offerings of ramen soup bases shio, shoyu, miso, spicy miso, but their twist is that every ramen comes with a sauce, you can get blackened galic oil, XO sauce, chilli oil or truffle oil. They also offer thick and thin noodles. 

Ramens range from $9.50 to $14.95 I think, the sizes are on the smaller size, I guess the size of a ramen is similar to a regular Raijin Ramen. If you are a big eater like me, it is worth it to get extra noodles for $1.50, they given you a pretty large portion of extra noodles on the side (the extra noodles was probably as much as the noodles given in the soup). You can get thin or thick noodles, I had the thin and it was pretty good, not too soft or hard.

I got the sous vide roasted beef with shio ramen combo, I got chlli oil with my combo. The sous vide beef was just ok, a little bland, it came with a truffle oil which tasted like salty olive oil, there was no earthiness of truffles in it whatsoever. The soup was not super rich but flavorful enough, I tried my husband's blackened garlic oil and it is nice when used sparingly, it taste quite bitter concentrated.

We also got the gyozas, which were not every good, the skin is too thick and doughy, the filling was nice and moist though but I like thin skinned gyozas. 

Service was quick, and the tables were kind of cramped. They also have a promotional program whereby they give you a stamp for every $10 you spend, after either 10 or 12 stamps (I forgot) you get a free ramen! Overall, the ramen is pretty good, I think I prefer here to Kinton which is right down the road."}
{"text":"Such a fantastic experience! Ordered many things: mapo tofu rice bowl, angus beef curry dip'n noodle, and shio plum ramen! The noodles were the perfect texture, the broth was incredibly flavorful, and we kept breaking up the conversation to talk about how good everything was. We got a combo, and the price was fairly good in the end!

Will definitely be coming again!"}
{"text":"Arrived later on Sunday afternoon and found Ryus Noodle Bar half-full with a few patrons on their patio and at their inside tables.  My partner and I were greeted and seated quickly.  It's a casual and minimal décor, with a few interesting design touches at the front entrance, the ceiling, and a giant painted calligraphic kanji of Ryu on one wall.

My partner is a vegetarian, and we were very happy to see that Ryu was one of the very few ramen places that offered a vegetarian-friendly ramen (veggie stock, instead of just veggies in a meat stock :P).  They actually had two options for her, a Shio and Miso based ramen, as well as a Shoyu one, which she ordered.  I chose something on the seasonal menu, tsukemen, and further completed our order with two pints of Sapporo, which I believe were $4.95 each ($5 pints!).

When our pints arrived, I was very impressed to see the correct serving procedure the server went through: Proper Sapporo coasters were put down in front of us.  Our pints were poured with a fluffy head, and the glasses were placed down in front of us so that the logo faced us. Our pint glasses showed lacing as we made our way through it.  This whole shebang *rarely* happens even at craft beer /luxe beer bars, so I was very appreciative.

When our food came, I had to try a bit of my partner's veggie ramen (veggie stock ramen being a first for me), and was surprised to see that it had a nice, light, veggie stock with a strong mushroom flavor.  So vegetarians take note, Ryus definitely makes sure you get your fair share of umami as well.  The rest of her ramen was loaded with assorted vegetables and a few slices of aburaage.  She got the chili oil sauce as her halfway condiment, and she enjoyed the noodles more after she had added it.  

My tsukemen came with a very tasty hot broth that was rich and well-seasoned. The noodles are tender and chewy (al dente), and had a slight wave to them and paired beautifully with the dipping sauce for my slurping pleasure.  It came with some super moist and tender poached chicken, chashu, snow fungus, arugula (whose nutty flavor went well with the noodles), and a tiny slice of carrot that had been cut into the shape of a maple leaf! We were both very full after finishing our ramen, so portions were good for us.

Service was attentive but not pushy.  One can certainly see that they are trying to mind the small details as well.  There were quite a few Japanese patrons eating at the time, and their practiced (loud) slurping put my attempt to shame, so I'll definitely have to go back and give it another go :P

Overall, it's a very different thing from Kinton, so I don't believe people should be making those comparisons.  All I know is that I'm generally not in a mood to wait in a ridiculous line, or to dine in smoky and loud atmospheres.  So Ryus Noodle Bar is a very welcome alternative to the block."}
{"text":"I went to Ryu's for lunch today with a friend for the first time. The restaurant was busy and had a nice vibe to it.
The taste of food here is great! I can say it is my second favourite ramen place in Toronto besides Sansotei. 
The reasons why I only give it a 3 stars are because:
First of all, the waitress took a long time to get our order. The space is so packed that my chair touched my \"neighbour's\" chair and if I move I would risk nudging my \"neighbour\".  The restaurant also sells the egg as an add on. I have been to many ramen restaurants in Toronto, this is the first time a restaurant charges me for the egg. The egg at other ramen restaurants usually comes with the ramen. 
I would say the overall rating of the service is a 4/5, taste: 4.5/5, environment:  3/5."}
{"text":"Never had ramen before but I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience. My husband had the shoyu and I had the beef curry. We both started with pork and vegetable gyosas.
All was delicious. Staff was very friendly and helpful in explaining menu items.
We will be back to try more ramen."}
{"text":"We definitely did not plan on coming here today but we did ended up here for dinner. We were hoping we didn't have to wait in line and we didn't have to, but we did come here around 8:30 pm. We asked the waiter what is the most popular ones and he recommended this one for those who like a more richer broth. I got the spicy miso ramen and the garlic & shallot oil.

First time I tried the spicy ramen, at first, I was scared that it would be too spicy and I couldn't it. I got the regular spicy and it was fine, I was able to eat the entire bowl. The soup was thicker in texture, not just the normal miso soup. It was topped with tofu so it was a good balance of hot. And then, as I finished half the bowl, I've added the garlic oil into the noodles for a different taste. The garlic oil was very tasty too, it did give another flavour then just the spicy soup. The noodles was the best part aside from the soup base. The noodles was very chewy.

The service was really good too, explained the menu very clearly and how to eat the ramen with the oil. Overall, great food and service."}
{"text":"Friendly service and delicious ramen. Had the shio ramen. The soup was flavourful and the noodles were chewy - so good. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My favorite ramen shop in Toronto. Used to go to their Baldwin location all the time until it had to close. Usually get the Shoyu or Shio and option to get them made spicy. Tsukemen is also delicious and worth trying at least once. Their seasonal specials are also wonderful and worth trying as they are usually very different from their regular offerings.

What I like most about Ryus is the pork chashu. Most ramen shops give you a paper thin slice that's dry and over cooked. Here the pork is nice and thick and melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"Very nice place and tasty is an understatement. Ramen were perfect texture and the broth was smooth and yummy. We had spicy and regular miso which were both very good. I highly recommend adding sweet and spicy ginger add-on for 25 cents. 
Only draw back was that they did not have any air conditioning but after a minute or so it wasn't so bad. 
Also, it was fun the way the staff greeted people as the entered by yelling out to them."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I can't seem to get enough of it and I may have a problem.  

Location - odd because it's across from Broadview station along a strip of businesses that seem to turnover often.  See: KO Burger and the newspaper covering the windows.  Parking available behind the station.

It's not a huge space but probably seats about 30 with spots at the beautiful bar also available.  The food is up quick so even if you have to wait, it won't be for long.

I've had tan tan men 4 or 5 times, rich almost creamy broth with a bit of spice.  Perfect noodles and a good portion size.  I ALWAYS add a seasoned egg to whatever I order just because they are so tasty.  I've had spicy miso a few times, pork blaster twice and Taiwan style ramen today.  This is all in the last two months.  Everything I've had is so so delicious.  My only complaint is that I'm TOO FULL after pork blaster.  Not much of a complaint.

Attentive and friendly service, very quick - at lunch I'm in and out in 30'minutes.

It is a little pricier than some other places but I still find it worthwhile.  Check it out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"This place is terrific. I remember eating Ramen noodles as a student at home, out of bags - we used to think of them at gourmet Mr. Noodles. Boy was I wrong about what REAL ramen is. Ruiz Noodle Bar does it really well!

My dining companion and I chose different ramen. I had the Shio and she had the do it yourself option.  The broths were completely different - mind slightly fishier, and they had subtle flavours and an almost creamy texture. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the toppings - I had pork, chicken, and bamboo shoots, were tasty. The ramen also came with a choice of sauce on the side. I had the house sauce, which was sort of on the sweet side.  Overall the ramen was delicious and I would go back!

I also had an order of the gyoza which was decent enough.

The service was also good, friendly waitress who was attentive and had answers to our questions. The prices are also good."}
{"text":"Ryus is a nice change of pace from the darkly/dramatically lit noodle bars all over the city. I got the spicy miso with corn and an egg. I wish that the soups would come with more items included but overall I found the portion sizes quite large and filling. My friends got the rich chicken broth ramen special for $12. Their broth was delicious. I found the Spicy Miso a bit plain for my tastes but I really enjoyed the toppings I got. I prefer Ryus to Kinton simply because the broth was not overpoweringly salty. The service was good and there's a nice patio if you prefer to eat outside. It can get a bit hot inside the restaurant in the summer eating hot noodles. Their AC leaves something to be desired.  Overall a great quick lunch spot for when you are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I have been told that Ryus Noodle bar was pretty good.  Since I have tried many other ramen places, so I decided to have a try. 

At first, I thought I could pick the soup broth, however, apparently you cannot.  Their soup broth is a mixture of pork bone soup, chicken broth, and traditional japanese style which is  mushroom and something else, I don't remember now.  

So I ordered Shio Ramen, includes pork cha-shu and chicken cha-shu, white fungus, and bamboo shoot.   I ordered extra pork cha-shu slices and garlic & shallot sauce to go with the ramen.

The order had arrived.  I thought, this look ok.  First bite on the white fungus, cold.  Then I tried the chicken cha-shu, cold.  The soup broth was hot but not hot enough in my opinion.    Soup broth was kind of bland.  Chicken cha-shu was almost like a slice of regular chicken breast.  And the pork cha-shu... The fat in the cha-shu it's like jelly kind of fat.  If the soup was hot enough, the fatty part may melt and leave a hole in the cha-shu.  (Maybe I am little exaggerated but this is how i felt when it was in my mouth.  yuck!)  If you love fat that melt in your mouth, then you would like the cha-shu here.  

The reason why I am giving it 2-star because the service was good."}
{"text":"One of the better soups compared to other ramen places. They also have an interesting concept where you add in a flavoured oil when you are half way through to modify the flavour so you get something different. 
I personally like it plain though but it is a nice concept. 
Noodles are well done and toppings are flavourful. I do not like that you have to pay extra for an egg though as their ramens do not come with one."}
{"text":"Discovered this spot through Yelp and decided to stop by for late lunch. I didn't have to look at the menu since I have already decided what I wanted through reading some Yelp reviews. I ordered the Pork Blaster and added corn for an extra fee ($1 or $1.50). I mean for ramen it was pretty pricey. It was a $17 bowl of ramen. 

It was worth every dollar. There was soo much meat and noodle! The broth was so flavourful, didn't want to waste a single drop. You can taste the quality and the care the chefs put into this bowl of ramen. 

I ended up only finishing half of it. Took the rest home. The only reason I took 1 star off is because if you're going to charge me $17 for a pork ramen, it should have more than egg,pork, noodle and beansprouts. Even if it means you cut down one piece of pork and add in another ingredient. 

Happy Belly!"}
{"text":"[Pros]
Extensive vegetarian selection, which is great.

Spicy and sour ramen was delicious, as was the vegetarian option.

Menu is extensive without being messy or overwhelming: you are given a choice of beef/pork/chicken/tofu, eggs (hard boiled or poached), several different broths, three types of seaweed, veggies, corn, and several flavoured oils.

Huge portions! None of us could finish.

Veggie Gyoza simply contains cabbage, but was yummy.

[Cons]

No AC in summer so it was a little hot.

Dad had the pork barbecue ramen with miso broth. The broth tasted really heavily of pork fat and we found it too heavy.

[Overall]
Solid, reasonably priced ramen place. Good, quick service. Would come again."}
{"text":"OMG best noodles and ramen to date!!!!!! 
Ordered the spicy miso dish with an egg.  Delicious!!! 
Place is jam packed, get there 10 min before lunch crowd to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"Have been there on monday, environment is nice and I felt warm while staying there, like visiting a friend's house more than a restaurant, especially the dedicated washroom.
But I can just say the food & service are jus ok,  after I have tried the shoyu ramen, my mouth was keeping thirsty and dried for few hours. The taste of the soup is strong, but not rich, noodles I can find were stuke together, texture was not really good. But I am really like their pork chashu, portion is just good, with very juicy meat quality filled up with tasty chashu sauce. Servers are very nice but I just not really happy about, after I hv just finished the bowl, a server collected it and provided a bill at once, the shop was not crowded or lining up at around 4 oclock in noon. They should not doin tht and made me felt a bit pressure and seemed they are in hurry to ask me to go. Since location is not really convenient, I don't think will come again in the nearly future.
Anyway its nice to gave a try!"}
{"text":"Service was great, but I think the style of ramen is not my preference. I didn't feel very good after eating it. I think perhaps I should try another bowl. I got the shio ramen and ginger dipping sauce. I liked the dipping sauce a lot. I guess I'll have to try it again. Seating is very limited and small inside, so best to attend by yourself or up to 2 people, rather than a big group."}
{"text":"I've been to many ramen places and this one is one of the better ones.  I ordered the Shio Ramen and my friend had Spicy Miso.  What was interesting was that you get to pick a sauce and when you're half way done your noodle, you're supposed to add the sauce in your noodle.  I chose the spicy oil which went well with my shio ramen.  My friend said her house special xo sauce went well with her spicy miso ramen.  

I was surprised it wasn't as busy since they just opened recently.  Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I only go to this place for one thing and it is the Angus Beef Curry Dip N' Noodle. The soup is so flavorful and rich. Whenever I have the itch to have one, I take my friends with me (willing or not). There no need to order extra noodle just get the large it is the same price as the reg. 

If you feeling really hungry get the Pork Blaster my god it is heaven in a bowl (cue music). 
Well what are you waiting for stop reading and go check it out."}
{"text":"I had shio ramen, the broth tasted pretty standard and a bit thick, noodles were on the soggy side, the chicken that came with it had a weird texture.  I  prefer other ramen places, but I would come back to try the spicy ramen and vegetarian ramen.
Ryu would be a good choice for any strict vegetarians, they have ramen made with vegetable broth."}
{"text":"Great little place on the east end of Baldwin St. Sunny little patio with umbrellas for those who prefer shade with their fresh air. Inside is cozy and comfortable as well.

Service is fast, friendly and attentive. The ma po dofu rice bowl was the perfect size for this one, not too big, not too small. Started with a small platter of 5 gyoza which were perfect.

Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Two words: meat platter. I only had this once but I keep remembering it. The pairings between grated radish/ginger, mustard and sliced roast beef made me feel like I was doing a wine tasting, except it was with meat. For some reason the beef had the texture and flavour of duck breast. The dish is pricier, but worth it. 

I think this is one of the better places for Japanese ramen in town. I recall that the noodles were slightly finer. I'm thoroughly bored by pork bone soup overkill and it's nice to see seasonal dishes like cold noodle, or Japanese dan dan noodle appear on the menu. They set up a patio before the storefront in the summer and it's great for people-watching on Baldwin."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for the first time with my girl friend and had a great experience. The Ramen was very tasty and the service was great! I'd definitely recommend this little spot to any of my friends. I can't wait to go back and try out their other ramen options."}
{"text":"One of my favourite ramen places. Broth is so flavourful and when they say spicy, it's spicy. Not the watered down Canadian level of spicy. The service is excellent and free refills on pop, I'll take it."}
{"text":"My hubby and I originally wanted to go to ND sushi next door but it was closed, I'm so glad it was it we'd never have discovered this noodle bar! 

The noodles are very refreshing and not as filling as the other ramen chains like sensotei or santouka. The texture of the noodles were very good and the soup was also very tasty. They even give you a choice of sauce to the pair with the ramen with - add it when you're half done the noodles to add a new dimension to the flavour!"}
{"text":"Cash & debit only | New location (moved) | Ramen | Across from Subway station | LLBO | Take out or dine in

New location moved from Baldwin due to fire in June 2017. Now steps away from Broadview station.

Still delicious ramen noodles and rich broth.
Still great customer service all around. Clean and comfortable seating environment. Bathrooms are downstairs, one men and one women stall. Providing tootpicks, mouth wash and q-tips. 

Came in Labour Day Monday and they were open. Great summer breeze from open windows and doors. Downfall to that are bees joining me at my table. The server was super nice she kept coming to help me capture and release bees out of the restaurant  (however they kept coming back). 

Hitachino Ale Beer $9.75 
Taste like IPA and not available at LCBO. Imported from Japan. Served in their ow  branded glass.

Angus beef curry dip', noodle $13.75
Delicious sweet Japanese curry dipped noodles. Not a lot of beef in the sauce however. Choice of regular or large size.

Pork blaster noodle $17.95
Chose shiyo soup base. Delicious rich broth with noodles and 8 pieces of pork char-siu and  a boiled egg. Generous portion; too much for myself to enjoy. Choice of shiyo/shoyu/miso/spicy miso soup base.

I'd definitely come back here again.
Cash and debit only."}
{"text":"The best ramen joint that serves vegetarian dishes.

I ordered the Miso Spicy Ramen (mild), which is not very spicy at all. What's unique about this place is that they also give you a choice of various sauces that you are supposed to mix in with your ramen when you're halfway through. The broth was a bit thick, and you can order the ramen soft, medium, or hard.
My favorite part is that they didn't overload my ramen with bean sprouts to make it appear like there's more like at Kenzo.

If you've never been here basically you eat your ramen to about halfway, then add the sauce and mix it to change up the flavor. Ginger is my favorite.

The boyfriend is vegetarian so he got vegetarian miso ramen with medium noodles and the ginger sauce. The broth is thick but tasted very good - especially with the ginger sauce afterward. He said its the best vegetarian ramen he's had so far.

The service was good. The waitress was very pleasant and polite, and warned us about the vegetarian broth being thick. If it matters, Ryus Noodle Bar is owned and operated by Japanese people.

If you order pop, you also get free refills.

 If you're vegetarian and up for noodles I'd definitely recommend it, as neither Kinton or Sansotei offer vegetarian options. If not, I still recommend it because this place is awesome.

Edit: updating this restaurant to 5 stars because I realize after introducing this place to many friends, it has become a favorite to us all.

After the countless times I've been here, the service has always been impeccable as well as the quality of food. Definitely one of the best ramen joints in the city."}
{"text":"I highly recommend getting the Hot & Sour Wakame Ramen with thick noodles. Its soooo good!"}
{"text":"Too good. Best ramen I had in Toronto for this price too. Similar to isshin. Ryus soup base is creamy, noodles are just right tenderness. I ordered Angus roast beef ramen and the bf ordered pork blaster ramen. Both very tasty. Pork belly was soooooo tender. Just that bowl of pork meat is more than enough full without having ramen. At least for me. No words can described it. I have a video uploaded on instagram. The roast beef is very good too. Excellent portions. I don't favor the truffle oil, I rather eat it as original. Adding an egg is definitely worth it. Adding extra noodles only for $1.50 and it is quite a bit for one person. I'd definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"first time
in restaurant
we had nostalgic shoyu(extra spicy) and beef curry on rice.
Both were delicious.
Great service.

second time
takeaway
nostalgic shoyu(extra spicy) and Miso chicken
both were delicious.
Takeaway is really thoughtfully packaged.
Great service and fast too.

We both loved this comfort food.
Makes me wish for a cold rainy day to fully enjoy the noodles."}
{"text":"I'm glad Ryus reopened after the fire which completely destroyed the Baldwin location. I've always been a loyal follower because of their unique broth and the non traditional toppings they use. Plus their menu is very vegetarian friendly. Service is efficient and attentive. This new locale is across from the Broadview station with lots of street parking."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's AUTHENTIC - approved by my Japanese friend that went along with me. And most importantly, the tastes - hella delicious! I absolutely LOVED it. 

I ordered the pork blaster and it was very filling with a reasonable price, ingredients were quite fresh."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best ramen joints with a quiet atmosphere. I had the pork blaster shio ramen, ingredients were fresh, seasoned egg was perfectly cooked, the pork slices were unctuous, rich and full of flavor! Filling and 6 slices pork + egg + ramen for $17 isn't a bad price to pay for great food. Will definitely be coming back hungry for more!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious and I always crave going here and eating the ume ramen with a melon soda. Reminds me so much of Japan!"}
{"text":"It's like I have to choose between Kinton or Ryus. Can I like both? Yes? (So angsty)

The spicy miso here is great. I'm almost a little sad that winter is ending ...I'll miss warming up over a bowl of this stuff. Noodles have a great texture (I like mine medium) - I'm a little confused about the presence of chicken in my ramen but I'll let it slide because the broth is so nice and creamy. :3

 I also give points for the service at this place. Not as busy as Kinton, which has a line snaking out of it at peak times. (I'm sorry, Kinton is not worth standing in that line). Servers are really nice, not overbearing, and are prompt to cleanup/bring the bill when it's time. 

Also, takeout. When I'm tired after work, don't feel like cooking, and need copious amounts of sodium - this is my stop (I live dangerously close). Plus they draw a lil' smiley on the container and it's cute."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday evening and had to wait about half an hour before getting a table for our group of four. Seating is limited as this noodle bar is on the smaller side with less than 10 tables, although they do have a longer communal table down the middle.

We were pretty excited to try this place because of the good reviews. To be honest I'm surprised they have 4 stars on Yelp. Their menu was underwhelming - they have standard ramen options with pre-selected toppings or you can also make your own ramen. You can also pay a few extra dollars to make it a combo (add a drink, extra toppings, etc.). I decided to make my own ramen and got my noodles in spicy miso soup with a seasoned egg, boiled vegetables, and aburaage which is flat, fried tofu. FYI - they charge an extra $1 for miso soup (as specified on the menu) and another extra $1 to make it spicy (the waitress seemed to have come up with this on the spot)... The soup base was flavourful but nothing outstanding. My friend got the pork blaster ramen which looked a lot more impressive than what the rest of us got - so would recommend getting that one if it's your first time here.

What really upset me during my visit was the restaurant's handling of customers with allergies. My friend has a nut allergy and told our waitress this when she was taking our orders. She asked him how severe his allergy was, then told us that she would have to charge him double (!!!) the price of his ramen because they would have to follow certain procedures requiring them to clean their kitchen tools and equipment before preparing his food. We were shocked that they would penalize customers and charge extra for allergies/dietary restrictions. There was some back and forth between our waitress and the kitchen staff, but she ended up assuring us that no nuts would contaminate our friend's dish and wouldn't charge us extra. I'm not sure what precautions they ended up taking because our friend's dish came out very quickly right after... but thankfully he didn't experience any allergic reactions.

Overall, I was not impressed with this place - food and service were average, and I felt like they were trying to \"nickel and dime\" us especially with my friend's allergy situation. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Came here and tried their Tsukemen (the type where the noodles are given separately from the broth, and you dip your noodles in). Initially, it was quite good. Flavours were excellent and I loved it! However, as I kept dipping the chilled noodles into the broth, the broth started to cool really fast. Since the broth has decent fat content in it, once it started to cool it obviously detracted a lot from the way it tasted. That was fairly unfortunate. My bf got one of their ramen combos, that comes with a pint of sapporo and your choice of flavoured oil to put in the ramen. I thought the oil thing was a good way to distinguish the restaurant from existing ramen places out there, and I really liked the ramen that my boyfriend got. In fact I may venture to say that I prefer Ryu over Kinton next foor! (I didn't like their broth or pork belly, but that could just be me since Kinton has so many die hard fans). But because of my experience with the tsukemen I will have to give Ryu a 3.5 for now. Looking forward to returning to possibly up that to a 4!"}
{"text":"We are always willing to try a new ramen joint, especially one that might do something a bit different to set themselves apart from the other places in Toronto.  Ryus has tried to do just that.

The concept here is that you have your choice of ramen and flavouring.  Once you're half done, you add your flavouring to your broth and have this whole new bowl of ramen to enjoy!  

The broth for the shio ramen has a fish taste to it.  They also use a thinner noodle compared to their other ramen bowls.  The spicy miso has four levels of spice.  We also tried the cold noodle which had a really tasty sauce to mix into the dish.  The poached egg was a nice touch. 

There isn't much seating in the restaurant but it's definitely not cramped.  We sat on the front patio at one of the two picnic tables.  We enjoyed a nice pitcher of Sapporo with our ramen which was very reasonably priced at $16.95.  If you order just a pint, I believe it was $5.95.  

If anything, we'd go back for a pitcher (or two) for sure!"}
{"text":"Our favourite spot in the city for ramen. Great quality food and friendly service. My favourite item is the tsukamen (dipping noodles). Small tables so keep your party small. Patio in the summer."}
{"text":"After reading Janet S.'s, review, I had to come down for a try. This place is literally only a few doors away from Kinton Ramen, which means they'll need to carve their own niche or simply beat them at their own game.

I love spicy ramen, so I ordered their spicy miso ramen with extra noodles and pork belly, at SUPER HOT level (as stated on the receipt) and hot chili oil ($15.20 after tax). The spicy miso doesn't have any pork, so you must add it for $2 extra! Extra noodles are $1.50. Thick noodles are default on the spicy miso, but I ordered thin extra noodles, so I got to sample both. The extra noodles were put on the side, as their bowls aren't large enough to accommodate them. For this place, the thick noodles are best.

The spicy miso ramen has tofu in it, which is a turnoff. Tofu simply doesn't work in ramen, and eating a few pieces, I let the rest sit in the broth. However, the rest of the bowl was an experience unlike any other. The heat was wonderful! Finally, a spicy ramen that had enough heat to make me reach for the water! It was at the perfect level: hot enough to feel the heat, but not so hot that I couldn't eat it at all.

As an added touch, they put a lime in their water pitcher, so you get a very faint citrus taste. However, the glasses they provide are pitifully small, so if you order the SUPER HOT spicy miso ramen like me, you'll need to ask them for refills over and over again. You actually get ice with your water, something that none of the other ramen restaurants do for some strange reason.

The SUPER HOT broth is also super rich. I didn't finish it because of the remaining pieces of tofu, but it's almost like a stew thickness than a soup thickness. If you're not prepared, it WILL kick your ass because of the heat and richness. The broth isn't as complex as Santouka or Sansotei, but it sure beats Kinton (garlic overload) by far. Szechuan peppers are the dominant flavor in Ryu's spicy miso broth, while Sansotei prefers to blend black pepper with curry for a more sophisticated taste.

The pork belly was a very small portion of two pieces. I wish they had given me a third piece or made the pieces larger. Flavor was OK, but the meat is nothing compared to Kinton.

The environment is much nicer than Kinton. The restaurant is wider, has more comfortable table seating, doesn't blast loud music, and the people shout Japanese a little better.

Overall, I like it much better than Kinton. Unfortunately, it's the second-most expensive ramen restaurant next to Santouka once you add the pork and extra noodles, and that means people will prefer Kinton every time. However, by the end of my meal, I was stuffed, so despite the high cost, it was worth it. Between Kinton and Ryu's, it's a no-brainer. Ryu's wins.

Personally, I rate it 2nd just behind Sansotei. Sansotei doesn't crank the heat to 11, but it has an otherwise superior spicy ramen with no tofu-like turnoffs at a lower price. However, Ryu's Noodle Bar hits the mark with a very unique take on spicy ramen, so if you're brave enough, you should pay them a visit and try the SUPER HOT spicy miso ramen at least once."}
{"text":"This is a tough review because, I'll admit it: I don't like ramen.  I don't hate it, but I just don't crave it, or need it more than once a year.  I could live the rest of my life without ramen.

So why four stars?  Well, I did enjoy my time here.  The service was really good; friendly, informative.  The bathrooms were clean and nice.  The food came out hot and tasty; appetizers first, ramen second.  The serving size and quality of food matched the price.  So - if I liked ramen - I would like this place.  And I'd even go back.  In a year :) when it's time for my next ramen."}
{"text":"I used to like this place but not since they changed the staff and the menu.  It's way over priced now and very stingy what they give you.  You end up paying for a bowl of noodles that's not even worth the money after all the add ons they try to sqeeze you.   Very disappointed and felt ripped off when I went there last week.  I will not come back here again.  The one on college at Bathurst has much better deal and more appetizers and sides to choose from. :-{"}
{"text":"Delicious and hits the spot. I ordered the spicy miso, regular spice topped with pork belly, with the house made chilli oil on the side for $11. The food arrived promptly and it was just the perfect temperature for shoving it in your face. The broth was the perfect consistency and so incredibly flavourful. It was the right amount of spice for me. The pork belly was divine and just melted in my mouth. I would have given this place 5 stars but the service was a little slow. Not to say our server was anything but lovely. It's that they only had one person work on the patio and one working inside when the place was packed!  That's not enough staff to manage the volume."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. Place is clean. But I would rather go next door to Kinton and pay a bit more for a bowl."}
{"text":"Access
For a noodle bar you would think they close later but that's not the point. Ryu Noodle Bar is situated in a small street that houses many other Asian restaurants, not a far walk from St. Patrick's station at all. I'm not too sure about parking but I would choose to TTC.

Service
Great service, waitress described the different noodle types to us. I mean honestly service can't be that bad at a ramen place right? Anyhow she was good to us and I have no complaints.

Food
A lot of you are familiar with 'ramen', the Japanese love it and it is regarded as their number 1 food (more popular than sushi!). Anyhow in this restaurant you get to taste tsukemen which is where noodles and sauce are separated. The thickened sauce is more salty than ramen broth, but this is where you dip your noodles to suck up the flavour. My suggestion for you is to try it with 2-3 strands of noodles or else you will miss the whole experience. I am warning you now but the flavour is quite strong and does not taste like ramen broth. With this restaurant, the meat and toppings are diced up and placed above the noodles. I did not really like the toppings but they weren't actually disgusting. I'm pretty sure they made the toppings bland because the sauce added enough kick to it. The ramen was 'okay' lol. The broth itself had a good smell but I tasted powder(?); it didn't go down smooth at all.

This restaurant is average, I can't say that they are bad but nothing was impressive. I was recently in Los Angeles and after eating the tsukemen there, Ryus Noodle Bar just doesn't compare. In terms of ramen, Sansotei is by far winning in every category. Do I recommend this place? If you are in the area, it's not a bad choice since prices aren't that bad. I forgot to mention that you can get a large portion of tsukemen for the same price. Ramen and tsukemen range from $9-15 so it's not too bad."}
{"text":"Love this neighbourhood Ramen bar. Always get the Shoyu with that yummy seasoned egg, bean sprouts and corn. Its one big tasty bowl of soup. Service is great, prompt and courteous. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"I've both eaten-in and gotten delivery once, and both times I thoroughly enjoyed the food here. I'll be honest and say this was my first time eating non-instant Ramen, but I'll definitely be eating it again! 

The menu provides a good selection of different items and they also have an extensive list of additional toppings if you want to customize your dish. (The friend tofu and soft boiled egg are both delicious!) They also have a couple of vegetarian options, which is nice."}
{"text":"Tried out the shio tsukemen and it wasn't my fave. The dipping broth was a bit too thick and not to my taste. I prefer the shoyu tsukemen at Ramen Isshin."}
{"text":"We arrived at 9pm, no line up and enjoyed :
- Meat Platter (Steak,Chicken and Cha Su-Pork) with 3 sauces included
One of the item from the meat platter was the chef recommend 58 degrees sliced tenderloin steak which it was very tender and tasty, the platter came with the Truffle sauce, we tried it and it was alright, its flavour was not that strong. 
- Shio Thin Ramen + Rice Bowl + Drink Combo (Pork Bone Soup Flavour)
- Shoyu Thick Ramen (Pork Bone Soup Flavour)

We merely tried all of the sauces and we found the Ginger Sauce and the Darkened Garlic & Shallot Sauce were amazing with the Pork and the Ramen. 

The Soup were a bit sticky but it was full of the flavour of pork bone. It's service was great and we loved it, we will come again !

The bill concluded to about $50 with tax and tips."}
{"text":"I can't say I am a ramen expert but I usually would go to Japan for different ramen once a year. For comparing to Ryus' dear neighbour, I prefer more to Ryus as it resembles more to the modern Tokyo style ramen for the deep and complex soup base( shio plum). I would recommend people to come here for a bowl of ramen if you are sick and tire of the salty, oily, meaty style."}
{"text":"After eating all the Ramon on the street several times I have come to the conclusion this is the only place worth going to. 
Their flavourful broth, fresh tasty noodles and excellent interesting toppings can't be beat. 
Their cold noodles in the summer are my favourite. The use of a bed of cold noodles with various veggies and meat with a great bowl of sauce for dipping or pouring is great. Outdoor seating is key on a hot summer day with a pitcher of Sapporo and a order of the cold Ramon. 
Their menu is very inventive as its not the classic two or three broths with similar toppings. They have these great little dishes of oils to add to the soup when you feel a flavour kick is needed. 
This place is great. Worth trying and going back for more."}
{"text":"Great ramen, like this better than kinton and sansotei. Have chicken varieties as well, for those that don't just want pork, pork and more pork.

Meat platter was great, roast beef wasn't as tender as i hoped, but still tasty.

Tried both spicy miso, miso, shoyu, shio broths, all are very good. Vegetarian option was good, but the sweet soup base (corn?) was distracting at the end. Dipping sauces, i love the XO and spicy sauces together, great combo.

Nice patio and average service. Why would you eat ramen elsewhere?"}
{"text":"I had high expectations coming to this noodle bar because of the amazing reviews and I was so stoked to try their spicy ramen. I had the regular spicy ramen and the portion overall was gold for its price for around $11 before tax. I found the broth to be a bit too thick for my liking and I had noodles, bean sprouts, tofu, and some cabbage. This was probably a personal preference because many other people ordered the same thing and seemed to enjoy it. I'm usually not too picky with my food but I did appreciate how rich the broth was with different flavours. The food I say was 3/5.

The waiters are excellent, they constantly refilled our lemon water and asked us if everything was going well. The place was super clean too and they cleaned the tables with a spray. The chefs and waiters also greeted us when we came in and we went out. Because of their amazing service, I'm giving them 4/5. Maybe if I return, I will try the other ramen too. I would recommend you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"YAS!!! This has the meatiest and tastiest pork noodle soup that I have had in Toronto.  Death by pork belly!! Give me more.  Dense, rich and creamy broth that I want to swim in.  Nice and chewy noodles to go with the meat and broth.  Perfect.  Kinton used to offer this rich broth with a side of pork belly that matched Ryu's recipe but that is long gone now so this is my favourite spot to seek out the holy grail of pork belly ramen!"}
{"text":"Ryus has been my go to ramen place in Toronto, and I usually won't have ramen anywhere else in Toronto unless it's here. My usual order is the Spicy or sometimes Shio (Salt) Pork Blaster and it does the job usually for me as a meal. The Char Siu they use have a nice creamy flavor to it without being offensively oily. The broth has a nice depth of flavor to it without being too full of lard, and the noodles are cooked perfectly. Service is friendly and although not usually consistent through several visits there's not much steps of service you can expect from a Noodle place. I think they are modestly priced and my usual recommendation if someone is looking for a good bowl of ramen.

Will I Repeat? Most Definitely!!!"}
{"text":"Incredible service, the vegetable miso postage is still as beautiful and tasty as years ago. The house salad with sesame dressing was amazing. The pork blasted ramen spicy miso is a definite must order. You will be full after a bowl of their ramen! I've been to several ramen places and Ryu's is the top of my list."}
{"text":"This is my new go to place for ramen! My co worker took me here and I am a fan! I got the spicy ramne - mild. I should had got the spicy one, I really couldn't taste any spice in my noodles. The noodles came in a big portion! I love the spicy pepper they put on top of the rame. It was crunchy! It taste like chips! 

The price was pretty decent. About $7. 

You can also make your own noodle! You can add anything you want on it. From soup base to toppings. Would love to come back here!"}
{"text":"I've been a long time fan of santouka.  And for the longest time it has been my favourite ramen joint. But ryus has for the first time made me reconsider this choice.  And it's all due to....  The PORK BLASTER.  (this might be the most important advancement in ramen technology since the invention of the microwave) 

Imagine a bowl that you have to actually dig past a layer of thick cuts of perfectly cut/marbled pork belly in order to get to the noodles below.  There is nearly as much pork belly as there is Noodle.  You could probably make anything taste delicious if you put enough pork belly on top of it.  I could probably eat a shoe if it had enough pork belly on it.  

Fortunately the broth and noodles are awesome too.  The broth is a perfect moderate amount of richness that those who find santoukas broth too rich of salty will appreciate.  
There are small things about ryus that I love too.  The menu is beautifully put together and nicely explains all the options which can get confusing especially for ramen beginners.  The little sauce option to liven up the last half of the bowl is genius.  The design of the restaurant is nice.  Doesn't feel cramped, not to noisy,  and the option of sitting outside is not a common for ramen places.  

Try the pork belly.  It's impossible not to love. Experience the power of freakish amounts of pork belly."}
{"text":"Ryus was my go-to ramen place when it was on Baldwin and I worked on University Ave. I was so sad when I heard the news about the fire!

I visited their new Broadview location for the first time last night. It's definitely more spacious and inviting, although definitely cozy (it's impossible not to overhear your neighbours' conversations). 

Ryus' ramen is the best I've had in Toronto. There is something just so rich and flavourful about their broth and it doesn't taste as salty as a lot of other ramen places. Their noodles are always perfectly cooked and I love that they have sauces you can add. My go-to is the Spicy Shoyu, which never disappoints. 

The only reason I wouldn't give this place 5 stars is because I don't love that they only accept cash or debit."}
{"text":"It feels like every Ramen shop I try has their specialty. Ryu's specialty seems to be their dip noodle, and their roast angus beef. You don't find these in other ramen shops. And perhaps most importantly: their wheat noodle. Yes! You can get a slightly healthier version of ramen (hahaha \"healthy\" and \"ramen\" don't belong in the same sentence). I love the wheat noodle texture. It's more chewy and coarse. 

We ended up getting Shio Plum (which other stores don't have so I suppose this is a specialty), and Miso. If I base my experience on these 2 dishes (we shared), i would say this place is alright. The Shio Plum is not for everyone. The plum taste is definitely something that would turn off some people. But it tasted good to me. The miso ramen was more or less standard. 

Service is the same as all other ramen shops. They hire all japanese staff and will greet you when you come and exit. After so many years of ramen shops opening up, this point is pretty moot to me now."}
{"text":"A nice and quiet place to enjoy a bowl of good ramen.  My friend and I both ordered the Pork Blaster with spicy soup based, one at level 2 (regular) spiciness and the other level 3 (hot) spiciness.  When the food came, we both felt the soup was not hot enough, even compared to other ramen places.  But it was thick and flavorful. The ramen also had good texture to it and is better than Kinton's in my opinion. In general the ramen was solid and tasteful, just hoped the soup was a bit hotter.  As for our side order oil we had the Garlic and Shallot oil and Sweet and Spicy Ginger paste.   Both tasted good with the ramen and pork slices.  

Location is good, fairly easy to find. We sat out at the patio sitting which I enjoyed.  Staff were very friendly and attentive.  Overall a nice experience and would come back to try some of the other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Ryus Noodle Bar is my current go-to for ramen in Toronto.  Before the fire, Ryus didn't really stand out too much, except with their vegetarian potage.  However, I did hear a lot of raving reviews about Ryus after they opened up next to Broadview Station.  Ryus 2.0 (what I see it as) didn't disappoint!  Their newly revamped chicken broth is so drool-worthy I went three times in two weeks!  

There are two lines for the chicken broth items: the regular shio and shoyu ramen and their Nostalgic counterparts.  The staff first recommended me to try the Nostalgic ramen, but my bf and I preferred the regular shoyu ramen.  Both were flavourful, but the shoyu ramen just had an extra level of depth to it that makes it so memorable.  

TL;DR conclusions....

Pros:

- new chicken broth is out of this world!
- you can use points from your old Ryus stamp cards
- Servers are friendly
- right in front of the TTC station
- check out their social media for special add-ons
- their potage is a unique vegetarian ramen (thick and creamy)
- portions aren't too small

Cons:

- not as easy to get to as their old location since it's out of the downtown core
- best for small parties of 4 and under, with 2 and under as the ideal

I still have a few other ramen vendors to try out, but currently Ryus is my HG and I'll be stopping by at least once a month!"}
{"text":"With all the ramen places popping up over the city, Ryus has always been one of my favourite spots in the city. It's hard for me to say it tastes a whole lot better than the Kinton Ramen a few restaurants over, but Ryus has a simple menu and they also do something a little differently in that they have side sauces which you're recommended to dump into your bowl half way through your meal. 

On my last visit I tried their \"Tan Tan Men\" which was advertised as being a original spicy dish from Ryus. It was definitely the most dense ramen meal I've had, it came topped with a dry okra which added a whole new flavour element when bitten in to between ramen servings. I would however stick to their more classical Shio or Shoyu ramen for next time though.
I've also given their congee a try, and while I'm not one to really know a good congee from a bad one, I enjoyed what they served up. 
I think this adds a fun new element to the ramen experiences and once you figure out a favourite ramen order you can always change things around by experimenting with different sauces. 

Service here is quick and very friendly (like most ramen places) so I can always count on Ryus for a quick and delicious lunch!

They also have a stamp card which gives you rewards every few meals here and I'm a fan of that!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here because we were hungry and wanted some ramen to warm us up since it was pretty cold outside. We were deciding whether to go here or to Kinton Ramen but we ended up choosing this location since we wanted to try something new. When we first entered, the place was pretty packed considering it was around 5:22 pm. My friends and I sat near the counters near the wall since no tables were available. 

As for the selection of food, there were many to choose from but I ended up picking the Shoyu ramen and decided to add corn and pork cha-shu. My friends ordered the Tan Tan Men, and the Miso Ramen. With respects to the service, it was incredible. Our food came within minutes after we ordered. Sadly I would have to say the food itself was mediocre. I personally didn't enjoy the broth because it tasted flavorless and I really wanted it to be more salty, if anything; it tasted bland but was still edible. As for the chicken slice, it was really moist BUT bland as well... The ramen was also topped with chili peppers but it did not taste like anything... it was there more for presentation and eating it was not enjoyable. As for my friends opinions on their dish, they thought it was OK as well. Last but not least, the price for the meal was affordable. The ramen I chose was $9.85 plus 2 extra toppings and tax it came up to approximately $13.

Overall:
~staff were friendly
~service was splendid
~food was OK
~price was affordable"}
{"text":"Amazing! This is so far my favourite Ramen in Toronto after trying Sansoutei, Santouka, Kinton, Isshin?Momofuku,  Kenzo and etc."}
{"text":"Not the greatest ramen restaurant that I've been to. 

Positives: 
Generous portions including the amount of noodles and garnish. 
The noodles were by far one of the best I've had; perfect texture.
Cosy and clean atmosphere. If you're coming with a large group though, you may not end up sitting all together because it is a smaller restaurant. We didn't make reservations though. We were 8 people. 
The pork in the shio ramen I ordered was amazing, very flavourful. 
Friendly and welcoming staff. 
Comfortable atmosphere. 

Things to improve on: 
The broth for the shio ramen that I ordered was not very tasty at all. It had a strange almost fishy taste. I usually go for shio ramen whenever I order ramen, and this time it just wasn't good. The broth also overpowered most of the garnish that was in there except for maybe the pork and the arugula. The chicken that it came with tasted like it was pre frozen and barely had flavour. 
For ramen that was just mediocre, it was quite expensive. The shio ramen I ordered was one of the cheaper ramen bowls which was $10.50. I think you can get something better for your money at Touhenboku Ramen on Queen Street. 

Not sure if I would come back here or not. Some of the bowls my friends ordered looked much better than mine such as the Tan Tan Men. They were also quite happy with that choice."}
{"text":"Staffs are so polite and nice. I had the shio ramen with xo sauce. Not quite a good combination but the ramen itself is good."}
{"text":"It's pretty good but wait was long and ramen was a bit on the salty side. Had the roast beef with ramen and I thought it was a bit pricey and the beef was just alright. I do think they have a large selection though and would go back to try something else."}
{"text":"Ryus is in my top 3 when it comes to ramen shops in TO. I usually get the pork blaster ramen (with whatever soup base I feel like) or the angus beef curry dip tsukemen and they NEVER disappoint. Service is first rate and attentive. The pork is soooo tender and fatty - absolutely melts in your mouth - and the broth has that umami quality. The portion sizes are right on point. While the pork blaster IS slightly, just slightly, on the pricy side, I would say it's worth it because the portion size is more than enough to fill you up.

This place is on the same level as sansotei. Does it have the edge? No. But VERYYYYY close. Top 3 in Toronto. GET THE PORK BLASTER and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about coming to this ramen shop since my friend (who has bad taste in restaurants) suggested this place. However, for once, he hit a home run in his recommendation. 

I had one of the best bowls of ramen that I have ever eaten and I still cannot forget the amazing aroma and flavour of the Spicy Miso ramen. The flavours were well calculated between the harmony of miso paste and chili. That bowl of ramen definetely warmed up my soul as I was going through a bad week before I made a visit to Ryus.

The staff are very friendly and sociable. They provide amazing recommendations in what and what not to put in the different types of ramen. 

I definitely will be back for more the next time I come back to hometown of good ole' Toronto."}
{"text":"My favorite ramen place. Used to go to their Baldwin location until the fire incident. So glad they opened up a new location, and right outside Broadview station too!! I absolutely love their Tan Tan Men winter special. It's spicy, savory and creamy. The gy?za are amazing as well. Very thin wrappers with a very juicy filling. Prices are reasonable. Highly recommend folks try this place out."}
{"text":"Feels very authentic and the soup base here is always very tasty. The price is good and the service here stands out in my mind. Get the pork blaster with shoyu soup! It's my go-to. They also give you a cute little stamp card. I always come here if I'm craving for ramen."}
{"text":"The mapo tofu at Ryus was so good that my boyfriend and I immediately started looking up recipes for Japanese-style mapo tofu and then attempted to recreate it, failed, tried again, did slightly better but not as good as Ryus', and eventually, through a weird chain of events, I now make my own mapo tofu on a regular basis. It's nowhere near as good at the one that Ryus has but, hey, it works. Why am I telling all of this? Well, the moral of the story is that the mapo tofu was so good that it lead me to change my diet!!! (Okay, slight exaggeration, but you get the point).

All this to say that Ryus makes a damn good mapo tofu.

They also make a damn good ramen. Definitely the best ramen restaurant on Baldwin Street. 
Tender unburned pork? Yes!
A+ delicious broth? Yes!
Great noodles? Yes!
The possibility to eat outdoors and enjoy your ramen under the beautiful sun? Hell yes!!!

Anyway, Ryus is a great place and you should definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Step 1 Pork Blaster
Step 2 +Spicy
Step 3 Bite into the meat

Best thing to have on the menu
Consistent quality 

Even my extremely food picky gf agree"}
{"text":"I recently came back from a trip to Japan and after 2 weeks on a sushi/ramen diet, guess what I was craving? Sushi. Unfortunately the sushi restaurant was closed that evening so I went for the next best thing - ramen! 
 
I heard goods thing about Ryu's Noodles so I thought it was a good time to check it out since I was already in the area. I order the Shoyu dip noodle and it honestly the best I ever had! The noodles were cooked al dente and the dipping sauce was thick enough to stick to the noodles but not overly concentrated & salty. The order comes with deeeelious sides like bamboo, pork and sous vide chicken. If you haven't tried this method of preparing chicken, you're in for a very pleasant surprise. 
 
I also had a taste of the pork blaster ramen...soup was tasty and again, not overly salty. This order comes with a lot of melt-in-your-mouth pork so make sure you order this on a very empty stomach. 
 
I am very happy I gave this restaurant a try and it is now my go-to the next time I'm craving ramen."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with a friend as we met for 11am.  We were going to have ramen elsewhere but this place was open and so it seemed perfect as there is a patio to sit out on to enjoy the weather.

I just read some of the reviews and I wasn't asked how I liked my noodles and I have to say that was one of my criticisms.  I thought the noodles were too soft.  So I presume that is what our waitress gave us.  

I think she was Japanese and I have had this experience at other ramen places that if I don't point to the item I want, I have been given the wrong item.  

Pros:    On the plus side (patio is one),  I liked the sauces you could choose from and the prices are good.    It's one of 2 places I know of that have a vegetarian ramen and I have many friends who are vegetarians so that's a big plus for me.  I would come again ...but I'd make sure I tell them I want my noodle dente  and point to what I want too. 

Cons:  if you like egg you have to pay for it as an add on.  the pork was ok but not as good as Kinton

Verdict:  It's worth trying especially for the patio and veg options."}
{"text":"So glad a ramen place opened up on this side of town. Broth was rich yet not too salty, noodles were delicious. 


Staff are friendly. They were trying out a new rice dish the day I went, and offered some to customers to try. Was really good. 


Will definitely visit more now that it's only 5 mins away from my house."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended by yelp and some other friends. And after trying it im not sure why. This ramen place is located in a nice little neighbourhood outlet. And has a comfortable looking interior. It is fairy comfortable. Even though it is small.  Food wise is where i dont think it is as spectacular as the ratings suggest. Overall the food isnt bad its just not above averagem i feel like it is like every other regular ramen place and nothing really shows its unique  or things they do really well. The soup is not very special  and the noodles arent particularlu good. The one thing they have that i noticed is the small size. The portions are very small bu ramen standards. And the prices they charge for that size makes you wonder where did the money go. Overall if ur craving and in the neighbourhood then you should go to this place. But it is by no means that great to go out of your way to try"}
{"text":"Definitely my go-to ramen place in Toronto. I'm a big fan of tsukamen ramen and I think it's one of the best places for that. They only have two options, but both are delicious, and it's definitely a strength of theirs. Their other noodles though don't measure up as much. Broth and noodles are a bit more thick than I would like, but still delicious nevertheless. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Perhaps my review is a little biased because most ramen places are really hyped for their bone based broths or fatty pork slices. I'm pescetarian (vegetarian but eat seafood) so I never get to enjoy those highly raved about dishes at any ramen shop.

However, I do very much appreciate that Ryus has quite a few vegetarian options for me to choose from. I can name many other ramen stops that have either only 1 or none at all for vegetarians.

I've been here more than 10 times since it opened a few years ago and have tried many of their vegetarian options. They're all decent - but nothing mind blowing. I like that it's close to the U of T campus so I can pop by in between or after classes."}
{"text":"Finally, a new ramen joint in the east end. I can't say it's my favourite but it's definitely one of the better options east of the DVP. 

This restaurant is located close Broadview Station on the West side of the street.

For dinner, we had the pork blaster and tsukemen (dipping noodles). 

The pork blaster was great. LOTS of pork in a savoury super umami broth and a nicely cooked medium boiled egg.  The noodles were thicker and chewy. 

The tsukemen was decent. The toppings were a bit sparse, consisting of cubes of pork and bamboo shoots.  The dipping broth was less salty than at other ramen joints and more subtle. I warmed up to it after a few bites. 

Service was great. Our glasses of water were always refilled before I could finish. 

They have some interesting drinks on the menu which I didn't try, including some Japanese craft brews.

Payment is Debit or Cash only. 

Overall, great service and solid ramen east of the DVP."}
{"text":"Ryus noodle bar had noodles.  The bowls were a delight to eat and the workers there were very friendly.  The space looks minimalistic, which is good for all the minimalists out there.  It's a great choice to go to for lunch.  Other than that, I wouldn't say it is absolutely orgasmic or anything.  But the portions were good and I wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"I came here last Thursday and tried their shio ramen with seasoned egg. I felt it was extremely salty as there was more soy sauce than the average. They also added arugula which I thought was unique but did not taste as appealing as I would have thought. The egg however was cooked just right-runny yolk. It was extremely hot that day, the air conditioner was not high enough and they left the doors open meaning all the hot air would get in. Needless to say, it was not the best experience. I would probably give it another try in the near future."}
{"text":"I felt that the ramen was pretty standard. The miso ramen was pretty standard to me; rich broth, but not overly salty. However, I didn't like how the ramen only came with two pieces of meat (one piece chicken, one pork). I think they were skimping on the meat a bit, since every other ramen place I've been to always gave at least 3 pieces of meat. But, the meat they did give was tender and moist. So, I'm glad I added a seasoned egg (+$1) to my noodles. They also give you a small dish of sauce (you choose) you can add to your noodles later. There's also the option to make your own custom bowl of ramen (base price $4.95 + $$ for toppings).

I liked how this place wasn't too loud (Kinton is wayyyyyy too noisy for my liking), and it had table + bar seating. Service was quick and friendly; the waitresses refilled our water pretty frequently."}
{"text":"One of a kind ramen. I love the Spicy Miso ramen here it's so hearty and guilt free. Ramen lovers come here !"}
{"text":"Walked into this place for lunch as I had a ramen craving from the day before.  It was all business in the dining room for the lunch rush and I was seated quickly at one of the single seat bar spots.

I ordered the shio ramen with corn and a piece of pork belly.  Soup was full of flavour and the noodles were cooked well with all the fixings on top.  I ordered a second serving of noodles but would advise to stick to the thick noodles as the thin ones are just wonton noodles that were not very good in my opinion.

Definitely recommend getting the house special xo sauce to pair with your ramen.  There is some spiciness of the chill peppers mixed with the flavours of seafood and garlic.

Service was fast especially for the lunch hour which is a bonus."}
{"text":"Came here twice in two weeks for their anniversary special and I'm putting them at the top of my list of favourite ramen places in Toronto.

Incredible broth flavour, complex and smoky. Perfect noodle texture and interesting toppings (pork, chicken, picked bamboo shoot, white fungus, arugula, seaweed sheet) that add contrast in flavours and textures. Special sauce addition elevates the flavour profile further! Only wish this place was bigger so they could accommodate more customers. Came here at 12:30pm the first time and had to wait 30 min, second time came before noon and still had to wait that long.

Ordered the shoyu ramen (so flavourful and better than shio IMHO) with regular noodles. Added the garlic and shallot sauce which is sooo good! Soft boiled egg isn't cut in half but is the perfect done ness so it's forgiven. Spicy miso has a thicker soup base and \"hot\" is actually quite hot. Different noodle too.

Officially addicted!"}
{"text":"As I write this review, I am
Salivating on my screen just thinking about that smooth, spicy, creamy and most delicious spicy miso ramen. I have tried the spicy variety at almost every ramen shop in town and no one even comes close to touching Ryus spicy miso broth. It's depth and complexity is something that is incredibly unique. I can't necessarily vouch for the  more classic bowls like shoyu or shio, because I could never get myself to order something else, it's too good. I personally love to pair my bowl with the garlic shallot oil, white fungus, and chopped cha-shu. The servers are just the cutest things and I have become such a regular that they have my order memorized. And of course, an extra bonus that keeps me coming back is the points card ( which I have had many a free bowl of ramen, thank you). As mentioned, they have played around with the menu and slightly raised prices but I will continue to be a loyal customer as long as the spicy miso ramen stays the same! GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Got the summer special salad bowl (don't remember the exact name) with pork and chicken. Super refreshing. Noodle is harder than those in the ramen which is perfect. Really enjoyed it.
Friend got the tofu spicy miso ramen, I tried some, loved it as well.
Interesting selection of Japanese beer. Friend got a strong ale (8%?) I got a scented beer that's even stronger. Both are not bad, just for the taste, they're on the pricier side. Would've be perfectly happy with a draft Sapporo instead 

Only real downside is that they don't have air conditioning. And it was super hot yesterday..."}
{"text":"Went here for some late night ramen take-out and was pleasantly surprised! The wait was less than 10 minutes, the staff was very helpful and friendly and the food was yummy! I had the original one and got to choose my own sauce, picked the garlic one. I wish I had picked something spicer because their noodles on its own wasn't spicy at all. 

Overall would go back, even given the numerous ramen places within walking distance of this place."}
{"text":"Was brought here by a friend to this little gem today for lunch and must say that I was very happy with the vegetarian (perhaps even vegan? since the broth is totally vegetable-based if I'm remembering correctly and without eggs or dairy. but gotta double check the ingredients, which are conveniently displayed on the menu) ramen that I got. 

I ordered the Vegetable Miso Potage ramen ($10.75), which came in a really creamy and delicious, slightly sweet broth. The broth is totally vegetable based and is so creamy due to potatoes and cauliflower, probably. The noodles were topped with lots of veggies, including my fav - white fungus! And of course, the noodles were so heavenly omg... Egg-y, chewy, and thick, so yummy... Apparently Ryus' noodles are partly whole grain, so yay for fiber :) My friend ordered the Hot & Sour Wakame ramen ($10.75), which wasn't that spicy imo and the broth was much lighter/more watery than mine. There is pork oil in this broth, but I couldn't taste it at all when i tried a sip. The portion size of the ramens are not as ridiculously large as at Mo Ramyun, for example, but big enough that I felt completely full, but not dying by the end. Yes, I did finish eating everything :)

The service is very friendly - our waters were constantly refilled and we were checked on many times.

Lost 1 star for the crowded space and loud noise level. Currently I wouldn't recommend bringing a large group here since not enough seating. I hope Ryus expands in the near future because currently they have very little space for their level of demand.

Not super vegetarian/vegan friendly as most ramen places aren't, but a few apps are vegan (wakame salad, salad, mapo tofu) and 2 of the ramens are vegetarian/possibly vegan. 

Will be back again!"}
{"text":"It's always unpredictable when I eat at a ramen place. I normally get painful stomach upsets. This time I was safe. There is a lot to look at in the menu. You can customize your ramen from scratch even. The thing is though, everything has a price. If you order a pre-made set, you will be hyper aware how expensive each extra can cost you. Some items like x.o. sauce costs 0.25 :0. That is free in Chinese restaurants!
Today, I ordered shio plum for $9.95 + egg $1.00 + tax
It was pretty good. The soup was clear, it was not too salty and importantly, it was filling. The char siu is different from the chinese variety I'm used to. I recommend anything with char siu."}
{"text":"I must say I am blessed to have such a lovely authentic Japanese Ramen joint 2 minutes away from me. They offer a variety of dipping and soup noodles as well as some rice dishes topped with \"stew type concoctions\". 

The Shoyu dipping ramen here is by far my favourite. The restaurant allows you to choose between regular or large ramen (for the SAME price!!!) and the noodles are topped off with an assortment of toppings (white fungus, bamboo shoots, chopped sous-vide chicken breast and chopped pork). The sauce is nice and thick, gripping well onto the ramen. Overall, very yummy and the perfect dish if you are not a fan of soup noodles. 

Other honourable mentions are the curry dipping noodles (the mild curry has a nice sweetness to it) and the pork blaster (the charsui simply melts in your mouth, but make sure to come hungry for this one as it is quite a hefty portion)."}
{"text":"I'm from Osaka. And  I'd say this place is the closest to what you get in Japan, while other  places try too much to fit into something else that's not really common in Japan. Love the spicy miso!! 

Better than any other ramen places in Toronto so far!! :)"}
{"text":"I tried this place instead of Kinton based on the reviews. What a let down. The broths were cool to the touch and very little of it too. You order the proteins as additional toppings which makes for a pricey dish. Unless you get the Pork Buster for $17! While generous on the meat itself, it was fairly plain. They give you a 15 stamp card. Once filled you get one free. I won't be taking advantage of this."}
{"text":"News Flash: Ryu's has reopened at Broadview and Danforth!! Their new location feels bright and spacious. You are greeted by all the staff when you enter and when you leave. The staff here is very polite and checked in on us often to refill our waters and see if we needed anything else.

Food wise I ordered the Ryu's Rich Shio. This came with a piece of pork, chicken and bamboo shoots as well as another ingredient which I have no idea how to translate except that it's good . I absolutely loved the flavour of the broth. Delicious!

I also got to try their spicy miso and did not really enjoy the taste this time. I've had it before but found that it just tasted very spicy this time and little else.

I am happy Ryu's is open again providing yet another option for ramen. I will definitely be back to try their other flavours and you should stop reading now and go check it out too."}
{"text":"Best ramen in Toronto , great service and consistently great broth! The beef curry is also amazing!"}
{"text":"Decent service but still needs more work on their ramen.

Boiled egg and Chashu(pork belly) on the ramen are very good however the broth tasted too light. Adding more flavour makes its ramen better"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Ryus had a number of interesting items on their menu, such as the pork blaster and spicy miso ramen. But since this is my first visit, I opted for their basic Shio w/ thin noodles and added an egg. Unlike other places, Ryus extracts flavors from dried seafood and adds it to their broth, which gives it another layer of depth. But the broth was also on the heavier side, almost creamy. And I wasn't a fan of the lemon zest in there, the citrus note was sort of out of place. The same goes for the slice of chicken breast; its mild flavor & texture doesn't really stand against the rest of the bowl. On the other hand, the noodles were done well as they were springy w/ just the right amount of bite. The egg was also nicely seasoned and had a creamy center, although it would've been better if the yolk was runny. The pork shoulder was sliced thick and beautifully seasoned & tender as well. And the bamboo shoots were a nice addition. I wouldn't mind coming back to try their other bowls."}
{"text":"I live right by here and I come very frequently. Prices are fair and food is great. For those who are used to Chinese noodles, however, the ramen here may be a little too al-dente for your taste. If you're planning to come on a weekday evening, just have a backup place in mind because they're sometimes full and it's a small place!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now.  Both times were fairly mediocre/as expected, nothing too out of the ordinary or amazing.

First time for lunch, it was in the middle of summer.  I got a ramen and my friend got a cold ramen.  We found the dipping sauces pretty cool. Generally found their soup bases a little too salty for our preference, but otherwise, they did an okay job.  For the price we paid, it was a reasonable lunch.

Second time for dinner, all three of us got bowls of ramen and split a plate of gyoza.  It was around 6pm, so we expected the place to be up and running for dinner service, but workers were still fixing lights bulbs and washing windows, so that definitely killed the atmosphere/impression part. Again, food was relatively salty and I felt that portions were a little smaller than before...

Overall, I'd come back here out of convenience, but otherwise, I'm more inclined to try other ramen restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"they're known for their dip'n ramen - my good friends have been to Japan and says they do the dipping ramen the best - that it brings them back to Japan. the first time i tried the original dipping ramen, with for pork only and the egg. it was very delicious and a flavour blast. the broth is very thick and full of unami, definitely heavy, so pace yourself haha. near the end i was struggling to finish it since its a pretty large portion. but i will say, i prefer a classic bowl of shoyu instead. it's kind of tiring to dip back and forth and definitely more work ahaha which sometimes, makes it a nuisance when you're famished. the second time i came i had one of their winter specials: the tan tan noodles, which was much more satisfying for me than the dip'n. again i ordered the classic poached egg! definitely will be back to try more of the menu.

note: both times i went pretty late - after 8 pm so there wasn't a wait at all. but usually the tables flip pretty fast regardless!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday at 1 pm. This ramen place, although quite small, had 2 seats at the bar and at a table. My sister and I grabbed the table after the waitresses kindly suggested we waited 10 seconds for her to wipe the table down.

I ordered the Tan Tan Man (literally translation - peanut soup noodles for those in love dan dan mein) for $12.25 and the spicy ramen salad for $3.75.

The spicy ramen salad was nothing special. Cold ramen mixed with a bit of cheese topped a bed of undressed salad greens.

What was special is the Tan Tan Man. The soup is thick and creamy. Since I am not a huge fan of spice as it burns my throat, you can opt to order the chilli oil and the chilli powder on the side - thus you can add as much spice as you wish.

My sister ordered the hot and sour wakame for $10.75. Same drill - ask for the spices on the side and you will be able to control the burn.

If you are a fan of japanese ramen, this is definitely the next place to try. This restaurant offers traditional ramen with a shio, miso or shoyu base, but if you come to Ryus Noodle Bar, definitely try the other flavours of ramen. If you stick with a spicy one, you won't go wrong."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that the service was very good and the staff were very pleasant, which is why this review gets two stars. The food however was very very disappointing. I see what some of the reviewers below mean with their comments... How can a spicy, thick soup taste so bland? I have never ever not drunk the entire bowl of broth after I'm done with a ramen. This was the first time I left it. The noodles were thick and chewy which was good but they were also very bland. I'm surprised that this place has such positive reviews when it was very mediocre. I'm disappointed I ate here and I won't be back. Also you need to pay extra for the egg and chasu....... What ramen lacks these things?? *insert game of thrones shame bells*"}
{"text":"This my favorite ramen place!!!

It was located on Baldwin street, which is close to my campus and I used to go there quite often for lunch. However, after the fire, it changed location. 

I have to drive to get there but the ramen definitely worth it! 
They have a variety of ramen selections but I always get shoyu ramen and make it spicy with corn and seasoned egg. You can choose the spiciness level from mild to medium to spicy. 
The ramen is so tasty that I have to eat it once in a while. The broth is rich in flavors, paired greatly with the ramen and chashu. The portion is big. If you are super hungry the pork bluster is for you. 
The service is quick and always friendly. 
And they give you cards to collect stickers for rewards. It's just so cute!"}
{"text":"I heard good things about this ramen store so I tried it out in the summer with their Hiyashi Chuuka menu, which is basically cold marinated noodles/noodle salad. Hiyashi Chuuka is one of my favorite dishes and I was excited....I ordered a Extra large (oomori) portion. 

However, what came is a pile of noodle and very little sauce... The sauce were obviously not enough for all the noodles, and ran out very quickly. Basically, I had to eat a big plate of bland tasteless cold noodles. That's a lot of boring carbs and waste of calories.... The price wasn't cheap either (around $15 including tax), so it's a shame to waste. 

Another thing that bothered me was that there were soooo many flies flying at the speed of jets in the store. I'm terrified of bugs, so it's not a nice combination with a big pile of flavorless carbs. 

Maybe their other menus are better, but I would rather spend my money at other ramen shops...."}
{"text":"This place is a great ramen noodle bar. The restaurant is modern and unpretentious. I hate being forced to wait half an hour at other ramen places downtown. Ryu serves ramen like it's meant to be. Affordable, tasty, good value, and quick. Definitely recommend this place over the other overhyped places like Kinton. The pork blaster (double meat) bowl is really filling. A regular bowl should be good enough for most people."}
{"text":"I said they got dip ramen! Make no mistake, 
Their tender chashu is softer than drizzy drake. 
And they got that garlic oil, what a great idea,
Ramen more customizable then closets at ikea"}
{"text":"10/10. Home run. The menu describes the ramen dishes really well too; from what's the broth made of, individual toppings...
Fair amount of street parking in the residential area behind Broadview station, 1 hr max before 6pm, free after that.
Highly recommended for a visit."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: located on the famous baldwin street, modern, trendy

Food: cold noodles special, 3/5, the noodles were legit cold. which was unexpectedly different. definitely different approach to ramen.

Overall: probably wont be back, ill rather go to kinton down the road."}
{"text":"I came here with two of my friends right before a rush of people came in, and we were seated immediately. It was at around 7PM and it was already kind of packed. There's a sign out in the front that says \"30 patrons max. \" so I don't think this will be a great spot to hit during peak hours due to limited seating. It's also directly right in front of Broadview station, so it's very convenient!

I decided to order the regular shio ramen with corn topping while my two friends got the miso and shoyu pork blaster ramen. The soup bases are lot thicker than what I'm used to at other places but nonetheless it was still tasty. I thought out of the three bases, the miso tasted the best. It's salty with a little bit of sweet aftertaste. The abundance of pork in the pork blasters makes the $20 dish well worth the money. 

I'm giving this place a four star since it is on the pricier side of ramen. But other than that, great place to grab a hot bowl of delicious ramen!"}
{"text":"This is a review for dinner on December 9th 2017.

I had been to Ryus 3-4 times back when they had their Baldwin location.  This was my first visit to their new Broadview location.

We were seated at the bar promptly after arriving and it appears this new location is a bit bigger but much cozier (and not as cramped as their Baldwin location).  I ordered the miso ramen and an order of 5 gyoza to share.  The gyoza were much, much smaller than I remember, and my friend and I joked about how we should have ordered 10 gyoza instead.  The ramen itself was much like I remembered of their previous location - very filling!

This new location is a bit out of the way but I would come back here if I have a ramen craving!"}
{"text":"My friend told me about this place. So we decided to give it a try. After all it was a frigid February night and a bowl of some spicy ramen was needed. My first impressions was that this place was tiny and we would never get a seat.lucky enough we beat the rush and got one.The staff was friendly the service was quick.when looking at the menu the pork blaster caught my attention , like i said i needed something spicy :) . I only tried ramen at one other place, and by far it does not compare to ryus. I will definitely come back here for another go.for the price and the portion size its well worth the drive."}
{"text":"We ended up here after being turned away by two extremely popular ramen places in the city since they had a 30 minute wait time (how long will this ramen craze last?!). This place was surprisingly not crowded like crazy and they were able to seat our group of 6. One person in our group was raving about the broth he had here, so we were eager to try it out. 

Ordered the Shoyu with garlic and shallot oil. I also got an extra topping of cha-shu (pork belly). Since we were a large group, I was expecting them to take some time but the food came relatively quickly. I was starving by that time since we had walked almost 30 mins in search of ramen. Anything would've tasted delicious to me at this point but when I dug in to my ramen I was left gravely disappointed. 

The ramen was disgustingly lukewarm. The extra topping of chashu felt like it came right out of the refrigerator and tasted like chicken. Someone mentioned that they used sous vide cooking for their pork belly but it was just...bland. If they would have at least seared or blowtorched it, it would have given the meat a nice flavour and texture. The broth did not have any depth of flavour either and would have tasted a lot better if they had served it hot. I got the thin noodles and they were just so-so. I borrowed some spicy oil from my coworker in a desperate attempt to make the ramen palatable but nothing seemed to help.

I give the food a 2.5. The service on the other hand was quite friendly and deserves a 3.5, since the waiter did ignore to top up our water. 

PS: Find the secret word on their Facebook page to get a free topping. Only valid on weekdays."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. I made a mistake the spicy miso is not vegetarian.  It's still my favourite dish. But they do have a vegetarian section."}
{"text":"I did not like the ramen I got here. I got the vegetarian shoyu and it was very bland. The tofu was overly sweet though so the two tastes really contrasted, not in a good way. Veggies were boring, broth was so-so. Upgraded for a truffle oil and it did not mesh well with the broth at all."}
{"text":"Been to this place twice now, and will be going back.
My mom ordered miso pork ramen, the soup was super rich, much richer than Kinton's.

I ordered the Angus curry beef dip noodle, the sauce was very flavorful and though there wasn't much meat(it is a sauce focused noodle), the limited amount of meat that was in the sauce was very tender. 
The other dip noodle has more meat. Sauce was as flavorful.

The shop has a lot of side dishes and it doesn't only have soup ramen, but also tsukemen(dip in sauce noodles) which has been my favorite type of noodle and the sauce is very very flavorful.

I liked Kinton, but have always found their noodle on the tiny bit undercooked/too tough side, and Ryu's noodle bar's noodles was just right for me. Preference on soft/toughness is very subjective but if you are like me then you will probably like their noodles.
The shop is also much more quieter than Kinton, so if you prefer low noise level this is the place for you.

Planning on going back again next week."}
{"text":"Decent portions, tastes great. 
I am not a fan of ramen, but I liked this place."}
{"text":"Iron Chef Baldwin Street
In Kitchen Stadium, we now unveil the secret ingredient: RAMEN!!!

The Chairman: \"So now Baldwin Street, with an open heart and an empty stomach, I say unto you in the words of my uncle: 'Allez cuisine!' \"

It's a proper battle here on Baldwin between Ryus Noodle Bar and Kinton Ramen.  The newcomer here is posing a proper competition; however, it has not quite stood up to the talents of Kinton.

The FOOD: A decent ramen offering in the very traditional shio (salt), shoyu (soy), and miso ramen.  Sometimes some extra options.  It's fairly flavorful, but I didn't find the depth of the flavor approaches what is done in the traditional Japanese ramen shops or their competitor down the street.  It's definitely a lighter ramen broth, but maybe not to my taste, especially during the winter months.  I found it a little complicated to try to order and choose among the additional \"secret sauces\".  Noodles were decent, but perhaps a bit tough.

They've attempted to get a bit fancy, for example using sous vide cooking on the chicken.  What they fail to do is to either pan fry it afterwards or blowtorch it, or something to properly warm it before adding it from fridge temperature, so it tastes a bit gross.

The SERVICE:  Generally good...some difficulty extracting recommendations.  Quieter than the neighboring Kinton, which is a welcome relief.  This isn't Japan...let's save all the trendy Japanese yelling for Guu and its imitators.

The ATMOSPHERE:  It's either \"simple and clean\" or \"spartan\" as your interior tastes may dictate.  I really disliked having so many of their seats face the wall. It felt very odd....much less comfortable than the traditional style of sitting at a counter facing the kitchen.  

OVERALL, the value is decent, the food is decent, and it's a good experience.  I give the iron chef title of Baldwin street to Kinton."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding Ramen. Pork blaster \"hot\" has to be a personal favourite. Very filling and rich broth and the spice was good enough to excite my Indian palate... That's really saying something! Will definitely return although I can't say I'd try much else since I'm sold on this one dish. Patio is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I am such a fan of ramen so when I tried Ryus after the recommendations of fellow Yelpers, I was incredibly disappointed by the flavour in their broth and the texture of their noodles. I have tried the ramen at Sansotei, Hakkaido and what I find is when you take the first sip of broth, you can't wait to dive in for more before it's all gone. I found that the miso ramen that I ordered had no flavour, it's a richer broth with more fat but I couldn't taste the miso. My egg was cold inside which made me assume that it's not made fresh on the  spot and I was surprised that I had to pay for traditional toppings (bamboo, egg, mushroom etc..). I was also hoping to have the option to choose a thicker or thinner noodle which wasn't available either. I also ordered their gyoza which were not seared much and had a lot of liquid inside. On the positive side, the service was lovely, very attentive and eating outside on their patio today was great. For those who enjoy the option of having different proteins in your ramen, they provide pork and chicken. They also have a great assortment of drinks from the marble soda to other unique Japanese drinks in a can."}
{"text":"This ramen shop came with high recommendations from a friend, and it didn't disappoint! Most ramen broths are usually too salty for me, but this place keeps it rich and flavorful but well balanced. I got the shio ramen, which came with plenty of various toppings including bamboo shoots (my favorite), pork slice and a slice of strangely moist chicken. The arugula was an new unexpected addition to japanese ramen, the slight bitterness added a new layer of flavor so it was most welcome. 

Stole a spoonful of the miso ramen broth from across the table, and it carried a heavier pork/meat flavor compared to the lighter shio broth. The shio broth had more seafood undertones, however both were delicious and it just came down to a matter of taste. Definitely will be back next time I'm craving ramen!"}
{"text":"Okay is a good way to describe this place. We had the curry beef noodles and the shoyu ramen. The curry was typical, not too hot or spicy although you can order extra heat. Plenty of noodles accompanied the dish although it was a bit light on meat. 

The shoyu broth was missing the rounded richness the better ramen places have. And the noodles had the taste and texture of the ramen packs you buy on sale 10 for $1. Like I said, Ryus is okay."}
{"text":"So I had some business to do on Baldwin St. today (REALLY!). I rarely make it to that stretch of Baldwin (you know, the short block chock full of a variety of restaurants, right near the AGO), for no other reason than it's not on my mental radar. I was happy to be early for the meeting and needed somewhere to go and use the washroom, oh, and I was getting hungry. A Japanese friend had recommended Ryu's Noodle Bar to me because, as you may well be aware, there are far too many \"Japanese\" food/noodle/sushi places in this city that aren't owned or run by Japanese people. Now, don't get me wrong, someone who may not be Japanese may be a fantastic expert chef in Japanese cuisine. However, I'm getting a bit tired of mediocre food being passed off as \"authentic Japanese\" in this city - don't even get me started on the lame number of terrible \"Japanese\" Ramen places! Sure, it's accessible and affordable, but there's so much thorough care and effort put into pretty much everything Japanese that I can think of, so it's great to have somewhere that makes this attention to detail - at a reasonable, affordable price. I wandered down (knowing that the space isn't huge inside, and hoping that I could get a seat). From the exterior, I was immediately struck by the simple, straight forward elegance. The interior is clean, minimal, well organized (tables for 2 or more people, a long eating bar in the middle of the room, as well as one tucked in against the wall). Good use of space. Interestingly lit ceiling panels. Wooden sliding door leading to clean, well-stocked bathrooms (um, so the green stuff in the dispenser on the tray at the sink isn't soap, it's mouthwash, thoughtfully provided - next to little disposable cups - my hands smell nice and minty now) - Take Note, Rosewood Chinese Dim Sum. The service is excellent. You're greeted the second you walk in (take note Ashdale Diner), there is a thoughtfully provided coat rack if you don't want to have your coat on the back of your chairs. The servers (only two, but professional, friendly, helpful and organized) are amazing! The menu is wonderfully laid out - well-organized, the choice of ingredients is well explained, suggestions on how to decide on your own ramen (choose one broth, then the noodles, you get the picture..) are there, or easy specials. There are also a few vegetarian options. I had the Shio Ramen special with the egg ($10.50). It arrived quickly and at the perfect temperature. As soon as I had my first sip of broth, it was like slipping into a delectably perfect bath on an icy day. It tasted creamy and lemony (no dairy, and the lemony flavour is from the lemongrass). The size didn't look huge, but with all of the ingredients, it was perfectly great and filling. The waitress offered some hot sauce on the side, so I thought I'd try it. It added flavour with a bit of heat, just perfect. I will happily go back and try everything else on their menu!"}
{"text":"Great broth. I ordered tan tan noodles hot vs normal spicy. It was good! I drank a lot of water and not that I needed milk or sugar to soften the spiciness. I should have asked for bean sprouts to balance it. 

My partner in crime ordered the pork blaster with miso soup base. Very tender and delicious pork. Good value for the portion of meat and not the char siu slices that most ramen places ordered. Great broth."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best, the menu is a bit confusing. I don't go to eat ramen for it to be vegetarian and made with chicken broth, but that's just me. I love my ramen spicy and intensely flavoured. I felt as if my time and hunger was wasted eating here, but vegetarians might enjoy it a lot."}
{"text":"I've never really liked ramen. Been to kinton noodles and just didn't like it. This noodle house has made me love ramen! I tried other places but it doesn't measure up at all. There's something extra special about their ramen..I bet there's a secret ingredient. My favourite in the world is their spicy miso soup ramen. Soooo good every time. The tofu melts in your mouth together with the soup...the presentation and colour of the food is on par."}
{"text":"word of mouth directed me to come here, after seeing the photos it didnt look all that.. but when I ordered the shoyu ramen, it blew my mind!! a bit on the pricier side I find but I do recommend it!"}
{"text":"It's a nice spot for Japanese ramen. The broth is quite delicious and the texture of the noodles is on point. Service is pleasant but the typical Japanese enthusiasm is watered down slightly compared to some other Japanese establishments. It also was a touch slow at times being served on the patio, but the staff managed the chaos pleasantly. Good to see it enjoyed by native Japanese people as well, which lends confidence to the authenticity of this place. The summer patio is also a nice bonus seeing as the inside of the restaurant is a touch on the small side -- I can imagine that this place gets full when the weather starts cooling down. 

On the negative side, I tried the gyoza and wasn't particularly fond of it. My only other gripe was that the atmosphere wasn't conducive to noodle slurping, which is half of the ramen eating experience itself. This might've been because of the diluted Japanese atmosphere and the fact that I was surrounded by tables with non-Japanese customers.

I'd come here again but my preference is still for Ramen Isshin."}
{"text":"I dig this place. Lines are usually not too long -- if any at all, charming service, and the ramen is decent. Yeah the egg is an add-on but I don't consider this to be a huge deal."}
{"text":"I have to say that this place is a very very solid 4 if not a 4.5 for me.

Last year I had gone to Japan with my wife for our honeymoon. We stayed in an area (Ikebukuro) in Tokyo that was well known as a \"ramen\" area. While every ramen restaurant/chain will have their own spin on ramen depending on which part of Japan your in, as well as the establishment my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed a \"dipping\" style of ramen. 

The broth we had in japan was thick, that when noodles are dipped it would coat the noodle with flavor while leaving the noodle intact and not to get soggy while in the broth. Though I did find one or two places in Toronto that had the same \"style\" of ramen, their broth was just the plain old pork broth that did not coat the noodles as in my fond memories.

Then came Ryus noodle bar. This place is a bit out of the way from the downtown core, but very well worth the drive if you are a ramen fan. Most of their bowls of noodles start at about $14, but they allow you to either choose \"regular\" or \"large\" size noodles at no extra charge.

Its a little known secret that also while in Japan, most if not all ramen shops also have a similar unspoken rule. If you want to get extra noodles, or get a large size ramen, there is no extra charge in Japan. And Ryus noodle bar happens to honor this, to the regret of stuffing my stomach.

My wife and I got slightly different ramen broths, hers was \"umami\" based, while mine was benito flake based. Both broths were very thick and satisfying slurping up in a spoonful, but even better when dipped with the noodles.

There was lots of toppings, lots of noodles, the broth was super rich and \"creamy\" dare I say (perfect for dipping noodles). The noodles themselves were made excellent, soft to bite into but still enough of a bounce to chew on, very \"al dente\"

Overall this totally satisfied my craving, and reminded me of my honeymoon in Japan. I would not hesitate to recommend this place to any ramen lovers to try."}
{"text":"A solid ramen place. There is nothing bad to be said but it did not stick out too much in our minds! 

We stopped by RYUS cause it was close to Kekou (our main mission hehe). We came pretty late so there was no line. 

We got the SPICY MISO ($9.95) with garlic oil and the SHIO RAMEN ($9.50) with the house special XO sauce. 

They encouraged us to eat the noodles plain first then add the oil afterwards. The garlic oil was very tasty and did add another dimension of flavour. The XO sauce was a little disappointing as it was underwhelming..The soups were quite thick and very flavourful; the noodles were chewy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Today is my first time going there. I ordered a combo with dumplings, plum shio ramen and hot tea. For sauce, I chose the truffle oil. Though extra money needed for the truffle oil, it's so worth it. I was amazed by the taste in my mouth. The idea of adding truffle oil in ramen is fantastic. it's like adding magic to the already good ramen. I love it!"}
{"text":"I don't know why, but I typically walk right by this place. But after trying it, this and Etsus are easily my go to places on Baldwin.

It's really pleasant not to have loud music blasting the entire meal! Service is also fast and doesn't seem rushed as well. I also don't know what the portion size and price was before, but size wise, this was perfect for me. I like the idea of being able to finish my meal feeling satisfied, but not stuffed. The price point seemed fine to me as well.

I had the shoyu with truffle oil sauce. You'll have to pay extra for the truffle oil over the other sauces. In my opinion, I think it's worth the cost. It tastes good I thought it would. I'd sense the shoyu broth and then get a subtle truffle flavour after every spoonful. There meat was tender. Veggies tastes like veggies. All seemed good to me. I'll come back for sure"}
{"text":"Great noodle bar without the shouting common at similar places. I came for a quick lunch, service was swift and tasty."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

This place wasn't bad, but considering the intense competition of ramen places in Toronto I have to be a bit harsh in rating these kinds of restaurants. Unfortunately, this place is not 4 star calibre in my books.

When I came here on a Saturday afternoon at around 3pm, this place was still quite busy. I also liked the decorations of this restaurant, as it really gave the Japanese ramen noodle shop feel. The seats were a little uncomfortable however, and I found some of the seats too close to each other.

I ordered the miso ramen. However, to my surprise, the egg is an add-on that's charged extra! This was the first ramen place I've ever been to where the egg is charged separate...sad, since the egg is what makes the ramen bowl complete. I decided not to have the egg, since the price itself was already quite steep as is.

The ramen was cooked perfectly and was of the thicker kind, which I prefer over the thinner kinds other places serve. The other ingredients such as the chashu were also good, and the broth was probably one of the best I've had in all the authentic ramen places I've been to. However, despite the positivity of the ramen itself, the egg is an important component, and sadly the fact it's charged extra meant that I skipped on it.

Service was excellent, and I was impressed how two servers managed to handle the entire ramen place since the place was quite full. I might give this place another try, but it would have to be a situation where I'm not on much of a budget."}
{"text":"One of the better Ramen in downtown. Quaint location around Baldwin street. High recommend their meat platter with truffle oil. For a better deal, construct your own Ramen according to your liking!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place for Ramen many times. This place is located on Baldwin so it is very close to my office. This Ramen place is small, so I would say if you go with a group of friends, best to go in a small group. I think a table of 4 would be the max, if you want to get a table. The last time I came here, I ordered the Shyou Ramen and added the egg to my noodles. The both is good, but a bit too thick for my taste. The texture of the noodles were more like egg noodles then ramen in my opinion. Overall the ramen was good. But I thought the seating was a bit tight."}
{"text":"Ryu's Noodle Bar is a cozy ramen restaurant, tucked away in one of my favourite neighbourhoods in Toronto. We arrived at 6pm, and the restaurant was already packed. The three of us opted to sit by the window, which was a snug but comfortable fit. Perfect for people watching. We each had the shoyu ramen and a bottle of warm sake. The broth had a nice light flavour and the noodles had a nice texture and were chewy. There was a good amount of bamboo shoots,  and a generous slice of chicken and pork. Our server, although very busy, was friendly and took the time to chat with us as she came to check on our table. A great atmosphere to enjoy a hot bowl of noodles and do a little or a lot of drinking :) Next time I will have to get there early to try their special ramen; limited to 20 bowls per day."}
{"text":"This ramen shop is relatively small like most of the ramen restaurants in toronto. We didn't have to wait long for a table. Service was great and quick! We pretty much got our dishes 10-15 from the time we placed our orders. I ordered the spicy tan tan noodle. Overall, I thought the broth was a little on the rich side and is much thicker than other ramen places. I remember having to down a ridiculous amount of water afterwards. Would I go back? Maybe?"}
{"text":"Noodles are amazing. Meat is amazing. Asahi beer is a decent import. Small location but don't be fooled, the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"One of the better ramen shops I've gone to. Seating is very limited but the decor is pretty modern and sleek. Nice to come with a friend or two. Limited options but the ramen itself is very well done. I'd come back if I were craving a bowl."}
{"text":"3.5/5 - Was really looking forward to trying this as it's one of those highly rated ramen places. It was quite busy when I arrived with 2 of my other friends on a Friday evening. 

We ordered their popular ramen as well as a ramen salad since it was a hot day. I liked the ramen, it had a nice mushroom flavored broth. The ramen salad was also decent. Don't have much to comment on that. 

I really want to give Ryus another shot since I know I did go after eating sushi so perhaps I overate and didn't give my first visit a fair shot!"}
{"text":"Nice little ramen place on a nice street in Toronto. Street parking only but that's not quite their fault. Nice and helpful staff.

Plenty of vegetarian options which is not the normal thing where I've lived, my veggie ramen had a pretty good broth but was filled with vegetables and I prefer having less vegetables that fit the soup well. This one was pretty good but would have been even better with bamboo shoots and some spicy green onion but I believe you can add the bamboo shoots if you want. The vegetarian gyoza was a great +, tasty and good sauce. 

The others with me had the miso and spicy miso ramen which they both enjoyed and preferred to other ramen places."}
{"text":"The plethora of Ramen/Noodle bars in Toronto, let alone on the Baldwin St strip itself, makes it difficult to really stand out and be amazing. I think we're spoiled. That said, as a vegetarian I'm always pleased when there is not only one choice but a few! 

The thing I like about Ryus is that you get to choose a sauce that you mix in half way through your soup which changes the flavour of the dish so it's like you're eating a new meal! I do however like my soup better before I mixed in the sauce but that just means I have to choose a different sauce next time. 

Cheap, cheerful, really nice staff. Not my first choice for Ramen on this street but I had a good meal."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of ramen... but I think Ryus has changed my mind! Went with a friend on a late Sunday afternoon and sat on their patio since sitting inside actually felt hotter than outside. The table was under an umbrella - the temperature was perfect under the shade on the hot summer day.

My friend got a combo, which seemed like a pretty good deal for a side dish (he got gyoza, but there were other choices such as any of the rice bowls, tofu, etc.), ramen and a soft drink (unlimited refills). He got the shoyu ramen - he's been a few times and said he's enjoyed the noodles each time.

I opted for the special cold salad noodle - with a homemade sesame sauce and vegetable (really yummy bamboo shoots and white fungus) and meat (cha-shu, which was delicious, and chicken, a bit bland) toppings. Everything tasted good together, and the presentation was great. It was the same price for the regular and large size, so of course I had to go for the large. I was able to finish half of it, and packed the rest to go. The waitresses were very attentive, and helped me pack up my leftover nicely (sauce in a separate container).

Lastly, I must comment on the washrooms! It was super clean and carefully kept - there was toothpicks, mouthwash, nicely folded toilet paper... things you'd only expect at higher end restaurants. It seems petty but I like to judge the overall commitment to quality and service of a restaurant/venue by how the washroom is, so five stars for this!"}
{"text":"Ryus noddle bar has a wider noodles selection which extends from Dip N Soup to vegetarian broth. Out of all noodles dishes, I love dipping N soup ramen and my favourite is the Tsukemen. This is the only food that would makes me come back . Unlike the other ramen store, their ramen portion is relatively smaller to fill up my stomach. I need to order extra noodles to my ramen most of the time. 
My partner like their  58 C angus roast beef. He thinks it is interesting to have it in a ramen store. 
Overall, it is a nice restaurant to hang out with your friends."}
{"text":"They have decent ramen and the price isn't bad but the flavour is nowhere close to other ramen places like kinto ramen."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place. The decor was nice, service was quick and friendly. I had been to the location on Baldwin before and really enjoyed my meal. However, the ramen I ordered this time wasn't great. 

I ordered the spicy miso regular, and as someone who likes spice, I found it too spicy. I found that there was too much tofu and sprouts for the size of the bowl. Also, the broth was quite thick; more like a stew/gravy consistency than soup. 

I would probably try this place again and order something different."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch after seeing the \"okay\" reviews on yelp. The restaurant was small like any other ramen place but we didn't wait too long for a table. 

I ordered the combo with spicy miso ramen which also came with pop (free refills) and gyoza. What's special about this ramen place is that you get to choose a sauce that you can add to your soup after you have eaten half your noodles (apparently that is the Ryu way of eating their noodles). Sauces include XO sauce, truffle sauce (extra $0.25) and garlic and shallot sauce. 

However, the soup was thick, bland, and tasteless, even AFTER adding in the sauce. For the noodles you can choose to have them soft, regular or hard. After ordering the regular I felt that the noodles were not bouncy at all. The gyozas were good but overall, the ramen really disappointed me. With so many options in town and within walking distance (Kinton, Raijin, Santouka, etc.), I would say Ryu is my least favourite and I would not recommend this place for ramen lovers."}
{"text":"So glad to see a good ramen location in Toronto's East End. It was the final piece to the puzzle and now we have everything. It is sad that a fire on Baldwin street had to occur for this to be, but I am eternally grateful for it.

My wife and I both had the miso ramen. And added a broken egg and wakame. The broken egg is a great touch and good value over the perfectly formed and cooked egg. The miso broth is a little thick which I like but my wife wasn't as fond of. She got full quicker and is likely to try a different one next time. Miso ramen also comes which thick noodle which I'm a fan of. Ordering extra noodles is an option but I'd have to be really hungry for needing this. Also the use of both a slice of pork and chicken was nice touch and most places don't do that.

Looking for to future visits over the year! Free street parking on broadview as well. At least on weekends..."}
{"text":"It's hard to compete with \"Kinton\" a few shops down, but with their prices and original/delicious broths, they are in contention. It's a nice place to go for cheap, fast, and feeling Ramen. They let you choose which oil/sauce you want on the side which is neat."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review of Ryus. It used to be one of my favourite ramen shops. I have been to (the original location of) Ryus some 30+ times and have the stamps to prove it. 
My first visit to the new location was a disappointment. I am very let down.

Ryus was an authentic ramenya (never mind the arugula) on Baldwin with an authentic broth, depth and reasonable chashu meat in their bowls. They added more taste by having a customer choice of different sauces - like Garlic Oil, Truffle Oil, etc. - included, which added depth and taste and customized their ramens. This, in addition to their tasty noodles and broths, was their signature offering.
All of the above is gone now.

I have tried two of the menu items at Ryus Broadview and was severely disappointed. Where do I start (remember, I had been to the original location dozens of times and this was my first time here so am providing direct comparisons)?

1- The broths had less taste. I had the tsukemen and on the second attempt the miso and they were both less tasty, had almost lost all their depth and were not even fully warm. Both times the ramen could best be described as lukewarm. The Miso Ramen tasted like canned vegetable noodle soup and had a hint of sesame, but there was little miso taste. The tsukemen has lost much of its fish taste and is just a gooey concoction. What.has.happened.here. ?
It seems they have deliberately changed their recipe to include chicken broth, which explains why the Miso Ramen tasted like chicken vegetable soup (and not ramen). That cannot be the whole story however. Many good ramenya have chicken broth and their ramen is still good.
You want even more irony? The Miso Ramen was off their 'Rich Broth' section of their menu!
If I want to eat weak and undelicious chicken soup that tastes 'off' I can always go to Touhenboku, which I never do.

2- The sauces are not free/included anymore and have to be added separately. remembering that these were one of their differentiators and mostly free one can see they have cheapened out and decided to not be different than everyone else.
More importantly for the customer, this may be one of the reasons (in addition to the weaker broth recipe) their broth has lost its depth. The sauces were adding taste and if not ordered as extras the broth relies only on itself.

3- The prices have gone up (Tsukemen is $16.25), but the meat quantity has gone down. Take the aforementioned Tsukemen (dipping ramen) for example. Having ordered it so many times before my eyes were not deceiving me when I quickly noticed that there is so little meat pieces in the bowl (there is no chashu in their Tsukemen).
Recall that a bowl of ramen in Japan itself is $7 to $9. We are already paying so much more for ramen in Canada.
With that said, I could see that the noodle and broth on both the Miso Ramen and Tsukemen were the same as before. Their noodle is thick and eggy, which I enjoy.

4- For the price Ryus still does not include an egg or even a half-egg with its ramen. That is extra.

5- While the owner used to accept credit card for years he has stopped doing so now. This is irritating for two reasons. One is the customer is not told so upon entering and there is an inconvenience attached to the lack of information and the refusal to accept credit cards. The second is it adds to the worrisome optic that the owner has lost interest in serving customers, making good ramen or authenticity. It looks like it is either all about just making money (cash) now or possibly serving the whims of an uneducated customer base. If so, the owner is saving ten cents or whatever on each transaction (I assume) or whatever.

6- This is a minor point because one can choose not to add it, but we noticed that tables have hot sauce available on them. Hot sauce and ramen? Why not peach juice or maybe vinegar? How about olive oil? I mean what does hot sauce have to do with ramen? Does the owner think he is running a pho shop now? I am being sarcastic of course as years of dining at Ryus tells me the owner (who is not really in the kitchen anymore much (he was sitting at a table on my last visit) knows his ramen, but I just felt it is all so inauthentic. Maybe the customer is to blame for this, but what sort of a clientele is Ryus attracting nowadays then and how far is the owner willing to go for money while straying away from what ramen is?
Could this mess all be because the owner has opened shop in Greektown and his customer base is not as sophisticated as the one on Baldwin? If so, can we expect \"Coming soon! Gyros Ramen!\"?

The new store is nice, is clean both in the dining room and the washroom and the waitresses are still Japanese (with a coordinated super short bob haircut rule as uniform), but unfortunately still no traditional kitchen counter seating.
Kinton has been watered down and disappointing for years. Time to rely on Santouka now, hope Konjiki remains respectable and Isshin is and remains as good as my last visit."}
{"text":"If you don't know where to go for ramen at Baldwin, I would say go to Ryu if you don't like the crowded seating and noisy background at Kinton.

*With each bowl of ramen, you get to choose a type of sauce to go with it, and you can pour in the soup to enhance the flavor. 
*favourites: Garlic and Spicy oil, as I like to have a spicy kick to my ramen. 

-Shio Plum (+$1 poached egg) - $10.50: Whenever I go to the restaurant, I would always get the Shio Plum as I prefer a clear and light soup broth, and Ryu's version is perfect! The noodle was a bit firm and chewy, but that's how I like my ramen noodles... the poached egg and chopped pork cha-siu were done well, and I appreciate that they didn't give me just fatty pork pieces. The plum was described as \"sweet honey plum\" on the menu but it was definitely not sweet. In my opinion the plum was pickled as the paste was slightly sour, which I didn't mind as it went perfectly with the light shio broth.

-Shio - $9.50: My friend got the Shio ramen as well but instead of having a clear broth, hers was a bit oilier which I think came from the cha-siu pork. My friend enjoyed it but in my opinion the serving size was quite small with only two pieces of meat (pork and chicken).

*complain: the ramen broth is always lukewarm. In summer it's not bad, but in winter I wish the broth would be slightly hotter, because who wouldn't enjoy a hot bowl of soup in Toronto's winter?!"}
{"text":"I was meaning to write a review about this but I was out for the Labour Day weekend.  

So I went on a Thursday night and it's a rather small place in comparison to all the other places on Baldwin.  Truth be told, the two patio umbrellas are rather large and they block the front of the house, so to the owners, you may want to position the tables differently or find some way to present yourself!   

Going inside, it's a really small place that seats no more than 30 people but the design is nice and the white walls really brighten up the atmosphere.  It's a quaint little place that offers up for the most part a formidable ramen that is comparable to the many places open.

An unique selling point that Ryu's has with their ramen is the whole aspect of picking an oil to add into the ramen broth once you've consumed half of your ramen dish.  My friends and I all got different ones ranging from truffle (I got that one: an extra charge $0.25) to garlic shallot to ginger.  It's an interesting concept and certainly segregate themselves from all the other places like Kinton, Kenzo and Ajisen (and whatever other ramen places) there are.

As for the ramen itself, I got the shoyu ramen and I have to say that on its own, it tastes really good.  I'm always so afraid that the broth would be too salty, which is sometimes what I experience when I'm eating pho or a beef noodle soup, but the saltiness/flavour was damn near perfect.  Better off, the taste of the broth had certain flavour notes in it so it wasn't a straight on salty broth.  There was a proper complexity to the actual broth.  Really good.  As for the noodles, my friend addressed that they were too soft and I kindly disagree with her.  I thought the noodles had the desired al dente bite that I expect in any noodle.  The little garnishes like the fungus and pork shoulder was very good, not dry and very flavourful.  When I added the oil, and maybe I put too much in it, but I honestly didn't think that it improved the taste.  While the server was correct that it will taste a lot different, I'm not exactly sure if it was necessarily better.  I personally prefer it without anything.  Also, the broth itself is already a bit on the oily side, so I feel like adding more in it just takes away from the flavour rather than improve it.  I think if anything that's my only gripe with this place.

Service-wise, it's solid. There's a total of two servers and they're constantly moving around being quite attentive.  When you come in, there's a welcoming Japanese greeting when you come in.  Not only that, they understand the menu and are able to answer questions.  I asked them about a supposed \"self-serve pop\" bar that you have access to when you purchase a combo and they answered that the bar hadn't been installed yet and that it was just a can of pop that we would be getting.  I really like it when servers are knowledgable and can answer questions on the spot so brownie points to that.  

This has nothing to do with service persay but I felt one thing I did notice about the menu was limitation and lack of choice when I was ordering.  All I said to the waitress when ordering was shoyu ramen and felt that I almost wished that there were a bit more options like Kinton.  Would you like the broth normal or light?  Pork Belly or Pork Shoulder?  Take the additional oil out of the equation and you don't exactly get a whole lot of options.

Overall, I think that this ramen place is doing a pretty good job, but I think there aspects that can be improved to make this place even better but they're heading in the right direction!"}
{"text":"My three star review stems from the fact that we were quickly seated and the staff were warm and attentive. Otherwise it would have been two stars for the food alone. I've had many different noodle dishes (pho, ramen, udon etc.) at a variety of restaurants and this was by far the most bland and aesthetically boring. 

After being told that all of their signature bowls start with a pork stock and have chicken and pork as well as other greens, fungi etc. we asked about vegetarian options (neither of us are veggies but just weren't in the mood for pork) and ended up ordering a veggie version of one of their main bowls. When it arrived it had barely any veggies - overall a big bowl of bland broth full of ramen noodles, a few pale veggies and two little tofu pieces. Heavy on the noodles, skimpy on the toppings and no real presentation. Thankfully there were sauces to add - we tried the ginger and the garlic oil and they saved what was otherwise a hopeless meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant was on fire today!! Might be closed for awhile. Just an heads up"}
{"text":"Pork blaster is very filling and full of flavour. Staff is friendly. Street parking is hard to find but there is a green P parking lot close by."}
{"text":"I really love how cute this little restaurant is. It wasn't busy on a Sunday afternoon. Service was also nice. Too bad that I was disappointed in their ramen. And it really doesn't take much to impress my palette in terms of ramen...because I love ramen.

I had the Tan Tan Men (10.50$ - spicy dried shrimp powder and miso soup base with ground chicken)  today and I was sorely disappointed. 

Firstly, there was very little meat. It's supposed to be ground chicken, but there was not more than a tablespoon of the ground chicken and it was lost in the soup. 

Secondly, I had a hard time enjoying this ramen as the soup was super bland. The soup was this super thick, spicy, creamy, starchy sauce. Yes it was spicy, but it had no flavour and little seasoning! I could not even tell this ramen had shrimp flavour in it until I read their menu closely again. Why is \"shrimp powder\" something to even boast about? They also advertise that they use \"dried okra\" in their soup. Why not fresh ingredients instead?  Just sayin' it does not read well...Very strange move on their part when they developed their tan tan ramen. Also, the noodles were also not seasoned. I couldn't taste anything, all I could experience was a lot of spiciness and numbing of the tongue. In my mouth, the soup and the noodles had somewhat of a bitter aftertaste, and all in all felt like it was a bland starchy/floury sauce mixed with noodles. 

And lastly, I did not like how heavy and greasy the soup was... it felt like my noodles were doused in fat.

Oh and they only make 20 of these tan tan ramens to order each day. Blegh, no thanks."}
{"text":"The best ramen I've had, hands down! Although Sansotei will go head to head with this place, I will still go with Ryus! Their broth is so distinct and creamy I low key wanted to ask for more broth! Their noodles though - average, nothing to really rave about. But their meat and topping portions are very generous. I also appreciate the noodles on the side rather than in the soup since sharing with companions would be ideal with the extra noodles! 

Overall this place is number one then Sansotei THEN Santouka in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Despite my shaky first experience, all the other times I've gone have been excellent. I've had the same super friendly, very attentive service since the first time. Whenever myself or my friends have had any questions, they've been happy to answer, be it substitutions, what dishes have certain things (like pork), and more.

Also, the food has been really awesome, so I guess I just got a bad bowl the first time. As a vegetarian, I totally appreciate their variety of veggie options. (My personal favourite is the miso potage.) This is also the only place where I've truly enjoyed gyoza! 100% recommend it."}
{"text":"I had the shoyu and got the 3 additions (egg, pork and a ginger mince type topping) which were all good recommendations. I think this is one of the most generous places I've been topping wise - you definitely dont need to do the additions to feel full! Very authentic feel, very kind staff. Ill be back!"}
{"text":"I actually wanted to give this place 2.5 stars but I'll round up just because they had the nuts to open next door to the ramen juggernaut that's Kinton.  Not only do they have to compete for customers in the same area, they cannot escaped being compared on every level.  That being said, let me tell you that Ryus and Kinton are completely different animals in the world of Japanese Ramen.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say that if you love Kinton, you will actually not enjoy this place.  

We came in on a Friday night, the restaurant was completely desserted -- a bad omen.  My boyfriend ordered the classic shio ramen while I got the spicy miso mabo ramen (which I've never even heard of before).  The stock at Ryus is light and slightly fishy (I think they use fishbones), so it has that seafood umame rather than the usual pork bone taste.  My BF, who loves pork bone based ramen, did not like this from the get-go and noted that we didn't have eggs in the ramen.  I enjoyed the flavour of his ramen; however, I had a major problem with mine.  It was WAYYYY too oily -- and not oily in a \"hearty broth\" way, but oily in a \"floating thick, translucent layer on top\" way.  I'm the kind of person who will finish all the soup in a ramen and I could not stomach it (even though I usually get the \"rich\" broth at Kinton).  Despite the heaviness of the mabo tanmen, it was lacking in seasoning -- it lacked salt and I could not taste ANY miso flavour.  They should really do something about this.  Seeing how this is the standout item on their menu, they need to make it tastier or else people will try it and probably never come back.

Even though I hated the mabo tanmen, I still want to give them another chance.  It is their soft opening after all; maybe they are still trying to figure out Torontonian taste buds.  I feel like they do have their own point of view but it does require the diners' effort to appreciate them while their neighbors are so easy to love.  I hope they make the right alterations and find their own niche on Baldwin."}
{"text":"The pork blaster was as good as the original one from when they were still at the Baldwin location. Since it was so hot we also had the cold salad noodle... definitely a surprise! The flavours worked so well together - a sweet chili sesame sauce mixed with the egg yolk from the poached egg on top. Perfect for such a hot weekend. Apparently large and regular portion are the same price, with large being double the number of noodles. Both dishes had perfectly al denté noodles, exactly as i like it."}
{"text":"The East End has it's own great ramen! 

My girlfriend and I had a classic Ramen and the Tan Tan Men (Spicy). We also ordered Gyoza. Gyoza were nothing special, as they were wet in the inside. On the other hand, the ramen was great. The Tan Tan Men was very thick and full of flavour. The noodle to soup ratio is pretty unreal if you're a noodle fan. It was ground chicken in my ramen. While it was delicious, I felt it could have been slightly cheaper as a result. 

It doesn't hurt that there's free parking on the street for dinner time. Will be coming back and bringing more friends."}
{"text":"Craving ramen but didn't want to go very far, I yelped to see what was around and this place popped up with some very high reviews. With that being said I definitely wanted to try it out.

The atmosphere of this location is warm and cozy. The decor is beautiful and the staff were courteous which I was extremely please with. I was the only one eating but my boyfriend wanted to keep me company. They came back and checked to see if he wanted to order anything or if he needed anything and I really appreciated that because sometimes people just ignore when they're not getting anything.

I made my own ramen - Spicy Shoyu with a side of pork and corn. DELICIOUS! Honestly it definitely hits my top 3. There is nothing that I would change. I appreciate that the sides actually come on the side. This is so I can add is as I go. If I dont want all my corn in there then it doesn't have to be. 

It wasn't too bad in price and definitely worth the trip. I will be coming back and recommending to my friends!"}
{"text":"This place quickly became my favourite ramen place in the city. I have never been disappointed and love the food, decor, service, and atmosphere. 

My favourite is the shio ramen. The broth is not too salty or rich...Just really delicious. I also love that you can choose the hardness of your noodles. The extra toppings (like half-boiled egg, white fungus, bamboo, nor, etc) cost extra (but hardly anything at all) but with the points card, you can quickly earn a free topping or sauce, especially if you go with friend and scoop up their points! I haven't tried their whole menu but everything I did try was pretty darn excellent. The desserts too! 

The staff greet you in the typical friendly Japanese manner and are usually very quick to get to you. The only times service was slow was when they are very busy, and even then, they made sure each table and waiting customer was acknowledged. 

The decor is nice and simple, befitting a nice little ramen spot like this. The thing that really did it for me was the heated toilet seats in their washrooms. It's just such a beautiful little luxury to have a warm seat to put your tush on, especially after coming in from the cold. Definitely my favourite ramen spot!"}
{"text":"First off, ramen should get to your table pretty quickly after you order it.  Instead, I was halfway through my 2nd beer by the time our order showed up and I wasn't drinking particularly quickly.

Second, I've never had ramen broth that seemed like it was thickened with cornstarch before.  Flavour was fine (spicy miso), but the consistency was just odd.

Finally - noodles were weird.  Not bad.  But there was no benefit to using thick noodles.

There is much better ramen in the city with quicker service.  I doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"While there are so many good ramen places in Toronto, Ryu's stands out of its competitions by its broth. Ryu's is using fish and shrimps to make the Shio and Shoyu broth; therefore, it tastes different from most of their competitors. However, I have to say not everyone may like it has some fishy taste. Personally I like it and the broth is very creamy and thick. There are three choices of noodles texture; I always like the hard noodles for the bouncy feel. 

I also tried the Tsukemen which is supposed to be cold noodles dipped in broth. It is the best for summer time. The most remarkable was that piece of fatty chasu melt in my mouth and it tasted so good. 

Spicy miso Tanmen is my favourite so far. The vegetable based broth is surprisingly flavourful and the tofu is so silky. I would suggest spicy hot level if you really love spicy. 

Service in general is very good but the food comes a little slow compare to other ramen places. 

Definitely wanna go back to try the vegetable Shoyu and miso portage."}
{"text":"If you have a craving for ramen noodles, you may want to check out this place is which tucked away on Baldwin Street, just a couple of blocks east of Spadina.  They have a great selection of ramen and other noodles, but my only complaint is that the dishes are too salty. They have indoor seating and a patio as well as a drink menu that included plum wine and Sapporo Beer on tap. The food itself is very fresh, service is friendly as well."}
{"text":"The wait is way too long. At 1:30 pm two bowls of ramen took them more than 20 mins to cook and serve. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Great noodles! Good vegetarian selection. A gem on Baldwin and the price was perfect!! Very friendly and great service."}
{"text":"Popped in here for a quick bowl of noodles on Saturday and I am glad I did. I ordered the rich shio ramen and it came pretty quickly and it was delicious. The broth was perfect and the noodles had that perfect chewy texture. I also liked the white fungus they topped it with. The price point seemed average for this type of joint. All in all, I enjoyed my lunch, and I would return."}
{"text":"My favourite ramen place in the city. Refreshingly un-hip: no crazy lines, no crazy hipsters, and no \"Sorry, we've run out of broth.\" Just straightforward, satisfying ramen for a good price. 

Also: melon soda floats."}
{"text":"A little out of the way since it's not in downtown but Ryus is a decent ramen bar! We had the Pork Blaster ramen, Nostalgia Japanese Shio, and Ryus Rich Shio. They have a really good chicken broth - so simple, not thick, not oily, and just really good. Their pork blaster has the thickest soup and it's very heavy - everything about it is porky.

Overall, pretty good ramen place!"}
{"text":"The place is nice and there isn't loud music blasting. And unlike the other ramen joints, the kitchen is separated from the dining area. A bit pricier than the other ramen joints and I don't feel the higher price is justified given the portion size."}
{"text":"Oh man...this Japanese ramen place is dope!!!  My wife and I really enjoyed our lunch here. This place is modern and it has a patio!!!  Staff here is super nice; they greet you when you come in and out in Japanese. Feels like I'm in Japan. 

Here's what we ordered:  Pint of Sapporo, Vanilla Ice Cream floating in Pepsi, Spicy Pork Blaster Ramen and Shio Plum Ramen

The Spicy Pork Blaster Ramen was super filling. The broth was rich and had tonnes of flavour. The noodles cooked perfectly; not too hard and not too soft. Seasoned egg that came with it was yummy in my belly. I opted for two more toppings; bamboo shoots and corn. Delicious!

Wife loved the Shio Plum Ramen. She opted for two extra toppings; seasoned egg and chopped chicken. She said the chopped chicken was super tender, like tofu.

I wish they had more options in beer. Would like to see them offering Asahi Black. Other than that this place gets my two thumbs up!!!

Food:  5/5
Ambience:  5/5
Service:  5/5
Cleanliness:  5/5"}
{"text":"Too creamy and thick for a ramen, it tasted more like curry and the noodles didn't go well with the thick sauce either. And compared to other ramen spots in Toronto, it's def on the pricier side"}
{"text":"Another ramen place, so close to kinton! 

Staff is nice. Place is clean and bright, with very clean and spacious washroom.

The good point is that ramens taste a little bit different than in other ramen places, with one original idea, being the small sauce that you can add in the ramen soup once half done. That being said, one easily forgets to add the sauce, when time comes. Noodles are fresh and likely homemade, slightly overcooked though.

Otherwise, the broth is too creamy to my taste, the chicken slice (chicken and pork in the same ramen, really?!) is direct from the fridge into the soup... which is therefore only lukewarm.

winner: kinton"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed that they discontinued the tantan ramen...but the spicy miso ramen was really good, i was asked to choose the spicy level, \"regular spicy\" was not spicy at all for my taste. staffs were friendly. btw, it's too hot inside! it seems they didnt open the air con. anyway, i will come back!"}
{"text":"This is a very cool place, the menu is a little complicated, you will need a little more time to fully understand how to order. The prices are reasonable. The only thing I need to warn people is that the broth has MSG, so if you are allergic to MSG, you'd better skip this place."}
{"text":"Came to Ryus Noodle Bar for lunch on a recommendation from my friends.

I had the shio ramen that comes with a pork & chicken slice, bamboo shoots, arugula, white fungus, and lemon zest.

The soup was creamier than what I had expected but the flavour was good. I didn't like the meat but the veggies were great. I added two servings of chili sauce later which made it better.

I'd probably come back with friends but I like Sansotei and Kinton better!"}
{"text":"I love going to these types of Japanese restaurants where the staff greets the customers, very welcoming feeling! I liked how they had displays of how their noodle bowls looked like and what was in it. I went at around 12:00pm and we got a seat right away, right after that people started piling in and had to wait. I like it how they lad a long table for people to sit facing the wall so those who are eating solo won't feel as lonely. I got their regular sized angus beef curry dip noodles with hot peppers. It was great and full of flavor. It was good at first but I guess since it was so flavorful, I started to get sick of it. I did enjoy the little chunks of beef at the bottom! The noodles were also served steaming hot and fresh. I would go back here again!

Service was exceptionally fabulous though!!"}
{"text":"Best ramen place ive ever had! I believe they had a location downtown on Baldwin street but had an accident and it burnt down. The new location is a little out of the way, but I would travel to eat here regardless. The ramen just has so much flavour to it and the portions were perfect for me. It may be alot for some people depending on what you get, I usually get the pork blaster which has more slices of pork in it to fill me up."}
{"text":"Drove to Toronto today to enjoy a bowl of Miso Ramen. Best miso ramen in town! My wife ordered the pork fest shio ramen which she loved. Pork was cooked to perfection with the right amount of flavor to complete the experience."}
{"text":"I'm going to make the suggestion that if you can't eat pork, then do not to try this place because you will be severely disappointed.
I came here upon a recommendation as it being as good, if not better, than Kinton.
I did my research and found out my dietary restrictions limited me to making my own ramen - coolio, nbd.  I got the veggie broth and added chicken, mushrooms, corn and nori.  The ramen was really bland and no amount of sauce helped.  I really didn't like it.  If it helps, my friend enjoyed the spicy miso ramen.
Their service was impeccable.  It was less crowded than other Asian places and this was probably the reason why it wasn't so loud.
I finished my meal, but I absolutely hated the food."}
{"text":"Ryus has been my go-to ramen place since it's opening. 

I've tried many of the variety of ramen they offer (all except the vegetarian options) and enjoyed all of them. Their broth, in my opinion, is superior to most other ramen places (Kinton next door is no comparison). It has a lot of complexity instead of just salt and pork. The sauce/oil they offer are also very flavourful. They used to recommend adding the sauce halfway through your ramen since it changes the taste so much... and it does! This way you get to enjoy 2 different ramen - the original which is tasty on its own, and the one with sauce. My favourite are the Garlic and Shallot oil and Truffle oil. 

Their soft boiled eggs are always cooked to perfection (many other ramen places either simply don't do it right, or are quite inconsistent). The egg doesn't usually come with the ramen, but it's worth the extra, or you can collect stamps for free toppings like I do. 

The default noodle type is not the same for different ramen, but you have options to pick thick or thin noodles (al dente). 

I'm not a big fan of their chicken breast which comes with some of the ramen, but you can always ask to switch it out for pork cha shu (which I think they do a good job with, although not impressive - Kinton is hard to beat in this regard). 

The menu is still evolving, new variety added every once in a while. Unfortunately the price has also been adjusted multiple times (most of the sauces used to be free, more stamps required for free toppings/ramen), one of the reasons why I took off one star. The both also gets a bit salty at times, but not to the point that it's not enjoyable."}
{"text":"This is best ramen place I've ever been. Good taste, good service, everything is clean and good price. I've been here for at least 20 times ( because I live really close and I'm kinda lazy to cook XD). Highly recommended! Oh try spicy miso and shoyu, they are the best!"}
{"text":"This is my go to ramen spot in Toronto. The service is always excellent, and the ramen is consistently good. I really enjoy the sauces that come with the ramen, particularly the XO sauce. 

There are single tables as well as a \"bar\" table, which is nice if you don't like the shared tables that many other ramen restaurants have. It is generally quiet, which is nice if you want to have a conversation or study."}
{"text":"love the variety & options. a bit pricey here but the broth is amazing. i personally prefer thinner noodles over thicker/chewy noodles. would definitely come back to try their other ramen options!"}
{"text":"Been going to this place for two years now. Courteous service, consistently good ramen. A bit pricey, but that's alright."}
{"text":"The bf being the ramen fanatic that he is, we just had to try out the new Toronto ramen spot : Ryus Noodle Bar (@RYUS_Noodle_bar). I have to say that I am incredibly curious wondering who have the guts to open another ramen shop just a few door up to the super successful Kinton Ramen (post here).

 I have to say that it an incredibly cute place with the 2 communal table in the front patio.
Upon entering the place, I notice that it was tiny and the seating doesn't look very effective to me.
And did I mention they didn't have AC 


All of their ramen here comes with one of their 3 signature sauces:
~ Garilic & Shallot Oil
~ Seasoned House Spicy Oil
~ Sweet & Spicy Ginger Paste
 
~ We had the #1 and 2, the recommended to add the sauce at least half way through the bowl before adding the sauces and I totally agree since you have to taste the original flavor of the broth
~  I have to say that I have both sauces especially the Garlic & Shallot oil which was incredibly flavorful and complimented the broth perfectly.

Shio Ramen $9.50
~ We always try to try the most basic one first time at any ramen place. Their ramen here comes not only with a fatty melt in your mouth pork belly but also sous-vide chicken breast which was very moist and tender. 
~ The broth didn't taste like pork bone alone but when I ask our server, she said that it was purely pork bone soup.
~ I find the soup rather oily and heavy where you couldn't really taste the creamy pork bone broth (still love the broth here). 
~ I personally tasted butter in the broth?!?

Spicy Miso Tanmen $9.95
~ I ask for the extra spicy and love it. The super thick red broth is made with house made chili paste, miso paste and Sichuan peppercorns, it's then top with some mabo tofu. 
~ Love the spiciness and I didn't even miss the lack of meat but wish the noodle itself was more undercooked (al dente).
~ Although I like it, thought it was rather Chinese / Shanghai dish than Japanese.
~ A different king of noodle is use here which is thicker and softer

 Verdict :
~ I am not a huge fan of the broth of the basic shio ramen
~ Love the extra spicy miso tanmen which I would be please to come back anytime for it"}
{"text":"I confess I have a slight obsession with ramen, especially for those cold, rainy days. However, I wasn't entirely impressed with Ryus Noodle Bar, despite the good reviews that I've read. 


I had the spicy miso ramen, and my complaint is that the soup base was too thick! I am generally not the type to drink a whole bowl of soup after devouring the ramen, but this broth was so thick that it was almost impossible to even take a sip. It felt more like a sauce than a broth, and I found it overwhelming. Perhaps I will come back next time and try another type, but my first impression was not that great."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars as their food is delicious! However, the portions could be a bit bigger for the price, and the water they give tastes like metal. I'd come back but order a beer or pop!"}
{"text":"Both of us ordered the shio chicken+pork ramen. The ramen is ok, but I think it's too salty for both me and my cousin. We had to drink lots of water after finished the ramen.

The bamboo shoot was good, according to my cousin."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I'm willing to take subway for 40 min just to have a ramen in Ryu's(?  ?)"}
{"text":"This noodle bar was amazing, the broth was  very flavourful and the noodles were authentic, I had the Spicy Tofu Miso ramen dish and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Ryus is on Baldwin just a few doors from Kinton.  I have to both several times. I like the noodles at Ryus better than Kinton. It is not the best in downtown Toronto but it is pretty tasty. I personally I like miso broth with house xo sauce. 

The  ambience is pretty nice and I much prefer the quietness at Ryus to Kinton loud music. While I would go to Ryus again I probably won't go to Kinton unless my friends want to go"}
