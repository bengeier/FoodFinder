{"text":"My boyfriend and I sat at the sushi bar after doing a little shopping. The sushi was amazing, the best I ever had. It was conveniently located, great atmosphere and friendly people. I will definitely come back!!! - Alex and Eddie"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Good deal.. 1/2 off Wednesday on sushi rolls all day. Friendly staff & nice  atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, I'm always a bit disappointed to see that this place is still open due to the way they treat their customers. I feel that a lot of people tend to frequent an establishment more for the customer service and atmosphere rather than the mediocre quality of food, and I doubt this place's menu makes up for the piss poor attitude of the owner. Wish I could be fair and say I had had a chance to try it out! 

A few years ago, my family and I walked into Daishin, mainly because it was one of the only places open and not packed on New Years Eve. Maybe they were expecting a crowd, I am not sure, but what happened next is pretty unheard of. We first asked to be seated at the hibachi tables, and my parents (not being familiar with the group dining experience) decided they preferred more privacy when they saw that we would be seated with another group. My father asked for a private table instead and all of a sudden the owner comes out to consult with our would-be waitress and proceeds to flip out at us. He raised his voice and callously announced that it's HIS restaurant and we can't have it our way and promptly threw us out with some rude claps and pointing. Utterly embarrassing and uncalled for. Needless to say, we've not been back and I wouldn't pee on this place if it were on fire :) Perhaps the guy was having a bad night, but there's honestly no excuse to flip one's lid over something like that. Hopefully he has since gotten some anger management therapy, and perhaps gained some manners and etiquette. They certainly won't be getting any service from me."}
{"text":"We ordered sushi. Rice was hard. Chef grab it too much. But fish was good.
Also I surprised about eel.
My husband loves eel so he order it everywhere.
It was bigger than other sushi restaurants!!! 
Miso soup was very good. Taste was exactly Japanese miso soup!!
We will come back soon!!
I recommend this place for sushi! :)"}
{"text":"Best sushi ever!!! The place is very clean, the staff is pleasant and the food is phenomenal! Will definitely come back.

{"text":"This is nice restaurant but the seating seams cramped.  The hibachi is about the same as everywhere else.  Same show, no imagination.  Prices are a little higher hear..  staff could be a little more friendly."}
{"text":"Look, the prices may seem a bit steep at first, but consider what is included in the price: your hibachi entree, miso soup, a side salad with ginger dressing, shrimp, grilled veggies, and steamed or fried rice. That is a lot of food for ordering teriyaki chicken ($18). You are not only paying for food, but also entertainment from the chef. Therefore, due to all of the food and entertainment included, I suggest you visit on a night in which you have spare time, and no plans following dinner ( it can take some time). It's worth the money, and I think you will really enjoy yourself. They also offer coupons, so keep an eye out for deals!"}
{"text":"I ate here the other night with a large group of people(17 or so). First, we had called ahead to make reservations a while ago, however they of course had lost our reservation. However, they did make every effort to accommodate us fairly quickly. The biggest issue I had was the speed they took our orders, and delivered and cooked the food. We arrived at 7PM, and didn't leave until around 10:15. If I was just on a date night, I would have just walked out. It is unacceptable to not take our orders for over an hour, take another 1/2 hour to 45 minutes to finally start cooking our food, and then take around 20 minutes to collect our bill and finally get us our credit cards back. The food was great, but I don't have 3+ hours to spend on dinner! I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in late at night with my sister after some Christmas shopping. I had no clue Daishin was here, but Yelp helped.

It was tasty, clean and not busy at all. Probably because it was a late night during the week near a holiday. However, we tried a few different sushi's prepared very well by the chef's behind the counter. The manager/owner also came over and helped us try a couple different sake's as we knew what we wanted but didn't remember what it was called ... Sho Chiku Bai. That's it! 

Very helpful service. Quite tasty sushi. And it came out fast. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me, I don't know, but I've been to far better places for sushi. We gave it 3 good tries thinking maybe we just weren't ordering the right things, and it never got any better. Also, each time we dined in, the wait for our order seemed extra slow. 

I'd have to say this is about one step above getting sushi from the grocery store, and that's not saying much. The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because we never got sub par customer service, and I never got sick here. It wasn't like the sushi wasn't fresh, it just wasn't ever any good. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm kind of surprised by the low rating but, to each their own. I've been coming here almost every week & I have yet to get a bad meal here. The chicken hibachi is outstanding & as well as the chicken yakisoba. The chicken katsu is nothing to sleep on either. The meals include soup, salad, & rice which is a good value. If you don't like seaweed (nori), you can get a soybean wrapper instead in your sushi...which by the way, the sushi is really good & fresh. The service is always great!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but two incidents of major food poisonings later gotta take down  two stars...
No execuses unless you can provide a proof that  Chef himself walked to the Atlantic ocean to fish and brought back spoilt seafood. No? Didn't think so."}
{"text":"I have eaten before which is the reason why I could not rate them less than 2 stars. Food is great but we waited almost an hour for our hibachi cook! Don't forget too ask for the yumyum sauce."}
{"text":"I enjoy their sushi and Yakitori a lot! Have yet to try the actual Hibachi or other menu items. They have good sales on the sushi on certain days of the week. The sales don't include all the sushi though! Every time I've been there one of my rolls so happens to be one that isn't on sale (not sure the full details of the sale- they should state it somewhere specifically..). Even without the sale price though you still get more tasty sushi for cheaper then other nearby sushi restaurants. I would have given more stars because the food is delicious but they take forever to bring you food. I have never been there for less then an hour- there is no reason it should take so long (45 mins) to make 2 rolls of sushi."}
{"text":"Service slow. Hibachi good, maybe better than average once it came bc we were so hungry. Didn't think they expected a crowd on a Sunday. No sake shooting, but the did flip chicken (not egg) and the chef was good about keeping this pescatarians shrimp separate from the rest of the meat and chicken."}
{"text":"Went there in January '12; they have half price between 4-6. Some of the best sushi I've ever had!!! Sit at sushi bar!!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night with a party of 6 as an early Mother's Day dinner for my mother in law and grandmother in law. We arrived around 8 pm and met our party at a table, who were already seated. The place was packed!! Very busy, although many tables were empty because the patrons had finished and there was still dishes and trash on their tables. Seeing that should have been my first clue as to what poor service we would receive. I only saw about 2 waitresses on a busy weekend evening, so maybe that was the problem. Overall, the food was delicious, some of the best Hibachi and sushi I have ever tasted. Also loved the ginger pork Hibachi dinner, it was unique. However, I had to give it 1 star because it took over 20 minutes to be greeted by a waitress (someone in our party had to get up and go find one!), took 20 additional minutes to receive our drinks and put in our orders, took 20 minutes to receive our appetizers... So you can see we are an hour into our meal here and are just now getting food. Completely unacceptable. After that it took another ten minutes to get a chef to our table to start our dinner. My sushi appetizer came out as we were getting our Hibachi dinners - so what was the point of ordering an appetizer if it came out late? I was not impressed with the service, attentiveness, or restroom cleanliness (disgusting) and will definitely not be going back, no matter how tasty the food. I am not spending another 2+ hours here on a late Saturday night to celebrate any family occasion, or any occasion at all."}
