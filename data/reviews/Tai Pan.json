{"text":"when I started going here about 14 yrs ago, I would have surely given them 5 stars. I always loved the House rice. It was always overflowing with beef, shrimp, pea pods, etc.  We placed an order for food recently, and the House rice was mostly rice for almost $9.00 a quart. $2.00 for a small eggroll ?? Prices up...quality down. Maybe making up for empty seats. Not in this economy, not in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is our first trip to Calgary after visiting Banff and Jasper.  Peking duck is amazing, the skin is very crunchy,  not fattening like many other places.   We also like steam bun with creamy salty egg york inside.    Surprisingly the service is much better and more pleasant than many other  chinese restaurants in town"}
{"text":"The food is really good and the portions are big.  However if you ask for anything extra, please check your bill as they charge you for anything extra.  For example, we asked for scallions for the soup and we were charged $3.95 for them. We will probably eat here again, but will bring our own extra spices!"}
{"text":"This is a good place for dim sum. Currently they have a special from Monday to  Thursday. If you put in your dim sum order before 11 am and pay cash, dim sum is 25 percent off. (Call the restaurant to see if this special is still available). It can get pretty busy around eleven."}
{"text":"It was surprisingly very busy on a Wednesday night. I arrived with a party of 13 (with reservations of course :D ) at around 7pm.   Most of the tables and booths were full and many seemed to be enjoying the Peking Duck that was on special. Our table was located in the private room with another table and we ordered the preset banquet meal for 10.  The Peking duck was delicious. I found the meat to be very tender and not too fatty. In addition, there was lots of pancakes to wrap it up. Unfortunately after the duck and wraps arrived, we had to wait 5 minutes before we realized they had forgotten our sauce and I had to flag someone down for that. Our request for ice water also took two tries.  The food was mostly standard and filling, however there was not anything that stood out and everything sort of seemed bland...?The rice was overly yellow and moist and unappetizing. I found the shredded duch thick soup was too watery and the crab was very small. Interestingly, when the lobster dish arrived one of the claws was already missing its meat- I suspect it met an untimely demise....   Also, the chinese broccoli was very hard and I have the impression that they either undercooked it or skipped that step entirely. The salt and pepper fish also seemed like it could have been given more attention, as several chunks were deep-fried together into fist size pieces and it took quite a bit of tearing to get a sizeable portion.  Yet, one of the most surprising aspects was that even though the Peking duck was exceptionally juicy and tender, the whole crispy fried chicken was very dry. I think it may be because they have perfected the duck since its in such high demand.  I did like the shanghai noodles and they had one incredibly huge prawn on the three kinds of seafood and mixed greens plate.   Unfortunately, I found the food to be hit and miss and the service to be rather slow and unattentive- maybe due to us being in the secluded private room...? Overall, I think there are much better restaurants out there, I may return on occasion, but certainly not anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place hands down has the best peking duck in the city. It's crispy, not super fatty and you get duck meat and not just skin when you order it with the wrapping crepes. Usually we get the 3 course with the soup and the lettuce wraps (which are duck based), and a few other dishes (the battered shrimp and S&S pork chops with biscuits are a must try)  Like most Chinese restaurants, service is not their strong point but what they lack in that, they make up in their food."}
{"text":"The worst excuse for \"food\" period! Horrible...period!"}
{"text":"Tai Pan serves pretty authentic and pretty tasty chinese cuisine.  Dined here over the Christmas holidays with family and  we ordered the preset meal for 10.  OMG, the food kept coming and coming ... it was endless.    I can't remember all the dishes/ platters (I think there were over 10!) but they were all excellent.    Highlights include:  1) the fish dish - firm morsels of white fish on beds of greens,   2)noodles - pretty standard but the texture was chewy, interesting, and the accompanying brown (oyster sauce base?) was addicting,   3)lobster - deep fried and then bathed in a white cream sauce (I didn't have any actual lobster - too messy - but I did eat the sauce with rice - yum!)  Prices are extremely reasonable - I am not too sure how much the dinner for 10 cost since I didn't pay the bill but I suspect it may be around the $200 - $300 range ... which is actually pretty reasonable considering the quality and quantity of food.  I hear they serve pretty decent dim sum too.  Decor and ambience of the restaurant is average - typical chinese style restaurant.  Nothing special, nothing glaringly awful.  There is a cash machine located in the restaurant.  Not too sure why since the place does accept credit card.  Washrooms are meh.    Parking is not too bad.  The restaurant is located in a strip mall so the few parking spots out front are shared.  I can imagine parking may be more of a challenge during peak times like Sunday Dim Sum."}
{"text":"I just tried the Curry Beef......WOW! Changed my review to 5 stars. It's awesome. Excellent curry! You need to try it!  Great Chinese food in Middlefield. If your in the mood for Chinese you should definitely go to Tai Pan. It's much better then the Chinese buffet over near Wal-Mart. Staff has always been friendly. We do allot of take out from there but have eaten in a couple times. Giving it 4 stars because it is a little pricy but it's the best option for Chinese in the area."}
{"text":"Chinese food is pretty good. Their American menu is a bunch of fried and greasy garbage. (My young daughter orders from American menu.) staff is kind and prompt. Good prices."}
{"text":"Service is great food is plentiful hot and very reasonable we got a combination of everything you would enjoy"}
{"text":"Ordered a few items on delivery and was absolutely blown away. Lemon chicken, mushu pork, steamed bbq pork bun, wonton soup, shanghai noodles w/ beef. It was about $15 cheaper than its competitors and drastically better. I can't say I've had delivery Chinese food this good before. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place has closed down due to complications. No more cheap dimsum in the mornings. Just a heads up for anyone wanting to go"}
{"text":"This is Chinese food that is a big step up from the cheap takeout places in the area. Their sauces are really good. The chicken dishes are made with good quality chicken that isn't at all stringy. The wonton soup is delicious! And, since they're in Amish country, there's even buggy parking.   Best Chinese food in this area!"}
{"text":"Good lunch portion and selection - good prices. Love that they are open early for breakfast daily with discount early dim sum prices and good selection of congee... although could use more salt."}
{"text":"I'm super lucky to have this gem so close to me! Authentic Chinese food, great service and great prices! Never had an issue and I've been coming here all my life. They were rated one of the best Chinese restaurants in the country for a reason and it shows!"}
{"text":"Closed for renows April 2014, no reopening date listed. Also post they want -all new staff as well"}
{"text":"Good (not exceptional) dim sum, dumpling 3/5, pork short ribs in blk bean 4.5/5, sticky rice 3/5, tofu skin shrimp 2/5  Service good, little pricy $25 for 4 dishes"}
{"text":"I thought the service during dim sum was pretty good - we weren't rushed out and the server even asked if we wanted change from our bill (the answer was no). Tea was refilled constantly. Spring springrolls (full crunchy prawns) and eggplant with shrimp were well done. The rice wrapper of haw gow and other steam dumplings were a bit too gummy, but adequate for the price. Cheaper than our usual favourite- Golden Central. The dim sum at Golden Central is better, but after the last time we were at Golden Central - the service was so bad (and I have a high tolerance) in which we were told to leave (in a very blunt manner) so other people could have our table, we decided we wanted to try a new dim sum joint. Good value dim sum. Go early as it gets really busy after 11am."}
{"text":"From my experience at the restaurant, I am actually quite surprised at the good ratings.  The food here is nothing special and can be easily replicated by most Chinese restaurant in the city.  The problem with this place is the food comes out so slow when they are busy and service is sub-par even for a Chinese restaurant.  It is also difficult to carry out a regular conversation because of the noise level partly due to the low ceiling and packed restaurant.  It is crowded every time I have been there and the tables are packed very close to each other.  I just don't see what the allure of this place is other than the price and the free parking."}
{"text":"Not the end all be all of Chinese cuisine I was promised (I have lived in Los Angeles  San Francisco and New York)so I believe I know Chinese cuisine bur good enough for what it is. Dishes are good tasty and big , the staff is kind and helpful but the food is not as good as it should be too Americanized for my taste if you are into some killer Chinese and don't mind a drive go to China Moon in Twinsburg and order to go."}
{"text":"After discovering that Shikiji was closed during the Christmas holidays, we stumbled into Tai Pan (which was in a strip mall next door).  We didn't know what to expect, but after seeing that most of the customers were Asian, that was a good sign!       The first dish to come to our table was a complimentary pork rib and winter melon soup.   The beef and five kinds of mushroom dish (with a generous helping of wood ear, button, straw, enoki and abalone mushrooms) was seasoned perfectly and made our son very happy!   The Shanghai noodles with shredded pork was devoured in less than 5 minutes.       Despite the fact that the steamed man tow (soft white fluffy buns) with condensed milk was not on the dinner menu, our server was able to accommodate my son's request (man tow is one of his favorites).   The salt and pepper squid was fabulous--it was fried to perfection with a minimal amount of batter and best of all, there were no raw onions on the plate!      Well, what else can I say?   There were no leftovers to take home.  This is what happens when you take a teenager out for supper...  One of their specialties is Peking duck and duck wings (a few people at adjacent tables seemed to be enjoying these dishes).   We'll have to try these and their dim sum another time."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant tonight.  The food was very bland.  I'm surprised by other reviews that rave about the food as the best they've ever had.  You need to try Imperial Dragon in Mentor."}
{"text":"I've been going to Tai Pan since I was a kid and the food remains unchanged. It's very good food. I haven't had anything on the menu that isn't bad, but my favorite is the sesame chicken and kung poa chicken. The nice thing about their spicy dishes is that you can get killer spicy is you like it that hot. The chefs don't hold back, and it will burn a hole right through your tongue,   I love the wonton soup which has a flavorful chicken broth and homemade noodles which are thick and you may need a fork to eat them.   Prices are very reasonable. You can get a lunch for about $6 or so, and dinners are about $10. Plus they give you enough food to last for another meal, so box it up and save it for later. You will probably spend less here than at McDonalds.   Tai Pan also supports the local community. They are always happy to provide a gift certificate for a local fundraiser.   They are located next to the Giant Eagle in town."}
{"text":"You can't ask for better here if you're from Vancouver or Toronto and have been longing for good, authentic Chinese food. There is finally real congee, properly made wonton noodle soup (not the knockoff \"wor\" kind; the REAL deal with shrimp and thin noodles) and very reasonable prices. You could have lunch for two here for under $15 with a generous tip if you know what to order. Portions are also very generous and the evening dishes are well made. I've yet to find anywhere in Calgary serving proper wonton noodle soup (certainly nowhere in Chinatown where they pass off pork dumplings for $9 as a reasonable offering - this places serves it for $6 as a far superior product). A true gem in a difficult city for authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Always an enjoyable experience here. Seems pretty traditional food is always on point and the service is quick with affordable prices what more can you ask for"}
{"text":"This place used to be a Malaysian restaurant called Tropika. Now it's a Chinese place that offers decent dim sum and Peking duck a la carte. Modestly priced, the service is quick and pleasant, more so than other places that offer the same dishes. If you find the aboveground lot full, there's underground parking (recommended)."}
{"text":"So-so buffet.  I had the weekend dim sum/ chinese food buffet.  Seniors $12.95 and Adults $14.95.    The dim sum fare consisted of:  -  Steamed Chicken Bun - Very good and hot and steamy.  I like it!  It's kind of peppery  with chicken mean and a wedge of egg. - Steamed BBQ Pork Bun - Very good and hot and steamy. - Fried Turnip Cake - kinda cold. This should be served hot. - Har Gow - took the last 2 when I got to the tray but waited for about 20 mins before they filled it up again; not too bad - Siu Mai - just OK - Sticky Rice - hot and steamy and quite tasty - Some dessert items - like laughing ball (chin toi)- OK, baked pineapple bun - a bit dry. - Congee - not too bad.  The Chinese buffet:  - cut up BBQ chicken pieces - quite tasty - salt and pepper calamari and fish - quite good - Singapore Vermicelli - not bad - Won Ton Soup - needed salt - Vegetable dishes looked kinda sorry  - Fried Rice - quite tasty - Tomato and Egg dish - kinda mush  Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food! Haha I have no idea how or why or perhaps it gives me that nostalgic Filipino party feeling when every party has a selection of Chinese food.   Tai pan is great! We went there for dim sum with some friends after a night of heavy drinking and did you know dim sum cures hangovers?? Jokes, but it sure makes my belly happy  The quality of each dish was up to par with other dim sum places I've been to. Less expensive than T-pot and regency. And they serve a larger amount for the Chinese donut. We ordered the usual sio mai, steamed Shrimp dumplings, tripe, ribs, deep fried shrimp dumplings, sticky rice, donut with crepe, etc. and even tried the congee and wonton soup. There was nothing that I didn't like.   Service was the same at most Chinese restaurants..nothing special but everything was done quickly and efficiently. Food came out pretty quick."}
{"text":"Parking: 5/5 Dining Area: 4/5 Food Quality: 3/5 Service: 3/5 Value: 4/5  This place must do better with take out orders.  We tried Tai Pan on the positive Dim Sum recommendations and previous Yelp reviews but it was kind of a let down for dinner service.  Sadly, they honestly seemed surprised that someone showed up for dinner and that set the tone for the evening.  The server was distracted the whole time, the kitchen was slow, and the place was empty.  Having said that, it was clean enough and the food was ok.  We'll probably go back to try the dim sum sometime but not likely to go back for dinner again."}
{"text":"This is to review the buffet ....  Bleck! hahah. Okay, that sounded harsh... well, let's just say I didn't enjoy it.  $12.95/pp...Not much variety, pretty basic and not great.  I'm not much for Chinese buffets anyways.  But on Mon & Tues, the buffet is $8.95 which makes it more bearable I guess...  :-/"}
{"text":"Tai Pan is my parents go-to place for dim sum. When they were visiting last time, their friends brought them here and they enjoyed it.  Tai Pan is just off center street NE right across the street from Tire Craft in a little shopping mall called The Madison. There's a decent sized parking lot which is nice, otherwise if that's full just park on the street across the road and walk over.  We arrived Saturday just before noon and we didn't have to wait or anything. When we got seated, more and more people rolled in. We ordered tea and were handed a dim sum sheet.  My mom loves ordering all the dim sum so we let her do that. There were four of us and we ordered about 8 dishes. Dim sum is great when you have more people so you can try everything.  I took a picture of most of the things we ordered, rice crepes, pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, taro/turnip/chestnut cake, bbq pork/chicken and egg yolk buns, Chinese beef balls, chicken feet, black bean spareribs, sticky rice wrapped in banana leaf, other dumplings - we ordered a nice variety.  I love dim sum anywhere so this was good - I found that the portions a little bigger than some other places as they offer four pieces of some things while some places offer three. There were a couple dishes that came with a variety instead of all the same - for example instead of having all turnip cake, one order came with turnip/taro/chestnut so it was nice to have a taste of each.   Everything was tasty and filling, service was good - no complaints here!"}
{"text":"Always delicious with an nice range of spice soup for two makes a great meal!  Good service. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Who would think that you would find one of the best Chinese restaurant in Middfield Ohio, but yep this is a great one. Fantastic  presentation of quality food. Had the sizzling rice soup and a zucchini with chicken dish , off the wall, close the front door says Warren  Don't pass this one when in the area  Warren & Norene ! Navarre Fl"}
{"text":"I would hate to christen this place with a terrible first review, especially since I added it, but sometimes fair warnings are needed. This upstairs restaurant space is in its third incarnation since I've been in Calgary, nowadays masquerading as yet another Peking style buffet (its previous name was Empress, and was the same style), luring unsuspecting southern Calgarians into its greasy maw. Perhaps New Year's Eve is not the best day to test out a new place, but food quality should be the same regardless of traffic: we were there at 5:30, half an hour before the place exploded with a surge of patrons (possibly looking to end their mortal lives on the last day of the year), and the food was likely the first batch of the dinner hours.   The only winner I could surmise (to my great surprise) was the salt n' pepper squid - everything else was drenched in grease, and was either too salty, or utterly flavorless. The Shanghai noodles were the dubious winners of that combo, a flavorless slime that wriggled down my throat like worms. It made me look forward to Master Ken M.'s homemade Mexican feast even more.  As I've said, New Year's Eve is probably one of the worst days to try a new place, and it could be that they were on autopilot, slamming out dishes any which way. They might even turn out to be a decent buffet option for the south - but I am in no rush to return and find out."}
{"text":"Initially it was hard for me to transition from my usual dim sum spot, to Tai Pan. I've been going to the same place for years and loved them for their consistency. However, my boyfriends coworker suggested Tai Pan and we took a chance and tried it. I was blown away! It was delicious! I ordered my usual deep fried shrimp dumpling and loved it. Of course it came with the sweet mayo! (Don't mistaken this for actual mayo people....it's not the same when you use it for your leftovers. Haha). Oh! The Chinese donuts are also amazing!! It's been years since I've had these, but now I order it everytime I go to Tai Pan. If there are extras to take home, even better!   One thing I should tell you though, is that you shouldn't wait around for the dim sum carts...because they aren't coming! Everything is ordered through their dim sum menu and made-to-order. If you haven't been yet and love dim sum, this I definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I'm actually quite surprised by this restaurant.  A decent reasonably authentic chinese restaurant outside of the chinese core, and I like it... a LOT.  I would give it a much better rating if it wasn't for some things here and there that a little off, here and there. The buffet, comprised of dimsum items and a decent mix of other items is pretty good for lunch.  But the difference between the lunch and dinner is the addition of snow crab legs.  For the extra $5, it's hard to say if it's justified.  Still, I did enjoy the meal though their version of haw gow (shrimp dumplings) with corn?!? is a little odd.   Pricing is surprisingly quite reasonable, and the all you can eat freshly made dim sum on weekends (1 to 5 pm) is an incredible value.  I wholeheartedly recommend. I do have to try a regular dinner (non buffet) but for value and quality, this is probably the best chinese resto in the south west of Calgary overall (though admittedly Leo Foo is better but not in price).   One last word, the fact that 1/2 the place is usually filled with chinese diners is always a good thing."}
{"text":"I have to say that the Peking duck here is quite delicious! After reading a few reviews I would agree that it is one of the best in the city for sure. It's hard to find the place because it's inside a mini strip mall under an apartment building but worth the hunt. The 3-course meal comes with the Classic Peking duck wraps, followed by the duck soup, and ending with duck lettuce wraps. Definitely a good place to stop in for. Their dim sum is on my to eat list."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese I ever tasted in my life. First off my order was wrong.. I kept it and didn't complain. Then I tasted it and it was disgusting.  Even the fortune cookies were stale as can be. I will never order from here again!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't yelped yet for Tai Pan.  I've been to this restaurant both to eat dim sum and to eat dinner.  Dim Sum:  You order via a check-off list.  Their dim sum list is not as extensive as other dim sum places but the food does come out piping out!  The congee was quite tasty and it was served steamingly hot!   Dinner:  Very tasty and quite authentic Chinese cooked food.    Servers speak both English and Chinese.  Parking very limited.  Free Shaw wifi."}
{"text":"First time trying Tai Pan. Had heard from various people that this is the place to go to for Peking Duck.  I have to say that it was very good. The duck was sliced very well, with a good amount of meat in each slice.  Our group of 4 ordered the 3 course & salt and pepper squid. The soup was plentiful and came out nice and hot. The duck lettuce wraps were also very good. And of course the duck with pancake wraps were the main event and was delicious.  Salt and pepper squid were tender and not chewy. Service was friendly and fast.  They always kept our tea pot and water glasses full. And the bill was very affordable, $60 divided by 4...not too shabby for a hot and satisfying meal. Please support this restaurant as it looks family owned and they work really hard!"}
{"text":"Haven't been in the actual restaurant, but the few times we've ordered delivery we've been majorly impressed.  Its not the typical greasy, oily Chinese food one typically thinks of.  After eating you don't get a gross feeling.   The ginger beef is average, but the lemon chicken is amazing.     They are friendly, easy to understand on the phone, and have free delivery in my neighbourhood.   One of the best Chinese places I've had."}
{"text":"I tried the burbon chicken and it's really good. The spareribs are tasty too. I'm a big fan of the wonton soup and chips."}
