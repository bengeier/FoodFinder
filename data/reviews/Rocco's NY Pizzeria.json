{"text":"The pizza is HUGE!!!!!!!!! The pizza is really good and the pizza is pretty cheap and it is so good. I RECOMMEND THE SAUSAGE PIZZA. :)"}
{"text":"Thanks for catering our night shift lunch!  The Rocco's staff was extremely accommodating and friendly.  We purchased nearly 50 pizzas for them to serve dinner to night shift.  The pizza was still warm when we picked it up, and we had more than enough to feed the associates.  Thanks again for accommodating such a large order!"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is they have a student deal: two pieces of cheese and a fountain soda for 4.50. The pizza doesnt have much flavor. They charge for bad ranch. By the way, there is no pesto."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great service. Pizza was flavorful, wings were great. Fingers were huge and cooked great. Thanks for the holiday cheer."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly people, if looking for a great and friendly place to get great tasting pizza I truly recommend Rocco's."}
{"text":"When you have three kids under 10 and a 4 month old (Aunt duty), cooking dinner is the last thing on your mind. At least for the inexperienced over here lol. 

I wanted to try something new, so I found the closest NY pizza place to my house. Ordered two large pizzas with garlic balls (12) and was happy with the order. The pizza was made perfect. My only complaint is that I had to wait even when I arrived over thirty minutes past the time given for the food to be ready."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. They do offer indoor and outdoor seating but very limited so I find it best to take it home"}
{"text":"Ahhhhmazing pizza! Ultra thin crust! I love to go on Mondays because they have a large cheese pizza special for a whooping $9.99!! So delicious! Its best to eat there to experience the crispy crust"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast today and was blown away by the service and the food, the server Ryan was absolutely amazing ! I wonder if it's his family that owns it? He went out of his way to ask our true opinions and wanted feed back about our breakfast experience. I've never had such a wonderful breakfast experience, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Rocco's Pizza is my favorite pizza place I'm from Jersey so it's the closest thing to home every time I go in there everyone's friendly everyone's outgoing they talk to you I love all the sports memorabilia representing all the New York and Jersey teams. It is the only Pizza I will eat out here no one else can compare"}
{"text":"Roccos pizza is delicious and Monday's extra large pizza special is a great value too."}
{"text":"easily one of the best pizza places anywhere, the family is from Brooklyn, New York and they know what they are doing. Next time you are in Las Vegas take a trip off strip and go to Rocco's...west charleston location or out in Summerlin...try the fried rice balls and the garlic knots!"}
{"text":"I'm another one of those former New Yorkers looking for a good pizza. I got a kick out of the reviewer who was worried about the saturated fats he may have consumed. Come on, this is suppose to be a NY style pizza joint, there are no worries about saturated fat when you come here. If you are worried about that then stop by the Go Raw Cafe or the Red Velvet Cafe. 
I wanted to get a taste of their freshly made pizzas so we ordered a sausage, green peppers & onions pizza (versus picking slices that get warmed up in the oven after ordering). The ingredients were fresh and were served in ample portions. The crust was one of the best I have had here in Las Vegas. My only complaint is that there was not enough sauce on the pizza. The pizza came quickly, the employees were friendly and helpful. I felt the price was reasonable for the quality. I will be going back for more. I would avoid this place at busy times due to the cramped area the tables are placed in."}
{"text":"I've only had the pizza and i just love thin crust! I thought the sauce was very good and different from a lot of others I tried. I can't wait to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I am from the East coast and by far this is the best place I can find for pizza.  I really enjoy the Brooklyn pizza, and I would highly recommend you try the All You Can Eat it comes with pasta, cheese or pepperoni pizza and salad for like 8 bucks each.  My kids love it."}
{"text":"The 1st time I ate here, i was extremely pleased. Tonight, I ordered extra cheese with  meatballs pizza. I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. It just didn't taste good.  Maybe it was the meatballs? I think it's better if you you dine in but not for delivery."}
{"text":"This place is amazing there pasta is so good   I recommend there chicken Alfredo .if your in the area you need to check this place out ."}
{"text":"Great place to pick up a pizza, some pasta or hot sandwiches.  Take away a star if this was actually in NY, but it's in Vegas and one of the best places around.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My boyfriend and I always go. Friendly staff, fast service. Best pizza spot"}
{"text":"We love italian food and didn't want to drive across town to Olive Garden. We've tried little mom and pop restaurants on the southwest side of Vegas, and either their marinara is watered down or the food just tasted like a frozen dinner. 

NOT the case for Rocco's NY Pizza. 

Penne Marinara on point! Pasta cooked perfectly. Sauce very thick and flavorful. Portion size enough for two. 

Chicken & Broccoli Alfredo, Amazing. Not only is the  sauce delicious, you get the taste of fresh broccoli, nice in color as well. 

French Bread nice and fluffy on the inside, crisp and flakey on the outside. 

6 Garlic knots, I thought could use a little more garlic. BUT my gf thought they were amazing. They were pretty big and nicely baked to a golden brown. 

Antipasto Salad!!! Omg! I will order that everytime I go back. Crisp lettuce, fresh veggies, big portion! The best part though, the ham, salami, provolone & prosciutto!!! Amazing!!!

(Order directly thru them for carry out, it won't take aslong as an online order)"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Reminds me of home everytime I walk in.  Just hate that guy who stuffs his face with the complimentary pastries and licks his fingers with every snatch."}
{"text":"I understand that they were closing in a half hour. I ask the worker if they were still serving? He said yes. So I look over the menu for about a minute and asked a few questions. He did not seem to care for my business. I felt rushed so I just ordered the special pizza. The pizza is average. The worker gave poor service."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city.  Not close to the strip--out in Summerlin, across the street from Red Rock.  But this is real NY style pizza."}
{"text":"I'm from the East Coast....we know pizza....this is LEGIT NY PIZZA! Don't believe me....try it....oooh and while your there grab some WISE chips and TASTY KAKES! yup! Large cheese did the 4 of us just right! Rocco's was good to me."}
{"text":"This is my go to place. Awesome environment and even better food. Great service even when they are really busy. Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"From the east coast, so always in search of good local pizza and Rocco's is one of the better places in town. Haven't tried and dinners - but the pizza and calzone are both great. Unfortunately, both orders the delivery 30-40 mins over the estimated 1 hr and everything always comes cold and items like wings or pizza are soggy by that point. Even called ahead to make my case to the manager and was advised it would be on time, ended up being 1hr 45 again and cold. Good food, but do yourself a favor (and save a couple bucks) and just go pick it up."}
{"text":"Went to Rocco's last night for their all you can eat pizza salad and pasta special.  Despite the place being only half full literally at 7pm, took a good 20-25 minutes just to get the garlic twists (appetizer ordered separately)--way too long considering they weren't busy.  We watched a seated couple walk out and a couple later coming in walk out because the service was taking so long.  Then the waitress gives me my husband's salad after another 10 minutes (wrong one).  The last straw is when she (the smiley waitress) finally serves me a salad with ROTTEN PIECES OF LETTUCE IN IT.  Very gracious to take my order off the bill--my stomach was strongly turning/ready to barf and my appetite vanished.  We used to be regulars (going on average once a week) but the service has severely deteriorated in the last two weeks...last time we went took an extremely long time to receive food (same pizza salad and pasta they serve everyone else at this time--only difference is the salad dressing!) and the same waitress was slow to catch refills.  In a city like Vegas there's plenty of competition out there--not sure what is going on with them lately, but they better tighten down their process, service, and food quality or pretty soon they're not going to have any customers--no matter how good their prices are.  I can only think of picking out all the pieces of ROTTEN LETTUCE after waiting so long for my food...my STOMACH TURNING/HEAVY NAUSEA ...then seeing the pizza and spaghetti, I piled the plate on top of the other, and walked right out of there, my IMMEDIATE GOAL being to get THE NAUSEA to SUBSIDE!!!  It was a horrible experience and I will never patronize this establishment again--EVER!!! : ("}
{"text":"Rocco's is our go to place for NY-style pizza and for good reason. Not only is it super close to home, but more importantly, they use some terrific toppings. Their sausage, in particular, is the bomb. The sauce is excellent and exhibits a winning blend of acidity, herbs, and spices. The crust, while very good, is not the best that we've had and does tend to get soggy after awhile from all the delicious toppings.

We usually get a large (18 inch) \"Everything\" pizza to go, but their sausage and peppers sub is mighty tasty as well. The price ($18) is on the higher side, but we don't mind shelling out a little extra for this kind of quality. Call ahead and your pie will be ready for pickup in about 15-20 minutes."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Frequent of the Summerlin location, but this one is closer to the house. The way pizza should be, with the thin crust you have to fold to eat, the oil oozing from it, cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Service was horrible came with a major attitude. Payed 30 for lasagna and was no where worth it. Won't ever be going back and will NEVER recommend this place. was treated absolutely horrible. Horrible."}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1 star I would.  Don't know how the food tastes fresh. Took 2 hours for the food to arrive then it was ice cold. They could have called to say there was a problem but they didn't. We don't mind paying 60.00 for good food and service this was neither. When we called they offered to deliver again but why would I want to wait another 2 hours again, they should have just offered 1/2 a refund, a new pizza at a different date or something. Had to microwave all the food so then it was soggy.  Then they had the order messed up to boot. Won't be doing this again."}
{"text":"Great pizza, terrible service. Cashier was extremely rude when receiving my order and made me not even want to eat there. If you see a balding mike \"the situation\" from jersey shore lookalike working, you may want to leave immediately to spare yourself from his rude, condescending attitude. Enjoy"}
{"text":"great lunch special and delivery service is very good as well love the pizza and salad"}
{"text":"Before Roccos, every time I went back to NY I would make a point to get some pizza.  No longer necessary now that real NY pizza is right here in Vegas.  I laugh when I read some of the other reviews that complained about being crowded, took too long, wouldn't answer question, etc...it doesn't get any more NY than this.  Roccos is da real deal & food is great!"}
{"text":"This place was very good until new owner took over. He acts nice but is not customer orientated and the food has suffered due to his cheapness. I spent a lot of money in there in the past. About a week ago I ordered for delivery, it was 30.00. I paid with c/c and when the food came the delivery driver was very embarrassed and told us to complain. The two slices were in brown bag stuck inside by the cheese. The two  heros were cold and very messy the way they were wrapped. I am very sick and didn't want to call because I deal with them and thought he was a nice guy. I was trying to telI him  the owner to know what happened last time and how driver was badmouthing the way the way the owner was too cheap to put pizza in a small box. I tried to tell the owner this and he hung up on me four times while I was trying to tell Him what happened telling me he was too busy. The food has gotten terrible since he took over. The place has become filthy. I have cancer and he kept saying call back in an hour . Salads, sit there for ever, meat  taste bad, pasta sauce is stale. This guy is ruining the Rocco's name and he's very expensive. Oh and his pastries are all stale. No customer service just takes your money, that he's good at! Stay away from here."}
{"text":"pizza was really good, like the location from our house, will be back to eat here again soon."}
{"text":"Love their pizza! The eggplant parm is the best I've ever had. Kid friendly and nice staff."}
{"text":"Rocco's is my new neighborhood pizza spot! Their EVERYTHING pizza is super scrumptious!  I love the crust - it stays crisp and is flavorful, tasty sauce and fresh mozzarella - you can really taste the quality of the ingredients!

I've also tried the CHICKEN fingers and they were pretty good but they gave me a PACKET of ranch - blah. My only complaint :)

They also have a mini market of authentic Italian food items for sale - pasta, canned tomatoes, stuff like that.

I usually call in my order on the way home from work and it's always a quick, convenient pick-up and I can try a few of their yummy zeppoles (fried dough with powered sugar) at the counter!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the past week since coming into town for work. The pizza is genuine NY style at a price that rocks. I have spent many weekends in NYC and this reminded me of the pizza I love. Huge pieces at an affordable price that taste good. Their meat slices are great."}
{"text":"Outstanding, pizza by the slice, awesome, lasagne...awesome, sub sandwiches, awesome. Great bunch of people working there, very very good"}
{"text":"The pizza here is delicious. Total New York style not a lot of crust and you are able to add different kinds of toppings. Lots of other varieties of entrees  as well"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Rocco's for years.Having had every single item on the menu, I have enjoyed every meal.
I grew up near \"Little Italy\" in New York City and have been to Italy twice. I know Italian cooking. This is absolutely the best in Vegas. The crew there are extremely cordial and friendly.  Mangia?"}
{"text":"Rocco's pizza is really good. One time I was there though and the cheese slid off my pizza and burned my leg. So be careful."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy Rocco's - the lunch special of a drink and two slices of cheese for $5 is fantastic, and the slices are huge.  If you like New York Style pizza, this is the best in the neighborhood.  I always get straight cheese.  The crust is perfectly done, just the right amount of sauce, and there isn't an insane amount of cheese.  All in all, for a neighborhood pizza place, it fits the bill."}
{"text":"First...FAMILY owned.  Great pizza..the sauce is tasty crust yummy.  I frequent local family owned businesses most of the time.  This is our family pizza place for sure! Woot!"}
{"text":"The best pizza that I have found so far in Las Vegas!  The stromboli's are good, tha anti pasta is great, etc.  Love this small walk up with a few tables for sitting.  The best part though (as it should be) is the pizza!"}
{"text":"They need a new person taking the orders over the phone. So rude I cancelled our order."}
{"text":"I love the pizza and garlic knots! We've had several different kinds including their white pizza, which is amazing. This is the only place my kids will eat a full slice of pizza...normally they just nibble. This is our go-to pizza place."}
{"text":"Sorry they got the orders wrong and literally forced my kids and I to eat the 4 cheese pizza with artichoke which is nasty nasty and nasty awful.Explanation was that she thought we wanted that. I don't eat pizza that has no meat!!!! she said sorry and that was it! We paid 56 dollars and wont go back.
I bought 2 large . Never going back!Most of it landed in the trash."}
{"text":"The pizza here is so yummy and such a good price! Right across the street from where I work so I'll be coming frequently!"}
{"text":"Love this pizza! Mozzarella they use is high quality and is so delicious.
My kids prefer this pizza over dominos."}
{"text":"I love roccos.  My brother used to be his landlord on a different location.  Good food. Good vibes.  Authentic italian food. 
So authentic that you might walk in an average joe and leave a made guy. 
Quality food at a decent price. Why go to downtown summerlin when you can save money here. Forgettah bout it. ...

Dont mind the bodies in the walk in freezer. Just part of the business.  I hope this place isnt a front for a huge mob organization. 
Bada bing bada boom... eh oh... the balls on these guys..."}
{"text":"nightmare!!!! first time wanting to try this for delivery, 2 hrs later delivery driver calls he's lost!!! i tell him where to go still lost!!! i had to go find him!!! he had my food in the bed of his pick up truck!!!! no warmer to keep my food hot!!! i get back home half of order was wrong!!!!omg!!! 40$ wth!!! roccos tells me that the drivers are contracted out!!! so they don't know who they are!!! omg!!! get people who know vegas!!! morons!!! never again!!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is really good considering, great pizza is hard to find out west (I'm from New York so I'm spoiled and prejudiced when it comes to pizza.) I usually get the calzones which are great when you're craving something filling and cheesy and yummy. 
The thing that stands out to me most, however, is the staff. I went there one night to get food for myself and my boyfriend who was very sick and in the hospital and tired of hospital food. I had ordered beforehand and when I got there I realized my card had expired and I had no cash. I tried to leave but the man at the counter came after me and handed me the food I ordered, at least 30$ worth, insisting I take it even though I couldn't pay. I'm not poor, just irresponsible, and he did the nicest thing a person could do, even though he had no idea what was going on in my life and probably just thought I was an absent-minded, silly girl who forgot that cards expire (which was true). 
Generosity like he showed me that night is rare, and is a huge part of the reason I'll only buy my pizza from them."}
{"text":"Service here is very poor. Confirmed take out orders are not even started when showing up for pick up. Quality of the pizza is very inconsistent. This is unfortunate because the first visit to this location the pizza was very good. Must have been an anomaly because every visit after has been subpar. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"The first dozen times I went to roccos I would have given this place 5 stars. It was my favorite place in all f Vegas and I would regularly drive 30 min to get it. The last two times I went it has gone way down hill. I heard that it is under new management and it shows. You can tell they are cutting corners every way they can. The crust has gotten thicker making the once large pizza is now the size of a medium. They are using half the amount of cheese and the pepperoni has gotten thinner. Needless to say I will be going to roccos new location even though it will be add annother 10 min to my drive. Good pizza is worth it!"}
{"text":"Straight up best proper NYC, thin, chewy, slight toasty crust. By far the best I've eaten all around town. Always have a variety of pre-cooked slices to go for the last minute dinner decision."}
{"text":"Best Thin Crust Cheese Pizza since I left Yonkers, N.Y. in 1956.  Awesome Cannolli for dessert. Very personable management and staff.  Will definitely return on my next trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Ordered a large cheese and it was ready in 20 minutes.  By the time I arrived it was being pulled out of the oven.  The pizza was delicious.  Always a good place to stop by by for lunch while at the office.  

Extra points for pics of Sinatra and the rat pack."}
{"text":"I wrote a detailed review about their pizzas and somehow my feedback got taken down.  I have eaten at hundreds of pizzerias and this is hands down the worst pizza place you can go to.  Their pizzas are worse than sam's club and costco's at twice the price.  When we visited them a few months back and ordered a large pizza and paid $20, they gave us a pizza that had been sitting on the shelf all day long and didn't even bother to re-heat it.  We also ordered the Chicken Casa pasta and all the vegetables (mushroom etc.) came straight out of a can.  I can get better Chicken pasta at Pizza Hut at half the price.   There are quite a few NY pizza restaurants in LV and any of them would be a better choice.  It's amazing this place is still in business."}
{"text":"Great food. Amazing service.  What more can you ask for? Prices are a Lil more then most. But you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Very good customer service..pizza was very excellent we got a combo in large..Ive been to a few pizzerias around Vegas and this is one of my top go to ones"}
{"text":"A very small tucked away little pizza shop, family owned and run like a NY pizzeria. One of my favorite pizza places in Vegas. Expect it to be busy at times and to have to wait. Try the Zeppolis!   :-)"}
{"text":"A-OK.

Of course I have to try the closest pizza joint that isn't Domino's, Papa John's, or the like.  One never knows when that kind knowledge will come in handy.

So my intent wasn't to be wow'd by some gourmet offering.  I just wanted some good pizza.  My measuring stick ended up being a standard Hawai'ian, and standard it was.  I didn't set out to be impress, and I certainly wasn't beyond expectations.  Was it good enough? Heck yeah.  Decent thin crust which was cooked till crispy and not beyond -- which I find cheaper places either get right or royally screw up.  There were enough toppings to get the job done.  Order was made and good to go in a very acceptable amount of time.  Friendly service, and their pizza boxes support recycling.  All-in-all, mission complete."}
{"text":"Rocco's trumps Grimaldi's!!! 
Since moving to the area I thought i'd give Rocco's a shot and man did they deliver! (LITERALLY) Had a pizza with mushrooms and the most awesome antipasto salad. It was loaded with meats and cheeses and prosciutto! I have to say as a former Grimialdi's customer I'm definitely gonna choose Rocco's over them any day. Kicking myself now for not getting a cannoli!! Thank you again Rocco's!!! :)"}
{"text":"Gotten food from here many times after looking for a new pizza place. Very good back east style pizza. Hard to find that in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The best New York Style Pizza in Vegas! Hard to stay away from this place since it's so close to home. Been there about 6 times already and I think it's only been open for a month or so. Ok, I guess I have to go back tonight! Oh and the vodka sauce is good too."}
{"text":"Great food, even better service. Eat here daily. So many options. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The pizza is solid. I also received excellent service from a waiter, one evening that I dined in. I really appreciate the shaved sausage they used on my NY-style pizza, rather than the crumbles and lumps most other pizza places use. The prices are very reasonable. I have also ordered the eggplant calzone, which had a little less eggplant that I would have hoped for, but had very tasty ricotta-mozzarella blended with tasty spices. I'm just an eggplant fiend, that's all. The shrimp scampi pasta was a little disappointing. Not a lot of flavor and the sauce was very watery. Garlic knots they bring to your table are AMAZING, and the calamari appetizer is equally satisfying.

Most of my experience at this store has been takeout ordering. They seem to have to have a lot of extra people behind the counter and I never know which one is supposed to take my order at first, until someone addresses me. Then again, I tend to come in at times when their dining room is not very busy.

Overall great service, and I still frequent here."}
{"text":"This place is no longer a viable option to purchase your food from. The pricing is horrendous for the type/ quality of food served at this poor establishment. We use to get pizza from here frequently, but we have not recently due to how over priced the food is, and due to the below average quality of the food. There are much better options in the aliante area that should be considered over this restaurant."}
{"text":"Friendly service and mixed reviews on food.  Slightly overpriced for what it is, but I have mostly had their pizza, calzone, and their caprece salad.  Caprece salad is 5-stars, calzone was pretty damn good, but the pizza...even for NY Style...was very lackluster.  

Anyway, nice to have the place in the neighborhood and is worthy of business to be sure."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and came in with a big group after our kids soccer tournament. They had kindly reserved tables for us. The service and food were all above our expectations. Very nice people all around."}
{"text":"Rocco Rocco Rocco where do I begin....I came in because a friend told me your from Staten Island and my friend and I are from Long Island. First we ordered and we were waiting for our pizza garlic knots and tomatoe mozzarella salad and only 2 slices came out. We thought the rest would follow but it didn't so we went up to retell them our order and they acted like they had no idea what we were talking about. The lady forgot to put in our order and we had to keep going up to make sure it was in. As we were sitting down eating I noticed that  3 other customers having the same problem. The lady was constantly on the phone and keeping people waiting. She didn't seem like she could handle it plus the guys running the pizza didn't seem much help also. Also a nature program on CNN was on the TV and they were brutally killing animals. Not really what I want to see when I am eating.  Overall pizza was decent. But service was really bad. If you would contact me for more information my email is glopez4433@yahoo.com"}
{"text":"NY style Pizza good flavor but the crust was too dry. OK for getting a Slice to go."}
{"text":"Angel is great 
Always takes my order and Tyler is always asking if I need anything 
The food is the closest thing I can find to NYC 
Pizza I'm here at least 2x times a week 
The sub's are great also"}
{"text":"Being from Brooklyn, New York I looked far and wide for a pizza joint that would remind me of home. Alex makes it as close as they come so far. The food is great and the service is even better. Alex really goes out of his way to make his customers wanna come back for more. Dustin had my food delivered in a timely fashion with a smile. Check it out guys they won't disappoint ......Manjia!"}
{"text":"Pretty Good Pizza, unfortunately I got stomach pangs and the runs pretty bad after eating it. Must've been all the grease."}
{"text":"Waited and waited and waited you get the point. 
We tried calling on the phone it was Sunday evening around 4pm phone line busy 
So we went down there and continue to wait while the little girl behind the counter continue to flirt with cooks she didn't even bother to look to see if she could help us or other guest we just waited finally we just gave up and the little waitress continue to play around"}
{"text":"I got a flyer in the mail for this place and decided to take advantage of their Thursday special of a large, 1-topping pizza for $10.99.  When I called in my order, the guy on the phone wasn't really friendly.  \"Hey, no biggie,\" I thought, people from NY are stereotyped to be rude, so I thought this pizza would really be authentic!  I've never been to NY, much less had pizza there, so I was excited to try this place out.  It's located right next to Vegas Sliders in Aliante marketplace.  I picked up my large pizza with black olives (DD loves olives), and headed home.  It tasted like...pizza.  A step above Costco pizza (which isn't saying much), it had a good sauce-to-crust ratio (a nice thin layer of sauce), and they were generous with the olives.  The crust was soggy and droopy in the middle, crispy on the edges, lacked flavor (some salt could've helped), and had a chewy/tough texture.  I'm glad I didn't pay the full price of $13 for my pizza, and I probably won't be going back to Rocco's anytime soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Rocco's. We usually get the pizza, pasta and salad special and it has never disappointed. The staff has always been very friendly and it is in a convenient location for us."}
{"text":"Ahh, a glorious, treasured saturday afternoon off had me craving a slice and a soda. With the top down, beautiful 70 degree weather in March, went to Roccos, mentally tasting what i was gonna order.  When we got there, a line quickly developed, who knew that at 2 pm everyone else in Summerlin had the same idea?  The very friendly 2-person staff was kept quite busy. We each ordered a 2-slice combo with a drink, pepperoni and sausage.  While we waited, I added the cucumber tomato salad with gooey balls of italian mozzarella for myself.  What the heck, i knew i wouldn't be hungry for dinner later.  The salad was luscious, and drenched with a homemade dressing that was just enough tang, but not too much to wilt the crunch of the veggies.  The meal was delivered outside where we sat in the sun.  Perfect, right?  Perfect for me, but my date took one look at it and exclaimed, I can't eat that, it's full of grease and I'll be sick for a week if I do.  Crestfallen, but still hungry, I suggested returning it to be made with less oil (and more ala pizza hut style,  which means yuckky to me). He said no, and sat there, bemoaning the money that I SPENT not him on the meal.  I suggested that he try the Aloha Hawaiian bbq next door.   He said no way.  So...I ate with or without him.  Glory behold, he decided to try the pizza, and remarked, this is actually really good!  Yey, total conversion.  No sickness, and he even said \"I'd like to try this place again!\"

I'm told by another casual diner at Roccos that they import their mozzarella, and make their own sausage. I believe it. The pizza crust was slightly crunchy and perfect.  

In summary, when I have a craving for the perfect day out with a simple slice, i'll return to Roccos, and maybe just have a solo experience!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this Rocco's since 2010 and never been wronged until today. I always get the after school special 4.75 before tax. Today the manager with short dark hair guy that spoke Spanish decided to charge me extra for no reason. Charged me 12 dollars because that's how much tax is supposedly. I always send my friends but that's sad having to cheat customers. Going to take my business somewhere else....."}
{"text":"I'm from NYC and this is by far the closest thing to authentic New York pizza I've found in 6 years of living out here."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had with a pizzeria. I ordered a Margherita pizza and a pepperoni pizza and some buffalo chicken strips. First of all it took an hour for my food to arrive and it was WAY overpriced. The cheese fell off and there was far too much grease on the pepperoni pizza. The chicken was cold and soggy and overall the food was very unappetizing. Two thumbs way down!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely the best NY style pizza outside of New York!  I have always heard that its the water from the different regions that give food their authenticity, but unless Rocco's gets their water supply imported from the east coast, they have proven that fact wrong!  They have pizza served by the slice which I have learned while my stays in New York, the less toppings, the better because it's just that good!  Their riceballs with meatsauce is my favorite dish there which I like to get with extra sauce.  And for dessert, a must have is their chocolate chip cannolis.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Rocco's is Delizioso!!! Its as close to New York pizza and Italian dining as you can get in Las Vegas. We were very pleased with the service from Ryan the Manager. Not only was the food awesome but Ryan and the staff made our experience even better. Thanks Ryan for treating us like family and welcomed."}
{"text":"Great food but I will never order again. Worst customer service I've ever experienced while dealing with Rango, the owner. He was unresponsive to my requests, rude, and arguementative. I got charged $84 dollars for 3 large pizzas. One of the pizzas was ok, one was under cooked and all the toppings fell off, one was burnt and missing a topping. The owner was not willing to refund my money and take the pizzas back. Unfortunately, I guess I have to take a loss as the consumer as the pizzas sits in my trash. This was my fifth bad experience at this restaurant and I've finally learned my lesson. The worst part is I had house guests, so embarrassing. Save yourself some frustration and never order from roccos."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed about them.  I've order take out. One whole . By the time I arrive 15 mins to my destination.  The pizza was soggy.  I've called and complained about bringing back the pizza and asking to make a new one.  I guess who ever made the  added too much sauce.  Not recommend"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite pizza place! They make everything the way you request. Customer service is also fantastic. They sale a variety of different options. Have not tried out the delivery. Restaurant is cleaner than expected."}
{"text":"We love this little place and frequent a few times a month. Imagine if you had an Italian grandma who loved to cook Classic Italian comfort dishes... That's what this place is. I've had most things on the menu and haven't been disappointed yet. Service is always spectacular as well. The kids absolutely love the Nathan Hot Dogs."}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza by the slice. Today I tried their meatball sub, huge and really tasty, the Italian breast beautiful Golden Crust and soft and chewy inside. I really like to eat at locally owned and operated restaurants were never given the chance."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! I showed them the promotion that THEY put on Facebook saying $.99 for a slice of pizza and they said \"oh....no we don't accept that maybe try the other location\" WTF this is on your Facebook page!!! Suck it Rocco there are plenty of great pizza shops in town that I will take my money too."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty authentic, I am a New Yorker so always looking for good pizza. Also, tried the cannoli and it was awesome."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza. I have never been a fan of white pizza but it unbelievable here. U gotta try it. I called and asked if they can do half white and half regular.  He said he can whatever I like which was nice. I've beem here about 5x since it opened, mainly bc it is super close to my house. The pizza is 5 star quality, however,  they need to revamp their appetizers.  Place woukd be 5 stars ez w better items besides the pizza. Definitely recommend the pizza here."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Rocco's and can't wait to return! This is only based off of one take out order. When I walked in I saw a bunch of pizzas and goodies all around me. It smelled so good! The employee that took care of me was super friendly and the pizza was ready at the time they told me! I ordered the white pizza and I'm happy I did! The crust is perfect, the pizza is thin! Delicious cheese and garlic sauce! I will order another white pizza but next time I'm going to ask for half of the fresh ricotta cheese. I do like ricotta, however it was just a little too overbearing for me on the pizza! I got the large for $15. It is pretty big! I can't wait to try just a plain cheese pizza! I will return to Rocco's!!"}
{"text":"I love this spot!!! Great pizza, no fuss environment, great service! Love pizza with the white sauce!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've found in Vegas.  I call in ahead and pick it up to go.  It's always ready when I get there and I've never had any issues with service."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places! The pizza is great and there are a large variety of toppings available. The pasta dishes are flavorful and every one is fantastic! Both the cold and hot sandwiches are delicious! They even have burgers, tenders, and wings for those who want something different.

The service is always great, whether dining in, taking out, or picking up.

This is the spot for good eats and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a slice after shopping. Really good pizza and the staff was extra friendly. Fast and delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I live nearby and the location is very convenient to go to for authentic pizza. I'm originally from South Jersey, outside of Philly. I don't recommend the Philly Cheese steak. It's nothing close to a real one. The sandwich was small, the meat wasn't seasoned, and they forgot my grilled onions. It tasted like some that could've been prepared at home. The menu has a large selection of other Italian pizzeria items that are definately worth trying."}
{"text":"Delivery took over 1.5 hours.  Food taste was pretty poor.  I don't think that I will ever order from this place again."}
{"text":"Rocco's NY Pizzeria is the only place we get pizza. Their service has been wonderful every time, and our order is never late. I love the natural ingredients, and the slices are big! Also, the family favorite of ours from Rocco's is their Buffalo Wings! They are crispy and have the perfect amount of sauce! YUM! Love having a local pizza shop so close to home! Thanks Rocco's!"}
{"text":"We have been going here since they opened!!! Love their pizza, lasagna, meatballs!!! Would love to try other items, family over rules me. Would go any day!!! The staff is very friendly to every one when I go. They may be busy, always making sure you are satisfied. Do not have anything bad to say about Rocco's!!!! Love their student specials and Monday cheese pizza special!!! They do have a dining room in back, but Rocco's is more of a take out place."}
{"text":"The pizza here is good and if your a local and used to picking up or dining out then great. If your looking for delivery service, look elsewhere!!! They advertise that they deliver but if you call to order, they do everything to discourage it from adding $3 fees to saying things such as \" we stop delivery service at 9pm and although you are calling 1 hour and 45 minutes prior too, we won't have time to get to your order\" to \"you live close enough, why can't you pick it up?\" And the best \"Your order is $0.50 shy of our $20 minimum regardless if you pay the $3 fee so sorry\". 

They must be rolling in $$$ because they are certainly good at turning away business."}
{"text":"From the nearly inanimate object who took my order to the dirty table to the filthy almost empty cheese shaker to the second rate pizza with the \"not-so-fresh\" sausage that sent me running to the bathroom, thank you Rocco's for another miserable Las Vegas pizza experience.  I hope you'll understand my not asking for a to go box for the leftovers."}
{"text":"I ordered a chef's salad with no onions, and a piece of that Italian cake...tiramisu.  It was home delivery.  My order came pretty quickly and I was satisfied with the food.  It was a good portion size, fresh, and tasty."}
{"text":"Best pizza in North Las Vegas.  We have a lot of different favorites at Rocco's, but the last 4 times we ordered the 3 cheese pizza. YUMMY!  It is so dang good!"}
{"text":"I ordered the sausage, peppers and onion stromboli which was excellent. It arrived quickly.  My boyfriend ordered the italian sandwich. The meat used was quality but the sandwich itself left much to be desired. There were no condiments. It was just a plain sandwich. We added our own so it wasn't a huge deal. Overall we enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town bar none. Entrees very good as well. There's nothing like New York and New York pizza, and this place embodies both. Round Table, Grimaldi's, DiCarlo's, Metro Pizza? Fuhgeddaboutit! Rocco's trumps them all in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant!!! I have only ever ordered delivery and every time the food is hot and fresh! I have had the fettuccine alfredo with broccoli, the seasoning is perfect! And the broccoli OMG!! I generally do not order alfredo with broccoli as the broccoli is not cooked or has a bad taste but Roccos knows how to cook the broccoli in this dish its wonderful! I have also had the piccata, i read on a previous review that it was too lemony and that is not the case... the chicken is lightly breaded and very tender. The zeppoles with powder suger are really good some places make these really tough but these are very light! The stromboli is my husbands favorite and the pizza is equally good.... the meatballs are so flavorful and are really good we get them with the spaghetti!!! 
This is one of my favorites and i order from them often!!! At least once a week!! Definitely a must try! Also the guys that deliver are very friendly!! :-)"}
{"text":"Rocco's has excellent pizza is one of the few places in town where you can actually get a slice. This is as close to any New York style pizza that I've ever had outside of Manhattan. I also recommend trying the pasta dishes spaghetti and meatballs are  great they have  Rich marinara sauce and the meatballs are flavorful and large. Another particular favorite of mine are there Italian subs I recommend the Brooklyn they have fresh-made Italian bread."}
{"text":"This place is garbage. Nothing more than average pizza sitting out for a few hours then reheated for too long. They have a few locations in town and none are better than another. Their lunch special for two slices with a drink for five bucks would be worth it if the pizza tasted better."}
{"text":"Consistently good food & service.  Great variety of pizzas,  cold cut subs, salads, & even hot zeppelis for someone with a sweet tooth. A little slice of nyc right here in Vegas"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Crust is perfect. Just thin enough to have a crispy finish, but still soft on top."}
{"text":"Pizza, chicken parmigiano, Greek salad are a typical go too, with no complaints. From the first bite to the last,  this is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Tired of the same lame sandwiches? This place has the best sandwiches any where. I ordered the regular Staten Island and it was huge! Tons of meat and great bread. You have to stop by and check it out! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've had the garlic knots, mac & cheese bites and cannolis here. & let me just say... Everything is awesome! They're my favorite place for garlic knots and I'm very picky with those. The mac & cheese bites are good but just so you're aware, there's 6 triangles of mac & cheese bites per order. Their cannolis are also very good. I've had the regular and the chocolate.

In addition to their great food, I've also received great customer service! It can be noisy while ordering on the phone but the service you're given despite that kind of helps in having to repeat yourself due to them not hearing you well. Though I wish I didn't feel like I have to yell while ordering food on the phone.

I have yet to sit down and eat there so I can't comment on the speed of service or anything related to that but my order is always ready for pickup when they say it will be or not too long after."}
{"text":"The Original Roccos owner has this location - the BEST one of all! Great pizza but the garlic knots are the bomb!! Would love more dining space - but its ok because food is best around! Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Has to be my favorite pizza place, recommended by a few New Yorkers who moved to Vegas.  I had the summer special- which is two slices of pizza with a drink for 7.50 (any toppings.) Fries and bacon on a pizza was amazing, was more than I expected. Slices are huge!"}
{"text":"Diane         Had a very good experience at this restaurant. .The stromboli
Was awesome and the service was too. We would go back and take friends"}
{"text":"The prices are on the high side but the pizza, knots and calzones I've had are definitely above average. I only give so few stars simply because the place constantly seems like it's \"crashing and burning.\"  The staff are constantly in the weeds, in each other's way, behind on orders and genuinely confused. It seems to be that way even at 3-4 pm. There's a lot of kids working there, so it's understandable to a point. Honestly they are all trying to be attentive and helpful. 

My experience has been okay for carry out. But with about 7-8 orders under my belt I have NEVER been given an order that was correct or complete the first time. And always with a \"you're all set,\" then me pointing out the missing or wrong item, then the staffer reading the ticket and realizing the mistake."}
{"text":"I love the cannolis!!! If you like thin New York style pizza this is your place to go."}
{"text":"I would give it no stars if I could. Second time this has happened to me. I ordered a pizza and wings. I was quoted 1 hour.  After calling and being reassured my pizza was on the way, just 10 minutes shy of 2 hours my food arrived.  I'll start with my wings. They look like they were cooked this morning and put in a box. My pizza, the box looks like the driver had his girl friend sit on the box. When I open the box just looking at the pizza it's smashed to the top of the box and doesn't look like they even cooked it completely and of course like the wings it's cold.   When I called to speak to the manager about the situation he questioned me, said wasn't I quoted 2 hours. I said no. I said I would never agree to that. He then came back with well lots of people order it early. Umm no."}
{"text":"This place is freaking awesome. I've been coming here for about two years, always ordering to go entrees. I can't speak for the pizza or delivery service, as I always get take out. Their food is, hands down, some of the best in Las Vegas. The Chicken Casa and the Champagne Chicken are two of the most delectable dishes you'll find, and for the prices charged, are better than just about anything you'll pay triple for in some stupid casino on the Strip. The service is always top notch, and that may be because I know the people here after coming in here so much, but from the beginning I've always felt welcome and that my patronage was appreciated. I recommend this place to anyone that's in the area if you're willing to spend a buck for good food."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. We decided to go there because of reviews online. When we called to place an order the guy said us one price and we asked how many toppings did it include and he said if doesn't matter that it was included in that price. When we came to pick it up around 9:30pm 04/09 another guy at the register told us much bigger price. When I asked why it was different it was not what we discussed on the phone, he answered that he just came in and they guy who was taking an order was 17 years old boy and didn't know what he was doing. And this guy still charges us different price than was discussed on the phone. Never will come back. He even didn't try to solve the problem or offer the price that was discussed. It was on 10860 W Charleston Blvd."}
{"text":"Last stop before leaving Vegas and enjoyed the best meal. Everything was expertly executed and reminded me of NY. Tried the calamari and had the everything pie, minus the olives. Perfect! Ended the visit with a delicious Tiramisu, which was amazing. Will definitely come again if I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Their weekend breakfast is a must have! Get the breakfast pizza and the Belly Buster, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ordered a small pizza and mozzarella sticks then was told it would be ready in 15-20 minutes. Showed up after 10 minutes and saw a pizza box on top of the oven but didn't think anything of it. Added a canoli to the order then proceeded to wait another 20 minutes before going to the register to ask what was taking so long. Turns out that pizza on top of the oven was ours, the cheese sticks were cold and they hadn't even started on the canoli. When I asked why we weren't no ti if I ed that our food was ready the register person proceeded to argue for another 5 minutes that it wasn't his fault. Really long story short, extremely disappointed in the customer service. Hopefully the food is alright..."}
{"text":"We were in search of a new place to try over the weekend and had heard good things about \"Rocco's\"...So we decided to stop in and grab some take out.  LET ME TELL YOU, the Pizza and garlic knots were SOOO GOOD!  The boy working the counter was polite and helpful, even suggested we try the knots, we were not disappointed!  I'd definitely come again! Happy customer & newest fan!! Thanks Rocco's!!"}
{"text":"Love Rocco's.  We have delivery at least every other week.  Our fav is the white pizza with chicken.  Everything is always fresh and staff always friendly.  They are always on time with delivery.  It's never \"it will be 45 min\" and then and Hr and 1/2 goes by and no pizza.  They say 45 min they are normally early."}
{"text":"False advertising!!! The pictures of the food on the menu they stuck in our door looked great.  Real NY style pizza and sandwiches-looks great, lets order.  Big mistake.  Nothing NY about any of this.  Hot sandwiches had stale TOASTED rye bread (was supposed to be marble rye-and what NY deli routinely toasts the bread on corned beef and pastrami sandwiches? ) and corned beef and pastrami were heated in a pan-yes a pan. Meat had no flavor either-couldn't have been that fresh. When we first tried them, my wife said meat tasted like  it had been heated in a pan and when I called to complain they confirmed that yes, we do heat the meat in a pan.   What NY deli (or any deli for that matter) have you ever been to that heated sandwich meat in a pan?  Thought at least their salad would be edible- was, sort of, if having fresh lettuce isn't essential to you. Did have a lot of feta on it, which is fine but not if it's intended to hide the lack of freshness of the lettuce. Seems like everything we ordered was stale and they attempted to hide this fact  any way the could.  At least the order was delivered in a timely fashion.  Mgr wouldn't give me a credit when I called to complain but did offer a store credit for the items I complained about but don't know that I would want to try anything there again."}
{"text":"Mehh....had two slices of pizza (one meat and the other veggie) and an order of garlic knots.  The pizza was nothing to write home about which was a little disappointing.  The garlic knots were pretty good. I won't be rushing back.  I'm sure there are other good pizza places out there."}
{"text":"The best in town!!!!! Try the new Rocco's on 6870 South Rainbow. loving it!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am from Brooklyn ny where there are pizza places on every corner and every single one is better then this.. I wasn't impressed... I am visiting my brother and was wanting to find a good pizza place..when seeing that Rocco's  is ny style I figured that the pizza couldn't be that bad but it was dry and not flavorful..I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas! Just like in NY. It's authentic ny pizza, they also have many sandwiches and such which I haven't tried because I always want the pizza. Their white pizza is unreal too."}
{"text":"Soggy crust, sloppy pizza, bland sauce 
Seems they're more worried about pumping out pizzas than quality. 
Also, we waited inside for 10 minutes for our pick-up order because the guy working there didn't realize out pizzas were already done and sitting on the counter."}
{"text":"Great strombolis!  Nice place to stop and get a slice as well.  Reasonably priced and great service.  The place is small, but offers a friendly atmosphere.  A family favorite,"}
{"text":"I ordered a large cheese pizza for pickup and it was done in about 15 minutes.
So far so good.
But when I walked in to pick it up you could tell there were a bunch of workers who didn't want to be there.
Ok, whatever...
So I got the pizza home and it wasn't horrible or anything, just was pretty tasteless.
For $14.00 they could have put some more cheese on it too.
I hate when pizza shops don't cover the pie.

I wanted to give this 3 stars but it just wasn't there."}
{"text":"I love the pizza. The guys are friendly. A bit chilly inside for my taste. Make sure to try the knots too."}
{"text":"Will never order from here again. After eat24 app messed up order, our delivery order turned into a pick up order 2 hours later, so we ended up with nasty cold dried out food. When we told them we ordered it delivery not pick up they said oh that happens all the time. If you know it happens all the time why did u let our order sit for two hours? Aside from being cold it was nasty and dried out."}
{"text":"I come here every week the people here are great. Everything is fresh they have great  prices. I love there lasagna  pizza."}
{"text":"This is my second time there and the first time was much more memorable than this latest venture.  Sauce seemed a bit off, can't put my finger on it, but it seemed too bland almost watery.  Maybe I'll go back, maybe I won't.   There are enough other so-so places around that aren't as far away."}
{"text":"I saw the open sign and walked in eagerly at 10:57 am. I am a pizza lover and our office is looking for a local place to order from once a month.
Lady refused to wait on me as they were not \"open\". Three minutes? Sign was illuminated... Really? 
Must be nice to be able to turn away business. Would have been strong account. As Julia said....\"Big Mistake...Huge...\""}
{"text":"I think I just stumbled on to something here....woopsie.  Right down the way from my work, my boss sent me over to pick up some sandwiches from Rocco's.  Not realizing what I was about to walk into I ordered philly sandwich.  As I pulled up I could already smell the Italian goodness I was about to embark.  Now I have driven by a million times and have read a few of the reviews that pop up but really I HAD NO IDEA what an amazing place this is!  

As I approached the counter I could not believe the selection in front of me....and I ordered a philly.  Silly me.  I love the \"by the slice\" idea so you can sample a couple different styles of pizza.  There was a great selection from pizza to garlic knots...down to the little dessert complimentary by the cashier.  I told the guy I will definitely be back to do some pizza since that is their thang and that is what everyone raves about.

Contrary to the other reviews the main guy was a sweetheart.  I think people just misunderstand the NY edge.  The place was vibrantly decorated-fresh and modern with a New York feel.  Outdoor seating is available but no one was sitting out there. The chairs and table looked metal - OUCH!  They sure are cute but I dont see myself sittin on those in the summer....this is Vegas boys. Lol 

Now for my Philly, first off their bread is baked fresh.  I ordered the regular which is the 6\" but really it looked more than a 10\".  It was huge.  The bread as I said was so good I could eat it alone....so fresh.  The meat with grilled onions was so flavorful.  You could actually taste that it was steak.  There was so much meat I could only eat half the sandwich.  The cheese I believe was american but didnt overpower the sandwich. Soo so yum.  I brought the second half to the BF at the end of the day and the sandwich was just as good warmed up-I know because I had to have another bite.  I have had the turkey/provelone before that someone ordered me and that sandwich was no joke either.  BTW my boss ordered the Staten Island and its his fav out of the sandwiches.  

I will be back and bring the fam...sit and actually enjoy the meal there (pizza for sure this time) and I will update my review but as of now two thumbs up for Rocco's philly steak sandwich, fresh bread and ingredients, ambiance, decor and service!!!  One big happy package!  Can't wait to get back there!"}
{"text":"Great NY pizza I love the sauce. Lasagna is good too. I pick up pizza here at least 2 to 3 times a month"}
{"text":"Two slices of cheese pizzas and a drink for $4.99+tax. It a great deal because the cheese pizza is awesome. Especially when they re- heat the pizza the crust magically gets tastier and crispier. Perfect cheese to sauce ratio. This is the only thing I have ever ordered from this place. If you find something good why not stick with it right?"}
{"text":"The garlic knots at this place are a work of art!!!  They are served in a bed of garlic butter, so good!!!!  The service is good as well, not to mention the pizza is always delicious and authentic thin crust type with yummy sauce. No go here for lunch a lot and they also have great lunch specials!  A+++"}
{"text":"This place is yummy! The garlic knots are amazing. Portions are huge! Always leave here with left overs. Strumboli has great flavor, the meat and veggies are pretty even in proportions (veggies didnt over power the meat), the dough was very evenly cooked. The alfredo \"the best I've ever had\" according to my niece. Philly had an ok flavor, need a little more spice. Clean, prompt and nice service. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"The friendliest place and the BEST food! We got the garlic parmesan knots and marinara sauce is insane. Also the dressing they use for the Caesar is so unique. Lastly, we got the Alfredo chicken pizza and almost just died over all the types of flavors. Don't forget the finishing touches with gelato. Order the sea salt caramel! We just moved to Vegas and this will be our spot for many years:) thank you Rocco's! Brandon is the cutest server ever"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Best pizza in Vegas and the fried Oreos were amazing.  Great service too, minimal wait during peak time on Saturday night.  Definitely going to become regulars here!"}
{"text":"Native New Yorkers, rejoice. This pizza joint will hold you over til your next trip back east. From perfectly baked pies (and they won't balk when you say it) to delicious pasta dishes, Rocco's knows what us east coasters love. 

The cheese pie consists of classic foldable slices and though the sauce to cheese ratio is a bit different every time, that just makes it more true to form since that's the case in NY too. They also offer fresh salads and a long list of pasta and chicken entrees. To go is just as delicious as eating in, but they do offer booth and table seating for those who just can't wait. The slice/soda lunch specials can't be beat and you can admire the NY decor as you dine. Service is fast and friendly but don't call too late, most days they close at 9pm. 

Resist the chain pizza invasion and stop by Rocco's for an authentic NY pizza joint experience. You'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Rocco's for about 3 years now. It's always good. I don't think I've had a bad slice yet. Their $4.99 lunch special (2 slices and soda) is perfect for me and my son when we want a quick lunch before heading to the park across the street."}
{"text":"I think their pizza is good! Compared to the corporate offerings I think Rocco's pizza is a better choice. Their sandwiches are ok and entrees the same. My wife loves the pistachio gelato !  They have a great selection of gelato and ice cream that you can't buy anywhere close. We eat here at least  2 times a month(takeout) . If you have not tried then you should! Military discount offered!"}
{"text":"Looking for great NY style pie this place is the best in Vegas. Great environment excellent service there entrees are great. Almost forgot make room dessert their deep fried Oreos are to die. Been going here for years and satisfied every time!"}
{"text":"So happy to report that there is finally delicious pizza in the neighborhood! (A lot of the other stuff nearby is outright inedible.) It's classic NY-style thin crust with fresh ingredients and the flavors are nicely balanced. The crust handles nicely--not doughy or chewy; it has a nice crisp. This is pizza that I will crave and am thankful it is close by! Looking forward to sampling the many other items on their menu."}
{"text":"I love this place ! There are a lot of options . The pizza is superb, the service is second to none. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I had in a long time. Great desserts. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I have to say it is one of the best places in town. I live in Henderson and drive to Rocco's at least once a month. I just wish they had one in Henderson - hint, hint, hint"}
{"text":"Customer service sucks! Sent my son in to pick up an order and he was overcharged. Sent him back in to at the very least get the receipt and they said no. Apparently getting a receipt for a kid is too much, not good business to be rude! You have lost our business and every summerlin family we know and meet will get an earfull. Big mistake,huge!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza, especially the Everything Pizza and Great Customer Service :) don't forget to order the Zeppolos!!!"}
{"text":"My 8 year old loves the pie he get's from this location.  He even wrote an essay that was posted in his classroom on the Witty Writers board.  His letter reads:

     \"There's no place in the world like Rocco's Pizza.  It makes me smile every time I see it.  When I see the pizza at Rocco's it looks amazing.  I smell the crunchy crust, and then I hear myself eating it.
    Next I feel it's greasy cheese, and finally I taste the yummy jalapenos.  As far as I can tell you, Rico's pizza is the place to be.\"

Thank you Rocco's for making a special kid smile.  He rates you 5 stars."}
{"text":"Those looking for a high quality and authentic NY style pizza can find it right here.  You want a fine dining experience with a wine selection?  Fuggedaboutit!  This place is about the PIE (or slices) man!

Want big discounts or coupons?  Stick with Pizza Hut or Dominos.  What to pay a few bucks more for great pizza crust that doesn't get in the way of delicious pizza sauce, fresh and authentic Italian ingredients?  This place is the BOMB!

Do yourself a favor.  The next time you want to do that occasional pizza night, pick up an ice cold pack of brew and a $15 pie at Rocco's!"}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to Yelp on a trip to Vegas and it did not disappoint!  The pizza was perfectly crispy and not over-sauced.  I also enjoyed the little fried pieces of dough with powdered sugar that were sitting on the counter -- yum."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with my boyfriend. We ordered 2 sodas and 2 pieces of pepperoni by the slice. The waiter (the tall one with the spikey hair that stands with his hand on his hip like he's bored and has better places to be) gave us a dirty look and said \"that's all?\" Yes that's all. So he walks away and we wait and we get our pizza and it's a pretty huge slice, like equivalent to probably 3 regular slices, which is awesome. It tastes pretty good, but I felt it was slightly bland and could use a little more flavor. There was hardly any sauce either. Overall the pizza was very enjoyable. But when the waiter came back with the check and my boyfriend commented on how good the food was, the waiter just stared at him and then walked away. So we decided not to come back because mediocre pizza isn't worth being treated like we weren't welcome. It was cheap though, the bill for the two sodas and slices was about $10. Still... Not coming back."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, but the shop is a little cramped, even for a pizza joint. The food is worth it tho!"}
{"text":"The food was exceptional and the service was on point. The Penne Vodka was the best I've had since moving from New York 10 years ago. It was flavorful, rich, a decent portion and affordable. Seriously, it was REALLY good. The pizza was tasty, with a flavorful crust. I have had slightly better in this area, but it was good and very reasonably priced. Unlike some competitors that want to charge almost $20 for a pizza (INSANE), Rocco's pizza was certainly worth the $12.99. The veal parmesan sandwich was also delicious and firm. I find that this kind of sandwich often comes pretty mushy from other places. The Eggplant and Red Pepper Stromboli was good too. Not as flavorful as the other items, but the dough was chewy and it was satisfying with the marinara sauce for dipping. We ordered late on a Friday night through Eat24, and the delivery time was pretty long. This was not a problem, because it was our fault for ordering so late. They were busy and the time was disclosed to us. A woman who worked for the restaurant (not sure if she was an owner or not) called right around the time that the app projected we would get our food to apologize for the late delivery. I thought this was wonderful customer service, considering that the food wasn't late. I mean, it was almost 10:00, but that's what time we were given. Very apologetic and courteous. She even threw in a complimentary tiramisu for our wait time. Totally unnecessary and it was DELICIOUS. I'm not a fan of tiramisu either. So, from the reviews I've read, and prior experience to be honest, sometimes the delivery has some snags but overall, this place is great."}
{"text":"Roccos is the best they are consistently good same with customer service. Love the food everything is good."}
{"text":"Great pizza. My friends and I go here a lot. Good pizza, good wings, good restaurant."}
{"text":"Not a great experience.  Ordered 2 pizzas, a antipasto salad and mozzarella sticks on an early Sunday evening.  Nothing too complicated, right?  The order arrived about an hour later, and the salad (that was my one item for dinner) wasn't there.  My husband called to let them know and they were very unapologetic and didn't really want to do anything about it.  He got them to begrudgingly send a replacement and all of the items that I had requested to be omitted on my GrubHub order were all there (things that I'm allergic to).  My husband called them back again and they didn't seem to think there was a problem and argued with him about the issue.  They submitted a refund request to GrubHub after about 20 minutes of back and forth.  The salad was decent, but nothing to write home about and our guests said that the pizza was just average, at best.  I won't be ordering from them ever again."}
{"text":"Roccos has the best pizza in Summerlin. It's the perfect thickness and the sauce is delicious! The staff is very nice and our pizza is always ready on time. We eat here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for pizza and friends! Love it and definitely going there with the whole family next time!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent best sausage I've ever tasted in my life.  the service humm thats another story.  The owner came by our table before we ordered and suggested a few things including a custom made Stromboli. Now my brother ordered one and he end up getting a vegetarian yet he ordered a custom meat lover I fortunately got what I ordered. I ordered also a side salad which  took over and a half an hour to recieve. From the looks of the waitresses. And owner face after 35 minutes it appeared that they had forgot our order. All and all it took 1 hour and 25 minutes to order and eat a Stromboli and salad
The best suggestion. Forget coming to eat because the Dittzy airhead waitresses might forget your order. Call in order to go. Much faster"}
{"text":"We love this place. We eat at the restaurant often and also have them deliver pizza and wings for every party and family gathering. My husband is from NY and says the pizza is authentic New York style, just like he grew up eating. My son loooooves the wings and my daughter's favorite is the lobster ravioli. Great friendly staff, too."}
{"text":"Local delicious pizza/ Italian restaurant. The staff is super friendly! The food is delicious! The atmosphere is great. I really recommend eating here. They definitely have gained new  regular customers."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Rocco's (Rainbow location) tonight for the first time, and I have to say my experience felt as though I stepped into an Italian eatery right in the middle of Italy. The atmosphere from the New York and Italian pictures hanging on the wall to the pizza oven right when you walked in, I felt as though I walked into an inviting Italian spot, one you would walk into from the cobblestone lined streets in Italy, or a true pizzeria right in the heart of New York's Little Italy. I thought the food was amazing and a lot of it - we all shared just as Italian families do. We had a Stromboli, cheese pizza (truly New York style), tortellini with meat sauce, chicken parmigiana, and salads large enough to share, not to mention the cannolis were delicious. The Italian flavor profiles were right on point, as well as the portion size of each. The service was more than I could have hoped for with caring, attentive and kind hospitality, just as you would receive from the welcoming families that own the restaurants in Italy. I am Italian and I love good authentic Italian food, which is hard to find outside of Italy, but I found it here at Rocco's - I will be returning here very soon, hungry for more!"}
{"text":"I was driving and had a craving for pizza but not just any ordinary pizza , I wanted a good tasty fresh New York style pie and a sign caught my eye \"Rocco's\" in Windmill area so I went in and was greeted by great & prompt service and a display of tons of choices of tasty looking pizzas, salads, etc.... omg I didn't know what to choose so I had a piece of the white pie which had fresh tomatoes & basil on it and mmmmmmm luv it ..... and then I had to have a dessert which I chose the cheesecake and it was so good that I asked to have them package up 6 more pieces for my family and I ordered a whole white pie just exactly as to what I had to take with me with a fresh salad and my kids and husband were very pleased and happy! To sum it up Roccos food is fresh , homemade and anybody can tell when u eat good Quality food! However the atmosphere was great and inviting and they have so many items to choose from and I will definitely be back over & over!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure when Rocco's replaced Eddie's at this location but I'm still surprised either would consider this location ideal.  Yes it's in a busy corridor on Rainbow but it's not the easiest shopping center to navigate.

As expected, only change to the restaurant is basically the name.  It's still a mom/pop Italian restaurant focused on pizza.  I went with the two slice special ( w/drink, $5; toppings $1 extra ) 

It's an OK slice - decent size, good crust, sauce is average, they too ( is this a trend ) cut the sausage in long slices, (almost look like it's peeled ) which I am not a fan of ( give me the bite size chunks )

I will return to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"so i'm off to my old bar to watch the ncaa championship, fla v. okla. i decide to bring some pizza's. i'm on the westside and remember rocco's on buffalo ( tried a sammie there once, decent ) so when i call info, they send me to rocco's in summerlin - the guy on the line convinces me to try them out - thick new york accent, major attitude , \" we have the best pizza in the valley ! \" okaaaay 

order a sausage and a peperoni ( only meat for the patrons of my old place ) 

strange location for a pizza place - they've got about 5 pies displayed for per slice orders ( notice later they have 5-6 pizzas stored below the counter - why ? ) 

nice enough place - got the italian/ny pics on the wall, yeah, never seen that before. 

included a free order of the little italian donut puffs ( damn it, my mom is looking down on me know for forgetting the name ! ) zeppole ?!?! 

get the pizza to the bar, the bar fly's start to swarm, i get a slice of each before the boxes are down to crumbs. 

pepperoni - ok - a little to much cheese combined with the peperoni grease makes for a floppy slice ! The sausage - very good !! 

i'm trying a place in henderson next week where the owners claim THEY have the best ny -style pizza in the valley - i'm looking forward to the comparison."}
{"text":"The only reason i didn't give 5 stars is the price. Rocco's is pricey for a pizza joint. That being said, they have an awesome Monday special, large cheese pizza for $8.99 ($1.50 for toppings) We get this a lot and wish it was cheaper then $8 for 5 chicken fingers, to make out meal complete. I love the environment, the staff, and the energy of the place. Lastly, being from the east coast, pizza in Vegas is a joke (aside from north end pizza) but Rocco's reminds me of home."}
{"text":"AMAZING! The cheese calzone is the BOMB.COM. The pizza is on point as well. But we can't pass up the calzone, get it every time. Prices are great!

Everyone is complaining about the service, we've never experienced this. And it's the SAME people every time we go. They are not rude, they just aren't kissing your ass. If you smile and are nice to them, they smile and are nice to you. It's called common courtesy. 

I also saw someone complain about $2 drinks and 10 min for a pizza. You pay $1.80 for a drink at a gas station and can't refill it and 10 min for a pizza is fast! If you waited less time for a pizza before, you ate it raw sweetheart.

We truly love this place and I recommend it to everyone. (haven't had the other locations, so I cannot speak for them)"}
{"text":"We ordered last weekend for delivery. Told 45 minutes and after over an hour and a half, it showed up. Kinda bummed because the pizza and burgers were just ok. Spent over $70 and honestly just wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has really changed! They used to have great food with a homemade flavor, now it taste processed and like any other food service menu and portions are smaller as well. Probably the worst meal I've had in a while and a couple hours after eating my youngest son ended up getting sick. So adding possible food poisoning onto a bad meal, it's a solid guarantee that we will never eat there again! 

Ohhh, and the delicious garlic knots, are now greasy tasteless balls of dough! No knots and no garlic! 

So sorry to see what was once a great takeout place become a failure!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and courteous staff !! Ordered and enjoyed some pizza and wings... I will order again and their prices are great as well"}
{"text":"Perfect New York style pizza. 
You can buy it by the slice or the whole pie.

Crust is crisp with just the right amount of softness. The cheese and sauce are light.

Employees are always friendly and working hard behind the counter. They always have a basket of fresh zeppoles next to the register. You can't help but pop a few in your mouth while you wait."}
{"text":"S. Rainbow location. 

Food is great. Customer service is not. Authentic NY pizzeria indeed! Rocco's is near my office, and last year I decided to give it a try. The folks that work there weren't rude, they just didn't show much appreciation that I decided to patronize their establishment. However, It's the food that has brought me back again and again. I should clarify. I am by no means an expert on their menu, but can vouch for the Stromboli. I have visited other pizza places around the valley and am disappointed every time that the Stromboli is not more like Rocco's. It may take a while to make and it's a bit pricey but it's worth it (call ahead to limit your wait). 

The facility has a family owned feel. The walls are lined with photos from New York as well as, what I assume to be, family photos from the owner. Order at the counter. Food is brought to your table on real plates, and metal utensils (rather than disposable paper/plastic). They have a television in the dining area that is always tuned to either news or sports. They have a self service soda fountain with limited options from Coca-Cola. The pizza and Stromboli are made in full view so watch if you like. 

I have visited Rocco's a dozen or so times since that first visit and it has become one of my favorite places to have lunch. I wasn't blown away by the service, but the food was good enough to get me to come back. By now I have become familiar enough with the staff that they know me. They greet me with a smile when I arrive and wish me well when I leave. The casual environment and good food make it a great break from the proverbial, \"rat race\". If you are considering Rocco's, I say, give them a shot. And If you had a bad experience, please give them another chance to get it right. I hope they do."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, probably better than most places in the area, but it's not 4 or 5 star pizza.  I have been here a few times and will be back again, mainly because it's convenient and better than most other choices in the area at this price point.  I think what holds it back from the next level is that I am a fan of sausage pizza and their sausage is not very flavorful and I always feel like there should be more cheese (even when I order extra cheese).

All that being said, they have a lot more on their menu than pizza and it does look very good.   I have ordered their Chicken Champagne in the past and thought it was very good.   I have also picked up a loaf of french bread before and it is about as good as would hope.  

Bottom line:  If you work or live in the area, it's worth checking out, you may even like it better than I did, but don't expect to have the best pizza you have ever eaten."}
{"text":"So good, ordered the special large pizza and wings for only $20.99. Ordered mushrooms and jalapeño poppers and both where really good."}
{"text":"First didn't know what and how to order but after the cashier helped me out it was phenomenal. They had some type of sweet breads that where off the chain! Great service and great food."}
{"text":"This review is only of this location. I have been to better locations.
My friend and I ordered a calzone, a slice of cheese pizza and Zeppoles (and a meatball sub to-go). The calzone which they make to order came out right away and she enjoyed it. Meanwhile, I waited another 10 minutes before my slice of plain cheese pizza was reheated and brought out to the table. I asked them to start my meatball sub later because I was taking it to-go. Unfortunately, it was ready well before the Zeppoles. Still not sure why, but the Zeppoles, which is just powdered sugar on small pieces of fried dough, took 40 minutes.
The Zeppoles were small and too chewy when I finally did get them. They were very different from the ones I've had from the Windmill location. Disappointing.
The environment seemed a little bit stressful because the cashier and a lady that appeared to be the manager we're not getting along. She was openly yelling at him behind the cash register for everybody to hear."}
{"text":"Seriously- so good.  We love their pizza, their antipasta salads, and my son and I LOVE the zeppoles.  The pizza is baked in an oven, and comes with a thin crispy crust, lots of cheese and the freshest of ingredients.  We have been coming here for over 10 years and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"I ordered the lobster stromboli and it was good, but that was not lobster in there. Tasted like the imitation crab stuff that is really a fish that tastes kind of like crab. I'm from Maine and grew up on lobster, and the meat inside was not lobster. I was dooped. I won't order that again. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Some of the best NY style I have period. Thin crispy dough holds up. No fold needed. 

Primo."}
{"text":"This manager rangel really cares about his customers and food quality!!  He took a personal interest in our table and experience and made sure that our visit was delightful!  in short a stellar experience and very yummy pizza and soft and wonderful garlic knots would highly recommend them to anyone anywhere the servers are always friendly thank you we will happily  return!!!!"}
{"text":"The closest I have found to real NY style pizza. This will be my go to spot when I visit Vegas. Helpful staff, clean store, awesome pizza. Love the patio so you can sit outside. Air conditioned if you want to sit inside."}
{"text":"If you're looking for pizza similar to authentic NY style flavor wise I believe this place will satisfy you. The crust is light, the sauce is tasty and the cheese pretty good. I like simple tasty flavors in a pizza and Rocco's delivers, also the XXL cheese for $18.99 can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Roccos is amazing.  Been coming to them over 15 years and they just expanded to my backyard off south rainbow.. Whether to go or dine in, whatever you get, be sure to have a hot slice while waiting"}
{"text":"A little over a year ago, this had been a favorite spot of ours, but suddenly,  the pizza seemed completely different, so we gave up on it.  Thought we'd try it again about a week ago, since it had been a while, and im glad we did.  The yummy pizza was back!  ( It might have been even a little cheaper than it used to be? )
     We ordered our food online, through Eat24, it was ready on time, and we even used PayPal.  Super easy, no problems with our order.  
Had an Xtra Large pepperoni pizza with Xtra cheese,  and we got the fried ravioli, fried mushrooms and zucchini.  Mushrooms and zucchini tasted like your regular 'fried bar food.'  (Nothing special, but it was exactly what we wanted at the time.) The fried ravioli was also very good. My kids loved it. 
       But we thought the pizza was outstanding.  Everyone seems to like their pizza a certain way, or a certain style.  It can be so different from one place to another, so I try and take all these 'pizza place' reviews in stride.
    But Rocco's pizza was definately back to the kind of pizza I prefer.  it was SO yummy!   Its what I describe as the 'big, cheesy, floppy kind.'   Where you can taste the garlic just a bit.  Thin crust,  and HUGE pieces you can fold over.  (My hubby prefers the thick crust, 'pan style pizzas.'   but I prefer less bread.  But he did still really like it.)   
       And the marinara sauce is the BEST.   
I forgot that Rocco's used to have this amazing marinara, and thankfully, its still as good.   We'll get even more next time to dip our pizza in!   
      (And i'm guessing the pizza you get with the 'all you can eat' lunch special is different than the pizza you actually order.  I've never had the lunch special, but it looks different from their 'real pizza' in the pictures i've seen.   I imagine a lot of people would complain about not getting the same quality pizza, but it makes sense to me.   
     So if you gave up on Rocco's, and it's been a while, you might wanna give it a try one more time.  And get some marinara!"}
{"text":"It's the best pizza in vegas!! Love the sweet little donuts at the cashier...great place great food!"}
{"text":"I called in a lunch order to go. The service was nice and fast. 
Lunch order was ready in 15 mins. as stated. 
I order Chicken Valsostano. The chicken was great, the sauce it was made in had 
great flavor and the cheese and mushrooms were a great addition.
The pasta was a little disappointing, the sauce was on the acidy side. 
I will come back and try other menu items. 
It is nice to have all these new places in the area close to my office."}
{"text":"Great people, great service, shitty taste in teams! But the pizza is good regardless."}
{"text":"I am from Brooklyn so know a little bit about pizza....pizza here is good...passes the test

3 stars because heros just OK and salads absolutely terrible...stick to the pizza"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian guy ;) Soccer fan and amazing Pizzaiolo !!! Little Italy of Sin City..."}
{"text":"I'm not usually one of the posters saying \"I don't get the reviews here...\" but I don't get the high marks here.  We ordered the lasagne and the spaghetti and maybe that's where we went wrong, but we had to feed a variety of taste buds and those choices seemed to be the best match for everyone.  It was middle of the road pasta that no one had much to say about.  Though I did post my photos on Facebook and my friend remarked \"That does *not* look good.\"  Perhaps it's merely suffering by its competition.  My brother mourned the loss of Ciao Ciao pizza each and every time he visited LV.  For me, Cugino's remains the most poignant Italian in Vegas."}
{"text":"The cheese pizza and garlic knots with marinara sauce is amazing! Why haven't I visited this place sooner! They have a pretty good selection of Italian dishes and would love to try them one day after I drop 15 pounds lol

They have lunch deals for 4.99 and Monday's they have the large pizza special for 9.99. 

If you haven't tried them, what are you waiting for!"}
{"text":"3 years ago I left my review.  We've been loyal customers for longer.  Something has changed over the last year and I don't know where to begin.  The pizza once reminded me of Home.  Long Island!  I was so happy to have found this place and it has served our family well for many years.  I don't know if they switched recipes or if they've just gotten sloppy.  The pizza used to be a perfect balance of cheese, sauce and the most delicious crispy crust.  Over the last year, we have received the soggier, greasiest goo.  Can't complain about delivery or anything missing from our orders, just a gripe about the quality of food and ingredients.  We will miss you, Rocco's!  On to find the next best thing in the Pizza realm"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this pizza place! I was born in NY, But I am more Vegas I suppose, because I moved here when I was 7, BUT my whole family is from NY and most of them still live there. I have been back many times to visit, so I have had the real thing. I have tried a lot of NY pizza places here in Vegas, and some of my family might disagree (there is a NY pizza place they are committed to) but so far this is the winner for me.

The pizza is amazing and just like NY should be. Fresh and delicious. They have the best chicken fingers out of any other place I have been to. I just love them. I have also had the chicken Caesar salad and was very pleased with that as well. Thank God this place is near the house, because unfortunately, they don't' deliver. Couldn't ask for better NY style pizza."}
{"text":"Some of the best original tasting New York style pizza you'll find in Las Vegas. I personally prefer the meat calzone, and my husband prefers just the plain pie. Of course, we always have to get birch beer when we go, or just wouldn't be like New York.
The staff definitely has a New York 'hard edge' to their service, mannerisms, but hey, I figure that adds to the experience that so similar to New York and New Jersey!"}
{"text":"Like buying a slice on any street in New York, and Rocco's has great canolli to boot...Calzone's good as well. Can't as for more. For me, finding good pizza anywhere outside of New York City is a plus."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA IN LAS VEGAS!! Amazing service and great environment. When you come in ask for melanie, she's great!"}
{"text":"I love their location at The Trails.  Always great pizza, and take home dinners.  I order them \"cold\" which allows me to heat the item at home for about 15 minutes in the oven.  Nice melted cheese that way, and hot out of the oven!

But - from Rainbow, the \"take home\" Chicken Parmesan Dinner  was simply awful. The breaded chicken was absolutely rock hard.  In fairness I did have to explain what I wanted, using the exact lingo that Sam/Trails had always used for my order.

I will not be back to Rainbow - but when in Summerlin will visit Rocco's at The Trails!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would.  Both location will go out of business as it is run by dishonest and unethical people.  Would not trust how they get their supplies or what they do to the food.  Stay away.  Go to Grimaldi's, Pizza Rock, or Custom Built pizza."}
{"text":"Filthy dirty place. First customer of the day I went to restroom and was horrified. Imagine what the kitchen is like when the bathroom is filthy. Lazy employees standing around."}
{"text":"We were walking back to our car from another restaurant when we saw their sign for zeppoles. We wanted dessert so we walked in. We ended up buying an order of their garlic knots and a bag of zeppoles. Both were delicious. The garlic knots were super garlicky and good. The zeppoles were warm, fluffy and sugary. We will be back to try their entrees when we are in Summerlin again"}
{"text":"Awesome New York style pizza. Had fried raviolis filled with ricotta cheese, eggplant grinder and a large cheese pizza. Staff has a great east coast friendly attitude and don't forget to pick up a black and white."}
{"text":"Being from NY this is my favorite place to go for pizza in Vegas. This location is better than the other Roccos. The decor is home and they have daily NY papers to catch up on all the sports news."}
{"text":"Had the chicken parm sandwich. Awesome to say the least, nice crust on the bread and plenty of chicken and cheese in the middle. Originally from NY this made me feel like i was back home"}
{"text":"Not a real pie. The crust is subpar and flaky. Sauce is bland. If you're from New York, this is not a real pizza shop. Comparable to Chuck E. Cheeses."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a couple slices for lunch today. They have a $4.99 combo for 2 slices of cheese and a drink, $5.99 2 slices of peperoni and a drink, and $6.99 for 2 slices of combo and a drink. 

Today the combo had mushroom, sausage, and pepperoni. I had a drink with me so I asked if I could get the combo without the drink. The cashier gave me $1 off. The pizza could have been heated another minute longer, but it was still good.

They recently started a AYCE for $6.99, which includes pizza, salad, and pasta. I will probably come back for that when I am on a mission to get my Fatty McFatfat on!!

The staff was friendly and we even had a conversation about various AYCE sushi spots around town!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I are self proclaimed cheese pizza...ummm...cheese pizza pros???
I'll just state it that way.
When I finally \"clued in\" (after Rocco's had been open for about three months) and told him about a new pizza challenge he jumped out of his chair and grabbed his keys \"LETS GO\"! So we drove right down the street to :) Rocco's!!! 
We started off with an order of six garlic knots, they were yummy, they are baked and light on the garlic. Not bad! We have had some that were fried or something before, those are ick. These are baked and we are garlic crazy, maybe next time I will say HEAVY on the garlic ;)
We ordered a Caesar salad and it was very good. Not too much dressing and the dressing was not thick or too fishy. It had a nice acid of lemon yum.
We both ordered bottles of water which I later noticed you can order fountain or tap also.
And then *music* the pie!!!! 
Yum! I will have to say its darn near close to perfection.
Our cheese pizza pie was cooked to perfection. Crispy edged, soft middle, thin NY style, light on the sauce, light on the cheese, light on the spices...just like I have had in Brooklyn! Actually it was Manhattan... :) *hides*
The owners??? were super duper nice and def from NY :) You feel welcome and just like part of the family after speaking to them. They asked our name and if we had been to a Rocco's here. 
Nope. 
But I GUARANTEE!!!! We will be back :) 
I need to get a deli sandwich, a cannoli, some cookies, a pasta entree.........lets see.........
Oh and they have JOEY'S BLACK AND WHITE COOKIES!!! I can't believe I left without one!"}
{"text":"It's been challenging to find a good slice of NY style pizza in Las Vegas. Being from the Mid-Atlantic, I'll admit, I am a pizza snob! I was pleasantly surprised at Rocco's and would definitely return to enjoy some slices. Closest to the real deal NY style pie, however my NY style pizza quest still continues in Las Vegas! #nypizzaquest"}
{"text":"I went in with no expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised. Not the best pizza in town but very good for the price. Any place with fried oreos on the menu is alright by me."}
{"text":"Came here for a last minute meal before my appointment over at massage envy next door. AMAZING, quick, quality service. If you love meat, get the Brooklyn Sandwich. Love this place & will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Best pizza and zeppoli's in town. I have been eating at Rocco's for 10 years now, and ever since they opened this one closer to my house I have loved this location.

Sam is one of the main guys there and he always gets me the best deals of the day. He knows my favorite is two slices of their special white pizza. All their toppings are fresh food and (like i said) you cant beat their NY style pizza"}
{"text":"Pretty good representation of NY Pizza.  Dough was thin/medium and cooked.  Toppings were a little skimpy, but overall pretty solid."}
{"text":"After a full day of moving we dropped by Roccos for a quick piece of pepperoni pizza.  Not knowing they closed at 9, we were greeted by the owner himself.  Even being closed down for the evening he offered to get us some PIZZA!  What a lifesaver and he was so cool about it! Warmed us up some pizza and gave us two extra pieces!  Thank you Roccos...STILL my favorite pizza in Summerlin!"}
{"text":"Our experiences here are amazing. About 3 weeks ago we went in to buy a calzone and decided to get a slice of pizza while we wait and the guy at the cash register gave us free drinks and was really nice. About a week ago we decided to dine in and our waitress was so sweet and really attentive to us. We had ordered an extra slice of pizza that we later decided we ordered to much food and she said she can box it up for us at no extra charge. The food is so good like everything. We asked to speak to the manager to compliment out waitress because she really is the best."}
{"text":"Rocco's pizza rocks. The place is a little tight, but Sean and his team did a great job making my family feel like we were at home. Everyone was very friendly and went out of the way to make sure we eat good, especially the Zeppoles they are amazing."}
{"text":"I have had the most amazing hand tossed pizza's from New York and Connecticut. Rocco's pizzeria is not on that level. It is just a great local pizza for a great to-go price.

It was Friday movie night at home with my guy. The pizza really hit the spot while curled up on a sofa near the television. 

The customer service was awesome. The store is clean. I would come again if I was in a hurry and wanted to bring home a pizza."}
{"text":"My son loves this pizza place in summerlin. It's the New York pizza in summerlin! It's delicious and staff are nice. This place gets really busy, line for pick up gets long."}
{"text":"This place has the best delicious pizza in town.  They're so courteous and welcoming as soon as you walk in the door.  Specially the white guy cashier.    He even remember what I ordered last time.  Guys, do come here at least once and you\"ll definitely keep coming here."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Las Vegas hands down! :) 
Closest thing to New York pizza!
All the pizzas that I have tried have been great! The calzones are also good... If you are a cannoli fan their cannolis are delicious and worth the trip on their own. 
I highly recommend this place. Quick service and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This I my go to location when I fly in from Seattle on my way to my parents. Their white pie is amazing. The crust is so crisp and flavors meld so well. They have wonderful salads and incredible pasta dishes. Their cannoli are mouth watering and the powdered sugar dough bites to sample really get ur tastebuds going."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza place..first time my kids ever had a real New York slice of pizza and the wing are humongous...Will differently come back again."}
{"text":"Another great experience at Rocco\"c.  Take out order of chicken fingers and Stromboli. Awesome food and excellent service."}
{"text":"As usual excellent and friendly service along with great NY pizza.  I am originally from the East Coast and this place is awesome.  Always order from them.  Go check them out."}
{"text":"This is one of the best New York style pizza I ever had and the guys are very nice. I definitely will come back to this place."}
{"text":"Great place to take the family, owner is great and cares about his clients. Try the sandwiches, better than any other place in town."}
{"text":"I've never been to New York but my husband is a true New Yorker  from Brooklyn and everytime I come to Visit the family here in Las Vegas  and my  husband we always hit this spot because it is so good and I dont know New York pie but he does and my trip is never complete until I hit this pizzeria before I leave town !
George has been there for a while and he always greets me like family, and my family comes here at least 3 times a month

{"text":"I was Headed to work and we decided to try out Rocco's when we first entered and was not greeted I had second thoughts of eating here, granted the guy taking orders was on the phone, but there was two other employees who didn't even acknowledge we were there and the guy on the phone didn't say we will be right with ya nothing. Once he was off the phone he did greet us and took our order. The food was served fresh and in a reasonable amount of time. I don't know what we liked more the Queen sand which which had fresh cheese, meat and veggies the bread was fresh and had a nice consistency to it. The Stromboli was piled high with meat and the flavors were perfect. The customer service improved as we were checked on and thanked for visiting. We will be sure to visit this place again! The food and the price are spot on and they are generous with their portions!"}
{"text":"I've lived in NY for 8 years before moving to Vegas. This was my first visit to Rocco's with a group of 3. We were hungry and wanted pizza. We were hesitant to walk in because they were closing in 30 minutes. I have always have awful experiences prior to closing due to the lack of quality of food they end up serving me. They all just want to go home after a hard day of work, but it should not have an impact what they serve their customers.

However, this was not so with Rocco's! They weren't rushing us to order and was very patient not to mop the floor while we were still eating. When our food came out, the zeppoles and the pizza were piping hot! The mini zeppoles were addicting and I've never have them that small! The pizza was not greasy and the crust was not burnt. The white pizza was cooked to perfection with pepperoni and sausage. I would ask to put garlic on it and it will taste even more heavenly! I loved every single bite of it, as I enjoyed my \"cheat day\" on my low carb diet!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the pizza! Darn good and you can buy by the slice to mix it up."}
{"text":"Best best best!!!  Everything a former NY Gal could ask for!!  The heroes are awesome. The pizza is awesome. The canolis and zeppolis are to die for!!! If you are looking for authentic and I mean authentic NY Italian, this is it!!"}
{"text":"best New York pizza in Summerlin and p.o pasta dishes look yummy too!  very friendly staff! please come to LA!"}
{"text":"Love their NY thin style pizza. Their managers are awesome and super friendly. They have specials and are definitely worth checking out. Their dessert dough ball things are amazing!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. I did not know Upper Crust Pizza went away.

I wanted the chicken fingers, but they did not come with french fries. Fries separately are an extra $3.00. Not that I am a cheapskate, but not trying to pay $15.00 or more on lunch.

So, I ordered the student special - 2 cheese pizza slices and a drink for $4.50 as the sign says. I paid $5.95. I didn't argue, but I feel that was a dollar too much?

Anyway, I am a native Long Islander. I can make pizza. I was not very impressed with the cheese pizza. It was okay...nothing that will win award, but it was not inedible. I have had better pizza at the Red Rock Station buffet. 

Will I go back? If someone else is buying & this is their choice, I will eat there. It would not be a place I myself would say \"Hey family - let's go to Rocco's\".

IMO, the best 5 pizza places still in existence in Vegas are: Red Rock Pizza, Napoli's Pizza, Mark Rich's, Broadway Pizza, & Metro Pizza."}
{"text":"I've had better and I've had worse. I got two slices that were okay at best. If you're looking for true NY style pizza, I'd recommend checking out Verrazzano near the corner of Rainbow and Charleston. Also, beware of Rocco's bottled water. I got excited by the label when it said \"NY Water\". I figured it would be a good sign for the quality of their food because it must mean their ingredients come from NY. Then I read the fine print on the bottled water and it read \"water source not from NY\"."}
{"text":"Pizza usually delivered piping hot to us and delicious, but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. Guy who answered the phone said he sent it out right away. We live less than 3 miles away and it took almost an hour to get it. We've been patrons for years in Summerlin and recently at Rainbow. But they just lost a customer for life with his attitude toward me on the phone!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I come here a couple times a week for their lunch special.  $5.35 for two huge slices of cheese and a beverage. Hand down the best pizza in Vegas and their staff is great!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, just a little too greasy. We ordered 6 garlic knots and they were literally swimming in a pool of butter. I also ordered a salad that was 6 bucks, very small and definitely not worth the money.
The main reason I am only giving 3 stars is for the service/or lack there of. Like many other people said, the guys working there are very rude and give off a really bad vibe. I was not feeling the love at all!"}
{"text":"Great food. If you can't eat a child whole I would not recommend getting anything large from there it's massive, but tastes amazing. The subs both hot and cold are great. My personal favorites are the Italian and the Chicken Parmesan they have a taste and smell that just gets you nose and tongue in a frenzy. The staff is great too they are always really nice, not sure why they have a card that reads \"If you have any complaints or concerns\". The reason I give it four stars is this its small and sometime there is no place to sit but other than that a great place to be."}
{"text":"5 stars not just for the food but the service as well. The wild white Pizza is the most unique pizza I have ever had (and I thought I had them all) the garlic sauce gave the pizza a typical Italian taste but the buffalo chicken and mozzarella as toppings gave the pizza a savory taste. I must say the menu is intimidating because everything looks good. Save room for a cannoli or some gelato. I used to rave about Chicago style near my house but I'll make the drive to get New York Style!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst service. Called as a new visitor in town and the guy answering the phone almost hung up on me he was so frustrated I had asked if they did delivery. For a weeknight this shouldn't be anything that should upset the business to where they get worked up if a customer asks if a pizza place delivers. For those wondering, NO they don't deliver and NO you shouldn't order from this place unless you like to feel guilty for asking an innocent question.  SMH WTF?!"}
{"text":"I called to put my order in 7:50pm and the young lady that took my order told me 45 minutes i call about 50 minutes later and asking how much longer The young man that answered says it left 12 minutes ago he has one more order ahead of you but he should be there shortly i told him I'll wait a few more minutes if he does not get here I'm just going to have to cancel my order it is now 9:30pm I just received my food all cold I was very disappointed with the service although the food does have smell good I bet  it taste very delicious If was  warm super disappointed"}
{"text":"I admit it... I dream about pizza.  Warm, cheesy, folded in half on a paper plate, dripping with orange oil.  I love NY pizza and this little place has the best I've had in LV.  When I want my 10-year old stepson to clean his room, I offer him pizza at Rocco's, and sure enough, the room is clean. The slices are so big, I can usually just order 1 and be content.   I enjoy & can appreciate the authenticity of Settebello in Henderson, but this is NY pizza at its purest."}
{"text":"Rocco's reminds me of good old fashioned New York pizza. The sauce is delicious (good water) rice balls, excellent! Garlic knots, excellent! All very good... We eat there at least once a week. The only downside is they are a little high priced but, you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"I used to go and order 2 large pizzas weekly. I should have rated then as it would have been 5 stars. It was always crowded. However, in the last few times it has been aweful. The people are still nice and it is less crowded, but the food stinks. We spent $43 on the 2 large pizzas n powder doughnuts. However, it had been thrown in the box causing the toppings and cheese to slide all to one side and my additional ham was not added. I figured maybe it was a fluke so we ordered last night and there was chunks of garlic and the doughnuts were not fresh...taste a day old. I guess we will switch to our other pizza place. The Charleston location is still yummy."}
{"text":"Great Pizza! My son found this place! Pizza is the best New York style pizza in Vegas! They actually heard about it from friends from the east so they looked it up! He said that compared to all the places in Utah and the pizza they tried in Vegas this places reminds them of the pizza back home in PA. That says a lot because he hates the pizzas in the west! While at Rocco's who had a Cheese pizza & A loaded pizza ! Both were excellent and like a few of my favorites here in Central PA I can truly say they would give even my favorite place a run for the money! So if your in Vegas and miss your hometown pizza try Rocco's for that East Coast flavor!"}
{"text":"I really like the pizza here. Thin crust isn't usually something I get happy over since I like a thicker crust. The pizza here is thin and it holds the toppings well. The flavor was really good. I ordered extra cheese and sometimes can make the pizza soggy or hard to eat but not here. I have to be honest though I tried the garlic knots a couple of times thinking maybe the first time they were having a off day but they just were not good to me. They were kind of tough and overcooked. I had no room to eat a cannoli after my meal so I bought a couple to go for later on. They were pretty good. If you are in the area for lunch they have some good lunch specials. I think the cost is good for what you get here at roccos."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

Tried this place for dinner and I was ready to not like it. I wasn't crazy about the pizza joint that was previously here and I typically don't like super thin crust type pizza. my wife told me they have a special on Mondays where you can get a large cheese pizza for around $10 so we ordered one. Inside was busy with customers and there were plenty of staff on hand to get everybody taken care of. The only downside is that they only have about 5 tables inside and since they were filled with customers eating side it left us customers waiting for take out orders huddled together which was awkward. The inside is narrow so there isn't much space when it's busy. 

I ended up liking the pizza. It was thin, not too greasy, and had the right amount of cheese and sauce. I can't say I'd pay the regular $12.99 cost for it however with a coupon or a promotion like we got this time it's a good deal. I came back a couple days later for lunch and picked up a couple slices of cheese and a drink for around $6 including tax. The pizza was hot and just as good as a couple days before. The only thing I don't get is why it doesn't come in a take out box? The 2 slices were on a thin paper plate inside a brown paper bag. I wasn't just getting lunch for myself but my wife too and trying to carry it all out plus 2 sodas was effing ridiculous. I like the specials they have and look forward to trying some of the other menu items however if it doesn't come in a proper take out box it might make me not want to come back as often since I wont want to risk dropping all the food trying to carry it to the car."}
{"text":"One of my favorite New York style pizzas in Las Vegas for sure. I've dined in a few times and every time the pizza was fresh and hot and the price is good too"}
{"text":"Went in to this place to get a gelato. It tasted like it had sat in a freezer uncovered and had taken on the taste of the freezer. Disappointing because if it had been properly stored it probably would have been delicious."}
{"text":"i am from NY and will not eat pizza out here.  when rocco's opened in Aliante I gave it a try.  i have been back every other week since.  great pizza!!  sure there are times it isn't perfect.  it could be due to a new cook or something.  but overall, the pizza is great and I will continue to go back."}
{"text":"The food was somewhat disappointing.  Had tortellini Alfredo.  

My biggest concern was the restaurant smell!  Smelled like sewer!  I smelled it stronger coming out of the restaurant when we were done.  Coming out of the sidewalk covers, but the smell permeates into the restaurant as the doors are opened.  I'm sure it's a landlord responsibility, but this will be detrimental to the business if not resolved quickly!"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular customer. The pizza was great and nice people. I think they have switched owners bc the past few times I have gone in, the people working there have been soo rude and the pizza does not taste the same. The lady at the register is very rude. I ordered 4 slices of cheese for pick up, which they hadn't started when I came in, and there was no one else in there. Then I saw the owner grab from under the counter from a bucket, there were a bunch of old slices and he threw them into the oven. When he handed me the to go box, I opened it up to add seasoning and you could tell they were from 4 different pizzas. The slice on the buttom had a hole in it, the manager was watching me look at it and he came up to me and said \" you know you can just ask for a new slice\" Ummmm if you know this is a bad slice why are you serving it to me to begin with! I will not be back here again, which makes me sad bc it used to be such a great place!"}
{"text":"I placed an order at 6 pm (around the time I got home). I waited until 8 pm (hadn't realized the time had gone by) and called them up. My order wasn't even in the system! I tried them once, but-Never again! Calling the manager didn't help. She offered to credit me, but said she could not refund the charges."}
{"text":"This is my first review on yelp this is the best pizza I've had in a long time not only did I not spend a lot of money but the 2 slice deal I bought were hugh and very tasty."}
{"text":"Literally waited 2 hours for a large pizza and calamari. Pizza that arrived was a small and NO calamari. Called them and they said they could give me a credit. YEA RIGHT! Like I would ever order from here again. Then she tells me \"thats the best I can do!\". To anyone thinking of placing an order for delivery or pickup PLEASE save your money and order from a place that genuinely cares about providing good customer service.

P.S. I'm from Jersey and this location's pizza is a far cry from NY pizza"}
{"text":"Been here before and usually the pizza is yummy but, today it was just mediocre. The cheese slices are actually cooked earlier in the day and if you want a toping, it's thrown on and goes into the oven to be warmed up. I get it it's lunch time and they can be busy. But, not a good idea."}
{"text":"The best pizza and chicken fingers. Definitely cannot wait to go back and try more things on their menu. Such a friendly staff and prices are very inexpensive. Love the homey feel the place has! Love it love it."}
{"text":"This place was so cozy. Loved the atmosphere. The food was delicious and they were very generous with the servings. Ordered pizza, fries, and calamari. Orders were hot, fresh, and brought to us. They cleaned up right away and thanked us. Such a great place. I would definitely go again and take more dates. Friendly service."}
{"text":"My mom and I just moved to Las Vegas and Rocco's is definitely going to be the go to place! The manager, Ryan was so nice and made us feel right at home! The service and food was amazing! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. We come here at least twice a month, and the Pizza is wonderful. The staff treats you like family. Great place to bring kids! We love Rocco's!"}
{"text":"Roccos delivers easily, the best pizza I've had in years! It's a small New York style pizza joint where you can watch the process of pizza construction take place before your very eyes. 
In addition to stellar pizza with high-quality ingredients, there are also many entrées to choose from. 
Chicken Parmesan and chicken piccata are two of my favorites. Very large portions, great thoughts, and homemade garlic knots to boot!"}
{"text":"So to start I had the absolute highest hopes for this place and couldn't wait to try it. 
Called in an order, guy on the phone said it'll be ready in 20ish minutes.. I got there at 22minutes.. There was a line LITERALLY out the door. I was like oh shit this is the place to be woohoo! 
So I asked the guy in front of me if there was a specific place for pick up and he said no.. All one line. 
So 25mins after arriving (47 mins after ordering) and no welcome or apology for the wait I got to the front paid for myfood which was sitting on top of the oven. Get it home and it's cold.. But not the good kind of cold. And the knots were SOOOOO greasy.
If this is what NY pizza is, count me out!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to frequent.  The food and staff are awesome.  Ryan is phenomenal.  Keep it up!  If you find yourself hungry and it's breakfast time, try their breakfast pizza, it does not disappoint."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place.... it's the closest thing to being home to NY. The customer service was good too, it was a little of a wait for our order so they threw in a free salad or wings..Pizza is bomb and the size and prices of it.... even better. BEST PIZZA IN VEGAS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Real New York atmosphere, crew, and of course da pizza !!!

This little Italian Pizza place makes great NY style pizza. Great service, food, and price!!
Definitely a winner !!!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza place in town  If Rocco isn't in the store run the other way.  Very inconsistent! Pizza will be burned one day and the next the crust will be under cooked and soupy,  Worth ZERO stars."}
{"text":"Sooooooo done with this place! The dine in service is hit or miss. Mostly miss. The food is usually good, but overpriced. Don't waste your time. Please note: this used to be one of our favorite places. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day and ordered the $5.99 2 slices of cheese and a drink. Also ordered a side of garlic knots that I read in the reviews were tasty. The pizza is definitely a huge portion for the price. But you get what you pay for and it tasted okay but i wouldn't say delicious.  The knots were a doughy and not a whole lot of garlic. I wouldn't come back here for the pizza but I'll give this place another try down the road and order something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Best Pizza Place in Vegas !! Pizza is amazing feels like I'm in NY , owners are the most nicest people ever! I love the environment it's a real ma and pop shop! Definitely recommend this place !!! Better than dominos and Pizza Hut ! Rocco's thank you for amazing service"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? Pizza is undercooked, overload on the flour. Every single slice the cheese slid completely off, pizza wasnt even cut correctl!!!!!!, all for $35 dollars. No thanks. Last time I come here, used to be a good pizza spot."}
{"text":"This pizza isn't bad, a little greasy but that's the price of being tasty I guess. Haven't tried the pasta yet but I will have to try this place again when it's not near the closing hour, prices are competitive too."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Rocco's!  I'm lucky to have them right between my home and work and I order delivery all the time!  Everyone in the restaurant is great and attentive and the daytime delivery driver always seems happy to bring my order.  I have had the pizza, the club sandwich, fettuccini Alfredo, and the bacon wrapped hotdog and they have all been delicious!  My very favorite thing on the menu is the Zeppoles...do NOT miss them!"}
{"text":"After a long day of hiking in red rock canyon I found this little gem of a place on yelp. We ordered a large pizza and antipasti salad, food came out quick and was delicious. Guys behind the counter were very attentive, checked on us multiple times to make sure we had everything we needed"}
{"text":"Really good pizza!! The crust is amazing!! I highly recommend this place. Also really nice people working there."}
{"text":"They have the best ever ceasar salad!!! I don't know what they put in their dressing but they have ruined me for any other ceasar salad :) besides the food being absolutely delicious.....their service is amazing & they treat u like family. Love love love this place"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever and will blast them to every friend and family member we have in the Summerlin area. They have taken no responsibility for their actions and after going here multiple times a week we will not be returning. After waiting for over 2 hours for delivery with 2 tired and starving children I was told it was not their fault they did not deliver in the estimated time frame of 30-45 min. When I finally talked to the \"manager\" after calling over 5 times and being placed on hold, I was told it was not their fault and was actually hung up on. I was told the owner would contact me tomorrow however with this type of rude customer service I am not expecting any follow through. I will continue to call back until I get resolution to this horrible horrible customer service. Do NOT ever go here!!!!!! EVER."}
{"text":"That's not how it happened he knew anyway just pls credit my credit card 

Thanks 
Ordered pizza salad and fingers via grub hub
I didn't get my salad I asked for a credit he told me no credit I had to return food I said I want the dry pizza and cold fingers but didn't get salad and don't want another one delivered to me as I want to eat it with my pizza just credit me he said no and told me his pizza isn't dry and don't ever call there again ! REALLY what a jerk 
Plenty of pizza places around I don't need you ROCCOS AND NEITHER DOES ANYONE ELSE READING THIS
IF THIS IS AN OWNER SHAME ON HIM ID THIS IS A MANAGER GET A NEW JOB !"}
{"text":"Their pizza may be great, and the service here is better than their Rainbow location, but their wings suck. 

Good price for 10 wings at $8, available in medium or hot. Except they're dry- both in terms of the sauce, and the meat itself. Also a downside: they only offer packets of ranch for dipping. Unable to tell if wings were made fresh, just know that I was disappointed with the quality of what I received.

Pizza slices are fine here, and their rice balls are a treat. Small tables for dining outside, inside dining available further back in the building. Steer clear of the non-pizza options and you're good."}
{"text":"This place is really good. My go to place for lasagna and meatballs. Pizza is good too! Big slices."}
{"text":"Better to come in person if you want to carry out because they will forget that you placed an order over the phone.  Came to pick up my order, only to be told that they forgot to make the food.  And say, oh don't worry, it'll only take 3 minutes to make your food.  Really? Never heard of a pizza being done in 3 minutes.  Come here if you like dealing with incompetent staff."}
{"text":"I normally come here at least once a month and have never been disappointed.  The Brooklyn specialty pizza is my favorite.  I also like the garlic knots.  They have a great happy hour special where any pizza of 50% off Mon - Thu (dine in only).  It used to be available for carry out also but they just changed it to dine in only."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times with and without my daughter. The staff is always friendly and one time a few weeks ago when we were dining right before closing and I got a free slice of cheese! So nice!  The pizza itself is amazingly delicious."}
{"text":"Have never ventured away from their pizza until tonight. Let it be known I think Rocco's has the BEST pizza in Vegas. Hands down! Tonight I thought I'd try something different and was in the mood for chicken piccata. Not gunna lie I was a little disappointed... The chicken was extremely soggy but the sauce was pretty good. Not even close to the best chicken piccata I've had. Definitely won't be getting that dish from here again. Also got the antipasto salad which was very, very fresh and the dressing was super tangy! All in all, at the very least I will ALWAYS come back here for pizza and salad and might give a different entree a try next time."}
{"text":"I've only experienced their delivery service but every time I place an order is delivered very quickly my orders always correct very satisfied with the  Quality It may just be me but I only like the pizza with everything Very satisfied customer"}
{"text":"Stopped for something simple that really is fairly common for any Italian place like this to have. After having to explain what I wanted three times, the kid who seemed to be running the place developed a serious attitude problem and became antagonistic. Meh, first and last visit."}
{"text":"Rocco's on Rainbow and the 215 have delicious pizza. It's New York style and the ingredients are fresh. Stick to the pizza. Their calimari, pastas and sandwiches are not great. The only think I will order from them is their pizza and garlic knots. I would have given this review 4 stars but the manager is extremely rude. He does not care about the customers and if a mistake is made on the order he gets defensive. He seems very unhappy whenever I come in. He needs to learn customer service skills. I will order again but when I walk in and see the manager I dread that I have to deal with him."}
{"text":"Best New York pizza in Vegas! Drove from the strip to try it after a recent recommendation and it was worth it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fresh hot food, stay away anywhere near closing time!  Their slice pies look they have been sitting there since opening and didn't taste much better.  The cheesecake was frozen so I'm not sure how that was.  I'm tempted to try one more time in the afternoon when hopefully they have fresh pies but I'm not sure it will be much better."}
{"text":"Hate to give such a bad review to a local business but these guys deserve it. 

It was like eating soggy bread with watered down ketchup and rubber cheese.  The only reason this dump is still in business is because of the tourists at Alliante Casino.  Go to dominos or little Caesars, don't think you're gonna get something special or different-they're a rip off!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick lunch. I always get the 2-slices and a soda for $5.50. The guys working there are always super friendly.  The tables are set up a bit like a long hallway. Each table seats 4, so you will have to split your party to a few tables if you dine in. 

All told, solid pizza joint!"}
{"text":"All the reviews about them messing up phone orders is correct.  Ordered on the phone, they have no record of it when i get there.  Checked my phone plus asked them what their phone number was, it matched what i dialed. waste of time. There r numerous reviews about this happening, they should just stop taking phone orders as they cant seem to get it right"}
{"text":"Great food, and great delivery service. Unfortunately, we have to call a quits because theres an incompetent employee who took our order. He was unfriendly, and he also sounded like he was on pills or simpleminded. My husband and I frequently order from this place and every time we pray this kid doesn't answer, because of his discourteous behavior. The guy never mentioned the price, didn't review my order, and hung up before I can give him my zip code. The delivery driver was completely sympathetic and understanding. He's aware that this is a continuous issue, and I hope they fix it because the food really is amazing."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were good. I had eggplant parm. The eggplant was sliced thin and stacked in there. Price is a little on the higher side for a sandwich but everything is fresh. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Pizza was just ok. Nothing exciting, except the price. We have tried them 3 times and have yet to be impressed."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place based on yelp reviews, and to be honest I don't get all the hype! 
Let me explain...
The pizza was dripping grease which is fine if they were to be generous with the toppings but they're not
The pizza is extremely bland 
Garlic knots not flavorful at all
Spaghetti and meat balls ..oh lawd. The sauce tasted like crushed canned tomatoes with no seasoning...like AT ALL. Meatballs had to be the frozen ones you can buy at any grocery store.
I spent 50 bucks on stuff that I had to get rid of because I was so disappointed.

If this is the best pizza(that so many people claim it to be) in Las Vegas,I guess I better write off pizza until I move."}
{"text":"This place is great! The garlic knots and the Penne A La Vodka pasta was terrific, and the pizza was delicious and very NYC style. Definitely will go back! Normally I only come on here to put up any crappy service I get but I had to put how great it was. I Recommend this place"}
{"text":"Rocco's is a great little pizza place. We adore their onion rings and the pizza is pretty good too. I am very basic and just enjoy cheese pizza. I would not recommend the salads but really you shouldn't be going to a pizza place for the salad."}
{"text":"Best pizza in North Vegas. I'd like to think I'm a pizza expert, I'm from NY and we owned a family pizzeria so I have high standards. 

Friendly staff, awesome pizza!"}
{"text":"I always get my pizza and rice balls TOGo ! There food is so good !! Yummy - luv t rice balls !"}
{"text":"I've heard good things about Rocco's NY pizza. But reading the reviews after the fact makes it a sad story. If all the Rocco's in Las Vegas are owned by different people then this makes Aliante's establishment the runt. 

We stop in for a quick dinner, was not greeted when we walk in. The waitress sees us but just keeps staring without saying a word, we start walking toward her maybe she wants to help us? Nope. She walks right by us to the table just behind us!! Errr..Hello? She would have walked right through us if she could! Pizza was disgusting, it was as bland as cardboard and it broke into pieces...! I ordered a seafood pasta in white wine sauce (can't you tell I like to live dangerously?) The measure of a decent restaurant is how they handle their other items. This was a really bad idea what the hell was I thinking?! The sauce looked like homemade glue paste with calmari tentencles and some scallops that had seen better days. The worst part was the smell, it was so strong with the odor of way too much garlic, calamari and vinegar; our neighbouring tables wrinkled their noses in protest - had to cover it completely with red pepper flakes to mask the odor.  Did I mention this was a REALLY bad idea??  I took a few bites in a daze, omg am I actually eating this here right now?? Incredibly it didn't taste bad, just BLAND, is that even possible?  They are so bland that they can't even bring out the flavor of an obviously gross dish!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! I had the Rocco's wild white buffalo chicken garlic sauce. The fried Mac and cheese bites were a great starter and super cheesy! Our server was great very friendly"}
{"text":"Came here for a large pizza and some wings. First of all, they charged us 4 more dollars than what was on our receipt. Secondly, we got our wings in about 10 minutes but it took 50 minutes for our pizza. We witnessed costumers walk in and out without much of a wait after ordering after us. Overall horrible service, long wait, and confused high school teenagers trying to take orders."}
{"text":"Awful. Over cooked spaghetti canned sauce. Not eatable.  The meat sauce has no meat. The eggplant was soggy and too sweet."}
{"text":"We own a local shop in their area and order from here at least once a week. It's an East Coast type restaurant and the food is very good. I love their antipasto salad with the regular oil & vinegar, homemade dressing. Also the pizza is excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service is all I can say, first the guy tells me he can deliver to me, finally gets here and hour and 20 minutes later. The delivery driver says it an additional 5 dollar fee because it was over 5 miles, what ever I just wanted to eat my food. Pizza was cold, not even warm, along with the garlic knots and the terrible fettuccine Alfredo, the only thing that was actually warm was the marinara sauce(the reason it got 2 stars). I call the place back to tell the guy and he says he just made it he doesn't know why it's cold, well I decided after him talking over me that I'd just get a refund didn't want to deal with it, ask for a manager of the store and he says he will either be in Ina an hour or tomorrow he doesn't know. Terrible customer service and guy keeps talking over you. Food was pretty terrible and cold."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to grab a slice of pizza. Not only is everyone so friendly here, but you can get any type of pizza by the slice! They always have complimentary zeppolis out which is a nice touch!"}
{"text":"We finally have one here in Vegas, a true, real deal New York style pizza joint. What's not to like about this place, the pizza is just divine AND sold by the slice of course. All the finger foods are as good as ever, and the strombolis almost contend with Four Kegs. All in all, LOVE this spot and I'm so glad we have a few in Vegas now."}
{"text":"Great food great staff. If your not here your missing out. They make you feel like family the moment you walk in. The pizza is amazing"}
{"text":"46 reviews and I can't believe this food was given 4 stars. I will start off by saying the staff was very nice and courteous and the place itself was average. Normal pizza spot. Clean. 

We had fried calamari, French fries, garlic knots, and a half plain/half margherita pizza. 

Fried calamari barely had a crust, it was more of a skin. No crunch, all chew, and if it wasn't for my hot lemons I don't think I could have chewed all that frozen squid. It looked more baked then fried. Change the name to Baked Calamari.

The French fries were average frozen fries, little soggy, no crisp. 

The bread balls, I mean garlic knots, were misshaped baked bread. Not buttery and had no garlic, parm cheese or parsley for anything close to be related to NY pizza (I only lived there for 21 years). Add some salt and it's closer to a NY Pretzel. 

And finally, the pizza. The crust was awful. Like a sheet of paper. It was so thin it kept falling apart because the sauce was like a glue to the cheese and just ripped the crust. The cheese was the cheese you eat at Chuckie Cheeses. And the sauce. I would say it was closer to a sweet tomato jam. And I got to eat all of this cold food and dipping my baked calamari, soggy frozen French fries, and bread balls in this same jam! More like Rocco's frozen food & sandwich, jam & cheese shop. 

And if you don't know what NY pizza is suppose to taste like, go to the hidden Pizza shop at the Cosmopolitan btwn the Sushi Place and Jaleo. It's the closest thing to NY pizza that I have had in Vegas and still is not that close to real NY pizza and also expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first visit, but far from my last! Best calzone I've ever had! Also had sweet red chili wings, which were delicious as well. Garlic knots were fresh and hot and fantastic. Aalyssa was attentive and friendly. 
Next visit I plan to try the pizza. It looks really good! Granted I've been to this establishment only once, but I'm still highly recommending it. If you try nothing else, PLEASE have the calzone!"}
{"text":"We love this place, get pizza from here at least once a month.  The sausage, onion, and pepper stromboli is a household favorite and I love the zeppolis, which you cannot get just anywhere. Lately we've been trying the frozen dinners, which are excellent as well. They will work with you on prices for catering large groups."}
{"text":"I discovered this pizza place 7 years ago and still crave it all the time!  I wanted to go here for my birthday one year but my hubby to me to CUT instead and I cried-that is how good I think this place is!  The white pizza is the greatest thing on the planet as well as the cheese calzone.  Hubby like the pepperoni pizza b/c the peps' have a just a hint of spice to them.  Always love the zepoli's at the counter-love dessert before dinner :)

They also have started stocking foods like an Italian grocery store.  Tomatoes, pastas..etc."}
{"text":"So I won a gift card to Rocco's Pizzeria from a school event and thought I'd give the place a try. I place my order over the phone and they said they'd have it done in 15 minutes, very convenient. I got there and everything was ready I hand over my gift card to pay, and one employee starts arguing with another employee whether or not they accept it, as I awkwardly stand there. They finally come to the conclusion and I take my food and leave. I ordered a Cobb Salad, and 2 sandwiches (not all for me). The salad had slices of ham the size someone should get on Christmas and looked as though it had been cured during the revolutionary war. The sandwiches we're not very appetizing either. Rocco's claim to fame is their pizza which I did not try, and from this experience I won't be anytime soon."}
{"text":"Yes, pizza from Brooklyn, is brand/location advertising that is attractive to a pizza lover.

Even the interior decor of b/w framed poster is unmistakably New York New York; it is homey and warm without the crowd and the lines of a neighborhood pizzeria.

A \"Hello\" when I walked-in was very welcoming and they had ESPN on so the sporty feel was nice too.

And then the order...

My spaghetti sauce is weak and watery; maybe it's just me but I want my tomato to be on the creamy, if not fresh and homemade (it does not help when they have the BIG can of tomato sauce on DISPLAY next to the counter). On the bright side, I think the pasta is texturally good and the meatball is a big ball of fun worth trying again.

I've never tried their pizza but it looks big and cheesy thin. You can get two slices and a drink for _____.

And then the bathroom...

Seeing it was not very busy when I was there, I wished the staff were more mindful on their cleaning, because unfortunately this would be the last thing I will remember about this place."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times since they opened.  The pizza is a nice thin crust and flavorful.  The appetizers are excellent.  Prices are reasonable especially if you enjoy the lunch specials.  They have recently expanded to add further dining area which is also nice."}
{"text":"Ordered from there last night!  Pizza is great and we also got the caesar salad.  Good salad, but next time I will ask for the dressing on the side, as it comes directly on the salad (even for carry out).  The \"white\" pizza looks DELICIOUS, so I will definitely have to get that next time!"}
{"text":"There pizza is amazing. I always order Cannoli's as well. The atmosphere is very friendly and family orientated."}
{"text":"You gotta hangover?? Yeah. I did too. But I placed a delivery order for some delicious strombolis and solved that hangover issue.  

*protip: don't order extra cheese. Homeslice may accidentally hit the \"No cheese\" button and deliver a non cheesy pizza to your hungover self.

It's cool. Call them.  They will take care of you. And you can stuff your schit with cheese yoself. 

This is twice that my order was wrong. I can't give less than 5 stars though it's my go to hangover cure."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for delivery at 5:34. Received confirmation that it would be delivered in 30 to 45 minutes. After an hour I called Rocco's. The gentleman on the phone apologized and finally \"found\" my order. He said it would be out soon. 2 hours past the order time I called back. This time a girl answered and asked me to hold. She put the phone down and I listened to her talking to other customers for 11 minutes. When she finally picked up the phone, she said that our order was on its way. Needless to say, Over 2 hours to get a cold pizza, not my idea of a good restaurant. I would have ordered to go and picked it up had I known. Yes, they offer delivery, no it didn't work. I was still charged full price plus delivery fee. No real apology. I'm back to square one looking for a good NY pizza place."}
{"text":"Good pizza. However, their veal Marsala (chef's recommendation) was not great. Go for their pizza. Service is good, too."}
{"text":"Their pizza is just OKAY... I don't think it's
cheesy enough to have that nice, tasty flavor! I have definitely had better pizza elsewhere! I do, however, love their meatball sub/sandwich!"}
{"text":"I'm always on a quest for real thin crust NY pizza. Stumbled upon Rocco's on my visit to Vegas. This place is the real deal! Fantastic pizza! I wish we had a Rocco's here in LA. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good.  Delivery service is atrocious.  Ordered a pizza at 4:55 p.m. via EAT24 app.  As of 6:30 p.m., no pizza.  Contacted EAT24 and called the store.  Store stated it would arrive by 7pm--they said they never got the order via EAT24.  EAT24 confirmed that this was not true.  Fast forward to 8:15 p.m.--still no pizza!  Contacted EAT24--they refunded my money.  The pizza never did arrive.  We had leftover ham for dinner.

This marks the 3rd time we've had an issue with Rocco's delivery.  Either the order is wrong or they don't come at all.  To use the baseball adage, 3 strikes and you're out.  No more Rocco's for us.  It's a shame, because the pizza is good.  Seems to be a management issue there...."}
{"text":"I am a very very picky eater. When we moved to the new area of town we were trying to find a local pizza place and came upon Rocco's. They have the most friend fly staff answered all out questions without any hesitation. They didn't deliver to our area so it was a bit of a drive for us to get the good. We got home and the food was perfect temperature to eat, delicious, and I had no complaints! We try something new each home and so far nothing hasn't been less than amazing!! I jus found out they now deliver to us, which means we will be eating this for our weekly pizza meal! I highly suggest this great pizza place!!! And get the desert balls. !!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and service. Wish they delivered a little farther than 5 miles. Garlic knots are yummy."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving this place no stars is because i can't. This place took 35 minutes to get us the pizza. The guy at the front was rude. The soda refill boxes are next to the bathroom which is against every sort of law imaginable. We wanted the special and the guy told us there was only one special left except they're is a big sign that said \" 2 slices and soda only 4.99\" im sorry but I'm sure that should mean all day not well we only have one left and you can't have it. Thats so rude. Then when we finally got our pizza the crust was chewy like it was microwaved and it just was a horrible experience in general. Ill never come here again. Bring the old couple back they were better hers then the people working today."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Moved away from here 5 years ago. Whenever we are in town we eat here."}
{"text":"Gross.got a pizza slice that was mostly mush. The taste was bland. The employees did not wear gloves while handling the food. And when it was served to me it was shoved and squashed into the bottom of the bag. Waste of $$.had Costco been open I'd much prefer their slices."}
{"text":"Been going to Roccos for at least 12 years. I started with the one on Buffalo then Pavilion. After frequenting the Pavilion location for about 5 years I then moved to The Trails area of Summerlin and started going to Roccos Trails Village. Roccos on Buffalo used to be great now it's terrible, Roccos in Pavilion Center is always great, but Roccos in The Trails is FANTASTIC!!! These people are warm, friendly and Amazing. I go there at LEAST once a week if not more and the food is incredible. By far the best Roccos I've ever been to. They are so unbelievably efficient. I cannot say enough good things about this place! Keep up the good work. As long as I am alive and live in Las Vegas you have a loyal customer!!!!"}
{"text":"Born & raised in NY ... this is great pizza.  New to the area & ordered a. Jesse pizza with mushroom & sausage.  Great flavor, generous portion of topping and competitive prices.  I will be back!!  

Called in for Delivery ... personable & helpful! 
Ordered the Rotelli Bolognese & Rigatoni Anthony Both were delicious.  Also ordered Caesar Salad & the salad was fresh,flavorful & plenty of dressing!!  Salad was great! 

I will be back ... stay tuned for my next experience - plan to order some more entries very soon!!"}
{"text":"Came in for the $4.50 pizza combo and was told its for students only.  Gotta have an id to get the deal.  Went to pull up my school info on my phone but was asked what he wanted me to do he already charged me.  Best thing is that as he delivered my non student discount meal ... I shared it with my friends 7 year old kid who was at the table with us.  Wont come back."}
{"text":"worst pizza  in vegas..hands down this place sux major balls. The people that work there know nothing about how a pizza should be made. I feel like they hired everyone right out of jail.  Fire everyone oh and the girl with the tattoos who's the cashier...seriously??? Stay away from this place if you know what was good for you. Makes me sick just thinking about this place"}
{"text":"Making my way through the Rocco's menu and I have yet to be disappointed. Foods always amazing and the employees are super friendly."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! 

I've always had a love for pasta, got the thighs to prove it. Haha. 
I can honestly say Rocco's NY pizzeria is hands down the BEST pasta I have ever eaten. The Alfredo sauce is the best I've ever tasted. Fancy restaurants need to come here and take cooking lessons. We ate the chicken broccoli Alfredo pasta. The portion was well worth every penny, generous amount of chicken and the broccoli cooked to perfection. The pasta also comes with a side of bread that was perfect for dipping into the Alfredo sauce. And Sauce was homemade, always a plus. 
I bought the pasta for my 2year old but it ended up feeding my husband, 2 year old and I. 
Wait time was quick. Go see Saira, she was helpful and friendly. 
This is a must try!!! 

ALOHA"}
{"text":"Ordered the meat lovers pizza with extra meatballs. It was excellent, best pizza in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Oil flowing in a stream from the fold in the slice.  Sorry, but, it's not the worst I've had."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great place! They were able to accommodate our entire kids' soccer team last minute. Everyone loved the pizza and had such a great time! Pizzas are massive and tasty! We even ordered food to go so we could enjoy some of it later in the evening! Seriously, try this place out...it is SO GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times now. Service is always good, as is the food. 

Prices are pretty decent. I believe all their dinner entrees are about 10 bucks. Pizzas are cheap. If you just want slices, they have a special deal for two slices of cheese and a fountain drink. 

I can't eat at this place without ordering at least one rice ball. It's so delicious ! Especially with their marinara sauce, so be sure to ask for a little extra sauce with it. 

I've yet to try anything besides their pizza and rice ball, but that's ok. Those two items are good enough to keep me coming back. Eventually, I'd like to try one of their pasta dishes, but I love sausage pizza way too much."}
{"text":"I called up and talked to Chance.  Asked for a recommendation and he suggested the Pasta Zagera (not sure I spelled this right).  It was FANTASTIC.  My girl got the Lily's Mixed salad and she was impressed as well.

We WILL DEFINITELY order from here again.

-Andrew"}
{"text":"Holy moly. Where do they get all this delicious dough? The pizzas here are made with a thin crust, crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside, delight. The toppings are fresh and there are many choices. Only downfall is, they don't deliver. So, unless I'm up to driving there (I'm extremely lazy,) I'm
Not going to eat their pizzeria goodness."}
{"text":"I'm a transplant from the northeast and Rocco's is legit NY pizza. As good and authentic as the places in my old neighborhood - I was very glad to discover Rocco's."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in Vegas.  It is certainly the best in the area.  The lunch special is good anytime and they have other good specials during the week.  I stop by at least once a week and look forward to it every time.  Way better than that overpriced trash they sell at the Delucia Pizzeria on Losee and  Centennial."}
{"text":"You know I very much want to patronize local businesses; you want to give local people a chance but there's reasons why people go to places like Olive Garden because the food is consistent and when they charge your debit card it Once not repeatedly; this happened tonight at this establishment; look if you're going to run a business have a string POS system; this happened the Last time I was here and that was over a year ago; didn't come back because of this issue but I also did not write Any reviews because I'm not here to get on yelp to hurt anyone's business; but I work very hard for my money no one gives me anything and now I have been doubled charged for 1 item; it may or may not fall off m account but now I have to be vigilant and call my bank in the morning and make sure I'm credit back.  This review should be about this business food but I'm so upset I can't even do that"}
{"text":"Went to Rocco's last night to get my \"The Everything\" fix (a totally loaded deluxe pizza). And it was soooo good. Crisp bottom, yeasty crust, and terrific toppings.

Out of curiosity, I asked the manager about the other Rocco's deli on Buffalo. She told me that Rocco sold that location and moved his business over to W. Charleston location. So the real Rocco is in the house here, folks!

Also, she told me they are currently debuting discounted daily pasta specials everyday not to mention on Monday night their  cheese pizza is $9.99. Sweet!"}
{"text":"I love their lunch specials and the cucumber salad . I also recommend the Alfredo and garlic knots . The staff always welcome you when you come in . Also the owners are very welcoming and they are always on the line working"}
{"text":"Put in an online order.after two hours, wasn't here. Called and was told it was on its way. 30 minutes later, still no pizza. Called again, told it was in the oven. Finally got here 30 minutes later and didn't have part of our order. At least the pizza was alright and at least they gave us free soda...."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and comes out hot and on time and the staff is very friendly. Fries are legit the garlic knots are big and the pizza is delicious"}
{"text":"So I've been here quite a few times, and the more I dine the worse it gets. First off, you walk in and you will NOT be greeted. This last time we stood there for several minutes as the \"waiters\" lazily walked to and from tables with sour looks on their faces. Each one made eye contact with us but never once said a word. Finally, one waiter had no choice but to address us since he was bringing the bill to the table we were standing next to. At this point, yes I wanted to walk out...but my son was dead set on eating here. So he seats us, then walks away. No menu, no drink order. They stand in the back doing who knows what, look over, continues doing who knows what. Several minutes later we get menus. I dont care whether the food is decent or not, the service is sh*tty!!!! I have no idea what kind of system they have going but clearly they can care less. This is my last time dining here...EVER. and for the food, its ok. The pasta fagioli is simple but good. Pizza thin and slightly greasy. Good luck if you decide to give it a try."}
{"text":"Fabulous NY stye pizza (thin crust available). Owner operated that pays attention to everything.  All employees are friendly, fast moving, and aim to please. Very fresh and only high quality ingredients including lots of toppings including roasted red peppers. Cooked to order thick and thin crust pizza available, plus an assortment of other homemade recipes. Being from NY and a sort of pizza aficionado, my wife and boys feel right at home. Homemade cannolis are the best in town. Gelato bar too. A really great family run atmosphere with very resonance pricing. Highly recommend AAA!!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant one night and went back again a week later.  Definitely some of the friendliest staff we have had service from and we got out to eat frequently.  When you are paying, you can try samples of desserts!  The first night we got garlic knot sliders and stromboli and maybe something else and the next time we got stromboli, garlic knot sliders and a couple other things.  So far we have not tried the pizza, but give us time.  Everything was exclellent and both times we got garlic knots while we were waiting for the food.  Portions are large and all was very tasty - love the garlic knot sliders!!  They have a lot of specials and prices are very reasonable.  We found out they deliver to our area, too - bonus!!  and let me just mention again, excellent customer service!!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in town. Their dough is so great and well prepared. My favorites are the Hawaiian and their white pizza which is delicious.  That's why I'm coming back for the past 10 years. Great service and courteous staff."}
{"text":"Rocco's NY Pizzeria happens to be one of the best places I've eaten at.  It's inexpensive and we only came here because this is our grandkids favorite spots.  The pizza is good, Fettuccini is on point, RSVP Shrimp and Scallops Pasta is excellent, and the Salmon Pesto is superb.  Very delicious, very quiet, and those Garlic Knots are the bomb.  Definitely 10/10 or 5/5.  Rocco's \"Roccs!\" - JC"}
{"text":"Awful. Keep driving by. Not worth the headache. The cash register guy is super rude and acts put out if you ask anything about the items/menu. The food is not good and they are insulted if you tell them your order or item is not right. To make it worse, they call Rocco and he can't understand the fact that the staff could have possibly fuck ed up an order."}
{"text":"The food is great but the staff ls very slow and unprofessional. It's sad because this place used to be tops. There is too much competition to wait 25 minutes for a slice of pizza."}
{"text":"Called in around 835 for a pepperoni Stromboli.  Even though I know they closed at 9.  (Yea I was that guy). Gentleman on the phone was super courteous, said \"it'll be ready in 15\". Showed up at 8:55.  Apologized for ordering so late, because I know that can be a pain for a place trying to go home for the night.  Everyone made some jokes, we all laughed about it, and away I went.  These guys make an awesome Stromboli, super professional and helpful.  Will 100% return!"}
{"text":"I am lactose-intolerant.

I also miss having pizza and cheese and lasagna.

My husband has sacrificed his pizza eating ways for me, because he knows that I can't have any and that it's just not a good idea to eat a whole pizza solo.  I was craving pizza and knew that suggestion would make him happy, so I decided to check yelp and found all these lovely reviews for Rocco's.

We went there last night and got a slice of the works and a slice of the pepperoni/sausage.  The interior is small, with a few tables and visible attempts at making the place look like a NYC local neighbourhood pizza joint (B&W pictures from years gone by, faux brick on the walls, etc.).  The food?  We should have ordered a whole pizza!  Nice thin crispy crust, flavourful tangy tomato sauce, and the cheese!  So good, so stringy and melty.  

Good thing I ingested my lactose pills!  (I come prepared.)

4* for now until the next visit.  I'll have to try their garlic knots and check out the AYCE deal."}
{"text":"the pizza was very good and the knots !!"}
{"text":"Sooooo good. Got the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and it was creamy and yummy. Atmosphere was so cute and homey. Loved it"}
{"text":"Place is fantastic,best meatball sub I have found in Vegas.Alex is the best,knows how to run a business.Good  Pizza too.   Good Luck with new owner.       TIM B."}
{"text":"So had no idea there was few Rocco's around town. The first time I came to one was the Rainbow location mainly due the fact close to my house. It was solid experience and won me over with both pizza/pasta dishes. It been while since stop by again but after solid day of training my training partner and I decided on pizza by the slice for recovery meal. He was telling me about other location across from Red Rock Casino. I was like pizza by slice. Hell yay!! 

Unlike the rainbow location this one has way WAY more personality. The whole interior set up is much more true to a small pizza joint see in the city. The kitchen is pretty small, they have tiny market section (pasta, can sauces, and little bit of everything), and refrigerator filled with ready to go sauces take home plus few other items. As you walk towards the back of the restaurant to the dining area. It this little hallway that opens up to not very big dining area say less then fifty seats. All the stuff on the way from the photos (ton of family photos, and lot of famous landmark you know in NYC), and some artwork murals again NYC famous landmarks. The table overs with the checkerboard look screams italian. I love the vibe of the restaurant. Just fyi I was telling the guy about the Rainbow location and he told me that the ownership is not the original Rocco owner anymore. Guess he only owns this location and one other location out of three or four believe around town. Fair speaking of the pizza I feel both locations were very good. 

We got three pies all together by the slice. I only got one. The sausage and pepperoni. It was awesome. The dough really feel like was true to new york style pie. The sauce and toppings fresh. Maybe they shipped in some of that NYC water because everything about the dough was spot on and the crust addicting. The size of the pizza by the slice another true sign. It nice size. I had one piece hit the spot if had two that like eating small pizza for me. The way serve it on simple plan white paper plate. The price is super reasonable per slice. Really not many pizza places serve by the slice outside of food court in mall. If looking for legit pizza by the slice Rocco's NY Pizzeria. Da bomb."}
{"text":"We have been to Rocco's a couple times but this was our first time experiencing delivery.  This is our new favorite pizza place!  Pizza was delivered earlier than informed. Pizza and wings were hot.  Pizza and wings were awesome. Will not order from any others!  New favorite delivery!  Looking forward to trying all items on their menu."}
{"text":"We placed a take out order the guys were super nice even offer us more things when we got there. The service was amazing!! I love it I can't wait to come back!!! Oh & they also deiver!!"}
{"text":"It is my first time here and so far it is amazing!! The service is outstanding and very helpful. I'm more excited to try my first cannolis home made and fresh made  by the way. Will update when my order is complete !!!"}
{"text":"Love these guys.. Great pizza and hot when you get it.  Their Antipasto is the best and it is large  The delivery is always on time and with a smile. The people who take the order are courtesy and helpful...I would recommend them to all...I have been using them for over 4 years...Thanks Rocco's..."}
{"text":"First time here and let me say my fiance and I were not disappointed at all. If you are looking for an authentic pizzeria with amazing customer service, this is the place for you. We ordered a large holy moly and some jalapeño poppers, so delicious!  The only bad thing we have to say about this place is that we were sad that we couldn't finish everything!!!! Definitely coming back here again. :)"}
{"text":"Omg!! The best pizza we've tasted in Vegas... We've visited a few popular venues and wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery at 545 our pizza came at 715. They told us 45 mins. When it came the delivery call us and we had to go out to his car and get the pizza! It was seriously cold and chewy like day old pizza. An awful experience. Seriously the worst."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite pizza restaurants!! Always the family's go to Italian spot!"}
{"text":"After waiting for an hour to get my food. They forgot my part of my order. It's been more than an hour again and still haven't get my complete food. First time I order here and last time too."}
{"text":"I decided too mix up my pie instead of my normal Grimaldi. I pass this place all the time felt like time too give new place a shot. First impression was screams new york new york with its decor all around and talk about long island or new york accent. Everyone there must be from new york or close by feel like in the city.

I was thinking about going with fellow yelpers the white sauce pizza but more of pepperoni and red sauce guy. So order large pie with pepperoni and also order of caesar salad all too go. The wait was not that long because the place was for the most part empty works well for me! The caesar salad was average at best nothing special about it. The dressing felt like could have used more garlic and anchovies plus more dressing tossed in it. Too be fair I like my salad with decent amount of dressing not drowning but enough all the greens are covered or well tossed in it. The pizza again felt like it was nothing special but ok. The crusts on the end ok, like the thin style pizza and bottom of the pie was perfect, the red sauce was good, and pepperoni was good. They do offer LOT of different special student specials, 2 cheese slice pizza with soda ($4.99), or large 16' cheese pizza for ($9.99). All day long believe. They have nice display for their desserts. 

Overall just felt like everything was just ok. IT doesn't mean I would never go back because do like fact they sell pizza by the slice unlike Grimaldi. But in the end still nothing SPECIAL about the pizza here and without doubt not in the same ballpark as Grimaldi. Then again I never tried the white pizza most talked about so maybe then change my mind."}
{"text":"The best! The owners are so friendly, staff is great. Food as always, AMAZING. We order those desserts to called Zeppoles I think? Delicious! Highly recommend their Chicken Cesar Salads and Pepperoni Pizza!"}
{"text":"Pizza and chicken salad is what we order here and the food is always great. What is lacking is the attitude of the staff. Half the time there is no greeting when you walk in there or any smiles on anyone's face. At times I feel like they are being inconvenienced by having to serve you. Both me and my fiancé don't like going in here for that fact. There is another Rocco's on rainbow that has amazing customer service, if we were not so far away we would go to that more often. Keep the food change the staff."}
{"text":"Did a pick up on two cheese pizzas. Got home and put it on the pizza stone for a few more minutes and it came out legit. Tastes just like this pizza joint called Sal's Pizzeria in Jeffersonville, New York. Really good NYC style pizza. Salt, sugar, tomato, herb, and cheese amounts were just right. Definitely my go to place for pizza from now on even though its a 15 minute drive. I'm drooling just thinking about it..."}
{"text":"There pizza was just okay. They took a really long time when me and my husband went in for just two slices. First impressions can be lasting and mines wasn't good I probably wont go back."}
{"text":"Hands down the  Sicilian pizza on the planet! Their fried chicken tenders are always fresh and delicious. Another winner is their white pizza. We've had it regular with ricotta and also with spinach. Either way it's the bomb."}
{"text":"Food is good and it's close to home so it has been a frequent choice for our family. However, on our last visit, my son picked up the take out bag and noticed it started leaking. When he brought it to the worker's attention, instead of apologizing, the cook decided it was his opportunity to \"school\" my son on how to properly pick up a bag of take out.  He laid into my son and told him that it was his fault and the everyone knows not to hold the bag from the top. No apology...just rude treatment. Pizza places are ALL over and the food here is not so exceptional that they can really afford to be rude. We will going elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"So I finally tried Rocco's...I probably won't be back to try a few of their items. It is a nice place and customer service was friendly but from what I had and what everyone else in my group had it was more misses than hits. 

I had the chicken and broccoli fettuccine alfredo. My picture isn't a true representation, it was worst. The noodles were very under cooked. Under cooked pasta noodles are good if they were freshly made but when they're out the box or bag cook it longer. It was partially transparent in the middle, crunchy and gummy in other parts. It was like eating those Asian microwavable chow mein dishes but for pasta. It took me forever to finish it not because of it size but because it was just bad, even tried letting it maybe cook in its sauce but it never happened. I didn't care for the chicken pieces and sauce it was more like they cutted up half of a 6 piece chicken McNuggets box and added a bad bottled or canned alfredo sauce. The only positive thing about the dish was the broccoli seemed fresh, bright green and had a nice crisp when bitten into. 

A few in the group ordered some calzones. Right out of the oven and before they started eating it I was thinking that they're a nice smaller than usual calzones that I'd be back for.  However after noticing that 2 of the calzones weren't finished it seemed like maybe it's not that good. It seemed like the cheese was mostly left in the plates, it didn't look so tasty.

Their strombolis and pizzas did look really good these were ordered and left without a trace on the plates of those who ordered them. Maybe I'll be back for these.  They have a 2 cheese pizza slices and a drink special for about $5. Their Fra Diavolo also looked good from across the table, it had pasta, mussels, and a red sauce. I liked that they displayed the actually pizza,  strombolis, and calzones on the counter because they just look so good. They have these signs on the walls saying in big letters that they have best of various things and deals they have, it makes you want to get them and prove em wrong or right.  

I'll probably be back but not anytime soon so expect an update unless I get the same experience that time also."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here twice and weren't pleased with the pizza either time.  Being from NJ, but only 15 minutes away from Manhattan, I think I have a pretty good idea of what NY pizza is supposed to be like.  Actually, forget that.  ANY pizza should not be like what I'm about to tell you.

Like what I saw at Rocco's, we have our pizzerias that keep the pizza out for a little bit; it cools down and the cheese starts to harden and turn a little translucent, but after heating them up, it's just fine.  Not a big deal.  Both times we were here, despite being reheated, it looked like crap.  They were really dry -- I don't mean just the cheese, which was still kinda hard, but the whole thing was really dry.  Why is my pizza so stiff?  I wondered how long pizzas were sitting out and made me wonder how their business is doing.

It didn't taste bad, but I'm used to having greasy, gooey cheese on my pizza.  Gooey, as in it's melted, and I can fold my slice in half easily because it's soft.

I live only a minute or two away from Rocco's, but I've had Vincenzo's pizza (on Craig) twice and really liked it.  I will gladly travel the extra distance to get some good NY pizza."}
{"text":"One of the best fettuccine Alfredo's I have ever had. New York style pizza, fresh pastas and salads. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good but service is not.  This is how they gave me a two slice to-go order; on a thin paper plate slid inside a brown paper bag.  I asked if they had boxes so I don't get grease all over my clothes and car and he said no they don't have noses for slices.  Mind you they're huge.

If they can't provide a box for the price, raise the price.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"It's a pizza joint.  Don't come for the decor.  But do come for the pizza.  Probably the closest thing to NY pizza in Vegas.  It's not gourmet, but it's consistently good.  I like the pizza better than Dom Demarco's (which is sometimes great and sometimes bad), but the ambiance is bad.  

This isn't a date place, but it's great for a quick slice or for take-out."}
{"text":"I love the white pizza here, but we had a bad experience here! I called in our order (I'm from Utah and always look forward to getting my white pizza fix) and we came and got it, paid and left. They had to ring me up twice because they forgot to charge me for 2 pastas. Then, we didn't check our order, so we got home and found they had given us a cheese pizza instead of a white pizza. I called and let them know (nicely) that our order was incorrect and I would be back shortly to exchange. He said \"no problem.\" 

When I got back to the restaurant, the same man that rang me up confronted me and told me that I had ordered cheese and it wasn't their fault. I had several people in the car with me whn I ordered, all of whom confirmed that I had ordered correctly, and that he had not repeated my order to confirm he heard me right. Simple misunderstanding that did not deserve a confrontation. He then told me I'd have to wait because they had to cook me one (which is why I called ahead, silly guy!) The other food was all cold by the time we got to finally eat it. Simple mixup handled very unprofessionally. We will not be back, and I will have to find a new favorite white pizza.  If you don't mind a little confrontation and uncomfortable service, the food is really good. The penne a la vodka is to die for."}
{"text":"Great pizza guys! I miss the NY style pies."}
{"text":"I knew the original Rocco and while he's no longer a part of this restaurant I was hoping that the food would be the same. They have a $7.99 all-you-can eat dinner that consists of picking from the following menu: salad, cheese pizza (toppings extra $) and pasta with marinara sauce. 

They serve garlic knots complimentary, I thought these were quite good and enjoyed the dipping sauce. The salad was a bit disappointing because it was plain. Some lettuce, a few strands of carrots and tomato slices. The cheese pizza was OK. It's better when you ask for it to be well done when they heat it up, it makes the crust crisp up. The pasta - while I appreciate that it was served piping hot, the sauce didn't taste the same as I remember so I was a little disappointed with that. 

Overall, it was OK."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin? Called twice to try & place an order, no answer. Should have stopped there. On the third & final try, a man answered. This guy was rude & argumentative from the get-go. We ordered chicken fingers, fries, & calamari. Oh, & two sides of ranch each priced at 35 cents. We were quoted 45 minutes to receive our food. 45 minutes go by, then an hour, then hour & a half. Its Friday, I understand that it probably gets busy, but I call to check on the order & get very rudely told that he sent it out. No apology, just arrogance from this guy once again. Finally get our food. I will say that the delivery driver was super friendly! The only good part about this experience! 
I can't even begin to explain the horrible smell that emitted from the box of calamari. Ive washed my hands twice since I touched ONE piece, & I sill can't get this stench off my hand! It was spongy, off colored, & vomit-inducing. The chicken fingers were reminiscent of sponges. The fries were grease with a hint of potatoes. The 85 cents a pop ranch dressings were little Ken's brand ranch packets. So, naturally, when I called up there to demand a refund & ask if he wanted to send the delivery guy back, this same piece of work guy on the other end tells me that I have to drive the food all the way back & he'll \"give me my money back\" So we drive up there with the food, expecting a quick drop off & refund, & wouldn't you know it, this guy takes an argumentative tone again!  Oh & also, place was empty & the employees weren't busy. Soooo hour & a half for what? 
Never, ever again."}
{"text":"Eh...food was just ok.  Kind of disappointing.  Delivery took one hour.  Still in search of a good New York pizza place."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in town.  I like the white pizza.  They also have sample pastries while you wait.

Best part is that Cherry on Top frozen yogurt right there for dessert!"}
{"text":"Ok so I've been back twice since my first visit and it has only gotten better. Tried the Brooklyn pizza which was outlandishly dope then I had a cannoli for the first time in life and that was pretty good but can't say I was thrilled. The gelato is super good like for reals, overall I would say this is my fav pizza spot. Btw the staff is beyond nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and everyone before and after me got their food. 15 minutes after ordering I asked where my slices were and got a \"sorry bro\" right before they were tossed in the oven. Then the guy forgot them in the oven. 8+ minutes later they came out so hot I couldn't eat them. Once finally cool enough to not burn my mouth off I take a bite to find out the crust is extra extra crispy, one step from burnt in reality. Nothing else was said about having to wait 20+ minutes for them to warm pre made slices. Avoid!"}
{"text":"April served us, and she was one of the nicest servers I have ever had. On top of the amazing service, the food was definitely authentic at a great price! 

I would come again to be served by April."}
{"text":"I don't give five stars very often or I would here!  The only bad thing to say is the dining room leaves a little to be desired and it was 60 degrees lol.  Brrrrrrr.... That being said.  The pizza and Zeppoles were Delish!!!! It's good ole New York style pizza.  Huge pieces, thin crust, greasy, cheesey deliciousness.  Don't be put off that the pizza's are on the counter when you walk in - they throw them in the oven when you order and when you get it - it's piping hot and taste fresh and delicious.  Been there twice and it's yummy every time.  And p.s. if you order the Zeppoles - they will say it's two dozen but they will put like 50 in the bag so be ready to chow down!  :)

Oh and price wise - 3 pieces of pizza an order of Zeppoles and 3 drinks was like $20.  Cheap and delish"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas, if you like New York style.   All there dishes are well made and taste delicious.  You can dine in but not really set up for that.  They also carry a great line of authentic Italian canned ingredients, pastas and other items used to cook with.  They have a great dessert case and make amazing chips."}
{"text":"Ordered a antipasto salad with no pork and the dressing wasn't very good so I asked for ranch, they charged me an extra dollar and charged me for the antipasto full price yet there was no anti in it. Daughter had pasta with red sauce. It was watered down. No flavor... won't be going again ."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been meaning to try this place forever now since we live right down the street and we finally did yesterday. We definitely found our new pizza place! I'm from New York and walking in there and even seeing things that you can only find on the east coast, even my favorite potato chips, made me feel like I was back home in the Bronx! Can't wait to try EVERYTHING on their menu!"}
{"text":"I wanted pizza and I found this place on Yelp. What a great day for me! I love New York style pizza. I got a slice of sausage and a cannoli. The pizza was hot and delicious. The cannoli was big and full of filling."}
{"text":"Solid food, not too heavy, and the staff is quite friendly. I feel like it's probably one of my favorite around town, and the even have great deals for somebody who just wants a quick slice. That being said, it didn't necessarily give me tingles up the spine, so I wouldn't call it my favorite. Nonetheless, solid, tasty, and reliable!"}
{"text":"We love Rocco's in our family! It's the closest to NY style as we have in Vegas without cooking at home! Sauce is always yummy and chicken is always amazing! 

Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Ok NY pizza.  Nothing special and the service need to be updated. What kind of business doesn't greet customers or say thank you.   Grimaldi pizza is better and so is the service."}
{"text":"The food was some what good , yes they were fast and all but the only thing unsatisfying was the fact they were cheap with the ranch and ketchup. So we order a some what good amount of food and a large fries and I only received three ketchup packages and I was told ranch was extra ! Like hello really"}
{"text":"I love the Monday large pizza special. They definitely have some of the best pizza in Vegas and the service is great! I usually get a eggplant supreme and Lg pizza w/ meatball & ricotta"}
{"text":"What is all the fuss about?  The pizza was mediocre with minimal cheese and sauce and the crust was so chewy it was too much work.  Have to stay with my regular place though the cannoli's were excellent and the antipasto salad looked beautiful."}
{"text":"Aside from everyone there being exceptionally nice and attentive, the pizza is as close to buying pizza in NY. I'm a New Yorker who brags about how good are pizza is and I've tried many places that advertise NY pizza and I get the urge to box their ears because of the false advertising. You want NY pizza and live in Vegas, go to Rocco's. Oh, and they carry Wise Honey BBQ chips--need I say more."}
{"text":"Got a pepperoni pizza, was real dry and greasy. To me that's golden liquid but it was just WAY too much. Real thin crust but didn't really have a unique flavor to it. It is my first time trying this place out but definitely will give it another chance one day."}
{"text":"good pizza and salad. I think they forgot about the salad the first time we went because it took a really long time and we had to ask for it. We made our way back again on another visit though and it was very good."}
{"text":"The pizza wasn't bad but the little punk who answers the phone needs to check his little attitude. 17 year old little bitch talking disrespectful to a 44 year old man who almost went up there to give him an attitude adjustment. Will never order from this place again. Shame on the owner who doesn't notice this"}
{"text":"Tried ordering  delivery from here and was treated extremely rude!!! They need someone with better customer service to take delivery orders. SO DISAPPOINTED!!"}
{"text":"The service was great and friendly - always a plus! We ordered the garlic knot sliders...absolutely delicious and a pizza with extra cheese....equally delicious. It reminded us of pizza back home on the east coast. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"One of the better pizzas I've had in my life.  You can tell the owner takes pride in his food.  The crusts are crispy, but not burned which a lot of places tend to do.  Their Italian sausage is homemade, which is another plus.  It's not frozen mystery meat.  Prices are fantastic considering these are authentic new york style.

If you're a first timer, I would try the peperoni sausage.  One downside to this pizza is that it requires the dreaded napkin grease blot.  The pizza was very very oily, but I guess that's what you get for ordering the peperoni and sausage.  Needless to say it was awesomeeeeeee.

As the great governator always says, \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"I ordered take out. The food was fresh and delicious. Best calzone I ever had. Last time I ate in the restaurant. I had a meatball sandwich. It was amazingly good. The bread is home made and the best ever. My favorite neighborhood pizzeria for sure."}
{"text":"Eh. Not impressed. Nothing to cry about, I didn't send anything back. But would I drive across town again for this? No way. Especially when there are better Italian delis in Vegas. 
My family and I went here on a Sunday night. With no intentions of being in the area, we were quite pleased to find an authentic Italian deli style place. Reviews look decent, and they offer fresh cheese, so I was all in. 
Between us, we ordered a large cheese pie, a bolognese, a specialty pasta, and some rice balls. The pizza and rice balls tasted pretty good. The pastas were just average. The bolognese was actually quite bland. 
I was also disappointed in their deli selections. They basically had mozzarella and provolone, that's all. To me an Italian deli needs at least 5-7 selections you can't get at your local market. 
I would order a pizza from here again if they were close. I would even give them a second chance if invited by a friend or for a party. But overall, this is basic and average, and nothing more."}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza in Vegas...the Chef comes with the NY voice and additude. 

Love it and recomended everything on the menu"}
{"text":"Cashier handles food without washing his hands; and I'm talking about direct contact with actual food, not food containers. No place is perfect but it seemed like the guy didnt even care. Doesn't matter how the food taste if its not clean. Will not go back."}
{"text":"I really love the Rocco's in Henderson so when I moved to NLV I was excited that they had another location close to my new home! Unfortunately this location doesn't even come close to its sister store. I ordered online a few hours ahead to ensure I wouldn't forget to order and I could pay ahead. When I arrived they had trouble finding my order in their system and expected me to pay again but after refusing they found my order and handed it to me. Before I turned to leave once of the managers (I believe) awkwardly asked how tall I was (6'2 if you're curious) and when I answered just hummed to himself. It was weird. 

Despite the awkwardness and mix-up about payment I was pumped to return home and dive into my cheese pizza and chicken fingers with mild sauce on the side. The pizza was under cooked with a chewy dough and the fingers were a burnt and stringy. After all that, it was a disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Cheese pie was underdone for my taste, even ordering it \"well.\"  This is the same Rocco's as Charleston (by Red Rock, NOT the original @ Buffalo & Charleston, which is the best) The sauce is tasty: simple and straightforward tomatoey and well seasoned. Cheese was good quality and plentiful; crust was too chewy suffering from lack of char even though it was thin. 

Two White slices were huge, the ricotta was sweet and well distributed and oddly, the thicker crust was more properly charred than on aforementioned pie. Pizza guy was courteous, pie was ready in a timely fashion. 

Appetizers, Stromboli, hot and cold sandwiches, salads, entrees and a variety of pastas are available. They make cannoli and zeppole in house and have Italian cookies and several other deserts. 

Better than previous joint in this location, but not my favorite option in Vegas. Solid NY style za especially with large cheese pie Monday special of only $9.99; light years better than chain processed pseudo pizza."}
{"text":"The very best Philly sandwich I've had in Las Vegas, the place quite cozy and had nice ambient  decorations, their stuff is quite friendly and can certainly provide you with a recommendation according to your budget and craving. I went for the philly sandwich lunch special which included fries and drink for around $10, now is quite hard to get a good quality meal such as this one around here in vegas for under ten bucks, but believe it or not they have it! Certainly theres no doubt of the high quality ingredients, as they say, quality is something you can taste!!! Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Best NY pizza ever!! The garlic bread is delicious!!! Gelato is so good!!! 
Manager is so friendly and helpful! 
And they have a military discount!!!"}
{"text":"We came here while visiting my parents, who live nearby. At 6 pm on a Friday night, the place as starting to fill up. We ordered the XXL veggie pizza and buttered noodles for my son. It took over 30 minutes for the noodles to come out. The pizza took 45 minutes to come out. There is a small candy machine at each booth so we got some M&Ms while we waited. The noodles had real butter and my son and daughter ate them. The pizza was huge! My parents both ate a single slice while my husband had 2 slices. I had 1.5 slices. Having lived in Brooklyn, this is super authentic Pizza. I was surprised to have east coast pizza in Las Vegas. I would have given 5 stars but removed a star for slow service."}
{"text":"Terrible! The delivery took 2 hours. We called to check because we had guests and our 4 year old all asking where our food was. We were told it was almost here but took 25 mins more and it doesn't take 25 mins to drive that distance. The delivery woman was very rude and when we asked if it was hot (it wasnt) she just said angrily, \"you want it or not!?\" Well, we had to feed everybody who was hungry so we took it. Both pizzas were cold as if they had been sitting for a while, yet the crust was undercooked and doughy. How the hell did it take so long to undercook pizzas? Worst of all, all the cannolis were melted and so warm we couldn't serve them. Waste of $50. I want my $ back."}
{"text":"My go to spot for pizza (fave Is the white) and also enjoy the rice balls (huge!) With a side of sauce. Easily spilt among 2. Their homemade mozzarella is delicious; my favorite way to savor it is on a sandwich with roasted peppers basil and sundried tomato. Clean fresh taste party in my mouth. The antipasto platter is a great addition to your favorite pie. Dad enjoys fresh smoked mozzarella and I buy it as a treat for him, since while I'll pull fresh mozzarella a couple times a year during holidays, smoked is outside my realm of expertise. 

My family and friends enjoy the regular pie well done and a variety of sandwich specials and dinner items. Stand outs have been chicken Marsala, pasta dishes and many others we've tried in 9 years patronage. We've made a small army of fans out of friends and by word of mouth. 

Some of the items others have referred to as decorative and unnecessary have been great finds for a transplanted NY girl: Ronzoni Pastina to make chicken soup with egg and escarole like Nona made. Cavatelli in the frozen section is my go to pasta for when I make Vongole con cavatelli bianco (white.clam sauce that allows the bivalves to sneak into tubular pasta = mangia) the homemade sausage is a hit with the fam as well. It is by no means a fancy dining room, the star here is the food. 

On several occasions I've ordered custom to go platters for office parties or to show clients what real Italian tastes like from the standpoint of a second generation L'American. They fill cannoli to order and carry a variety of cookies, gelato in pre packed pints and fresh zeppoles (fried pizza dough, in a paper bag with confectioner's sugar) During the holidays, be sure to order cannoli and cookie platters early; they even make honey balls (strufoli)

The Italian ices, sauces to go and NY Daily News to read only add to the authentic vibe. For all of the people who complain about waiting: call ahead. Quality takes time. And quality is what Rocco's through owner changes and many years, has delivered without fail over the years. 

4.5 stars"}
{"text":"I love this pizza place!! You don't have to wait too long, they have other menu items also but the pizza itself is sooo good.
The seating is tiny and squished into a small hallway but it is worth it for the pizza, if you aren't into the seating just do take out."}
{"text":"First time coming thru and got a little bit of everything. Ordered the wings, mozzarella sticks, calamari and pepperoni pizza. Food was great and flavorful. As we were contemplating some great looking gelato the manager, Rengal, came out and checked on us. Terrific job and sold us on a couple of scoops! We will definitely be back...thanks!"}
{"text":"Best Cheese Pizza in Vegas.  Crispy crust, over sized slices.  Nothing further to say."}
{"text":"Food is great but pricey!  They charge $2.50 for their \"custom water\".  That's a lot in my opinion.  Try their lasagna pizza!  It's awesome!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best secrets of Vegas.  A bit out of the way unless you are headed out to Red Rocks, but well worth the stop.  I couldn't get over how authentic it was here.  

The sauce on these pies is amazing!  The eggplant parm is one of the best I have ever had in my life, and those little beignet-like things are fluffy pillows of powdered sugar heaven.

Fast friendly service, clean tables, and good prices.  A winner all around."}
{"text":"Great customer service, amazing selections.  Ordered an extensive amount of food online for catering and the staff here was supremely courteous and professional.  The food was up to par with delicious NYC Italian food (former New Yorker here).  It's better to call in the order...the online ordering will cost you 15%.    Will continue to come here and refer this restaurant..."}
{"text":"Just ordered from here. Probably like my 10th time ordering from this location and my pizza is always made to perfection. Thin & slightly crispy crust, just the right amount of cheese and sauce. A true New York Style Pizza! Love it so much and brings me back so many memories from back home in NY. So happy that I found Rocco's out here in Vegas! Would def recommend this pizza spot"}
{"text":"We order from here once a week and/or enjoy a pie to split for lunch.  Monday and Tuesday a large cheese is $9.99.  When they first opened it was $9.99 every day.  I understand supply and demand as their pizza is in demand in Las Vegas.  Many places have failed in trying to deliver a quality NY pizza.  Being from NY originally, I know that the trick to making a good NY pie is in the \"water\" and just screaming at it while you make it to get that true NY attitude in every bite.  Overall, the staff are great and the sandwiches are very tasty.  The Brooklyn is great if you are looking for proscuitto (good heaping portion) and the Manhattan Toasted (garlic bread) you can't lose with."}
{"text":"Randomly stopped by this establishment for a slice.  So glad we did.  Each had a slice and can't wait to order out for pizza night soon.  Pizza was great!"}
{"text":"Okay, so far the best pizza I've had since moving to Vegas.  Crust is a great texture, with a nice chew.  Sauce had nice flavor toppings were fresh.  I also had the hot wings and they are also cooked right, big and meaty.  On top of all this, the price is right.  Best part is, I live right down the street!   Only minus I can see was they didn't have any beer."}
{"text":"Love this place. I go there every Monday when they have their pizza special. Great consistent pizza. Nice people that work there too."}
{"text":"Very rude phone customer service I was trying to order a couple pizzas and the dude on who answered has 0% communication skills or customer service, he should be terminated because of how rude he was to me saying \"you're killing me\" because I wanted to order food at your fucking $8.25 job?  Don't take your anger out on me because you are stuck at a dead end job you grown ass man. Worst experience ever, I've been going here since I was in the 6th grade and I'm 21 now. This has been very disappointing experience, might think twice about ordering here. If I can give -5 stars I would."}
{"text":"Very good pizza very reasonable price, crust was a bit hard, but I wish they delivered."}
{"text":"Well I first ordered my pizza online so I didn't have to wait.... that was the first mistake! When I got there they had no order for my name so I said ok whatever and told her what I wanted. As I was ordering they got a phone call from there online tech person asking if they ever reserved my order the lady started getting mad and said no we never got the order and she also told the lady I was very upset and had left (mind you I'm standing right here not upset). The lady hung up and got my order, about 10 mins later everything came out. Little did I know when I got home this order was NOT fresh and intended for someone else. I don't live very far from here and by the time I got home the pizza was ice cold and had TONS of raw garlic ALL over it! I will not come back! So gross and very unhelpful here!"}
{"text":"After living in NYC for 15 years, then living in LA's pizza-wasteland for 8 years, I was fairly hurtin' for some good pizza again by the time I moved to Las Vegas. On my first venture, I luckily tried Rocco's and it immediately brought back memories of an excellent slice of New York pizza; the kind you can get on every other block in NY, and is barely anywhere to be had in Los Angeles.

Large, cheesy slices that are best eaten folded; the sauce is nicely seasoned and not too sweet; and most importantly, the crust is just the right thickness with an excellent bite.

The shop is not fancy at all, but has a decent seating area in the back. Walking in, the store feels pretty much like a typical NY pizza joint, which I love. I haven't tried anything other than their pizza but I will eventually. I'm looking forward to checking out Grimaldi's at Boca Park for more of a nice, sit-down pizza dinner, but Rocco's is definitely my pizza joint."}
{"text":"Service was good, but the Pizza was not. I was hoping the food would be the same as the Rocco's on Aliante.. but it definately was not...It was so greasy.. uggh I will not buy the pizza again.."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places with multiple locations in town. I've never been disappointed with the food or service."}
{"text":"Looks good, taste was not like any New York pizza I have ever had. I am originally from NYC and this pizza was a disgrace. Wrist of all they took forever to bring anything out. Plus they forgot our kid cousin's pasta we ordered. 

Never going back."}
{"text":"The last time I was here was not long after they opened, a small single stall unit with maybe four tables. Ten years later its looks like about 20 tables with a whole variety of pizzas, wings, beer and appetizers. It's looks like the sponsor a few local sports teams too so I'm happy to support a local business."}
{"text":"My husband and I were having a lazy Friday night so we decided to order delivery and found Rocco's menu in our stack to try. It was over an hour before our food was delivered and even though we were both starving, I could not force myself to finish the food. 
My husband got the calzone- there was a severe lack of seasoning. The crust was like eating cardboard. It was chewy and had absolutely no flavor. Usually pizza crust is my favorite, but if their pizza crust is anything like this calzone then I would highly not recommend. Even dredging the calzone in marinara sauce did not rescue this sad little dish.  
I ordered the Chicken marsala. The menu said it came on a bed of pasta. So I assumed that the pasta would be dressed with sauce, maybe some cheese? Salt? Seasoning? Anything? Nope, I was wrong. The \"bed of pasta\" was literally pasta drained from the boiling water straight into the take out container.... now why would I want to eat plain pasta?? Disgraceful. I even tried to find some marsala sauce to toss over the pasta, but it was non-existent. The Chicken marsala completely lacked flavor and seasoning. Completely under-salted - and I normally hate salty food. They might as well rename this dish- plain chicken breast over a bed of plain pasta. 
Garlic knots- When i heard my entree came with garlic knots I was very excited! I love anything carbs and bread. Boy was I disappointed. These knots were hard and extremely stale. What a let down. 
I have to admit that we did not try the pizza and I know this place is a pizzeria, but based on the dishes that we did try, I will not waste anymore money and time order from this place. Sorry for the harsh review, but if you can't make the dish right, then take it off the menu."}
{"text":"Love the school special, I get it every time! The garlic knots are totally to die. I come here like once a week and I love the staff."}
{"text":"We have ordered your cold sandwiches previously, and thought we would try a hot sandwich this time.  We ordered for carry out.  The staff was very nice and friendly.
We ordered a corn beef and pastrami sandwich and a corn beef melt with a side order of onion rings.  I was so disappointed with the quality of our food.  The onion rings were drenched in oil and very soggy.  My corn beef and pastrami sandwich was served with the heal of the rye bread.  It was served with the heal on the bottom, as though they were hiding it.  The bread was stale and dry on both sandwiches.  The meat tasted so processed, for the cost of $17.00 for the two sandwiches I could have gone 5 doors down and bought fresher bread and better tasting meat.  Please don't pass your stale heals off to carry out orders,  because the customer will not return.  I am Italian and this is not quality I was raised with.  We believe in fresh and good quality, not the garbage you are serving.  Good luck, if this is the best you can do."}
{"text":"I didn't want to eat here, but my Boyfriend  wanted to give this restaurant a try. I was pleasantly surprised.  The food came in generous proportions.  The orders took a little longer to be prepared, because they were made fresh.  We had garlic knots, pepperoni/sausage pizza, and the garlic bread.  All the ingredients on the pizza were fresh.  The dough was delicious when it was hot, but when the breading got cold, it became a little bit rubbery.  The crust was just so-so.  The factor that really got Rocco's an extra star from average was the customer services.  The server Ashley went above and beyond.  She was so friendly and accommodating, that she changed my mind about not wanting to give the restaurant a chance. Overall, I would come back for another visit."}
{"text":"Been in here a few times. Food is great especially if you're in the mood for Italian deli food. Subs and pizzas are good never ate in before."}
{"text":"In a time where there is a New York pizzeria on every corner you would think that customer service would be top notch and it wasn't even average. It took 7 minutes for anyone to even greet me when I walked in and stood at the counter but when another gentleman came in he was taken care of right away which I thought was kind of rude. The cook and cashier were making whisper jokes the entire time. I just thought it was unprofessional and I will never come eat here again"}
{"text":"Disappointed that it took an hour and 30 minutes to receive our food via delivery.  Don't think I will be ordering delivery from them again."}
{"text":"Pizza is on point Rocco served it up quickly and correctly. Cool vibe in the spot grabbed my pie and pasta to go but will eat in next time. Also wanna try the calamari and Stromboli."}
{"text":"Great pizza and Caesar salad. Order got messed up though. When you order through door dash It lets u choose different toppings for right side of pizza and left side. It ended up not showing I guess and I got all the toppings mixed together. I will definitely order again but will probably call to ensure the directions come through properly. Great pizza and salad. Garlic knots were pretty bland, they could use some more seasoning and garlic. Tiramisu is amazing! Overall very good :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place out after my boyfriend heard they served really good NY style pizza. I'm a pan crust kinda gal myself but all-in-all, pizza is pizza to me. The place itself is located in a plaza across from the Walmart shopping center. It's a small, deli style eating place where you can sit down or takeout. We ordered a slice of the white and a italian stromboli. I have to say I was pretty disappointed. First off, they got the order wrong and gave us plain cheese slice. They let us keep the slice after fixing our order, but both pizzas were just not so great. They bottom was burnt and the overall taste just blah. Pizza hut is better. I think this place is a chain so maybe we picked the wrong one, but I don't plan on coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Oh, Rocco's. My love/hate relationship. Why can't I quit you?! Oh yeah, they're the only game in the area if I want Italian food but don't want to cook or leave my house. I think they know this. I've had my order completely forgotten/lost via the eat24 ordering system. They had my money, I had no food for like 2 hours. The 5% discount they offered me was insulting, eat24 ended up eating a chunk of that bill. I've also received someone else's entire delivery order on a few occasions. The food is usually hit or miss. It's a surprise every time! The dining room is truly an enigma. The last time I was there, there were 4-5 wait staff running around like the three stooges. I've seen an entire Chili's run on less floor staff. As an Italian from one of the 5 boroughs, I'll admit to liking your red sauce, which is a big deal. See you soon, I guess."}
{"text":"Being from New York (and no longer living there), I am always in search of an authentic thin crust slice of NY pizza and Rocco's is as close as it gets! Even the team answering the phone have accents that remind me of home!

I've ordered a couple times (for pick-up) and it has ALWAYS been consistently tasty. Lately,we just get the cheese pizza (which is absolutely perfect) but sometimes I'll add the garlic knots or the Zeppoles (fried dough) which are delicious as well. And now that we've discovered this place, my buddy Patrick and I order from here at least once a week! 

There are a couple locations throughout Vegas so find the one closest and go try it. In fact, I think it's time we placed an order for this week!"}
{"text":"Very good white pizza;   good bakery dessert items.  First time trying the place."}
{"text":"One of the best places I have eaten at for pizza. We got the family meal. There were 3 of us we had a large pizza, 18 wings, garlic knots, 2 salads and beverages. There was plenty to bring home. For desert we had gelato which was very good. The staff were super friendly and always checked to see if you needed anything. I highly recommend this to anyone whose looking for some good food. Besides pizza they have pasta and other dishes."}
{"text":"Finally a friendly, clean and comfy enviorment with awesome pizza. Pricing is decant and there's hardly a wait for your food. I would reccomend this joint to anyone."}
{"text":"To say the service was horrible would be a compliment. We sat down and waited at least 20 minutes before anyone came to take our order.  After nearly 30 minutes of waiting for an appetizer or any of our food, someone brought us garlic knots (we ordered the garlic sliders), and they were mediocre at best.  The waitress told us she couldn't make the ovens cook any faster. (Seriously?!?!?!). We had a movie to catch and ended up just walking out....completely flabbergasted at the lack of service.  We will never go there again and will recommend that no one else go either."}
{"text":"The staff is awesome, fabulous customer service, I am in love with the antipasto salad. So delicious crisp and full of goodies. I could live on this alone !"}
{"text":"Welcoming vibe, friendly staff, delicious food, and way to close to my job. Food is always fresh and made to order, so prepare to wait a bit but dessert samples will make the wait fly by. The buffalo fries are currently my new obsession, I was stuck on the pizza fries until my need for something spicy kicked in. Buffalo fries and weekly specials plus the welcoming staff keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Rocco's is my go to joint for some quick good NY style pizza ... although im a CHICAGO pizza guy ...cut in SQUARES baby or STUFFED or DEEP DISH. ... ok ok back to ROCCO's it some good stuff and the prices are affordable. There is a pizza joint down the street from this location and they charge an arm and a leg for a pie and a salad. Check out Rocco's you might like it!!!"}
{"text":"This will be my last time here. Pizza is full of a ton of grease. The guys who make the pizza use their bare hands, then toggle back and forth to the cash register. Last night my pizza was just a puddle of grease, its not even edible. Their prices are outrageously expensive for the quality. Its the closest to my house but i think the pizza at the 7-11 is better quality now. This place has really gone down the tubes. Its just not what it used to be. A friend told me the one on S. Buffalo is the real Roccos to go. Something about a bad break up between then two guys. I also spent 18 bux on a veal parm sub. Seems a little pricey for the sub. It was good but not 18 dollar worth good. Their pizza is just a greasefest. It must just be really low end cheese to create that. My recommendation would be to go to Bambinos or East side for quality pizza. If you want really low end stuff that is over priced, come here and get some pizza that just sits out all day."}
{"text":"Meh.   Its ok.  I have lived in NY all my life.  Queens NY to be exact.  Anyway the food is average   My only problem.  The guy behind the counter I wish he would just smile more."}
{"text":"Just across the street from Redrock.  Good NY style pizza. Can't go wrong here!!!"}
{"text":"Whoa, amazing pizzeria that needs to work on to go packaging to prevent an oily drive home.  

I was feening for garlic knots all day and found this place on Yelp.  The nice man working let me sample the garlic rolls, they were mediocre.  I ordered a slice of pepperoni & sausage, a slice of cheese, and 6 garlic knots to go.  They packaged the garlic knots in foil, however, they don't wrap the pizza in foil, they simply put it on a paper plate and lay it in a brown bag.  The brown bag became soaked in oil, so I had to drive with one hand on the wheel and one hand holding the bag so the oil wouldn't leak in my car.  The whole drive home, I was paranoid from thinking the oil may start dripping on me/my car/my purse, etc, but it didn't.  Good thing I was wearing shorts because I had to wipe my hand clean (from the oil) on my leg and then take my car keys out of the ignition.  This was the messiest take out order I've ever encountered.  They should really wrap the pizza in foil.  I can just imagine there have been people who left the brown bag on a car seat, only to discover an oil mark on the upholstery or purse or clothing.  

Once I got home, I washed my hands and leg and dove into the pizza.  OMG-delish, this thin pizza packs a lot of flavor!  I usually like thick crust, but boy, this thin crust pizza is the bomb, the best I've ever had!  The marinara sauce for the garlic knots was on the bland side and the garlic knots itself was ok.  The bread was soft, but it lacked flavor.   

The pizzeria was extremely clean and they sold snacks, frozen food, and ice cream.  I liked the pictures they put on the wall.  There's plenty of seating both indoors and outdoors.  If you want GREAT pizza, come here!  Dine in if you don't want to experience a hectic oily drive home :)"}
{"text":"Found them on Yelp after a long day of moving & its right down the road from.our new apartmemt . Best pizza place we have been too since moving to Vegas !! & the fella here are so welcoming !! We shared a whole pizza and oh I fell in love with the crust haha We for sure will be back & this time dessert is on my check out list :)"}
{"text":"I was in the area with a friend & we wanted pizza...After checking my Yelp app, we chose this pizzeria because it was the closest to where we were. It's very small (setup primarily for take out), but it does have some tables in the back. After placing our order at the front counter, a large pepperoni pizza & anti pasta dish, we were disappointed to find that they don't sell any beer!

We waited for our pizza a little longer then I would've expected and on top of that we got our pizza first, before our antipasta dish. We had to ask about our antipasta dish, so I suspect they forgot. I'm sorry to say that we both felt that the pizza was just average, we liked the antipasta better. 

Being from the SF area, we've definitely had our share of good pizza and we were both disappointed. Furthermore, service was not their strength at all, but then again they are set-up more for take-out/delivery. In addition, I agree with other comments that it's pricey for what I consider to be very standard pizza. I wish I had gone a little further to New York Pizza & Pasta on Jones & Sahara (which I feel has delicious pizza)."}
{"text":"As always- the food was great! This is the original Rocco's owner- same as the one by costco on Charleston. Been going there for years and this one didn't disappoint. !"}
{"text":"Called in our order on NYE and it was ready as promised. The pizza was fantastic. Nice thin crust as we remember from NY. We also ordered wings. They were disappointing as to the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. They were small, meatless, and overcooked. I have had the fingers before and they are far better."}
{"text":"This place is great. We had a large group and ordered mozzarella sticks, fried zucchini, onion rings, the wild white pizza and an everything pizza. All the food was hot and delicious and the service was attentive without being overbearing. At the end of the meal, the manager came out and asked how everything was. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good fast and consistant been a customer for years and would recommend it to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Genuine NY thin crust pizza sold by the slice"}
{"text":"Nice little pizza place. We went for lunch and their by the slice is great for that. They heat up the slice in the pizza oven and it comes out perfect. I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"It was a Friday night. I've been to other Rocco's in LV, but this was my first at this location. I came in and I liked the design of the place. It felt like a bigger and spacier version of the pizzerias back east. The TV, however, was set to ESPN and not the YES Network like the Charleston location does. 
The pizza was good. The crust was tasty. 
The lasagna, I have to admit wasn't something to write home about. I've had better. Overall, I'd come back for more pizza but I will probably order the lasagna somewhere else."}
{"text":"What a freak show.  Waited for a pizza order and watched the counter guy getting his neck and cheeks rubbed by another guy who was wearing a grey coat and was obviously not working there at the time.  Another employee start laughing and a fight broke out behind the counter.  They carried the guy in the grey coat out the door and he was swearing up a storm.  The guy he punched eventually waited on me.  I don't know who owns this place but they need to know what happened and what a bunch of misfits are working there.  Great food.  Creepy employees.  Keep the recipe, get new help.  Others witnessed this crap.  Happened on Thursday around 7:30 pm.  Never again."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place doesn't have a higher rating. Best pizza in town! Excellent customer service! Always service with a smile!"}
{"text":"Rocco's is probably the best pizza you're going to find in the Aliante area of North Las Vegas. The slices are big, and they come somewhat close to resembling \"New York\" style. They expanded the small shop to include a dining room within the past year or so, so you can comfortably dine in here if you prefer. There are plenty of other options besides pizza (available by the slice), from hot Italian sandwiches to linguine with clam sauce. The pasta dishes are decent, priced a bit high, but the portions are quite large for one person. They also have gelato, which you're probably not going to find too many places around the area. The service is very friendly, alcohol available."}
{"text":"You want some great east coast pizza, the kind that you slightly bend to keep from folding downward at the tip of the slice?  This is definitely a nice neighborhood joint for some good pizza.  They sell it by the slice or whole pie and offer more than just pizza.  From appetizers like garlic knots to lasagna, they have some good italian cuisine.  They even have a fridge near the entrance with ready made lasagna and sauces for you to take home.  They even make gelato and sorbet! 

I ordered a pepperoni pizza to go and when I picked it up it was piping hot!  I had to have a slice in the car and it was yummy.  Nice, salty pepperoni and that grease that some people dab off on the cheese--yum yum yum!

It was good and well priced.  I haven't tried their other dishes, but there were lots of people sitting in their dining area eating pizza pockets and lasagna, so I'm assuming it's really good.

People have very different opinions about pizza, so you may not be the one to like greasy, thin crust, NY style pizza, but if you are give this place a try.  

PS: they also sell fresh pizza dough. just ask if you need some for a recipe of your own."}
{"text":"Not very happy with the pizza or thier service. Its just pretty plain and lacks flavor. The staff appears more interested in making you aware of thier tip jar then actually servicing the client. Made me very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"The veal parm arrived piping hot and was delicious! Authentic NY style pizza. Cannolis had a lot of filling! Overall good choice for an affordable delivery option."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas. It is the closest thing to NYC. The garlic knots are also wonderful. Love that you can get the pizza by the slice or take a pie to go."}
{"text":"The wings are great!  The Brooklyn pizza was great. The crust was crispy, the topping were generous and plenty of cheese.  Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"OMG. We had an extraordinary meal tonight.  The pizza, wings and zepollies could not have been any better.  No room for improvement. Monday is $9.99 large cheese pizza night. We did two of those, a large everything pizza, hot wings and a bag of zepollies.  All were sublime. Great value. $55 for the whole shebang. Great meal. Very nice people also. 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Good food, but the service is horrible! We have been sitting here for over an hour waiting for our food.  It took our waitress 45 minutes just to take our order. Absolutely awful."}
{"text":"Better than expected based on the reviews here. Having eaten lots of NYC pizza over the years, Rocco's is pretty close to a specific type there (there's no one style of NY pizza; don't believe the hype). Great crust, great sauce, decent meatballs - recommended & damn inexpensive too."}
{"text":"*****Dinner Special - $9.99*****

Not sure if it's limited time, but all dinners are 9.99.  Some are normally up to 14.99.  

I don't consider myself too asian, but the asian in me came out by quickly scanning the menu for the best value (which means finding the most expensive item - hehe)  Forget what i was in the mood for....find the most expensive items and then choose from there.  

For 10 bucks you can't complain.  I would have easily paid the 5 bucks more and been happy but I'll continue to go back for their affordable dinner specials.  

In addition to the dinners, we got a couple pizza slices - all excellent.  The crust was perfect with nice combo texture of crispness and chewiness.  

they were also sampling this dessert called zeppoles, which tasted like beignets, fried pizza dough with powdered sugar.  if i wasnt planning on going back, the 12 yr old side in me would have bolted out the door  with the tray."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place again. I ordered the white pizza, jalapeño poppers and fried oreos. So good! The white pizza was fresh and had a ton of riccota and flavor. The poppers were yummy too, didn't taste like the frozen kind you buy. I was very pleased!"}
{"text":"Depending on what you are looking it eat, depends on if the food is good or not. Have dined here several times and have tried several things off of the menu. There are a few items that stand out and a few items that need some help.

The one thing that is always constant is the service. The staff that works the register have always been extremely nice and helpful. 

The good:

Eggplant Parmesan Sandwich - Full of Eggplant and Mozzarella Goodness
Cheesesteak Sandwich - Full of Meat and Excellent Bread
White Pizza - Crust is Awesome

50/50 Dishes:

Rice Ball - Sometimes overly greasy & sometimes lacking flavor
Chicken Caesar Salad - Bland Chicken and sometimes too much or not enough dressing
Broccoli & Mozzarella Stromboli - Sometimes seasoned properly & sometimes not

Needs Help

Any of the pasta dishes - Pasta always overcooked and lacking solid flavoring

Overall we know what dishes work the best and we get those most of the time. It's close to our house and we like the employees, so we keep going back for more."}
{"text":"I grew up in New Jersey and Philadelphia and been in vegas since 96. I love their pizza at Rocco's. it reminds me of the pizzerias on the east coast. Service is not too friendly but not rude. Pizza is always good and empty pizza boxes are stacked tall. Reminds me of the east coast. Never tried anything but pizza but I love those pizzas"}
{"text":"This was my fav pizza in Vegas 2 years ago.  Last time I went it was fair (3 weeks ago).  I must have gotten older pizza that they warmed up.  It didn't taste like I remember.  I'll order a fresh pizza next time."}
{"text":"Love the food here but getting a little bothered by the pricing - order the same pie with maybe a different topping or so but the price is different each time - don't mind paying it but keep it the same each time - seems like the price depends on who is working the counter and is just made up - machine was down today so had to pay cash - was told one price payed and then told another and payed the extra but seemed a bit higher then normal - again love the food but just wish I knew what to expect"}
{"text":"This is a cozy Mom-n-Pop kinda place. Enjoyed some of the very best pizza and cannoli in all of Vegas. While I ate there a few days ago I had the pleasure to meet the owner, wonderful woman who you can tell pours her heart into this place! Cool wall deco, great ambiance, and an avid customer base that stays loyal--one visit and I know why!! I'll be back! :O)"}
{"text":"Pizza arrived cold and taste was ok. The wings were nice and crisp, which I like. The meatballs were average.

Now for the weird part. The next day, I had credit card fraud. The only time I give out cc info for purchases over the phone is for pizza delivery. I haven't ordered pizza in a while and it's usually online. Since the transaction went through, this means that the frauder knew my name, address and card number along with cvc. Coincidence?"}
{"text":"It's always hard to find a good pizza shop in las Vegas, it's usually hit or miss. Having said that, the food was surprisingly REALLY good! We had delivery, the guy said 45 minutes and he was on time. 

Me and my girlfriend split the white pizza and an order of plain chicken fingers. The white pizza with actually very good. It had ricatta and mozzarella cheese, canola oil with no marinara sauce. I think I found my new favorite pizza. The chicken fingers were perfectly cooked and lightly battered. I eat chicken fingers all the time when I have a cheat meal and these were worth it!

Overall I will definitely be a returning customer. Maybe next time I'll go and see what the atmosphere looks like inside."}
{"text":"Had them cater my daughters birthday. And everyone was raving about the food! Everything was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Shake my head, the service was awful.  I wasn't expecting an over the top greeting.  I was expecting the typical NY attitude,  \"What can I get you today?\".  Instead we heard, \"What do you want?\" with this miserable look on his face with the worst attitude. :[  I guess I shouldn't of assumed anything great for service.

I thought for the price of the pizza, the fact it's NY style pizza this would be a hit out of the ball park. WRONG!  I was very disappointed with the overall taste and consistency of the pizza sauce. It was BLAND, WATERY, and not what I expected since I lived in New England 22 years and never had a problem with screwing up pizza.  

  I ordered a Philly steak with prov and it was YOU GUESSED IT, WRONG.  It was was gross looking, never mind the taste.  The pizza had more flavor but not by much.  Overall very upset how much we spent, and the quality of food was piss poor.  

I know better than to butt heads with people that don't care about their job so I ate it and left pissed off and disappointed as usual.

I guess the next time I'm on the east coast I will remember to fill up on the Quahogs and NY STYLE PIZZA."}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer of Rocco's now for a little more than 2 years. This is as authentic to New York pizza as it gets.

Great service, very speedy, friendly staff."}
{"text":"I think this place has the best thin crust pizza in town. We've been here several times and their pizza never disappoints, the guys who work inside have always been good and friendly, and the value you get for your money is well worth giving this place a try (slices are pretty huge).

Not much else that needs to be said since the pizza here speaks for itself. I was just at Rocco's for lunch today and already want to go back just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery of a 14 inch pizza with extra sausage, & extra cheese, well done, pizza was cold when it arrived 1.25 hours later.

No tomato sauce, very little cheese and not well done.

Won't order here again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I always get a pepperoni and sausage pizza and it's always amazing. However, they use an outside delivery service which often times takes forever and your delicious pizza will arrive cold. It's close to my house so I always place my order over the phone and pick up twenty minutes later. The people are friendly and accommodating and it's a great casual place to eat with your family and friends. This place is a must try."}
{"text":"Soooooooo, while the food may be good, the customer that was evidently a regular was so loud and disturbing the whole dining area.  It would have been nice if the employees would step up and tell him to shut the hell up!  But they just let him be as loud and rude as he wanted to be!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from NY and so far this is my favorite pizza in Las Vegas especially the Sicilian Style haven't tried any other pasta macaroni dishes yet"}
{"text":"Man I swear, I haven't even been here since my last review. But my best friend Brooke wanted to come here for their chicken fingers on our break. So of course I went with her... she ordered 6 chicken fingers THAT'S IT NOTHING ELSE at 12:11pm she asked for them to be ready by 1230pm. I  mean of course that didn't happen, just like when i ordered my sandwich. They waited for Brooke to get there to even start the order who knows if this is their policy or what but we were only on a break from work (15 minutes) we work about 4 minutes away smh so we got there at 12:35pm and Brooke didn't even walk out of there till 12:54 PM it doesn't even take that long to make chicken fingers. I called and the \"manager\" (who seemed totally different from last time) told me he would make it up to Brooke... there's no way to make it up to brooke that we doubled our break time and had to count that as a lunch but thanks anyway!! Don't order, go here and expect it to be ready lol"}
{"text":"We received a flyer in our door so decided to give it a try.  A little underwhelming to say the least.   The driver had to call because she couldn't find the house on GPS.  We're not in a new neighborhood so there should have been no problem. She sounded frustrated on the phone and snapped at me to slow down when I tried to give directions. 

Pizza was cold when it got to us but despite that was still ok.  The mozzarella sticks were nothing to write home about.  The filling on the fried ravioli was good but the pasta wasn't crisp and needed more seasoning.  The marinara sauce was watery and bland.  It might have been better had everything been hot.  We might go in to eat but probably won't order delivery from there again."}
{"text":"I have to give a 3 star rating because of the poor service we received at this place.  

My family and I came here to celebrate my nieces birthday and ordered a ton of food and the guy was so rude.  

We ordered a few plates of pasta and 3 large pizzas  and the guy acted like it was such a hassle to give us extra plates and forks. Every time we asked for more forks he would look over at our pasta to see why we needed more."}
{"text":"Good tasting pizza,  it looked a little under cooked, but it was tasty. Maybe it was my fault, because i like a little crispy, and forgot to mention to them on the phone. Thanks."}
{"text":"I've had the pizza as well as a veal sorrentino. The pizza is good. Can't say that it stands out from most other places, but it's definitely worth trying at least once. The veal sorrentino was good. A big portion. I could only finish half. I'd be interested in trying other entrees. The calzones were oozing with cheese. Seemed like a ton of cheese. If you're into cheese you'd love a calzone. Prices were reasonable and there were a few specials. If you've wanted to try this place, I'd say it is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Usually I swing in here for the 2 slices and a drink special for lunch which is always on point, love the pizza here. This time after work I decided to go with the peppers, onions, and sausage stromboli. The crust was the best part of the dish. The peppers was close to being raw, if they would just saute the peppers a little it would make a huge difference!! 
So stay with the pizzas here and you will be in good shape. Plus they carry italian rainbow cookies, warning they are kinda a let down if you like American cookies, but they are good to get at least once."}
{"text":"The customer service was beyond wonderful and the staff is extremely friendly.  Even my little 5 year old was touched that they took such good care of us.  The food is excellent and my family and I are so lucky to live so close.   We've been back more than a handful of times in the last couple of months.  Definitely recommend their pizza!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza place. The food is good and not too expensive, the sample dessert thingies are AMAZING, And the pizzas are gigantic. A great place to go for pizza."}
{"text":"I've had worse pizza but not much worse. Dry, tasteless, skimpy toppings. The sausage was thin-sliced god-knows-what sausage with no flavor.  A good sausage pizza has crumbled tasty Italian sausage with a hint of fennel. Have eaten at other Rocco's locations. The food was edible. Take a pass on this one."}
{"text":"Just so that everyone knows, the owner tried to get in touch with me right away.  It seemed that he was willing to rectify my issue right away.  Unfortunate, and sorry Mr. Owner, my life has been just too busy and too much time has pasted to still cry about water under the bridge.  But a HUGE thanks for trying to contact me..."}
{"text":"Be prepared to spend a lengthy amount of time WAITING for your food here!

I've been here twice and I had to wait a while both times.  First time it was 20 minutes.  Second time it was 50 minutes!

First time:
I was grabbing food from L &L next door and my wife wanted pizza.  So she goes in and orders two slices of white pizza and the zappoles fried donut powdered sugar things.

We waited over 20 minutes for her order.  There is no place to wait for your order in the front. It is like trying to smash 20 people into a refrigerator box.  The owners really need to rethink the shelves full of groceries lining the front counter.  There is NO ROOM. Especially when it is crowded. 

The white pizza was good, the zeppoleswere AMAZING!  A whole brown bag full for under $5. Not bad.

Second time:
We ordered a white pizza and a meatball pizza TO GO.  They said it would be ready in 20 minutes.

Well, I arrived 20 minutes later and waited another 50 minutes for my pizza to be made.  Apparently the guy making the pizza mistook it for a meatball sandwich and didn't make it until 30 minutes in.  While my white pizza stood in a box on top the oven for 30 minutes to cool down.  No real apology from the guy at the register either after they realized.

When I finally got my pizza and left, the meatball pizza was UNDERCOOKED / Doughy and the white pizza was COLD.  Big FAIL!

Imagine having to stand in a long, thin corridor with other people waiting for their orders like me and others trying to order and make it to the back of the dining room.  GET RID OF THOSE GROCERY SHELVES PLEASE!  There needs to be more room, it's almost like a fire hazard.  People were tripping over each other and myself and my very patient son.

My impression of Rocco's was that that it was a stand-only-waiting-room-of-semi-organized-chaos-in-crowded-hell.

I'd rather have Dominoes, Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Costco Pizza, Round Table Pizza, Saborros Pizza or even Mark Riches Pizza.  At least they have their shtuff together and you get what you order in a timely manner."}
{"text":"The place is in a great location.  We ordered chicken fingers medium and the pizza special.  The chicken fingers were horrific.  There was way too much salt.  At one point, it tasted like I bit into a salt chunk.  They also gave us a prepackage of ranch.  They don't make their own ranch?  Fingers were overcooked.  The pizza had the texture of cardboard.  I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love this place. When I moved to this side of town from Summerlin I was bummed to have to drive so far to get my favorite pizza and now it's right down the street. I have been going to this family run pizzeria for 7 years and I have never had a bad pizza. And their calamari is bomb! I love Rocco's it's da real deal!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and pasta in North Las Vegas! I've been here many times and it's consistently good. Great food and great prices. The service is quaint and friendly. When I move to the south side of town, I will most definitely make my way back for the lunch specials and for dinner, perfectly cooked salmon with homemade creamy pesto sauce and penne pasta."}
{"text":"For the second time in as many weeks we have had great difficulty in placing an order over the phone.  Just tonight, around 5:30 pm, when we called we were asked if we could be placed on hold.  Of course, we said yes.  And then we waited, and waited, and waited.  So, we hung up and called again.  When asked if we could be put on hold we said No we were just on hold and noone helped us.  So the girl began to take our order.  Unfortunately, we didn't get to complete our order because they somehow disconnected us.  My recommendation is not to place an order, ever, over the phone with Rocco's!"}
{"text":"4/5
Rocco's has a Monday cheese pizza special that we enjoy: 1 large cheese = $10. The pizzas are generally hot enough, the price is right, and the crust is chewy and delicious. Pretty good pizza, though not Chicago style = my favorite.  The fist time I ordered a sausage pizza from Rocco's, I thought it was ham.  I tried ordering sausage again and it was the same. Apparently, the thin sausage slices they use remind me more of ham, and are not very flavorful.  I hope Rocco's changes their sausage because I really do enjoy the other components of their pizza. For now, I'll stick with the cheese :-)"}
{"text":"Don't bother. I don't know what it is about this location that made it such a bad experience. Maybe it was the sewer smell walking in or the fact that the Stromboli I ordered tasted like a trash can do I threw 7/8 of it away and took a walk. Either way I'll stick with the Roccos on rainbow by my house. Thus charleston outfit needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"Been meaning to check this spot out for a while now. 

I'm a big fan of mom n pop pizza places. They are usually much better than the chain spots and your business is appreciated.  Rocco's is a pretty standard pizzeria, offering subs, pastas, desserts and of course pizza with a wide assortment of toppings and sauces. They have an interesting spin on a bloody mary where you can get their vodka infused meat sauce; definitely want to try that out next time I stop by. They put their actual ingredients out on a shelf for everyone to see, its reassuring and good to know that the food is made from scratch. 

I was looking for a quick lunch and I had the $5 pizza special: 2 slices of cheese and soda, I added pepperoni for a buck more. The pizza was ok... very greasy and floppy, could have used a few more minutes in the oven. The slices were big and I was satisfied but not impressed. Avoid getting ranch if you like that with your pizza, for .85 cents they gave me a store bought pack of salad dressing. SMH

Overall the pizza was average but the menu holds promise, warranting a second trip in the near future."}
{"text":"My family loves this pizza place, we order a large cheese pizza from here at least once a month! The pizza is good and they have a fast turn around time with their deliveries. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good pie:)"}
{"text":"Good pie, our go to in NLV. Quality ingredients, large slices!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the food, five stars for the service. They deserve ten stars at Rocco's! 
We started with the onion rings which were seriously the best onion rings I've had since I can remember. Next we had the antipasto salad, which unfortunately was their one \"miss\" of the night. The lettuce was pretty wilted and brown, and it didn't have any dressing. The waitress offered us ranch or blue cheese. I asked if we could get the dressing an antipasto usually comes with and she said \"Well is don't eat it\". It also had kidney and garbanzo beans listed on the menu and we asked for those to be taken off, and she said \"Whatever barbanzo beans are\" and kind of rolled her eyes. The service fell short in that she wasn't knowledgeable about the menu at all. We ended up sending the salad back because it was just gross. 
Our pizza choice was a large meat lovers, and it was amazing. When our pizza came out, Rangel, the GM came to check on us. He asked about the service and could tell that we felt it was questionable. He explained that there was a discount for first time customers and told us he would check on us again. Our drinks weren't refilled until one of us approached the server and asked for them to be filled which is a pet peeve. The pizza was amazing. I don't love pizza-I didn't grow up eating it often because my Dad was stationed in Italy and was particular about pizza. This pizza would have met Dad's stringent expectations. The crust was thin and soft, and the toppings were plentiful. It was delicious. We boxed it up and took two mini cannolis to go. They were the real deal! I got mini cannolis because most places hit the mark on the cream. These were perfect, and I wish I'd gotten the full size ones. The cream was amazing and the shell was perfectly flaky. Oh and that first time discount? 15%! It definitely made up for the other gaps in service. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Rocco's is my spot! When it comes down to pizza they make one of the best tasting pizzas in town. My family has been going here for years now and we've never been disappointed. Trust me and get a Ham & Mushroom pizza, and some of the spicy chicken tenders, and don't get me started on the Canolis, hands down best canolis in town!

Their sandwiches are also good, try the Eggplant Parmesean Sandwhich, you'll love it.

Seems like Rocco's NY Pizzeria brought a little piece of NY to Vegas with them. Prices are reasonable, and they're fast, even on a football sunday or monday you can get your pizza in about 20 min. Dont think they have delivery but that's not bad when thee food tastes this good.

I could go on but if you're like me you don't wanna read an essay and just want to know if the food is good. so go to Rocco's now!"}
{"text":"The food here is definitely lacking flavor. Tried the pizza and was extremely disappointed. It had no flavor and was extremely greasy. The cheese was gross & heavy. Also tried the garlic knots and again, no flavor. It just tasted like dough. The marinara also had no flavor. It was like their concept was good but they didn't season anything.

Great location, bad pizza & garlic knots.

The counter guy was nice. 

The hallway and bathroom smell horrible."}
{"text":"A great local ma and pa pizza shop with delicious wings and other pastas. My fiancé loved the garlic knots. Good job fellas keep it up"}
{"text":"The garlic knots are so good and they are complimentary which is even better. The pizza was a very generous size and very tasty. I got Pepperoni and my boyfriend got the Meat Lover's, both sides were awesome. The service was excellent and the food came out quickly and piping hot. I would recommend this location to my friends."}
{"text":"Thank you Rocco's pizza, you have made me realize that I CAN make my own lasagna!
Here's our story: We've been eating at Rocco's pizza ever since they opened, when the restaurant was only half the size. We went there with friends all the time, unfortunately that will not happen again... 9 out 10 times I ordered the lasagna. It used to be the best in town! Used to be.  As the years gone by, so did the taste of the food. Finally I have decided to write a review because our last order was not eatable. My lasagna was dry like the desert. Once I added marinara sauce and cheese, I was able to eat some of it from the middle. The garlic knots however, were hard as a rock. Seriously - not over baked, just solid rock hard. No worries, I made some garlic toast at home.
What happened Rocco's pizza?  Be careful with the food quality because people might stop eating there."}
{"text":"Really excellent NY Pizza. It's great because it's family owned and operated and we like supporting our local spots. This is a small location and can probably only seat a maximum of 10-12 people. Thin crust, light sauce, fresh ingredients. $20 for a large pizza. It feeds about three people. It might be on the pricier side but the quality is worth it."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!!! So delicious,  we absolutely love it.  The service could be improved.  Actually,  the men we've spoken to when we go in,  or over the phone are very friendly and make you want to come back.  The servers though,  are women,  and are horribly rude and and have no concept of customer service.  We would dine in more,  but every time we have a bad experience because of our server,  so we've resolved to just use take out.  Even when they answer the phone,  they are appalling.  The fid is worth it though.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean restaurant, pricey food but you definitely get what you pay for here and you're paying for the quality which is top notch! I eat here many times a month and I'm always recommending it to friends and people visiting."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza!! Great service from all of the staff. They were busy, but treated us like family the whole time. People were constantly coming in to pick up their to go orders. They were fast and efficient, the pizza was cooked perfectly. We sat in the dining area in the back and we couldn't have been happier. The staff was very attentive to our needs every step of the way. The young man that helped us made our visit even more pleasant. And the Pizza!! Just wow!! Full of flavor, perfect on the amount of each topping, we got the large everything pie. Kids got a pepperoni and we didn't have leftovers for the first time in a long time. If you haven't been here, you need too. It's worth every penny. Did I mention the pizza was good? Maybe I should keep this one a secret...too late now"}
{"text":"Now this place is the REAL DEAL!
I moved to Las Vegas in 2003, took me years to find a great pie. I absolutely love this place and you will too!"}
{"text":"I hate to complain, said everybody who complained, ever.

Saw the student special in the window, asked about the student special and ordered the student special. 2 slices and a drink for around $5 !!

Finished my pizza and left only to realize they charged me the ADULT UNSPECIAL which was around $8 and came with a side of confusion. I had a back pack on... how do i not scream STUDENT SPECIAL ?!

They also turned off their fountain pop machine after I had filled my drink. I have no idea why. Maybe saving their carbonation for later :D"}
{"text":"Rocco's has been on the radar for far too long, so when deciding to order delivery (pizza) & wanting real pizza (not one from a Hut) my family & I went for it. Stayed with the basics to accommodate a variety of people. Cheese & Pepperoni to be exact. Like I said, basic, but great benchmarking material! If they can't make it good without tchotchkes then...

Anywho, both were good. Pepperoni was the greasy kind my fella likes. The crusts weren't too thick, not too thin, but just right. Crisp. Good cheese level. They arrived in exact time that they stated, still hot & as we ordered. Prices were reasonable- even their extra toppings & I love their gourmet toppings list. All good! Though I must admit, I have affinity for that hut- kind of pizza every so often, this was a good exchange for NY style pizza. Glad to have a good neighborhood spot that we can all agree on."}
{"text":"One of my favorite NY style pizza places! Amazing 'zeppoles' along with good traditional thin slices of pizza."}
{"text":"I've been scouting around for a good New York style pizza-by-the-slice place in Vegas, and Rocco's more than fits the bill. Slices are larger than a typical New York slice and sauce/crust is perfectly proportioned. Met the owner too, great guy. 5 stars all around."}
{"text":"It has been difficult for us to find yummy food in Vegas. This place has excellent pasta. Upscale taste! We are pasta lovers and this place has wonderful fettuccine alfredo as well as shrimp fettuccine in a wine sauce! Delivery is super prompt."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars but unfortunately not an option.  I called today (a Tuesday) at 4:30 for a delivery and the Store Manager refused to deliver stating it was out of the area; we live 4.7 miles from the store!!!  I stated we would pay extra for out of range, he still refused!!!  I then explained how they've delivered to us on several different occasions, he still refused!!!  We have had terrible Customer Service before but this was the final straw...so if you're willing to deal with a business that does not care for their customers....well good luck."}
{"text":"Went for a slice of white pie. Ordered 2 slices they are huge. It was delicious.  Good service on a busy Saturday night. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Extraordinary pizza!   Outstanding crust.  Finished off everything with an equally outstanding cannoli. Wish we had this place back in LA.  Go here!!"}
{"text":"I give it 2 because i usually like their pizza and would try again, but DON'T order online a few hours in advance and DON'T order the wings. For some reason, they must not have noticed that I was picking up at 4:45 so DON'T cook till later, or did but didn't care to wait, and made the order when it was placed online. The wings were like eating chicken jerky with hot sauce on them. HORRIBLE. They must have been cooked earlier and kept under a heat lamp the entire time or they just over cooked them. I admit, I was about 20 minutes late to pick up the food, however, they still wouldn't have been that overcooked and the pizza wouldn't have been so soggy and not so \"fresh.\" Also, I should have checked the pizza when I picked it up when you give me the line \"that the internet wasn't working and they couldn't call me to verify I was coming to pick up the order.\" Not happy this time!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite pizza places in Vegas. A lot of places are alike but this place has a unique flavor of its own reminding me of my trips to New York when I was younger. Definitely gonna be a return customer"}
{"text":"There's something so authentic about this place. The food was great and all the pictures gave me a real sense of history."}
{"text":"The smells are wonderful.  Cannot wait to taste!  The employees are not to friendly at first. They seemed impatient when were we trying to decide on what to order.  Hope the food is outstanding to make up for the employees.
Well sorry to say the pizza was old. We ordered a pepper and egg sandwhich and that was good."}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza. Probably one of the best spots for it. Honestly, I've been here and Secret Pizza for NY style and I prefer Rocco's. Wings are great, too!"}
{"text":"It was our first time there, the pizza is average. The garlic knots are under cooked, I ordered a large garlic knots (12) and I got 7!
Tiramisu was ok."}
{"text":"This place has very good NY style pizza I grew up just outside of New York City so I like to believe I have a decent idea of what good NY style pizza is. Not to mention the lunch specials they have are pretty decent. Nice amount of seating now that they opened it up. It's also nice to see the same waitress every time we go and we only go every few months. Very friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"Was ok. Not the best but not the worst.  They sell pizza by the slice which I like. The lunch special was $5.99 for 2 slices and a fountain soda.  They sell some italian canned goods and pasta. I got the white pizza. It was just ok. It needed a little something. I don't like to add garlic or grated cheese to my pizza. I like when it doesn't need anything. For some reason he delivered other customers food but called me to come get mine. I thought that was strange.  Maybe he was annoyed I asked what he thought was better, the cheese or white."}
{"text":"Good pizza . Went in for the all you can eat which is around 8 bucks .. But they tax u for pizza topping and pasta sauces ... Is it worth it not to me . Salad is mediocre , pasta was average , pizza was amazing tho"}
{"text":"Third times a charm? This makes three times I have seen a pizza spot in this location. I stopped in and ordered a \"Monday's Special\" which is a large cheese pizza for $9.99 and additional toppings are extra. Inside was very busy so I guess others are wanting to this place out too. While I was waiting for my pizza, I noticed they have pizza by the slice for sale. I asked if they could add a slice of Sicilian (cheese) to my order priced at $3.25 and make it to-go. My husband isn't a fan of a lot of sauce on a pizza, but I'm the opposite. I asked for a side of sauce (cost .85 cents) to go along with my pizza for dipping and it and I ended up really liking the flavor. The pizza had a thin crust and the right amount of cheese for it. The pizza wasn't very greasy at all and hubby and I both enjoyed it. The Sicilian slice tasted great and had the crisp crust it should, but I was a but disappointed when I got home and opened the paper bag it was in and it was just on a paper plate inside the bag. They did just open, so it's possible they ran out of to-go boxes, but I hope it's not this way all the time. The Sicilian slice was actually my favorite part. The employees were nice and with the different specials they have going on and the food being decent, I can see coming back.

Most pizza joints have a \"slice special\" and it has a certain time it runs and sometimes only on certain days. Well, here you can get 2 slices and a drink for $5.50 7 days a week anytime. I thought it was a plus that I could get a slice special for dinner instead of just a restricted lunch time special. Aside from pizza they also have wings, fingers, salads, strombolis, pasta, sandwiches and desserts. They also cater."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizzerias in Las Vegas. Everything I ordered was made fresh. Staff was friendly and made sure food quality didn't miss a beat."}
{"text":"I know all of the Rocco's around town get confused by other people thinking they are all the same restaurant and owners. They aren't. Please don't confuse this Rocco's with the one on Buffalo near Charleston because they don't have anything to do with each other. 

Walking in I noticed they have 2 sides. The right of the restaurant is for customers that are dining inside (they have an all you can eat buffet all day for $8.49 plus tax) and the left side is for placing and picking up to-go orders. The people working were very friendly. The lady who helped me went over the specials and told me what was most popular. I ordered the 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink special and waited for my order. The guy making pizzas took some slices and put them in the oven for reheating. He asked me how I was and was courteous. After he boxed up my slices I was on my way. 

2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink ($6.49) - The price threw me off a bit at first. It's kind of high compared to the average $4.99 - $5.99 cost for this type of common special at other pizza joints around town. Then I saw how big the pizza slices were and figured the price was actually on point so long as the pizza tasted good. Too bad the pizza didn't taste good. Yes, the slices are huge and I was impressed  by that, but just because the slices are huge doesn't mean the pizza is going to taste good. There was a good amount of cheese however it tasted rubbery and when I took the second bite all of the cheese came right off the top. The pizza lacked flavor and I didn't even eat the second slice. I gave this place a try and while the people working inside are very friendly, I have definitely experienced better pizza elsewhere."}

{"text":"I've only eaten the garlic knots here, but they are yummy! I think they deliver also."}
{"text":"This is our go to pizza place for take out in Summerlin. The pizzas are really good. No other words need apply."}
{"text":"I have always had great Italian food here.  Chicken Parmesan , chicken francese and chicken piccata are all excellent.  Prices are not inexpensive but each meal is normally good for two small meals.  I really enjoy their philly cheese steaks here.  The bread they use on the cheesesteaks are absolutely amazing.  I think they get the bread delivered here fresh daily because it is always greAt.  Employees are always friendly and welcome you at the door."}
{"text":"After almost a year, decided to try this place again. It was a random, last minute choice. Noticed they remodeled the place...NICE! 

My group of 6 and I, decided to dine in. Place looked very welcoming and so, why not?! Our server (didn't get his name) young guy was extremely helpful and was very attentive of our needs. Immediately took our drinks orders, and brought out a basket of garlic knots-on the house! Knots were fresh out of the oven, cheesy and soft. 4/5. 

I ordered their chicken fingers and fries from the lunch menu and they were BOMB.COM! Someone in my group ordered wings and a pep Stromboli, but they were not too pleased. The server never failed to come for refills and was on point at all times. 

I've tried them prior to remodeling and have always been satisfied with their pizza. Today's visit also was pleasant. Overall, 3/5."}
{"text":"This was literally the best pizza I have ever had in Vegas. It's greasy, cheesy, and the crust is amazing. 

The environment is wonderful. Full of awesome sports stuff and it's a nice, open floor. Our server was Rachel and she was seriously the sweetest person ever. I absolutely love her. 

If you're looking for amazing pizza...you've found it."}
{"text":"The restaurant was dirty. The tables were all crumby even though they were all empty.  The floors needed a power wash. The ceiling was leaking water down the wall into a dirty garbage can. The guy behind the counter was stuffing his face the entire 25 minutes we were there and talking with his mouthful to incoming customers. My stomach was turning when I noticed that he never washed his hands between eating and serving. I was also disappointed with the taste of the pizza. We could have ordered Dominoes and I would have been happier. I won't return for sure."}
{"text":"Pretty good...I had the shrimp basket along with the caprese salad which was yummy!! My husband had 2 slices of pizza which was tasty."}
{"text":"Another great dinner at Rocco's staff treats you like family when you walk thru the door. All employees are happy and friendly. The food is always as expected DELICIOUS!!Thanks Rocco's for another great dinner with the family!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time ordering from here through Door Dash. I ordered the garlic knots, fried calamari and the baked ziti. The garlic knots were bland but I was hoping to salvage it with a rich red sauce. The \"marinara\" they provided was so watered down. Couldn't stomach it. A good red sauce is essential for calamari as well, which unfortunately was the same watered down sauce they provided with the knots. Instead of a couple fresh lemon wedges for the calamari they provided a bottled lemon juice type liquid in a plastic container. The baked ziti was ok at best. I should've just stuck with Metro Pizza. I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Thin crust NY Pie.... sign me up!! Mostly good reviews, sounds good to me. So I call in a order. 

I go in pick it up and take it home. Uhhhh... yeah. Why is it so crispy? I've had pizza in NY (Little Italy) and it wasn't like eating cardboard. Why all the great reviews??? I just thought it was meh. Oh and the caesar salad, I get better caesar salads in a bag at the store. 

I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Made an order here on Super Bowl Sunday at around 2 pm and asked it be ready by 3:10 pm, and they were spot on with the timing. I arrived at 3 pm and my pizza was in the oven and my wings were being fried up. The wings were mediocre and there weren't many options for sauces - but yea it's a pizza place and not a wing place.

The pizza itself was quite tasty. I had them put on roasted garlic, pepperoni, prosciutto, and artichokes, which turned out really great. Additionally, the crust nice and crispy. There were also some pretty good garlic knots, as well as this really tasty rice ball, which contained rice, a couple cheeses, and was deep fried. That might have been the stand out item I had there.

It's likely that we will try this place again, as it certainly beats delivery pizza (though I am a sucker for pan pizza)."}
{"text":"Remaining fair and honest, when reviewing eating establishments throughout the valley, will inevitably bring you to one of those moments like I am experiencing right now.

I do honestly like Rocco's NY Pizzeria, their pizza is good and their pasta is as well, but I must honestly admit that the authentic New York ambiance of Rocco's, with it's decidedly acerbic nature, is the biggest draw for me. Being a native of the Midwest, I will forever remain unaccustomed to rude and impatient New Yorkers - but I love that.

Taking this into account, I am inclined to look favorably on any establishment where I can experience a little east coast attitude. Often times it will play a role in my overall rating of an eatery, as it did in my first review of Rocco's.

Since my initial visit, I have returned a few more times to sample the various wares. It was after these visits that I began to form the theory above, as I realized that the food is not great, but in fact, just good. 

On my most recent visit I ordered the rigatoni with sausage, mushrooms and what was supposed to be hot cherry peppers. What I got was a sloppily presented carton of rigatoni with the sausage, mushrooms and peppers decidedly bunched together in one large clump - oh, and with jalapenos, not cherry peppers. The sauce was okay, but not extraordinary and certainly not enough to distract from the presentation. 

Don't get me wrong, I understand that Rocco's focus is more toward convenience than elegance, but I can never excuse sloppiness in presentation. It doesn't need frills, but a little dried Italian herb sprinkling with some parmesan would at least make the meal look appetizing.

Rocco's offers typical, convenient and good Italian dishes that you would expect from a New York Style deli, but that's only going to get them a 3 star rating."}
{"text":"If anyone loves the way the pizza taste in New York, then you will love this place. Ever since I took a vacation to New York and had their pizza I've been trying to find a place down here that compares to it. And although this is still not New York pizza it comes pretty damn close. I've actually stopped looking and this is now the only place I will get pizza in Las Vegas. Excellent place and the people there are very friendly."}
{"text":"this was my second trip here. I wanted to give Rocco's another chance since my first visit was disappointing. Having been to a different location and enjoying it, I will not be returning here. The guy taking the order was a bit rude. Not just to me but others in line as well. The pizza was sickening, overwhelmed with grease it took any other flavors from the other ingredients right out of the picture."}
{"text":"I like Rocco's. It's good, local made pizza and pasta. Their pizza is good, but their pasta is better. Lot's of flavor with a freshness which is so often lacked in chain store pizzas. Never eat chain store pizza, what a waste of time. If you are within 5 miles of the Aliante then you need to make Rocco's one of your choices for Italian. 

Here is a little strange tidbit about Rocco's. I give their fresh pizza about 3 and 1/2 stars. However, I give their day old pizza (you know, the stuff that sits in the box all night and you warm it up in the toaster the next day) 5 out of 5 stars. It is by far the best day old pizza I have ever had. The crust has an excellent flavor the next day. I think I am going to have to buy two pizzas from now own, one to eat fresh and one for the next day."}
{"text":"Ever have one of those nights where you walk into a place that looks like it's either closed or no good and be totally surprised? That was my experience at Rocco's.  This place really looks like a hole in a strip mall. The busy dining space is hard to see when you walk in. You will slowly take in all this place has to offer (a freezer filled with gelatio, ice cream, sauces, desserts; stacks of pasta and canned Italian goods; an amazing menu of pizza, pasta and more. I got their calzone-like item. It was filled with broccoli and very yummy with their Marinara; though I wanted more cheese and garlic in it!  

Can't wait to try more here!"}
{"text":"I'm very impressed with not only the food but the owners as well. I've tried the pizza and the meatball sandwiches and they are outstanding. I've been there twice (first time for the sandwich) and when I told them I was moving to the area later this year they went out of their way to get my business. It worked, the pizza was so good I went back a couple of days later and ordered again. Food is 4.5 stars and service is 5 star. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas, hands down.  Gets busy on Friday nights, so plan accordingly if you are going to pick up a pie."}
{"text":"I'm an east coaster and pizza snob. This is one of two places I'll eat pizza from. And, like any good east coast pizzaria, I find that ordering a \"slice\" taste better there than the pies taken home. I find them bigger and just better. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the pasta dishes aren't as great as jersey/ new York and the sandwiches are good but not as great as the delis back east. Overall, my favorite pizza if I can't make it back east.l"}
{"text":"Rocco's NY Pizza has the best pizza in the city bar none!! As a lover of pizza I found that the crust and sauce are second to none as well as the entire menu including the Fried Calamari. My family took home a couple pieces of Tiramisu for desert as well! Can't wait for my next visit and if you are considering pizza please give Rocco's a try you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Rocco's has some of the best buffalo wings I've ever eaten.  We love them at our house.  For some reason they don't offer celery or carrots and I wish that they did.  They wait staff is always attentive when I dine in.  They also have a great Greek salad.  I haven't been very impressed with their pizza or calzones.  The pizza is extremely greasy and a lot of the time the crust isn't cooked all the way through so it's nice and soggy.  I've ordered their calzones before and the insides are always cold and the marinara sauce they serve with it is a flavorless disappointment.  I will still continue to go there for wings and the Greek salad but as far as the pizza goes, I will head somewhere else."}
{"text":"Good food ! Great service! Amanda is the best!"}
{"text":"Ive said it before and Ill say it again...White Pizza! Rocco's is one of the two pizza joints ill hit up when the pie craving hits. They make a great pie, and the price is right. You can of course order pizza whole or by the slice which is nice if I don't want to down a 12+ inch pie by myself, and the slice is generous. Rice balls and fried eggplant are also available among other things. I come here for the pizza so that's what im sticking to, and they do it well."}
{"text":"New York Vibe and that includes the attitude of the staff. Pizza is good but the employees come off irritated and rude."}
{"text":"The worst pizza place ever! We ordered online and was charged $30+ dollars for dinner just to find out that their website was down \"allegedly\" I would think if a pizza business was down and their website wasn't working properly, they would have that be known on their website. I never got my pizza, I was charged still, and the guy who works at the place was super rude and useless. He was not helpful. He told me to call the number that was on the site that I ordered from (which was their own site) to tell them I didn't get my pizza which conveniently was around the same time they were closing. Never again."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this New York style pizzeria.  The service is quick and the food is tasty.  The employees are always happy, friendly, and working hard.  And there is always a basket of delicious zeppoles at the counter.  The parking is easy and this is definitely go to place when we want pizza at home.  They get minus one star for no delivery, but I would recommend for anyone looking for a casual and local pizza place."}
{"text":"The baked ziti was not very good... It was basically just the noodles with cheese, no sauce. My husband ordered the cheese ravioli with marinara sauce and they gave him meat sauce. The ravioli was pretty much all ground beef and what tasted like ragu sauce. This was after waiting over an hour for our food to be delivered. There is a $3 charge for delivery, they only deliver within a 5 mile radius, and a $20 min charge. Overall, we were not impressed and will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"The location by Aliente is the only one I will every go to. This location is very lazy and disorganized. Ordered pepperoni on half. Only apperared on 1/4. The had to call me twice to confirm the order. And then left out half of my order when I picked it up. I paid for what they had ready and left with out the other half of my order. 
Long story short, go to north Las Vegas location and save yourself the trouble. The staff there are phenomenal!!!!"}
{"text":"Yes....this place was WOW!

We practically lived here for a week......we were without water and gas and this was around the corner.   The staff is the best and they bust butt......place is clean.  If you eat in......they are very attentive and you do not go away hungry.

Nice thin crust pizza makes a perfect veggie pizza.....oh and the Garlic Knots/Sliders.......OMG.  I don't even like meat, and I craved these for weeks.  Salads are always fresh and made to order......the one thing I regret, is never having the Breakfast."}

Rocco's NY Pizzeria makes you feel like family as well as provides outstanding service.  Not only was their customer service impeccable but were also kind enough to accommodate a last minute group of 14!  We ordered several pizzas, linguini marinara, and buffalo wings.  The owner was kind enough to throw in garlic knots and zeppoles.  Omg was the food amazing!  I am not from Las Vegas but if I am in town I will definitely eat here again and will highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Cute little place. Really good NY style pizza (had the large cheese pizza), not greasy at all. Zeppoles were fresh and delicious (had samples and ended up getting a bag).  Would recommend this place if you need a pizza fix."}
{"text":"I don't know what people are talking about. Being from NJ I can tell you this is NOT good NY style pizza. It's the kind of pizza you get in NY and then never return to that place again. I tried the regular and the white pizza. The white pie had no flavor, no garlic no salt, nothing. The regular pie had hardly any sauce, and the crust was hard as a rock. I hope there are better places for \"NY style\" pizza in the area.  We left hungry. They also messed up our order so it took about twenty minutes to get four slices of pizza warmed up.

Also they weren't wearing gloves or anything. Maybe I'm a stickler but I don't like people touching my food with their hands and then touching everything else in the kitchen. Gross."}
{"text":"Was better when Rocco owned it. New owners have made it mediocre at best. Service is not good. Staff acts like you are bothering them. Delivery gets overwhelmined easily."}
{"text":"The pizza is very NY authentic! Delicious other menu items like those powdered sugar dough bites...they sometimes offer those for free samples! 

Staff is NY as well! They also sell sauces and other Italian items too. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A must have authentic NY pizza.  I love it and eat there all the time (when not on diet)."}
{"text":"Ordering was pretty easy this time.  They put everything in a box this time which was convenient.  The Toasted ravioli was good however i wish they said on menu whether it was meat or cheese (it was cheese).  They also offer CJ's italian ice."}
{"text":"Quick one here....went back since we were up that way and the place kicked butt again. Robin was as sweet as always, food was awesome-except the garlic knot sliders, they were AMAZINGGGGGGGGGG.
Great food, sincere staff and a nice place. Im gonna keep comin back!"}
{"text":"Review on Pizza:

Ordered two pizza's and a side of garlic knots.

Pizza 1: Name didn't look familiar looking back on the menu now but it was basically a meatlovers. Meats were OK.

Pizza 2: Fresca Pizza I did not recognize the 3 cheeses mentioned.

Garlic Knots: Good but I like mine more slathered with butter oil and garlic. 

Dough crust on the crispy flatter side, difficult for toppings to stand up to the dough which broke while eating the pie. Lacks true flavor marriage of ingredients."}
{"text":"My husband and I were so happy when they opened this deli.  We moved away from their other location and were bummed that we can't get good pizza on this side of town. 
My husband is from NY and he gives this place two thumbs up. It reminds him of home. 
Amazing food. Everything in the menu is great. Really!!!"}
{"text":"I really like Rocco's, it was one of the first places my family and I tried upon our arrival here in Las Vegas two months ago.  HOWEVER, I suppose today wasn't a good day.  I ordered a Stromboli and garlic knots online at EAT24 at 135pm.  The food was promised at 205pm.  At 229pm, I still had not received my order.  I called Rocco's and spoke with a manager (Robert) who told me the Stromboli I ordered is cooked fresh and takes about 20 minutes.  I completely understand, however it was almost an hour.  He apologized and basically said the delivery man should be knocking at my door any minute.  It wasn't until the end of the conversation, when he sensed I still was not happy with his response, he then offered to take 10% off my NEXT order...next order...that's a pretty BIG assumption that I'm going to order from you again.  Sadly, this evening (on the same day as my order) I had already planned to order a pizza for my family for dinner, I may revise that plan.  I will give them one more chance to earn my business, they are always kind when I go to the restaurant; anyone can have an off day..but surely for an hour and ten minute wait (finally arrived 250pm) for a Stromboli and some garlic knots, you can offer more than 10% OFF my NEXT order...SMH!"}
{"text":"Love Rocco's - seriously reminds me of an east coast pizzeria.  Their white pizzas are great and they have tons of delicious appetizers.  Very friendly staff for the most part, except sometimes the cashiers.  I've even ordered bulk amounts for a work event and everything was made perfectly, on time, and very affordable."}
{"text":"Best eggplant parm sandwich EVER.

If you're going to Red Rocks, this is THE place to stop to get food.  It is a hidden oasis in a desert of crappy chain restaurants.  They really should advertise more that they are an awesome place, because we almost went to Burger King but decided to check out the pizza place first.  Close one!

The large eggplant parm is longer than my arm.  No joke.  They say it is 14\", but it was much larger than that.  It'll cost ya $14.99, but HALF of the sandwich was enough for my lunch and a pre- and post- rock climbing snack.  Plus, it was one of the best things I've ever eaten.

Service is friendly."}
{"text":"I used to go to the original Rocco's off Charleston, when I found out they were opening one closer to me I was super excited! The Pizza and Cannoli's are better than average. Not the best I have ever had but I can always count on a good slice if I craving it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in Vegas. It even rivals my all time favorite pizza from the east coast. The regular pizza is phenomenal. The sicilian pie is phenomenal. I'd recommend getting one of each, but wait until they cool down some for the best taste and crunch. A pepperoni and sausage pizza from Rocco's, and a lemon italian ice for after is last meal material for me."}
{"text":"1st visit: We ordered half pepperoni and half cheese pizza and what we got was a pepperoni pizza that my wife could not eat. We ended up picking the pepperoni off of half the pizza. Also, I do not eat spicy and I ordered chicken wings that are spicy even though they say they are mild. Also, while we were eating our food one of the young female employees starts sweeping the rug which caused dirt and dust to migrate in our direction and I start coughing and sneezing. 

So we just went back for a follow-up to see if our experience would be better. My rating has now improved to 4 Stars. Perhaps the first visit was a fluke...

Now improved to 5 stars after our 3rd visit"}
{"text":"Decent pizza, decent service.  I won't drive out of my way, but I'll stop by if I'm in the neighborhood again..."}
{"text":"Great location across from Red Rock Casino, if you happen to stay there. It's back behind the Chevron on Charleston. 

As everyone else has mentioned, the folks who work there are SUPER friendly. The pies are a great homage to the NY masterpieces. We scored a slice of pepperoni/sausage and one of Sicilian (the latter was a bit burnt on the crust bottom) :( The meat-topped pie was thin, cheesy, chewy, tasty. The Sicilian pie was nice - cheesy and crusty and perfectly sauced. 

We also picked up a small order of the garlic knots. Real doughy goodness with plenty of garlic sensibility. The accompanying marinara made them extra tasty. Wasn't so much a fan of seeing them served swimming in a greasy bath. Still very tasty.

We also scored some cannoli. These amazing pastries are VERY recommended. Smooth cream with chocolate chips and a crispy crust and pounded with a powdered sugar storm. Whoa.

I liked this place. Check it out if you want to get away from the casino and get some fresh air. It's a nice break from the smokey haze indoors."}
{"text":"This is as close to REAL New York Pizza I have tasted in Vegas. The staff is friendly. 
The owner is involved with his customers. 
Atmosphere is like you are in the city. 

What more can you ask for
Great food
Great service
Affordable pricing 
TRY IT
You will like it
Or you don't know pizza."}
{"text":"Oh boy, where do I begin? I have 38 check-ins at this location. The pizza is fantastic. Tonight I walked in and didn't recognize anyone. All new people. That's fine, as everyone was very polite and professional. However, the young man that brought my pizza and wings to the counter, had open sores on his hand that obviously needed attention. No gloves, no bandages. I paid and walked out, but threw everything away when I got home. Should've just refused the order, but I was trying to be nice. I will NEVER go back to this location. It's unfortunate, because the previous managers would never have allowed this. So long Rocco's. Unacceptable.

Al is the biggest asshole on the planet. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for awhile and the reason o keep coming back is for the food but most importantly the service. The gentleman by the name of Ryan makes it an enjoyable experience. He's also a gracious host who goes above and beyond! I always return hoping he's there's to make Rocco's rock. I plan to keep coming back because of Ryan!!! Btw the breakfast on the weekend is outstanding!"}
{"text":"It was really good. We had this meat pizza pie thing with a crust on top and it was \"a slice of heaven\" just like they said it would be. The service was friendly too. :)"}
{"text":"We have been customers at this pizzeria for over 7 years. We used to refer everyone here because of the customer service and home like feel you would get here. Not necessarily because the food was excellent  The value of the specials and convenience for shuttling kids between multiple activities in this area made it a win. 

The last few months the owner has been there way too much and his whole demeanor towards customers is like he is being put out, he's rude, unhelpful, and has lost touch with what customer service is all about. 

I called ahead for a small order -- slice of pizza cut In half or double cut and some small side salads. I know lunch time is busy and I had a tight schedule today and needed to pick up and run. 

First he tells me he will take the order then when he hears it he just tells me to come in and grab, and tells me his is busy. Well we are all busy Sir and that is why I called ahead.  We used to eat in every week and see lots of people pick up small orders. After I convince him to take the order I ask him if he minds splitting the salads in two containers cuz it's going to kids at a venue. I get it he's busy and it's a lot of work to use two containers instead of one but then he whines more about what I asked for. Seriously? A three min job of doing a mom a small task is too overwhelming for you? 

I was just going to not show but that is rude and I don't waste so I go in to pick up the order and give this guy with a bad attitude a chance to recover  his long term customer and I tell him how frustrated I am with it and he snaps at me, tells me I am wrong and that he doesn't need my business and won't let me pay for my child's lunch. 

Now he has made my child's lunch late, was obnoxious in front of other customers and he can't even apologize. What a narcissist! Add to that how you publicly addressed a woman, def not acceptable behaviors!

Well since you don't need my business I will take with it my swim team, charitable orgs that I ask to use you, dance team and every other referral that we have given to you so kindly which I have never asked for anything in return. 

Thank you for the lesson in customer service I will def view my own customers at my own small businesses small requests with much more relevance and make sure I don't show up as you did as a business owner. It was disgraceful. 

As far as the food quality goes it has gone down, last three weeks we have ordered meals they aren't cooked or cheese even melted, and the side salads like caprese and cucumber/tomato which they used to take pride in being fresh are not what they used to be and often old that we have to ask for fresh. The pizza guys behind the counter are still nice when he's not there. 

My suggestion is to skip this place and go elsewhere. You can find other small businesses that will feed you with a smile and appreciate your loyalty and the money you spend at them."}
{"text":"When Sam was here at this location..everything I mean everything was awesome! He has the best customer service and welcomes you in like one would if coming to his house. Great smile and such warmth. We would always want to come here for pizza and a great atmosphere NOW, Sam left :( and it is just not the same. The service, the food, the atmosphere...we came in recently to the most wonderful surprise!!..Sam was working and gave us that ol familiar smile and welcome. He was only filling in for someone that was on vacation. SAM-IF YOU READ THESE...please please please come back to Vegas!! We miss you and want to keep coming back to Rocco's our fave pizza place..these people just don't come close to you.."}
{"text":"We ordered Italian, and  of course we did not order pizza which everyone else had.  It should have been a dead giveaway.  We ordered the bolognese with a pink sauce.   The sauce taste was unrecognizable.   I had garlic knots.  They were knots with olive oil and raw garlic drenched over them.  Ooooooo.  We also ordered cannolis, again the filling was not of a cannoli, don't know quite what it was.   Good luck."}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer, I come in a lot. Because I love the pizza, it reminds me of home. Lately I've been noticing how the business is going down. The employees are getting worse. I had Ryan as a server and he just kept talking and talking. I didn't want to be rude but I'm just trying to eat. There is a new worker Rose if say she's the best server there. Very friendly and gives great customer service. I'll be getting my food take out unless Rose is working then I'll request her to serve me."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. I wanted to try something new. First and last time I ever eat here. The delivery driver was nice. Other than that , the food was uncooked and cold. My mozzarella sticks we're literally hard in the center. Definitely not worth the money. Grande Pizza is 100 times better I will only order from there from now on"}
{"text":"Just got food poisoning from cheese pizza, from lunch. I always come here, in fact, more than a dozen times. And all those times it would of been 3-4 star. But food poisoning is very serious!! 
Your probably saying, could of been anything. Yeah, but here's my process of elimination. My son and I, shared a cheese slice, x2. My wife had antipasto. Me and my son have severe diarrhea - that is the only thing we ate that was the same, all day. My wife is fine, we ate the same breakfast. Son had cereal- and Capri Sun for breakfast. Do the math. Plus, it came on after lunch. Anyways got Cipro from doctor. It's a shame, I loved this place!! For anyone reading this, like I said, I ate here a lot over the years, could of been a fluke batch, other than the food poisoning, it was a good pizza joint."}
{"text":"After a long week and no trips to the grocery store in sight, we decided to find a pizza and pasta place that would deliver to us. Looking at reviews this place seemed like a good idea, and the pics looked like pizza from home (we're from the east coast). Being hungry we ordered more than we could eat And I'm happy to say everything was good! I don't usually order antipasto so for something I don't tend to order, not bad at all. The pizza was reminiscent of our fave east coast pizza place, best garlic knots we've had out here, and the vodka sauce was v good. The zeppoles (something we've never had before) tasted like eating the fair! We're happy we tried this place and will order again."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza
If you want New York Pizza this is the place to go. The cheese is gooey and hot GREAT quality,  the pizza crust Simply Delicious.
If you're from the East Coast like I am you will appreciate eating here.
And I must give a shout out to the manager Rangel he has great customer service and very professional besides makes an awesome Pizza."}
{"text":"I'm new to Yelp but I'm a conisure of Italian food.  I've ate in Little Italy, Brooklyn, Hollywood Fla. Dan Tana's in L.A., Mulberry St. Pizza in Encino and my family were regulars at Di Martino's on Maryland Pkwy until the day it closed. Rocco's is on par or better than most of these other restaurants. The pizza is the best I've tasted in Vegas, and top 3 all time. Calzones are full and cheesy, made to order. (I get mine with ricotta, spinach and mushrooms). The ravioli in lobster sauce, though a bit pricey is ridiculously good. I practically lick the plate! Hahaha. The staff is awesome, place is clean and I buy all my sauces and pasta there to make homemade Italian at home. I and my family eat there at least twice a week, and my kids will not eat pizza anywhere else. I haven't been to the location in Windmill yet but seeing as it's closer to me I'll give it a try and comment about it. Great food, great people, great place."}
{"text":"Never had better pizza in Vegas!! Love the Rocco, sadly not all Roccos are created equal.

Rocco on W Charleston is not as good and disappointed me when in comparison to this location. The reason being, The owners are different."}
{"text":"I've had this Pizza joint on my radar for a long time.  I'm always in the neighborhood, so I don't know why it took me this long to finally try this place.....well, the Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition finally brought us together.

I was hoping to get 2 Slices of Sausage Pizza, but they didn't have any so I settled on 2 Slices of Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza.  The wait wasn't too bad and I had 2 Slices sitting in front of me in no time.

This is NY Style Pizza folks.....it's folding time!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Gdv3qhsDeQzZ2Ag-Tzq6vA?select=Wf2-VSjEYuTk7kPcwtDlEA

The Pizza was piping hot and since I ordered it \"well done\", nice and crispy too!  The ingredients is top notch.....Pepperoni & Sausage were full of flavor and the Cheese was very good.  It was kind of greasy though.....so if you're averse to a little Pizza grease, be prepared to daub it with some napkins.

The 2 Slices ran around $7 or so and was worth it.  Very satisfying.

Return Factor - 90%......there are so many other menu items I want to try!"}
{"text":"Growing up in the NYC area... This spot, more than any other pizza joint in the valley reminds me most of home. The thin, crispy crust is on point. The savory tomato sauce and melty cheese are perfect. Only thing is... Make sure the slice has cooled down enough to eat it. I burn my mouth pretty much every time I'm here. The pies here are \"da\" business!"}
{"text":"Hate to say it, but this place just lost my business tonight! I called in a takeout order. Dude on the phone was a straight jerk. I told him my name but let him know I was having my brother pick it up for me... He quickly replied, \"You don't need to tell me all that, I just need YOUR name.\" For some reason, that really turned me off. Maybe it was the way he rudely said that, but anyway... This place does not compare to its location up in Summerlin.

Pizza ended up bein' pretty good, but damn, the attitude has to go!"}
{"text":"Good pasta and fast delivery. Food is always as expected and never a disappointment. I have had the pizza, pasta, fries and desserts. Everything is consistently good."}
{"text":"Nice place, great service. I love their strombolis with eggplant, roasted peppers and smoked mozzarella."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Vegas for sure. Only 3 stars because the customer service is really lacking."}
{"text":"Ever since Rocco sold this location it's been downhill. The last time I was there the guy burned my two slices and tried to give it to me which of course I returned it. I'm not going to eat charcoal!!! I also think they use cheaper ingredients because the pizza does not taste the same as it used to."}
{"text":"I've been going to Rocco's for a few years now. It reminds back when I was a kid growing up in Brooklyn. I could munch on a whole pie myself that's how good it was. But the past few times I went there  I was disappointed its not as good as it used to be. Maybe they changed their ingredients or something. I kept going back fooling myself that maybe they had an off day or something, but I guess not. Sorry Roc but you're missing something, please fix it.

As for their customer service at first they might come off the wrong way but that is the NY swagger which I don't mind."}
{"text":"The cashier and the cook had positive attitudes, great customer service. Nothing beats NY style pizza! I felt like Luca Brasi sitting at the table!"}
{"text":"I'm not a pizza person but this is my family's go-to joint. Super close to home and great service every time! I married an Italian New Yorker, so this place gets our business a lot."}
{"text":"Finally I made it to Rocco's, I've heard so many good things but I've never had the desire to drive all the way to Summerlin to give it a try, now that they took over Eddie D's spot it's way close to my hood. Stopped in for a quick slice of pizza, I tried the cheese and the white pizza. I'm normally not a white pizza lover but I was pleasantly surprised, I liked it. I loved the cheese pizza. Crust was a perfect NY style, thin, cripsy and had the perfect \"fold\" the pizza wasn't greasy at all. My only gripe is, I love dipping my crust in ranch  dressing, and they only carry Ken's salad dressing packs, yuck. Why in a place like this do they not make their own ranch dressing? Only reason I'm knocking a star off. 

Lots of other treats to try, they sell Wise brand potato chips, which I love. They advertise all their entrees are $10. Pizelles and lots of other desserts. My only concern is they advertise \"da real deal\" Hoboken, NJ cookies, but they're kept in the same deli case as the meat & cheese. I don't want a meat flavored cookie."}
{"text":"This place is great for delivery.. We have never eaten there before and decided to try them out. Pizza is great.. Ny style! Our new fav place for delivery pizza!"}
{"text":"OK  decided to try this was place for 2 reasons. 1.) We got a flyer in the mail advertising a salad bar which was perfect because I could take my family for pizza and I could eat the salad bar and 2.) Because when I went on YELP to check it out I read bad reviews from what seemed like someone trying to sabotage them. So we decided to give it a try and support the local family business. We stopped in about 730 on a Sunday night after driving in from California. The first disappointment was that there was no salad bar. So I was a little's pissed off, but my family wanted pizza and it was getting late so we decided to get the pizza to go.  Not complaining about the service. Everyone seemed friendly and it seems they have quite a few regulars that dine there. Plus they had football on so we could see the game while we waited for our food. We ordered a large pizza and it was HUMONGOUS.  OK, in all honesty, I don't eat pizza so I personally didn't try the pizza, but my family said it was pretty delicious. They liked that the crust was thin and not thick and \"doughy\" and said it was pretty decent. I didn't see what all the bad reviews were about we personally had an OK experience. Besides the false advertising of the full salad bar which I'm still kinda Mad about, but in all fairness everything else was not bad. We most likely will wait until they really DO HAVE the salad bar before we return, but if your in the mood for pizza and live close by this place isn't bad. Don't believe the yelp hype."}
{"text":"Second time I've ordered pizza from this location and I'm a fan! I don't think I'll be ordering from anywhere else. I had the small cheese pizza and the thin crust was perfect and not soggy at all. The sauce is good and not too tart. Absolutely delish!"}
{"text":"One of if not my most favorite pizzeria since moving to Vegas. The pizza is thin & tasty. A bit greasy but always in a good way (just like NY.) they are always really nice and accommodating, and they have good specials in the beginning of the week on pies. Everything I've had here I've liked, and they've never disappointed me. Not the cheapest in town, but I don't mind paying for what I like. Way to go, guys...keep doing what you're doing! I'll keep the referrals coming."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in Las Vegas. It is true NY style, uses great cheese and quality pepperoni. The garlic knots are so good, the wings are awesome, and the powdered sugar covered pizza dough zeppoles are amazing. I could eat the whole bag. And the guys that run the place are so sweet too. No grumpy New Yorkers here!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, especially right out of the oven.  Nice Monday specials!"}
{"text":"We walked in and the guy behind the counter was...not rude but not friendly either. We decided want we wanted to order and as we got our soda from the fountain machine I noticed some ants roaming around. We sat ourselves down and I noticed that most of the tables had not been wiped down, parmesan cheese and crust crumbs were left as a warning that we chose to ignore. We ordered a small (14 inch) pizza, half pepperoni and sausage and the other half with some peppers and 2 other toppings and our two sodas and the total was $23 and some change. I'm sorry but it was such a waste of money. That pizza was bland, greasy, soulless.... As I was eating it my friend pointed out that I had grease running down the length of my arm. 
The only reason we finished the pizza is because we didn't want to waste our money."}
{"text":"This place is definitely open for business! The remodel looks Amazing and and the pizza is to die for! Best in Vegas Hands down, we tried the wild white and it was sooooo good! Lookin forward to trying the breakfast this weekend."}
{"text":"Finally stopped here tonight for dinner after seeing online that they offer Sicilian pizza by the slice.  I arrived to find that they only had one slice remaining, so I snatched it up and left my girlfriend to try their regular NY slice.  I gotta say I liked hers better.  The Sicilian had a great consistency, but it lacked in flavor.  Maybe it needed more sauce, more cheese, a topping... SOMETHING!  Or maybe I just came too late in the day and it just wasn't fresh.  But still, it's the first place I've found in Vegas that has Sicilian by the slice, so I'll be back to try it again."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and I'm trying out various spots, this will not be a place I go back to unless I want a cheese pizza.

Last night my family and I dined in, the waitress was a bit too casual for me.  She was very nonchalant and when she would bring things to our table, she'd just toss is on the table. They've got large heavy menus, I turned away from her direction to put my phone in my purse and as I turned back I was startled because she plopped my menu right in front of me, it was loud lol.  She was very polite and friendly though.  She didn't check on us often so we ended up having to make our own drinks a couple times.

The pizzas we tried were Cheese, Fresco, & Chicken Alfredo. They all tasted good, but nothing amazing for the price you pay.  I picked this place because it was close to our house and it was a $, I would have listed this as a $$.  Their cheese pizza tasted & held together better than the gourmet ones.  The other two were pretty hard to eat without everything sliding off.

The drinks need to be addressed, we all got Sierra Mist or fruit punch.  Their Sierra Mist tasted horrible to me, like algae or mildew, I couldn't drink it and sent it back and got a bottled water instead.  For some reason the fruit punch tasted fine.  Not sure if they have that pre-made/mixed, and the Sierra Mist needs water added but I'm pretty sure they're using faucet water for that.  Absolutely disgusting!"}
{"text":"Disregard any review that doesn't give Rocco's five stars, because there's nothing to NOT like about this place. Fast, smooth service by friendly people, and the only place I get pizza from anymore, period. I've ordered from them now about ten times and it's 100% consistent. I'm only sorry I didn't find them before, because I'm sick to death of bad pizza, or even worse, some of that \"designer\" crap pizza that the \"in crowd\" seems to like. Once you start screwing with pizza, it starts to suck. Some things should be left alone and should remain traditional. If you don't like this pizza, you need to have your head examined."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed. We decided to order a large pizza... where it was all dough and no sauce or cheese. We order the mushrooms balls that were surprising good and actually warm unlike anything else on the order... mozzarella sticks haven't been cooked yet and asking for extra sauce will get you enough make pasta for the week so I guess that's a plus? Otherwise... overrated.. over priced... and next time I'll just stay hungry."}
{"text":"Tried this place while we stayed at the Aliante Hotel.  Must say we were very impressed. . Delicious New York style pizza , & the wings were awesome as well... thank you Cristine & Ash for the great service!"}
{"text":"I've ordered in from Roccos probably hundreds of times.  It's been a solid go-to, with good food.  Orders have been right most of the time.  Not perfect, but easily overlooked.

Tonight I decided to try dining in.  Big mistake.

Wait staff did not notice us for probably 10 minutes.

TV was blaring some odious ultra left wing anti-gun agitprop special.  I asked 3 times for the channel to be changed or the volume turned down but my request was ignored.  Allegedly there was someone watching it on the other side of the restaurant...but no one was there, as the TV was on the takeout side.

Rocco's - you lost a lot of business tonight.  This will be posted in multiple places.

Update.  Owner responded privately to the Yelp review and apologized.  He states he is a gun owner and 2nd Amendment supporter.  He says he plans to keep the TVs on sports from now on.

You can make up your own minds.  As for me...I'll boycott for a month or two.  I hope some of you will join me."}
{"text":"Not the best pizza ever.  Not enough cheese. 
The pasta was OH so bland. I wanted to cry.... But the cheesecake was good! Plus they had the basketball game on, so there's the two stars for you."}
{"text":"I visited Rocco's based on Yelp recommendations and I was definitely not disappointed.  I must point out however, I am not a NY Pizza expert by any stretch of the imaginiation.  I would have given Rocco's 3 stars, but it earned an extra star for reasons explained below.

The prices are a touch on the pricey side, I think it was about $3 to $3.50 per slice and a slice is a little over 1/8th of a 18 inch pie.  The crust is thin, a little chewy and very pliable.  In genuine east coast fashion, they reheat the slices of pizza you order so they come to you nice and hot.  I had the pepperoni and sausage and sausage and mozzarella pizza.  The all meat pizza was a bit greasy and nothing special, but the sausage and mozzarella wasless greasy and very tasty.  I also ordered a small order of freshly made caprese salad.  Which brings me to the reasons why I gave an extra star to this restaurant.  Friendliness of service and selection of goods.

The owner (?) was super friendly and let me buy a smaller single serving size of the salad which was greatly apreciated.  There are also rice balls, homemade cannoli and zeppole on their menu.  If you are still hungry after your pizza, you can buy some dried pasta and canned tomatoes in their small deli section to take home!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place to get pizza in Las Vegas. My friends and I have been ordering from here for years! We will actually drive the 20 minutes from home to pick it up because it's that worth it. It's the best NY style pizza outside of NY and the Garlic Knots are to die for! It's a must if you're a local or staying at Red Rock Casino."}
{"text":"Great food for the price; we use Rocco's to obtain food for casual parties at home.  I love the Stromboli, lasagna, spaghetti, and the pizzas are good for mass pizza consumption in groups.  Be sure to call ahead as there is not much room to wait, and be sure to call the correct Rocco's as there are various locations."}
{"text":"Last Friday we were in Vegas for March Madness and needed to grab a few pizzas between games!  Where are we going to go? Hmmm....Rose's UNLV go'in sister said \"Rocco's\".  Wow....what a FIND!!  I have to say it's the best NY style pizza that I have had in Vegas.  We had the white pizza which was OUTSTANDING, everyone was raving about it.  We also had a sausage and mushroom pie and the tomato basil.  They were extremely tasty!  We will be in NYC next month and I will be going to Lombardi's to get my favorite pizza but when I'm in Vegas I will be going to Rocco's!  Bottom line.....Rocco's ROCKS!!"}
{"text":"Been waiting 90 min for a 45 minute delivery. Do not use if you want food in a reasonable time. Tipped well on card too

Edit: owner did reach out and refund, so that was nice and appreciated, but food ended up taking hour and 45 min"}
{"text":"This is literally the best pizzeria i've found in Vegas. I would definitely recommend it! Obsessed with all of their food, if you ever find yourself in Vegas head over to Rocco's. Great customer service! Great food!"}
{"text":"Food is legit!!!! Wings extra crispy, tenders and all the pizza. I've had the same delivery driver for several years. The only downfall is they go through employees. I feel like when I call to place an order, I'm always talking to some one new who is learning the system. Still, this is my favorite NY pizza joint in town and I order once a week!! I don't mind the fear of a heart attack, I welcome it!"}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of Rocco's in the past but this weekend I got a pizza from them and was very impressed this time. It was a simple pizza, pepperoni and mushroom. But very good however. I've always felt they hastily make their pies because the ingredients at times are unevenly distributed as was the case with the mushrooms on my pizza this time. About 20% of the pizza had no mushrooms and since I'm stating my observations I will say that they could have used some more pepperoni too. After saying all that, the potential for outstanding pizza is there. It was very good and hot. 

I'm warming up to the idea of making more frequent visits to Rocco's as I'm trying to avoid Blaze Pizza as much as possible.

But try Rocco's yourself. I don't believe you'll be disappointed and you may be able to provide insight in which I have not noticed. Try it and let me know by your review."}
{"text":"Hot food served on a paper plate. No go!
This is pizza for people that don't know what real pizza should be.
Pizza served with fake original New York pizza toppings. Absolutely no!
I know there's better New York pizza but this is not it!
In fact, this is not even close. I'll be sure to move on and not return.
Not even close to what real pizza especially New York style pizza should be."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic New York type pizzeria. Even some of the staff seemed to give me a Yorker attitude when I asked questions (not a great thing). But overall, it had good pizza with lots of options and some nice sides like caprese salad. The crust was thin, crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside - just to my liking. Toppings are semi generous- like a fair amount between meat and vegetable (an important thing to me when I judge my pizza). Fun for small groups and good for little kids. I know because we came here with like 7 of the little ones. And I appreciate all those little garlic knots for keeping all of the kiddies occupied while us adults stuff our faces!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza.  The only reason I am not giving a five star is I didn't like how our waitress kept telling us you know we close in a half hour.  Made me feel rushed to eat.   We were in area and just looking for a place to eat.   It was a Friday night they closed at 10.  We got there at 9:30."}
{"text":"Customer service was so bad. They waited on regulars even though we were there first.  Even some random girl who came in after us.  It was so bad that a random customer saw how we were ignored and gave us a supportive comment. You blew it never ever coming back."}
{"text":"Okay! So I'm back. Need to gettah life, I know. \"Can't find anyplace else to eat?\"  Nope.  I came back to see if they got lucky with the last pie or is this place the actual Bomb.  So's ay sitz down and ordah a ceasar right?  Add a slice of their White and Tomato Mozzarella.  The salad comes out fast and GET DAH F BOMB OUTAH HEAH... It's the BEST ceasar salad evah! Good portion, cold perfectly sized romaine lettuce, and the sauce; THE SAUCE creates another eye closing, nothing else matters in the world moment. Wow! ... Sorry, had to wipe the drool from my chin. How embarassing! The kid next to me is staring.  You can't be held responsible for what you do under this food induced, tantric based, transcendentalist food coma you will have no control over. When you recover, if anyone is staring at you, just apologize and hope you didn't drool too much. Great food and highly recommended! 

Oh, the people thar work here are gracious and humble.  Still lovin' Rocco's NY slice.  Was not a fluke.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"We didn't try the pizza but we had the 3 meat Stromboli with Mozzarella cheese, a roasted  beef sandwich and 6 hot bbq wings. They were all good - not necessarily on the healthy side but not too bad either. The girl who worked there was super friendly. The place is small but clean. Perfect for a quick bite. Will be back to try their pizza."}
{"text":"My buddies and I decided to have a mini reunion here since i told them i had this place bookmarked for a while.  We shared 80 bucks worth of food between 4 people and a child.

The goods:
Cheese Pizza - Better than most place i tried.
Penne a la pasta - This was soo 'eff-en good that even after my insulin level was spiked due to the carbs overload, i was still polishing this plate up with the remaining loaf of bread.  I went home and puked afterward from being too full, but it was totally worth it! ^5

The not so good:
Veal Saltimbocca - I had to forced myself to keep that pyramid in balance.  I was asking for suggestion and this was one of them.  I thought for sure the prosciutto would have canceled out the negative if there were any.
Calamari - Batter was whatever and the marinara sauce was tasteless.  Either of them cold have use salt or a \"BAM!\"
Everything Pizza: I thought i would like this since I'm a protein lover, but all the ingredients were too much and made the pizza limped status.
Meatballs: Got it just for the protein.  Do not want again.

It's a small joint/mini mini mart.  If it wasn't for their windows, i would thought i was in NY.  Now I know where to go to get my Italian fix 3.5/5"}
{"text":"After almost 3 yrs of living near Rocco's, I decided to try it for lunch. The shop is crowded feeling and just feels in need of improvement. I didn't actually see any items in need of repair. You just get that cluttered, time to spruce up feeling. 

I ordered a meat stromboli. The dough was crisp and appealing looking. The meats plentiful, but mostly a boiled ham and not salami or pepperoni. That's pretty typical of most fast food places. It felt like the food took longer than needed to get to me. No one else was ordering at the time. 

When it arrived, the ends of the stromboli were steaming hot, as they should be! But the middle was mildly warm. The dipping sauce was cold. 

Everything tasted okay. I've had better as the 2-stars indicate. I don't see me returning.

PS- I posted a pic."}
{"text":"Very poor service. If there is only an option to put zero stars...i'd put zero.
I ordered a slice of cheese pizza to go, and the cashier was not very friendly. He placed the to-go pizza in a small brown paper bag.  I just asked if there is a box for the slice to keep the pizza hot because i ordered \" to go\"... and he said \"what for?\"
He said there is no box for the slice. I asked for an extra plastic bag or even an exrta brown bag so that the food will not be exposed, and he wouldnt give me one. . I just told him nevermind, and left then i store. When i got home. The oil of the pizza leaked from the bag into the car seat!!!!!
The food is not good. The pizza is dry.
Do not go here or don't ever make a stop here. It was a mistake going here since it was the only pizza place nearby that was not busy at lunch time. No wonder they dont have a lot of customers."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I have not yet tasted the food. We had even before picking up the food was  horrendous. We decided at about 6 on a Sunday night to finally give Rocco's try. We first tried to use an app for pickup but no matter what we did they added a tip on to the charge. I wasn't going to give a tip for picking up a pizza. So then we decided to call when the person finally answered she said there's one person ahead can she please place us on hold. About 5 or so minutes later she finally pick up. She took our order and told us it was going to be about 20 minutes. About 25 minutes later we arrived and went inside to pay, she explained that the order was not ready and we asked that if we paid would she be able to bring it out to the car. She said no problem so we went back to the car. After waiting about another 20 minutes in the car we called up and was told it would be about 3 more minutes or so. Approximately 5 to 8 minutes later they came out and gave us our order. The man who came out explained that the guys that make the pizza weren't in today. Before we even left the parking lot we opened the pizza to see what it looked like. I had never seen an oval pizza before but that is what we got. 

So in order for this review to improve the food is going to have to be better than or at least as good as it is in New York. It's highly doubtful we'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place before the long drive back to Cali.. After a busy weekend of participating in a wedding, having some Vegas fun, and spending money on a lot of overpriced Vegas stuff.. I mean $15 for a 2 mile cab ride.. Vegas is trying to recover from the depression the wrong way, but I degress.. We were not disappointed choosing this place.. The place is in a typical strip mall nothing special but when you walk in you instantly feel like being in NY (at least if you ever lived in NY and know the feeling)with the way the place looked, to the NY pizza smell to the NY attitude from the owner.. We ordered a large pie and a couple of sodas, perfect meal after a long night in Vegas.. The pie took me back to NY.. Thin crust, crispy, big floppy foldable slices.. The cheese was high quality as well as the pepperoni.. The place is small and quaint with a small dinning area in the back that is decorated with old Italian family pics and other NY themed items.. The whole meal cost $20 which to me was awesome as I get the feeling Vegas # 1 goal is to suck the money out of you on all levels not just gambling.. I mean $15 for a 2 mile cab ride, you get my point... This is definitely a go to place and we plan on going back again when we visit the next time...

If you are tired of days spent paying too much for too little or even if you want a great pizza at a very reasonable price I highly recommend Rocco's.. Some of the best pizza I have ever had.."}
{"text":"Where do I start... So the place was a wreck! Not clean at all, the people working there were not the best at what they did and were slow.  We were over charged 0.83 cents. We noticed they rang up the wrong pasta and wrong size sandwich and we the customers corrected it before they started to make our food and then They brought out the wrong sandwich for me twice and the wrong size.  The small order of six garlic knots only came with 5.  Even though all of this we were determined to not let it ruin our night.  Because we could tell they were trying hard.  Then we saw this girl with a face tattoo taking an order over the phone and how she was just sassy and rolling her eyes on the phone.  That was when we decided to write a review. We got a sandwich. Pasta, garlic knots and one small soda.  Total was $38.93.  We would not recommend going to this place.  Spend your money elsewhere you will not feel happy after you eat here."}
{"text":"They have excellent pizza, my favorite place to come and grab a slice! The cheesecake also is so delicious. I had a wonderful dinner here today!"}
{"text":"The pizza was so good! Its fresh and hot. Love their thin crispy crust. I would go back there with my kids again. The environment was nice and clean"}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing and the specials are extremely affordable! All their food is wonderful I've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Being a newbie to the area wanted to know who delivers Italian and this restaurant does!! The pasta and salad was delish! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great all you can eat deal, cheese pizza, salad, and pasta. Slices are huge and just the right amount of sauce. Will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"As someone who's been to NY and enjoyed the pizza there, this is rather delicious! Fast and fresh with just the right amount of toppings. The slices are pretty large!

I would suggest lids and straws for the drinks :)
*This is the better of the locations."}
{"text":"I rang Rocco's at around 11:45 am to place an order for pick up, the worker was friendly and quick over the phone and told me my order would be ready in about 15 minutes.  I ordered a large pizza with half pepperoni/sausage and the other half I got everything on it.  I also added on a bag of zeppoles (fried dough balls with powdered sugar on top) because I was feeling especially fat that day and wanted to pig out!  Popped in at noon on the dot and my food was ready about a $25 bill in total.  

When I got home and opened the box, the pizza looked delicious but there was a light layer of grease on top of it.  I just did a little pat down of the slices I ate and was good to go.  Pizza was quite good.  The zeppoles were also delicious but also could be deadly because they are small so you think they aren't too unhealthy but then after awhile you realize you've eaten almost all the bag but I guess that's just a personal problem.  I definitely plan on ordering my pizza here from now on (they deliver too!) instead of from mediocre pizza hut or dominoes!"}
{"text":"What a dime of a find! Great New York style pizza that will leave you wanting one more slice. We always order the pizza pepperoni and tried the pineapple ham the other day. Super delicious and the price is well worth it. In my opinion, some of the best pizza I've had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to get a Philly cheese steak in Las Vegas! Great food and amazing customer service. I've gotten a couple of orders delivered from this location in the past and they are always very swift with their deliveries! Good pizza too but I really recommend the cheese steak"}
{"text":"I really do not get the bad reviews over the last few months. 
One star for bad delivery
One star for thin crust
One star for greasy 
etc etc etc.
I call B.S.
This is NY style pizza people ........ known for it's thin crust....... Known for ooohy gooey greasy cheese. 
Let me tell you they do it as well as any I have ever had. If you want that healthy organic, gluten free blah blah horsesh** then go down to Town Square,DT Summerlin, or to the strip and pay triple for diet rabbit food.
OK I am done my rant on yelp reviewers that absolutely know nothing !!
The place is busy and they don't seem to deliver on a consistent basis. No problem it's 3min from my place, I go pick it up.
RECOMMENDATION:
Order the everything pizza, it is outstanding. The best pizza in town by far.
And if you want to keep your organic, gluten free gf happy the antipasto salad is top shelf"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great location and the look of the place is awesome. The only thing that would have made the pizza perfect is if the cut the pizza in squares. Other than  that I will most defiantly be back. Dummy me forgot my phone on the table. Our waiter rushed out the door to give it to me. You don't see to much honesty in this town anymore. Great place."}
{"text":"2 Thumbs up Rocco's nailed it with the New York Style pizza.  Best I've had in a while"}
{"text":"Being from the east coast I am very picky about my pizza. Sorry to say went here and had a slice. First of all the crust broke into four pieces. Then trying to eat it grease was dipping down my hand. I really wanted to like this place as it is so close to my house. Needless to say after two bites I threw it away."}
{"text":"AMAZING AS AWLAYS! Rocco's is amazing the pizza is always good every single pizza the pasta is fantastic, and the jalapeño poppers are the bomb! And the cannoli's and the gelato! I'm overly pleased every time I come here. The staff the environment is also great to come sit and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pizza here is HELLA GOOD!! Its thin, pretty oily, but its worth the calories. Big ass slices too, NY style to the fullest. I'll be going here again for sure. Thanks Rocco fam!"}
{"text":"Moved to the NW last year and I have become a big fan of Roccos. The pizza is great with a full amount of quality toppings on each slice. You can choose pizza by slice or small medium and large. Pizzas are massive so choose wisely unless you want to take some home for later.

The menu goes beyond pizza and I am looking forward to trying the wide selections of pastas, soups, and breads. Roccos also offers Italian Gellato is also available to complete the meal. Soda, milk or juice for the kids, and a decent selection of beer or wine for mom and dad. Roccos is much more than pizza.

The dining experience is enjoyable at Roccos as well. A recently expanded dining area with added tables, arcade and small play area for the kids and flat screen TVs add to the family atmosphere.

Customer service is small town like, something rare in this city. Employees have paid for arcade games for my kids, given us free garlic bread as we waited for the pizza, lets us taste the wine and other warm gestures. They make you want to be generous with your tip!

In conclusion, after reading this review, you are now informed enough to not choose Domino's!"}
{"text":"They have the best white pizza ever. I love their chicken wings and for desert, the canoli is amazing! I've tried almost everything and this place is the best! From salads to everything on the menu, it all tastes great! :) lucky to have this place just down the street from my home. Authentic Italian"}
{"text":"I really liked this Pizza.  We ordered a large pepperoni to-go and the guys behind the counter were friendly and funny.  They also have a lot of sweets that looked good.  Definitely check this place out if you like thin crust.  I like to fold the slice and eat it to the crust, then take the crust and dip it in pop.  Very tasty."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out, because I saw so many photos of pizza by the slice, which was exactly what I wanted. 

I came here last Saturday night on a whim and ordered 1 slice of cheese, 1 slice of everything, 1 garlic knot and 1 double stuffed all meat pizza and I about fell over from all the tastiness!

You might be wondering if I ate all that myself and the answer is of course not! I ended up splitting it with my hubby.

Now let me tell you how pizzawesome this pizza was!!! As soon as I sank my teeth into this light thin crusted saucy cheesy pizza I was instantaneously transported to my childhood when I remember eating pizza just like this. Wow!!!! I was transported by pizza! 

What a miracle to find a place that actually makes pizza the way it's suppose to be made. Freaking frack! Everything about this pizza oozes perfection! Kid you not!

The taste of the crust is flaky, crispy yet tender. The amount of sauce is not overwhelming nor too little, also the amount of cheese is also perfect, smooth in texture and amazingly great taste.

Some of you might think, but this is just pizza! No big deal. What's the difference? Well let me tell you that all pizzas are not created equal and I believe I have found the perfect pizza place in Las Vegas.

I've eaten at so many pizza joints around town and even in CA and I have to say that I have yet to find a pizza that can match Rocco's NY Pizza.

I swear I've found pizza heaven and I highly highly highly recommend this pizza joint. I promise you won't regret it. I seriously can't wait to sink my teeth into another pizza! 

2 thumbs way up for Rocco's NY Pizzeria!!!"}
{"text":"My go-to pizza joint very friendly staff. Food is great! The prices are reasonable. The service is quick."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE!!!!!!

 H U G E pizza slices
 Super tasty
 Great lunch specials
? Friendly staff
 Perfect location"}
{"text":"I wish they would bus the tables more and that the bread was better.  Otherwise, great."}
{"text":"This pizza is so delicious! Seriously I just about died and went to heaven with each bite. If you want authentic New York pizza then eat here."}
{"text":"Excellent!! A bit far from me but will return when up in the summerlin area.  We had a regular slice, a square slice and the tomato mozzarella salad.  All were great! My daughter loved the pizza ( regular slice) and she is really picky about pizza since we moved out here from NY.  I will return again and think this place is worth trying out and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Friendly service but the good is flavorless and bland. The Alfredo sauce had way to much whipping cream and the pizza was also flavorless."}
{"text":"My first time in and it was good, but not great. Better than average, but a little pricey. I had 2 slices (one with pepperoni, one with pep & sausage)  and a soda. Total was like $9.74 and i thought that was a little high for a lunch of baked dough with sauce & cheese. I've had better and I've had worse. Service was friendly, but dining room was a little dirty, and I never saw anyone come out and clean off some of the tables. Location is a strip-mall and parking lot was full. I would still recommend picking up a pie from these guys. I will visit again and try one of their other menu items."}
{"text":"so this place sucks!! way over priced for what you get, and its not even quality food! waste of money big time! sticking with old school pizza"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times but today I experienced terrible customer service, we asked for our bread and salad to eat before we get our meal but we didn't get it until 10 minutes. My son went to the register to get some assistance and the front counter/order taker completely ignored him, until another customer told her he had been standing there for help. 

Service like this will draw me to make other choices when wanting a pizza night."}
{"text":"Great Pizza definitely unique. One thing that surprised me was that they had a BlackCherry soda that I had been looking for months. Wouldn't give up the source where he gets it from but had some good laughs about it. Will be back for the calzones though"}
{"text":"Total NY style pizza. Love that you can get it by the slice. They had samples of the zeppoles in the front and they were fresh-n-hot and delicious! 

I ordered the an entree. I'm used to it being prepared a different way, wouldn't order it again... BUT I did eat all of it. I will definitely try there again for the pizza. The table next to us ordered sandwiches and they loved yummy. I will definitely be back to try those!

I love that they have homemade pastas and sauces."}
{"text":"This is the worst service ever. 

They charged us for a pizza we didn't order. 
They gave us the wrong Pizza.
We called and mentioned the mistake around 9:45 and they said to come by in 20 minutes to pick up another one, but when we got there they were closed. 

They never told us they close in 15 min. 

I called the next day in regards to this matter and they hung up on me. Then they ignored my calls. When they finally picked up the phone they acted like a big bunch of jerks saying they assume everyone should know the close at 10 in the local neighborhood. It's a business law to state your hours anytime you communicate with customers over the phone and we are not from the area. 

I would not recommend their service and will be reporting their behavior to the Better Business Bureau. They treated us in the worst manner possible."}
{"text":"I walked in a bit inebriated.  So my ordering was a bit off, but the guy behind the counter was chill about it.  Didn't get nervous with the length of time or my lack of knowledge of the place.  I ordered two slices one with just cheese and one with pep and sausage.  Another big plus for me about this place was that they serve Coke products for their fountain drinks which is a big plus for me since I don't touch Pepsi.  

I sat down and they brought me my slices, and the first thing I noticed was the size of the slices which are rather large.  Next thing I noticed was the crispiness of the crust which I prefer.  What this place I believe is trying to accomplish is having a pizza place in your neighborhood like they have back east.  Every neighborhood has one.  They are not trying to change the game with their pizza just give you what they enjoyed back home, and I think they are doing a stand up job at it."}
{"text":"They called to let me know my order was ready but I didn't not answer and by the time I arrived he was already making my order again beciasenhe didn't want to serve those pizzas because they have sitting for too long and I appreciate that. It shows they wants to put out a quality product"}
{"text":"I must say, Rocco's is my second favorite pizza so far in Las Vegas. I had the pleasure of trying it at another location by pure coincidence from being hungry, and it was the only food joint nearby. I was pleasantly blown away, so tried this location. I prefer the other location better, but the pizza is definitely a 8/10 for me here. 

I'll be coming back, just cuz it's closer."}
{"text":"We originally intended to order from Grimaldis, but after the rude service on the phone, we opted for Rocco's instead. Very happy with our decision! Garlic knots are killer. Pizza was good as well"}
{"text":"Disgusting.

There was a long piece of plastic in my Stromboli. The breaded ravioli were rubbery and bland, and the tiramisu was still frozen."}
{"text":"Customer service is lacking here big time. This is the 2nd time I ordered takeout. The phone conversation was brief, not very personable. Both times I arrived to pick up my order at the time I was told and BOTH times they were just STARTING my order, 20 minutes later. Oh and did I mention there isn't a soul in this place? They never apologized or communicated with me. I almost walked out the 2nd time. Food is decent but I will not be sharing my business here anymore."}
{"text":"I am not sure if it was Yelp's fault, or the restaurant, all I know is that I was left without food at 9pm, I got no call, nor I got a message, email or nothing...No bueno...First impression...edited today 3/19th So the lady I spoke with that night had offered me 50% off on my next order, for my inconvenience...I called now and the Male manager totally denied the discount...I hung up and promise never again, was my first and last order..."}
{"text":"I like to say that I'm a pizza expert, especially New York thin crust style and this place takes the cake.
Crazy as it may be, it actually was better than pies I've had in NYC.
Couldn't leave without a pie for back home :)"}
{"text":"Came here with my boss on lunch break. Decided to try this place out because not many other pizza places around this area had that great of reviews either. Working at a food place myself and my boss having owned it we know how things should be in a restaurant. The second my boss looked around she was like nope not eating here. There was pizza dough laying around open on the bottom shelf that looked like it hadn't been cleaned in forever. The soda machine had buildup of some liquid and was leaking at the bottom. Honestly my standards aren't too high with food and I usually have a tough stomach so I said what the heck I'll eat anyways since we didn't have much time. I reeeeallllyyy should of listened to my boss. Not even 10 minutes after leaving I'm only going to say two words: explosive diarrhea."}
{"text":"Great food! Friendly staff! I decided to try this restaurant on a recommendation. I ordered the Hawaiian pizza and Brooklyn pizza. The portions are large for a reasonable price. I recommend going for a family friendly atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"Excellent service EVERY TIME! And the Buffalo Wings are fricken the best. I get medium and they are just spicy enough but not too spicy. The pizza is the best in all of North Las Vegas, so this is the place to go when on this side of town. I think it's family owned so I love supporting local and small businesses."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location in a few years. The previous owners before Rocco took over had great tasting pizza, now not so much. Rocco call the girls and get their secret sauce, because yours don't cut it. As we used to say in NY Forget about it. And that's what I plan to do about this place."}
{"text":"Having eaten a LOT of pizza all over the country I can tell you that a NY pizza this is not. The overtly obnoxious New York memorabilia on the wall may be shouting New York but the pizza whimpers, \"meh\". This doesn't even compare to the most mediocre slice I've had in NY. 

There is a certain quality that makes a pizza a NY style and that's what's missing here. They either use the wrong flour or do not let the dough rise long enough to create the gluten necessary to give the slice the right \"bite\". Simply put, the slice should not break when you fold it. The toppings were fine. It's pretty hard to screw that up. But a pizza is made by the dough. 

Granted, this was my first time here and it could have been an off night, maybe. But with much better options relatively close by, treat yourself right and go somewhere like Grimaldi's for an authentic NY pizza."}
{"text":"As a born and \"bread\" New Yorker, my blood runs thick on the traditional NY pizza sold by the slice. While I can't  really comment on what makes a Chicago deep dish dish earn its stripes, Rocco's is well within my EastCoast pizza wheelhouse, and remains a local real deal favorite.Here's why;

Oregano, garlic salt and red pepper shakers on the table. A slice that shows its tell-tale authenticity by the orange grease(a perfect co-mingling of marinara and mozz) that runs down the center when you fold it in half. Thin, crispy crust, balanced sauce, heaven on a paper plate. My Bronx-born parents even gave it a thumbs up. Trust, they would have no qualms going \"Joe Pesci\" on me if I took them for bad Pizza. In the summer Rocco's does Italian ices, their arancini and stromboli will not disappoint either. Bravisima!"}
{"text":"I am Visiting from LA and this is probably the best pizza my bf and I have had. This place is clean, the staff is friendly (thank you Sam and Felix) and the food is delicious!!!  We had a cucumber salad and a half/half pizza, one with white sauce chicken and bacon and the other regular with mushrooms and bell peppers! Try it if you are in town! Highly recommended! :)"}
{"text":"I live about 3 minutes from this location and I absolutely love this place. I always get the combo with a large 1 topping pizza with wings, bread knots and two drinks for under $30."}
{"text":"Pizza  by the slice lunch specials are always a bonus! 
And, when the pizza is tasty, that makes it even better.
Only about 8 tables if eating in, but saw a lot of take away orders while eating in.
A good choice for a quick and inexpensive lunch.
2 slices and a drink for $6.
Due to the close high school, they get slammed some days..."}
{"text":"Coming from out of town, we use Yelp as to not waste our stomachs on mediocre food.  This was definitely nothing special to rave about.  The crunchy crust was good but the sauce is not so great."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and got 2 NY size slices and a drink for $5. Can't beat that. I added meat to them
For an extra buck. The pizza was delicious. I would definitely come back to this place. Nice decor too."}
{"text":"Holy crap!!!! I want to blame the weather.... (sarcasm) ordered food at 2:35pm. Was told an hour for delivery. Delivery guy gets here at 4:13pm  I called the restaurant and get transferred to three different people. All acted like they couldn't here me and I get the excuse of \"well when we only have one driver it's very hard\". As a consumer that is not my fault your establishment only had 1 driver on a Saturday... in the summertime where let's face it Pizza is the way to go. Plus I'm sure other customers are utilizing the grub hub drivers offered thru the yelp app. I called you guys directly. Either way really disappointed. We order from here all the time. Not anymore. Thank again Rocco's!!!!"}
{"text":"If you are from NYC or the Tri-state Area DON'T BUY ANYTHING HERE. The pizza tastes NOTHING like NY pizza and you will be both disappointed and disgusted. The overall food quality here is just getting progressively worse.
They must've changed their marinara recently because it used to be okay and now is just water with tomato chunks and is completely flavorless. Our pasta was literally sopping wet with some tomato chunks floating on it.
Completely inedible.
This location has made several mistakes with our orders and with overcharging us and they did so again a few days ago. We placed the order electronically as to avoid any possible communication mistakes and they still got it wrong (it was a small order for 2 people).
When my husband went to pick it up they gave him a HUGE attitude bc he paid with American Express (they complained that AE charges them higher fees than Visa and asked him to look in his wallet for another card or cash).
On top of that, even though we had paid online, they rang it up again and threw in extra charges (besides incorrectly preparing the order). Unfortunately my husband didn't notice until he got home.

Don't waste your money here. I had a few bites of my pizza and eggplant parm and am throwing both out. It's not even worth the effort of a phone call to complain (again) about the poor service and poor quality nor is it worth the gas to return the food or have them credit our account for the overcharge.

You will regret it if you go to this \"pizzeria\". If you're from NY as we are: trust me, this food is DISGUSTING."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with this place.  I went to L & L next store one day and went in to see what this Roccos was all about.  The smells brought me in, So I grab a menu and took it home.   I was looking forward to my next trip to Costco as I knew I would come in and try a meatball sub and a pizza.  The meatball sub didnt have enough meatballs but tasted pretty good.   The pizza was average and overpriced based on how good it was.   The main problem was the customer service.  They didnt seem to want to answer any questions, especially regarding specials.  Main guy kept answering the phone even though he knew I had a question to ask.  As I was waiting to ask a question, I over hear him talking to a customer \"Sir, The ranch comes in an average size, I'm not going to describe it to you.  Just come in and if you want more ranch, i'll sell you more ranch\"  Very unprofessional!

    As I write this, i'm changing my stars from 3 to 2.  Never an excuse to act like a jerk!  I'm sure I am not the first to get attitude from these A holes!"}
{"text":"This really sucks because their food is actually pretty good, but they can't get an order right to save their lives. I've NEVER had an order delivered 100% correct. From something as simple as forgetting a ranch dressing, to getting someone else's order entirely.

Also when you go to their website to look at their menu and hit \"hot sandwiches\" the only thing that comes up is a breakfast menu. Anyway, just a heads up I learned the hard way their meatball sub DOES NOT come with cheese. It's extra.

Like I said, the foods decent. But they need to hire people that can read tickets.."}
{"text":"Bleh! Bland pizza! I ordered online over $50 worth of food and it came soggy and the pizza wasn't cooked all the way and tasted really bland. I had to re cook everything in the oven after I got it. For paying all that money I expected it to at least be cooked right. I won't order from here again."}
{"text":"I can pretty much sum up the place by saying this is a 4 stars pizza-slice joint with 3 stars service. The guys making the pizzas are pretty intimidating but that's what makes it \"Da Bronx.\"  It's also pretty annoying to pay 50 cents for extra cup of marinara sauce.  If I had a choice, I would go always go to the other Rocco's on Buffalo and Charleston. But sometimes I like a little attitude with my pizza so I put up with this one."}
{"text":"Loved my breakfast here! The pancake combo was tasty, hot, and included fresh fruit to sweeten the deal. Took a scoop of gelato and a pound of Italian cookies home. The service was outstanding, so will be back again and again. Can't wait to try the lunch and dinner menu, too!
Update: I went back the same day for dinner. Amazing slice of eggplant pizza, a side salad, and garlic knots. I am in 7th heaven."}
{"text":"I love the main guy who works here. Everyone is nice but he makes my daughters day. It is by far the kids choice for pizza. You can get a slice which is great in a pinch. The zeppoles are a crowd please at work."}
{"text":"The new owner will drive this place to the ground. She makes a deal about napkins, even if you have ordered buffalo wings. I used to order pizza several times a month, but won't be returning.Good luck running food business with such nasty attitude."}
{"text":"Perfect Bronx Pizza. Thin, crisp, cheesy! $3.50/slice for anything more than cheese-only. Loved the sausage/pepp. Mouthwateringly amazing. I'll be back, fo sho!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: 

Maybe they were just having a bad night when I wrote my 1st review because I have eaten here since & it's all good now :) everything has been on point & good thing 'cause the Buffalo location won't let you order delivery after 8pm even though they don't close until 9pm. Also they screwed up my order the last 2 times I called for delivery in time. 
It sucks too since I have really enjoyed their food & have been a loyal customer for literally 20years & bringing everyone I know to eat there! Off the top of my head I can name a dozen people who eat there and/or order Roccos on a regular basis due to me introducing them to it - But to say No delivery at 8pm on a Friday night when you close at 9pm?!  Quite disappointing & seriously unacceptable. I'd understand if they stopped taking orders around 830p but 8pm on a Friday?!! YOU ARE KILLING YOUR OWN BUSINESS & LOSING YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS! They might as well have said 
Go F Yourself! We don't need your business! Roccos has great pizza & luckily, ALL of the Roccos locations are great & the owners of the other locations are actually concerned that you have a positive experience unlike the Buffalo/Charleston location. I hate being insulted by a place I'm patronizing & spending my hard earned money. Who needs that shit?! Especially when there's a bazillion other joints to choose from! I guess they make so much money before 8pm that they don't have to care about their clientele -well la tee frickin dah! Bully for you! I'll starve to death before giving money to an establishment that takes their customers for granted /treating us carelessly.
Later Skater! 

Normally I can't say a bad word about Roccos. Unfortunately Sunday I tried to order but it was 740pm so they wouldn't take a delivery order so i ordered from another location that was open until 9pm ~ 1 large pizza, eggplant parmigiana with pasta, penne alla vodka, & 1/2 lb butter cookies. After ordering I received a call stating that my cookies didn't make it with the driver but that another driver would deliver them. When I opened the order, the penne vodka didn't even resemble what I've  ordered 1000's of times before! Instead of tiny pieces of pancetta, there were huge chunks of beef! The sauce was decent but the beef was not. Plus it wasn't even penne! It was mostaccioli! I know they're similar but they're still different. I've NVR heard of beef in penne alla vodka though! Then the 2nd delivery guy shows up with the cookies. Open the bag & voila! Rainbow cookies dip'd in fudge or chocolate- not at all something I'd eat or order. Idk what happened but either way it is NOT what i ordered! WTF! You call me 2 times AFTER I order but failed to mention the beef or the cookies?! I'm not even eating now after spending $60 on your food & after having 2 diff drivers come here. NVR again!!!!!
ONLY ordering from w. Charleston location from this point moving forward!"}
{"text":"This is my family's all time favorite pizza place! The pizza is always exactly what I order. It's a bummer that they don' deliver, but the zeppole by the register make it worth the trek. The staff my not be friendly by everyones standards, more straight to the point, but that's totally fine with me. Let me get my pizza and go!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for authentic pizza! They are fast with the delivery too!
Meatballs are really good as well!"}
{"text":"Though its been years since I've been back Rocco's was always good to me. I was one of the early employees at the now defunct VEGAS SLIDERS and i'd spend my lunches at Rocco's over our greasy burgers"}
{"text":"This place has some pretty good take out pizza.  For the record, I would give them 4 1/2 stars if I could do so.  We've tried other take out pizza places in the area; but we always go back to Rocco's.  For the money, you can't get a better deal.  Their pizzas are always fresh, tasty and fairly large for the money you pay.  They also have some pretty good salads. Plus, their salad dressing is outstanding. Rocco's is the place for me, whenever you're in the Summerlin area."}
{"text":"Great little pizza place! If you love pizza, but avoid it because it's too much bread then this is the place to go!  Their pizza has thin crust but amazing taste!  They also have very fresh salads to add a little veggies to the meal."}
{"text":"Got their calzone added pepperoni.  Was disgusting,  so much ricotta cheese,  no flavor and for $10 was a waste of honey and my lunch. Will go down to mark rich's next time"}
{"text":"Pizza wasn't very good. And service wasn't great. Felt rushed during our order and I ordered a side of ranch. The man tried to give me a packet of ranch salad dressing. And I asked for a container of the housemade ranch dressing not the ranch salad dressing. So he went in the back and returned with a container. When I opened it and tried to use it at home it was clear that he went in the back and poured the packet of ranch salad dressing into the container. Completely ridiculous. We had a $60 order too and left a tip..."}
{"text":"Ive never had bad pizza or pasta here.  Very authentic taste and very friendly staff.  A little more pricy than some delivery pizza chains, but the extra cost is worth every penny!  I come here a lot and know a family that comes in for pick up at least once a week.  It's definitely a nice change of pace from commercial pizza chains.  Definitely worth a try next time you are thinking about ordering pizza!"}
{"text":"Like others have said, \"some of the best pizza around.\" I concur. Glad this place is just around the corner from the house."}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza!!! Good zappoli as dessert too!!! Quick service...thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"Just finished an amazing lunch at Rocco's. The food continues to be very good. The staff are great, especially Ryan. Since we are repeat customers, he remembers our likes and favorite dishes. He always has a smile and friendly attitude. He's always spot on with his recommendations. When you eat at Rocco's, ask for Ryan!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a slide and a soda one day and was very pleased. This is real deal great pizza, plus a great atmosphere and fair price. I have also since learned that this pizza is the go-to for many local businesses, who all swear by it for their lunch purposes."}
{"text":"Best NY Pizza in Vegas! Very affordable price. Fabulous choco cannoli for dessert. Plenty of parking and very friendly atmosphere. A great family restaurant! I would come come here again."}
{"text":"OMG! If you are a New Yorker, and travel, you know how difficult it is to find authentic, fabulous, great tasting New York style pizza once you venture outside the NYC area. I just had the most delicious slices of sausage and pepperoni meat c combo pizza! Great, well baked, thinner crust, amazing sauce! I feel like I am on Aurthur Avenue in The Bronx right now! Nice family owned business! I will be back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place it used to be amazing, order a pizza tonight it was cold hardly no cheese or toppings had to bring it back was a little upset considering just took my shower and was waiting on hubby to bring home what is usually the best darn pizza in Vegas. Good luck"}
{"text":"Just ok 'za...got the \"everything\" pizza, crust was a bit soggy.....perhaps we got too many toppings.....I'll go here if I'm nearby, but I'll be actively searching for a better place"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. I'm from the East Coast and finding decent pizza out west is hard. Many pizza places claim \"east coast pizza\" but this one is pretty close to that. I've tried a lot of different pizza places and this one has to be one of my favorites. Garlic knots are delicious too. I've also tried an Italian hoagie as well and that is good too. I'm okay with mayo on it and the bread is good."}
{"text":"Roccos on Aliante is my favorite pizza joint in N Las Vegas. The wings are always In point and the pizza is good."}
{"text":"Can't beat the five dollar special. Heated in oven upon order each time. Very impressive for the cost. Keep up the good work guys"}
{"text":"This is probably the BEST PIZZA and antipasto salad EVER! THEN we had a sample if the Zeppoles, OH MYLANTA BEST MEAL!!! We didn't order ahead but the wait wasn't long at all. This will definitely be our regular place"}
{"text":"Rocco's has great pizza, and they are FAST with their takeout.  My pizza order by phone is always ready in 15-20 minutes.  The \"small\" pizza is actually quite big and a good deal for $9.99 - they have a Monday night takeout special on their large pizza that is an even better deal.

The crust is a wee bit thicker than real New York pizza, but the cheese and sauce have amazing flavor.  I am glad I gave this place a try because this is my new pizza place!"}
{"text":"We normally get pizza. This time I tried the philly steak and cheese. Very disappointing. The bread was dry on top but the bottom was soaked in grease. They used orange cheese which didn't go well with the steak. 
My husband got the calzone which was cold inside. Disappointed with this meal."}
{"text":"So I heard about Rocco's from people who are actually from New York.  They said it was good so it must be good.  Been in twice, once to pick up a late night slice of pie in my way home, and once for the lunch special.  Was equally impressed both times as the pizza was phenomenal.  Had the pepperoni once and had a plain cheese the next time.  The slices are of good portion and not overly greasy like you come to expect from a lot of pizza joints.  Would definitely recommend Rocco's to those are truly looking for a slice of New York nostalgia.  I also installed Rocco's water heater and he is all around a great guy who runs a great business."}
{"text":"I love pizza but not just any kind of pizza. I love Rocco's for its nice employees and it's NY style, and god you can't forget about the amazing pizza! I honestly prefer this over any pizza place! Thank you Rocco's, cheers!"}
{"text":"Great pizza to order or by the slice...salads, sandwiches, pasta, and other goods.
Nice spot right across the Costco in Summerlin.  Close to Red Rock Casino.
Went for an afternoon light lunch with family in town.  They loved it. I was already a fan.
Great thin crust and square sicilian style pizza.  Friendly staff and great quality/cleanliness make this place a winner.  Prices are not cheap, not expensive either, but it's not bargain pricewise.  Worth i for the quality.  Anyone who uses Pizza Hut, Dominoes, Papa John's in Vegas when there are places like this are just lazy or not with it."}
{"text":"Super bomb!!!! i had never tried a calzone and when i tried it i fell in love with it. Just like a pizza but wrapped like a burrito lol"}
{"text":"This may be the worst place in town.  When you walk in you smell the welcoming sent of fresh bread, but that is the last point at which you feel welcome.  I was there at 6pm last Saturday to check it out as a potential place to get delivery from.  I ordered an antipasti plate and a saltimbuca and was told it would take approximately 5 minutes (clearly a joke).  30 minutes later having sat there while the people who ordered long after me were served a pizza which the sent back to be properly cooked, I saw a less than sanitary cook in an illfittling tee shirt (plumber's crack and all) place a container with my saltimbuca up front to be sent out.  Appearantly someone had mistakenly given out my antipasti with another to go order, but instead of being applogetic and hastily correcting the problem, the staff prefered to argue with one and other, in full veiw and hearing of the customers, about the error.  This is one of the most disorganized dining establishments that I have ever seen.  The service SUCKS!!!! and the food...the antipasti was average, the  bread  was great and the saltimbuco was deep fried and inedible...I even refused to feed it to my dogs.  The pasta that came with this was barely eatable.  All in all I would recommend that you avoid this place at all costs....frozen would be safer and better....and, let's face it  there are ample italian deli places throughout this area that would be grateful for your bisiness and treat you with courtesy and respect, and honor the food that they serve."}
{"text":"Service was the worst I've experienced.  I ordered 2 slices and a soda and was told that my slices would be brought to my table.  I got my soda and waited.  I waited 15 minutes and then I noticed a family who came after me got their pizza slices before me.  I went to the staff and asked what was going on.  They acted confused.  I showed them my receipt.  They got my 2 slices within a minute, but they did not apologize for the delay.  I took my slices and left.  I called the complaint line, left a voice message.  One of the staff left a voice message.  I returned the call, but did not get a call back.  

This type of treatment is unexcusable especially since at the time that I ordered and received my pizza slices, it was not busy and there were staff just hanging around.  Although I understand that staff can make mistakes, the fact that they did not apologize but instead said \"So I guess you want your order to go,\" was just unacceptable behavior.  I grew up in the east coast area, and if this had occurred at a pizza joint there, I would have asked for a refund.  Since I was already late and hungry, I opted to get the slices instead of asking for a refund.  Although the slices are NY style, the service is slow like the midwest and unapologetic like Beverly Hills."}
{"text":"Sam. Let me tell you about Sam. He's personable, good vibe, I want to talk to him for hours. Gives the best recommendations. Sausage onion and pepper sandwich.... oh my!!!! He said it was good, it's not good, it's outstanding. This wonderful man plays the best old school music. You could be grumpy, walk into Rocco's when Sam is there. You instantly start singing along and snapping your fingers. Sam, never leave us!! I'm born and raised in Vegas, in the service industry on the strip over 20 years. Sam is a diamond in the rough. Thank you!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"When I go to a pizzeria anywhere I always look forward to homemade ranch! Sadly they don't offer it here. It's was packaged kens! I ordered a slice of white pizza which was tasty.. And a side salad which was horrible. Iceberg lettuce that was starting to turn bad and then the ranch just added to it being bad. The service was friendly and the pizza good so if they offer homemade dressings and a better quality salad then I'd give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"$$ - be careful for extra charges. We were charged extra for another item and when we had the cashier (male) check our receipt, he appeared to have to purposely up charge us and still trick us by the way he reviewed our receipt twice in front of us. However, we stood our ground and he realized his mistake. This resulted in no tip and -1 star. 

Food - I ordered the penne a la vodka, which includes bacon. This dish was very heavy and saucy. The ratio of pasta to sauce was 1:2, which made the dish overwhelming. Having half a plate of leftovers packed to-go, I still had half a plate of sauce left. I don't usually order pasta with vodka sauces but I wanted to try something different tonight. In my opinion, the taste was good but could have been better if there was less sauce. My boyfriend ordered two slices of pepperoni pizza. He liked the taste but he thought it was too cheesy. He also enjoyed the garlic knots, which comes with marinara sauce. I thought they were a bit doughy. 

Overall, I've been to better pizzerias. Upside - they deliver though."}
{"text":"Thin crust and a tasty tomato sauce are the key elements to a great NY pizza joint. I have to say I was really impressed with this place having tried their regular sausage slice and white pizza slice. My only complaint, if any, was that the pizza was a bit greasy but otherwise I really enjoyed the flavors. Of course, you can't go wrong with pictures of NYC and those distant mafia relatives in the dining area."}
{"text":"The reason for the one star is simply due to the attitude and service of the people that work here. Rude on the call in order, rude when picking up and not a thank you in sight. No offering of napkins, choice of dressing on a salad or utensils. With all the choices in Vegas, the owner had better have a talk with the employees. I will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I consider myself an expert, being born & raised on pizza from Queens, NY. This place is very good & I have to stop by here every time I'm in Summerlin. The availability of Wise potato chips is also pleasant surprise. There are Italian ices & zeppoles for desert to make Rocco's complete."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is one of the best pizzas spots in Vegas, I've never had an issue with service and the pizzas always been good for sure in my top 5 places in Vegas for pizzas that's aren't franchised"}
{"text":"What can I say about Roccos that hasn't been said. The place oozes east coast pizza parlor. from the smell of garlic when yo walk in to the great options and frozen dinners to go. The fresh zeppoli ready to eat while you're ordering. Great tasty White pizza us what I ordered today and it never disappoints..."}
{"text":"Rocco's Pizza! It's GREAT! Price is right. Food is tasty! I recommend the everything pizza. It's New York Style! Wifey loves the Zepolles! FREE SAMPLES!! They also have many fresh pastas as well as Garlic Knots! Staff Is friendly and atmosphere is family friendly with a decor of a New York Pizza Pub!"}
{"text":"The Sicilian pizza is excellent! It's just like the pizza I've gotten on the East coast which is very hard to find here in Vegas. The crust is fluffy and crunchy. The garlic knots are also very good, and the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"This place is garbage!  Pizza should be cheesy and saucy but this place is the true definition of cardboard pizza.  Dry, no flavor, and dough to make your jaws hurt the next day.  Wings are trash as well.  Dried out, no flavor.  The pizza makers here need to take a pizza 101 class. I spent over $40 here.  Maybe they should take that money and get some lessons."}
{"text":"This pizza is delicious I keep going back for more love this place.. the decor of the restaurant is nice and the staff always seems to be pleasant"}
{"text":"It seems some changes have been made, especially with their pricing. I got 2 orders of the eggplant parm a couple nights ago and it came out to $37.50, which is $19 each. That is ridiculous. I just got their lunch special for $6.99 which use to be 2 slices of pizza (cheese or pepperoni) and a soda. Now it's one slice, a side salad, and a soda. The salad is nothing special, and the one slice just doesn't do it. Needless to say, I'm disappointed with these price changes and cutting corners. I won't be going back, which is a shame since it's right around the corner."}
{"text":"Bet pizza in town. Rocco's clean. Fun atmosphere. Absolutely delish. Prices very good as well. Come down and try it."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in this place. As soon as I walked in, I can tell that the lady at the register was in a horrible mood. I asked her about the menu & she said \"look at the menu\" & just pointed at the little pamphlet. She didn't even bother to give me eye contact, she was nice whatsoever!

I ordered the stuff shells & waited about 20 minutes for it to be ready. I am disgusted with my order. I wish I could drive back & get a refund but it's too far for me to go back.

Do not go there. Do not."}

{"text":"My friend picked up a turkey sandwich for me today so maybe she got it wrong but it was the driest turkey I've ever had on a sandwich. There was no mustard or Mayo that I had requested but that could have been due to my friend not asking for it.... Also very little tomato to moisten ...She told me it had oil and vinegar but there was barely enough on the bread to moisten the turkey I had to add a ton of mustard and mayo myself just to give the sandwich some moisture... The bread was perfect- nice and crusty but I would never serve that turkey to anyone. It was completely over cooked and dried out."}
{"text":"Ok so the owner contacted me about my review and told me to call and have the order remade.  I called and talked to Ryan and he was very helpful and remade the order. Ryan had me check the order before I left, it look good and the wings were smelling good in the bag.  To finish my review that pizza I received was the quality of pizza for the price.  Thank you Rocco's NY Pizzeria for the great customer service.   I want to recant my statement about the management and say that \"Thats how you run a business and thank you for reaching out to me about my bad experience.\"  If you want a good quality pizza and customer service please check out Rocco's NY Pizzeria in North Las Vegas.  Hope y'all find this review helpful.  Thanks"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I just moved over on this side of town, we were looking for a pizza place  on yelp and found this place! Hands down best pizza place ever! There always busy, have great customer service and the food is amazing! If you live near aliante go check them out!! You will be very happy that you did!"}
{"text":"Rocco's is the best pizza I have found in NLV. The pizza is thin crust with tasty sauce on it. Their garlic knots are also quite good. Rocco's has great lunch specials during the week, especially the all you can eat (includes unlimited pizza, salad, and pasta...no drink) for $6.99. You normally get a side of the garlic knots to go with your meal, so you won't be going hungry after eating here."}
{"text":"Ordered a Pepperoni, mushroom, garlic and jalapeno pizza to be delivered and did not get what I ordered, the pizza was made wrong . I called and my only option was to go pick up another pizza from them. Not happy with the customer service."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA PLACE EVER!! The food is always delicious! They never get the order wrong. They make the food fast and fresh. The workers are super friendly. One time I was $3.00 short and they covered it for me. Of course, I drove back home to pay them back, but they were so courteous about the whole thing. They're definitely my favorite Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Good pizza, good pricing, good service. What's not to like? I love NY style pizza and Rocco's delivers! It's not the greatest pizza I've ever had, but I'm happy and full after eating it and let's be real, who isn't happy and full after eating most pizza? The only bummer is when I asked for ranch it was a salad dressing packet and not in a little plastic container like most places do. I prefer housemade ranch, but it is what it is and the dressing did the job! The cannolis here are delicious so save some room!!"}
{"text":"Consistenly good pizza from one of the better pizza spots in the city.

I regularly get a sausage and pepperoni here, and it is refreshing to see that they use shaved sausage instead of out of the bag uniform sausage spheres. Even though I consider myself more of a carnivore, I regularly get a cheese pizza as well and it always has enough cheese and is just as good as any meat topped pizza. 

Toppings and cheese are always spread out evenly and goes to the edge of the crust. The crust itself is always chewy, not too thick, cooked thoroughly, and never burnt.

Customer service is always top notch. When I come in to get my orders they are always ready to be picked up and are always correct.

This has become a go-to spot of mine to get a good pizza."}
{"text":"Always friendly staff. The pizza is fantastic. The wings taste exactly how they taste in upstate NY..always my favorite thing to get. The garlic knotts are amazing. And the cannolis are PERFECT!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza and wings in town. The only place we order from! We had a slight mishap with our order this even and they handled it like champs...asbusy as they were!  Thanks sonia"}
{"text":"I love the food here but I just had a problem here that pissed me off..I order my 2 slices kid runs the card and it was declined 3 or 4 times..after the second try I said do it again please..he made some smart ass remark that for me he will do it again..meanwhile there are people in line and he's making me look like a dead beat..I then get on the phone with my bank and after 20 minutes it is determined that there is no problem with the card..I go back in he claims he's worked there for 10 years and it's his family business again with an attitude..he runs it again it won't go through and it's impossible that it's their problem. ..you know what next time consider it's not the customers problem I have over 25k in that account and frankly the whole experience was an fing insult...check the attitude and fix the cc system I went to another restaurant next door and had no problem ..Mr 10 years..I will be taking a break from this place I'm so annoyed right now!"}
{"text":"Have to be honest -  this was our go to place for pizza and calzone-  no more .  Heard they changed hands ( not sure if that's true) but last couple of visits have been very ordinary .  Somethings happened to crust, sauce, cheese.  On lookout for new place .  Sorry Rocco's"}
{"text":"Calamari tasted like nothing but maybe this is a place that you dont get that kind of food but at least I tried. This place is a bit expensive and if people are looking for that East coast feel I think there are much better pizza spots down the street.  Service was a bit rough,  if it's that NY swagger then i guess those are the only customers in Las Vegas that going to tolerate it"}
{"text":"When this place first opened up it was actually very good. My girlfriend and I have eaten there several times and each subsequent time the quality of food has decreased. So we just decided to stop eating there and got our pizza from hungry howies down the street.  We decided to give it another shot last weekend and let me tell you it has gotten even worse!  We ordered take out 2 pizza's one med and the other large and it was the biggest grease slick I have ever seen not to mention the fact that we paid 42.00 for something that I wouldn't have given a homeless person because it was so bad. We almost decided to take the pizza back but we feared we would have made a scene. You have lost our business forever. I don't know what you have changed but it's definitely not a move in the right direction."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. My husband and I had shared a rice ball and both got a slice of pizza... it was fabulous. We stumble upon this location after hiking at re rock. Hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Has to be the best white pizza i have had since moving back to vegas. You can taste the quality in the cheese alone. Customer service was phenomenal from friendly atmoshphere to getting a guilty taste test of the awesome pastries brought in from the east. Donny was great THE definition of proper service."}
{"text":"We went to Rocco's for our daughter's 8th grade graduation celebration. There was about 20 of us total and we were seated right away. Food was good and the manager came and checked on us several times to see if we were doing ok. We ordered 2 of the large family meals and had plenty of leftovers! Great value good service:)"}
{"text":"Over past three years when I've visited and sold wine, I've had the pleasure to dine here. Sorry no pics BUT...here is what I've ordered.
This crust pizzas, authentic New York thin crust style with an abundance of items and delicious sauce you'd think your grandmother made. 
Meatball sandwiches which will fill you until the next day. 
Salads which are fresh. 
Garlic knot balls just like I've had in New York. 
Great service. 
Clean patio to dine. 
Close to Costco where you can gas up the car. 
Well...that's it. I've visited at least 8-10 times. 
5*****stars!!!"}
{"text":"Had the Sicilian style. Nothing too special.  The amount of raw garlic in the sauce made it pretty inedible.  This is coming from a garlic lover."}
{"text":"This places is the BOMB!! This coming from someone born and raised in the Bronx. I was happy to wrap my lips around a genuine folded NY slice. My first bite took me back to my childhood after school snack at Franks corner pizza shop every day at 3 o'clock. I highly recommend Roccos and will certainly be back.

Ps. Great Lunch special too!"}
{"text":"i moved here from ny 12yrs ago couldnt find good pizza went to roccos now i go 5 days a week and now my family goes there food is great prices are good workers are very nice owners are also very nice"}
{"text":"The food here is good but I ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo with broccoli and it was a few bucks extra. When I got home to eat it there were only 4 broccoli florets. That's not ok.

Update: so now that my family has finished everything my dad got a splinter on his tongue from a piece of wood that was in his pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza delivery.  Very good pizza,  garlic knots and zeppoli!  Order was delivered in about 25 minutes."}
{"text":"Yes I'm going to be that only person who dislikes their pizza and food. Ordered just cheese pizza and it was soupy and greasy on top and the dough couldn't hold the topping and it all slid off. No flavor. Baked ziti was pasta and ricotta cheese baked to a mess with cheese on top. Second time here, not impressed sorry. We are a family of chefs and caterers so we eat a lot of pizza, all kinds. NY style is sill my favorite. Now, my kid loves Rocco's, so go figure. Service was good to me both times. So, thumbs up to the staff, work on the pizza."}
{"text":"I've had Rocco's on numerous occasions.  We generally order out, but this past time my family was in town we decided to take the kids and eat in their newly renovated seating area.  My wife and I ordered the all-you-can-eat pasta, salad and pizza (cheese only).  Let me tell you, the salad was terrible (literally came straight from a package), the pasta was extremely bland and of extreme low quality, and the pizza was a greasy mess. If you want all you can eat, you have to keep pestering the waitress to bring you more stuff, as you are only brought one item at a time.  When we went, it was so crowded that our waitress literally didn't have any time to attend to us, so we ended up with a single piece of pizza for each of us.  We just left because we didn't want to deal with the fiasco of chasing down our server to eat mediocre food any longer.  

As for the quality of the pizza generally, it's decent.  Honestly, Vegas has the worst pizza options I have ever seen, so maybe that explains why people are raving about the pizza here? I don't know, but don't be fooled by the rave reviews about this place.  It's really not that great."}
{"text":"We ordered our dinner through Eat24. The order was wrong. The delivery guy was really nice and patient and I even spoke with the manager... When I talked to the manager she had said they would send out a new pizza within half an hour. Well within further looking at the place I now notice that they closed and never sent us our pizza. My children were waiting and never got their dinner from them. Thanks but no thanks. We won't be ordering from them again.

Update: 2 hours after the original delivery we finally got our cold pizza. 
Thank for trying"}
{"text":"Ordered a couple of pasta dishes (penne and lasagna). Super affordable, food was well seasoned and the garlic bread was AMAZING. 
The food arrived 20 minutes early and it was HOT. I will definitely order again, would recommend to friends. :) Plus they deliver far!"}
{"text":"My hats off to these guys.  Tucked away in an obscure place across from the Red Rock Hotel and Casino is Rocco's. Decorated in New York style with photos and oddities from the East Coast, this is hands down on eof the best pizza places in town. Not only do they have good pizza but it's the staff that makes the place. Always friendly, always helpful, they make one of the best NY style pizza's in town. Calzone, Zeppoli, etc. this places rocks......!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, friendly environment and phenomenal pizza! What more can you ask for? Great place to go for a family dinner or just a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Decent Pizza, decent price, super awesome family style service. Have not been compelled to try it again as I am feinding for some good Me-N-Ed's from Central Cali, but if I had to have pizza in Las Vegas I would order it from here.  I loved the family owned service and personal touch.  Pizza was decent but to be fair I am super picky."}
{"text":"Rocco's has great pizza and the best lunch special with 2 cheese pizza slices and a drink for $5.  The staff is friendly and the service is always fast. 

You can purchase dough, sauces, meats, cheese, and deserts if you wanna create your own Rocco's Pizza at home or order delivery."}
{"text":"Called them at 6:13PM to order a sandwich.  Person took the order without any questions, & said it'd be ready in 15 minutes.

At 6:24PM -- 10 minutes after I successfully placed the order -- 5 min before I was told it'd be ready, I got a call back from the same person who took my order.  She said \"Uh, I'm new here, and it turns out we don't have that sort of sandwich.\"

  If it takes Rocco's 10 minutes after accepting a sandwich order to figure out they don't have a particular type of sandwich, they've got issues & I have no interest in wasting any more time with them."}
{"text":"Decided to try something new and happened upon this place. My husband and I did the all you can eat special for $8.50 we were both very surprised by how big the slices of pizza are. The pizza was out of the oven hot, good flavor, crust was thin (not my favorite) but good. We also had a salad and then a bowl of pasta.... The server was on it and made several stops at our table to see if we wanted anything else! The menu is large and they have everything for Hamburgers to sandwiches and of course pizza.

The location is good with plenty of parking. They also have seating outside, which will be nice when it's cooler out. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I just ordered here for the first time tonight--the Everything Pizza is soooooo delish!!!! Everything was so fresh and very tasty! My kids got the cheese pizza and loved it! Great portions! I am definitely coming back again!!! Awesome pizza!"}
{"text":"Good pizza!  Price is a little high for a pie!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Definitely resembles pizza from back east.  Comfort food for me since I'm an East Coaster!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I'm an east coaster and this is mice to have a place where pizza is like Home. Service is great, super friendly and attentive.  Pizza tastes great. Gelato and cannolis ..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, their eggplant Stromboli is amazing and I highly recommend any of their Stromboli's.

Their pizza is great too but they shine on their garlic knots and Stromboli's."}
{"text":"I ordered a large supreme pizza and it wasn't the best. Their really stingy with the toppings and I expected it to have way more toppings than it did. I mostly tasted the cheese because there wasn't much toppings. I don't think I'll ever order from this place again."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok not great. The service was not so hot, the only thing that saved them from 1 star was the girl that did help us tried her best."}
{"text":"This place is my absolute favorite place for a cheese New York style pizza. To me it has the perfect combination of crust to cheese to sauce ratio!!!  And you can't beat their 2 slice and soda special. I'm sure their other food is great, but for years and years all I order is the cheese pizza. Try it out and let me know what you think."}
{"text":"Rocco's is the best pizza spot in Vegas. I'm from philly and I love there food. Closest to home.  The customer service is great!!! Go over and try it out.  I guarantee you will love it!!!!"}
{"text":"Pregnancy craving is this place!! Soo delicious!  We love the cheese calzone and the tortellini carbonara! Yummy! Do yourself a favor and eat here!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza!  In the past I've only only gotten a slice from Rocco's but today I called them for delivery.  The girl who took my order on the phone was really nice and helpful.  They estimated 45 minutes for delivery, but it only took 30. Delivery guy was super nice and my food was delicious!   Next time i want delivery ill be calling Rocco's again!"}
{"text":"Sometimes, you just have to dip into the first place that's convenient when you experience hunger pangs on the way home.  Ugh, leftovers.  So I find Rocco's as the nearest place to grab a pizza.

True NY style, fold it up and let the grease dribble down your fingers good.  Hanna was working the counter and took my order.  Without anything other than letting her know it was my first time to Rocco's, she brought me a slice of cheese pizza while I waited for it to cook.

Great pizza.  I recommend the Rainbow location as I cannot speak to the same quality or service at the other locations, but if they're consistent - this place is good."}
{"text":"Sad to post this bc Rocco's is my all time favorite Vegas pizza joint.  However, STAY AWAY FROM THE WINGS:(  Our order tonight included wings that were so overdone and chewy that they were more like jerky on a bone.  Husband threw them away.  Won't order wings again. Pizza and wings...except here:("}
{"text":"Ew. ew ew ew ew ew . 

Ew.

I was going to leave it at that, but I guess I'll explain you a thing and tell you why you should avoid this place like it carries the plague.

One. Explosive diarrhea.

Two. Cockroach.

Three. Table with rowdy children dropped their entire pan of pizza on the floor. Our pizza that was suppose to take 10 minutes took 25 cause the dude gave that table our pizza and just remade another one for us. Uh, excuse you, our order was in first before your undisciplined fuck-trophies mopped the floor with the cheese pie and we shouldn't be forced to wait longer or have our order skipped cause someone can't control their kids.

Four. Dirty To-Go Box. Swear to god. It had grease on the inside of the lid and the wax paper had black crap all over it. I got up and got a new box myself.

First time trying this place, and I'll never return."}
{"text":"Avoid this place.... I have tried this place two time, both times horrrible... The reason I went for a 2nd time is cause a good friend said its pretty good... Needless to say he isn no longer a friend LOL.. JK....  I walked in,,, looked that the pizza's they had, I was like, OK this is promising...  I got the all you can eat... 7.99+2.70 for beverage.... I felt I was cheated...  These clowns have the worst dough ever... Could of used Play Dough would of tasted better... Tried the pasta, talk about crap... Chef boy r dee would of been better....  Only thing that didnt suck was the PEPSI... I am beginning to think there is no where in this valley to get a decent NY STYLE Pizza... Try again ROCCO..

5/31/12
Tried thiis place again cause my dumbass friend bought a pizza to go... I thought he was getting Dominos but he thought he would try this place...  I told him how i felt about this pizza and its staff.. Well i had a slice... LMAO it was still horrible... He tried it and said WTF is this,, we promptly threw it out, and to Arby's.. Try again Rocco,, maybe you should just use Red Barron Pizza and pass it off as yours..  TOTAL FAIL"}
{"text":"So this was the first time I tried this place for a take out White Pizza order. I'd been to NY a few weeks earlier and couldn't stop thinking about the white pizza I had while I was there. Well, my man asked me one night if I was up to try a new place and so of course we decided to Yelp it. Not 3 miles away was Rocco's. I was super skeptical given my recent \"authentic\" experience but boy am I glad I stepped outside my comfort zone because their white pizza was EXACTLY the same style O had been craving!!! White cheese and dollops of ricotta spotted over it. We got half of it with sausage for my man and he enjoyed it immensely. You know the white pizza is really good when you ignore the sausage side completely! Haha. Sooooo good. His side had shavings of Italian sausage, which crisped up... interesting and tasty. He also sprinkled on some garlic powder and a bit of seasoned salt, which I didn't need at all on my side.  

While it would be hard pressed to expect a perfect NY pie in the middle of the desert, this was asap good it gets for a close approximate of my ideal for a NY white pizza and it's 5 minutes away from me. Definitely can't complain :-)"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas! Feels just like a NY pizza parlor. Can be a little pricey so go on a Monday and they have a special on a large pizza. The white pizza is a must try. Another plus, they sell tasty cakes!"}
{"text":"If I could give a negative rating I would. I have never been more disrespected by a \"manager co-owner\" (I believe his name was Rangel) in my life. This man literally verbally assaulted me. When I confronted him with the actual owner Robert he became more irate. He said to me if you don't like my pizza go somewhere else.DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE DEGRADED!!!!!!!! Worst service I have ever had. Not only was he rude ,but lied about everything including owning the place said he was the owner for 9+ yrs. We ordered pickup and as I was paying the guy started being extremely confrontational and the pizzas were just thrown together with no care whatsoever I wouldn't be surprised if they spit on them or put something in them. Never going back if that is how customers are treated. Also I asked for light sauce not no sauce and to think I payed $23 for something that made me literally vomiting sick pretty sure I got food poisoning . I have never been more insulted and felt more uncomfortable especially when he kept coming over making nasty comments to me as I was trying to just pay and get out. Also he kept speaking Spanish to others obviously talking about me which is completely rude.I will never go back this place is horrible... trust me steer clear unless you want terrible food and people disrespecting you ... guess he thought he could say/do whatever.Also they do not honor the prices/sizes listed on their menu.
Update:next day still vomiting sick no response from owner about horrible treatment I am telling everyone to stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Phanominal pasta, pizza and service.  Julius and his team rock.  Pizza and ziti awesome.  Outside seating available excellent.  Massive selection of tons of true New York pasta, hot and cold sandwiches, stramboli you name it, the have it I love it.  This place is not good its great!  I recomend for casual eatery in Summerlin."}
{"text":"I am a white sauce pizza fanatic.  If they offer it, I order it 99% of the time.

Rocco's version is pretty solid!  It has lots of cheese and goodies on the thin NY style crust pizza.  The large is about 16in of goodness, so not quite fold-able slices, but very good.

We ordered half sausage, half pepp, and I really liked how they used longer thin slices of sausage vs chunks of meat.  Adds a nice presentation with great flavor.  The meat was a little oily, but I actually prefer it that way personally.  Check out the pic :

Too bad they don't do delivery...but I am never on this side of town anyways lol.

It was a great pizza at a decent price.  Not the best in town, but if I was in the neighborhood, it would be a spot I'd frequent."}
{"text":"I stopped by last night on my way in to Vegas from LA and we all thought it was pretty tasty. 

We were skeptical on the reviews from the other yelpers but we're glad we tried it. 

Everything we ordered was good. We had chicken wings, pepperoni n cheese pizza, chef salad, seafood linguini and the meatball sandwich. All really good. Everything was fresh and prepped just right.

I say, give Rocco's a chance."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite breakfast spot! Everything is scratch made, and tastes amazing. Plus they have the best pizza in town also. Definitely come here weekly!"}
{"text":"Really great NY pizza with an atmosphere to match.  Free samples of the powdered sugar dough bites were a nice bonus too!

Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a place in the Summerlin area to stop by for lunch."}
{"text":"They put too much garlic on crust or in sauce.  Ordered cheese pizza and all we could taste was the garlic. Threw it away. Just wasn't edible."}
{"text":"Been getting their menu in the mail and been looking for a good, local pizza joint. I love pizza, that and a beer is one of my favorite meals. I called in an order for pick up and it was ready in the time they gave me, I think 25 minutes.

The pizza is overall.... Ok? I ordered pepperoni and extra cheese and the amount of cheese seemed a little less than \"extra.\" The pepperoni and everything tasted pretty good. I especially like the crust, it's on the thinner side but not too thin and was really tasty. Although I know pizza isn't an especially healthy choice, this one was rather greasy, which was a big turn off to my boyfriend. Also it really falls apart the further into the slice I got, eventually completely coming apart from the fat crust at the end. Between the grease and fall-apart quality this makes for a messy pizza experience.

Overall I have mixed feelings. It definitely wasn't bad pizza but not great either. My boyfriend also ordered a calzone and thought it was \"boring.\" Gonna keep looking for a good local pizza joint."}
{"text":"I have my go to for white pizza and it's usually Nora's and Slice of Vegas! But maybe I can add this place also now if I can't make it all the way to either of those places. I tried the white pizza which was delicious and the pepperoni/ sausage which was nothing really special. The cannoli was also yummy."}
{"text":"I always see this place packed and decided to try their pizza. My friend and I ordered a cheese and a white pizza with a side of garlic bread. The garlic bread was amazing. The pizza lacked flavor. The crust was thin but the pizza tasted like it was reheated. The sauce could have used more zest and the cheese wasn't that great either. The white pizza wasn't good whatsoever. Overall, not the best pizza I had but I might go there again to try their sandwiches. 

On a positive note, service was great."}
{"text":"I'm honestly not sure if the food here is any good or not, but the service SUCKS! This is the third time I've tried to call and place an order, as advertised on their website, only to be put on hold indefinitely and/or hung up on. Now that Rocco's is 0 for 3, I will not be trying again. There are plenty of other local businesses in the neighborhood that are competent at managing their phone business (e.g. Upper Crust, Napoli, Manhattan Pizza, etc.) for catering orders, and I will continue to support them. For their sake, I hope the owners/management of Rocco's learn a thing or two about managing the business side of a restaurant, because they are certainly missing some lucrative opportunities."}
{"text":"The food, environment, and overall service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. The place could be a little cleaner which is why only 4 stars."}
{"text":"This pizza is SO GOOD. I like all styles of pizza so I'm not picky, but no matter what kind I get, I still want good cheese, good sauce, and a well-cooked crust, and Rocco's delivers. The large is huge - bigger than the 16 inches they claim. I went on a Monday, when they have a takeout deal of a large cheese for $9.99, plus $1.50 per topping. Even with three toppings that's less than you pay at a lot of places around here for a smaller pie with 0 toppings, and you don't sacrifice on quality.

I'm just hoping I have the fortitude not to order one of these giant pizzas every week."}
{"text":"Pizza inspires some pretty heated debates. Everyone has a quippy little theory: \"It's all in the crust.\" \"It's all in the sauce.\" I don't get it. Are you telling me if someone put ketchup on the best crust in the world it would be the best pizza? Bullfeathers. 

I digress. Around these Yelp parts, Rocco's is touted as being some of the best NY Style pizza in Las Vegas. NY Styles means thin, large slices that tend to collapse in your hands. I have not been eating too much pizza of late, but we were over at Best Buy getting some new pans (not sure who's going to use them!), so I decided to pop in for a slice.

A large part of the charm here is the atmosphere, as you definitely feel as if you have walked into a Bronx pizza joint. Shelves are crowded with pasta and candy; there is a fridge with Italian ice, coconut gelato and Rocco's marinara sauce to go. The lady behind the counter delivers big smiles and charm with a big accent. It all works together to create the ideal environment for scarfing down a slice. We probably came a little late in the day for the freshest slices. By 4pm the premade pizzas looked a little disappointing, but whaddya expect?

Mondays they have a pizza special: large cheese for $10. Good deal, but we weren't ready to commit to a whole pie. I ordered one slice of the vegetarian. The crust was a nice balance of crispy and chewy, and the sauce had a nice sweetness. I must say, however, that for me, a pizza is all about the toppings. Ha! No, that is not my pizza quip. Seriously, I was a little disappointed in the toppings. They were sparse. I like piles of things on my slice. Yes, I am a glutton who is willing to use a fork. Have you seen my cow picture?

Anyways, that is just one little complaint. Overall, Rocco's has a delicious combination of atmosphere, crust and sauce. Way, way, way better than ketchup on a brilliant crust!"}
{"text":"Very good NY style pizza. The white pizza was loaded with ricotta and was amazing. Small pizza is enough to feed 3. Very good reheated the next day."}
{"text":"In town for a pharmaceutical convention and stopped by Roccos randomly and was glad my colleagues and I did!!! We shared the Wild White pizza as suggested by Ryan(fantastic person even though he's a Eagles fan) and were so impressed with the quality of the pizza a couple of the guys got some slices of cheese pizza to go just because. Will definitely be coming back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"I'm originally from NY and a pizza freak.  On my annual visit back to NY I think I eat pizza for 80% of my meals.  

Pizza is thin, typical NY pizza, maybe a little too thin though.  It's also insanely greasy, too much for the dreaded napkin dab, you'll need a few. The service is typical NY service, short, not so sweet and far from friendly.  I guess they're really trying to give you the NY experience.

Price is decent, but not far down the street in Boca Park is East Side Pizza. Far better IMO, and the same price."}
{"text":"This place gets it.. Good pizza, good service(this location). They even have the black-and-white cookies for dessert.  If they only had a good NYC cheesecake like JR.   But I have to say this place is one of the best in Vegas.  Try one of their sandwiches.  Forgetaboutit"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been going here since they were tiny with just a handful of tables, before they expanded. A great mom n' pop place that offers both great service and food! Try the buffalo chicken pizza, delicious!!!"}
{"text":"We love Roccos!  Every time the food is great and delivered super fast.  Very friendly staff and the pizza is great.  The dinner salad needs a little pizazz but all in all great."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza. They sell their own dough, so that's a plus! 
Great NY feel and service is always great with plenty of seating along the aisle, back and outside.  Love the samples near the register as well."}
{"text":"Went in tonight for the Monday Pizza special for $9.49 whole pie. Placed my order and sat in my car until it was ready. Walked back in and employees are arriving and swearing at each other in front of guests. Very unprofessional. I don't want to hear employees yelling and cursing at each other while I'm picking up my food. It was very distasteful. Management should really seek to correct the employee issues there. This is not the first time that I've witnessed employees not getting along and being disrespectful towards one another"}
{"text":"First time we've ever been to a pizza place and didn't order pizza. We got stromboli, fettuccine Alfredo and a Philly cheesesteak sandwich. My hubby got the sausage Stromboli and LOVED it. I had the eggplant Stromboli, also pretty good. I like more cheese though, so next time I'll ask for a bit more. Both of our daughters ordered the fettuccine Alfredo. I thought the sauce could've used a little more salt, pepper and Parmesan, but it was it was still good. My son ordered the Philly. He said it was AMAZING. He usually doesn't eat much and he devoured the entire thing. They have all kinds of desserts there too. We had a bag of little fried pieces of dough coated in powdered sugar. I have no idea what they were called, but they were great. The staff was super friendly and helpful, that was my favorite part. Nothing better than good food and a happy staff. We will definitely go back. I want to try the pizza, the vodka sauce and the cannoli."}
{"text":"Pizza is eh, not horrible but not great. Garlic knots were bland, NO flavor whatsoever same for the mozzarella sticks. We ordered 2 sides of Ranch, thinking it would be the good kind restaurants have that make it themselves...nope, packets. Overall, the food just needs more flavor."}
{"text":"i always get the stuffed shells. they make the best one. the garlic knots come with it and it is real, homemade knots, you have to try it."}
{"text":"I'd give it 1.5 stars. This was a horrible experience with horrible food. The wings were crispy and my 5 year liked the cheese pizza is about the only good thing here. We ordered buffalo wings not enough sauce and half the bones were broken, that is always weird to me. The cheese pizza was boring and only a kid could like it. We also ordered calzones, both calzones were missing ingredients that we had ordered and all you could taste was the over abundance of Ricotta in the burnt calzone. My mother had been here before and not liked it but said she would try one more time because all I wanted was some good buffalo wings and a beer. Oh yeah they don't serve beer or wine here. When my mom tried to order a Stromboli she was told that she could only pick from the premade old ones that were sitting out. I was shocked but not as shocked as when we went to sit down and the kid working told us we would have to sit in the hall he was cleaning the dining room. We tried to put together the 2 four tops to seat the 6 of us and there was no room to move, not to mention I hope nobody wanted to get by. While we were waiting for our food the kid starts mopping the floor with an unbelievable choking smell of cleaner we had to ask for our food to go. I'll never be back that's for sure and neither will my mother."}
{"text":"Great spot. Good food. Enjoyable atmosphere. The hardworking cooks are also your servers. It's a little in the expensive side when you compare it to chain restaurants but the quality is there. Been here twice and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Still my favorite pizzeria!  I enjoyed Roccos so much while I lived in NLV that I would make the point of having lunch here everytime I come back in town.  I went in tonight and ordered the Baked Ziti.  As always, whatever you order, it comes out hot and delicious from their kitchen.  

The staff are friendly and quick.  I only waited less than 10 minutes and my order was out.  I actually ended up eating it an hour later and the food was still warm.

I would recommend this establishment for anyone.  I lived in NY/NJ for 9 years and this store brings the taste of Italy right into your mouth."}
{"text":"I like the pizza, but the service is awful. I have called in an order and the person on the phone told me to \"hurry up\" (which I thought was extremely disrespectful) and then he proceeded to act annoyed that I was ordering food. My family enjoys eating the food, but it's not worth it when the employees act as if you are a hassle. I would rather just order pizza somewhere else."}
{"text":"We wondered around towards the back looking for someone to seat us. Was told after standing behind the waitstaff at the counter that we could just sit anywhere we wanted. Perhaps a sign? Would save from reviews like this. 
Second thing, the pizza. We ordered the Brooklyn.. I know it comes with extra sausage, pepperoni, and cheese. Hold the cheese please? Check. 
Um? Where's the sauce and pepperoni? It was literally just sausage. 
Also, they have these little candy machines on the booth tables. Super dirty. The place had a dirty feel to it. Dust all over the pictures. Walls covered in food. Save some time and just go to North End Pizza."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night. Ordered the special. Buy one get one half price. They charged me reg. Price after I asked for the special.  When I called, I  was told that I never asked for it! The person on the phone very rudely told me that I was wrong. Regardless whether I asked for it or not , if that's your special of the night why not just give it! When I asked that, the girl told me that the owner only wants to give it when asked for it.! No customer service at all."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and amazing pizza! Monday's special is a large cheese for $9.99 can't beat it. This is our go to pizza place and the employees are so nice, we would recommend!!"}
{"text":"If I could use one word to describe Rocco's it'd be: HUGE. The size of the pizzas and slices are hella big! There's no way I could eat more than 2 slices, and it's a shame, because I don't want to stop eating cuz it's so good! So far I've tried 4 of their toppings: cheese, pepperoni, meat lovers, and supreme. All very delicious. My favorite has to be meat lovers because the sausages they put on it taste like real authentic Italian cooked sausages.

Another thing I have to mention are tier garlic knots. We get the order of 6 knots for $3.99. & Just like the pizza, the knots are pretty big. It comes with marinara sauce but the knots are made with such a perfect blend of butter and garlic that they taste perfectly fine the way they are.

They have daily lunch specials for really cheap. I got the 1 slice of cheese pizza + side salad and my bf got 2 slices of cheese pizza and we also ordered the garlic knots. Our total was under $17 which is pretty good if you ask me, considering how much food we get. 

Last but not least the service was great. The people there are super friendly, they gave the place a homely vibe."}
{"text":"I remember when they first opened years ago and I liked this place. They've expanded and remodeled the place. Along with that was a decline in the quality of their food. My friend and I shared a medium half everything, half pepperoni pizza and rainbow cookies. 

Pizza:
What the heck happened to their crust? It was like eating a cracker - pale and flavorless. What the heck happened to the pizza? It's just not as good as the last time I've been here. I had to fix it by dousing it with hot sauce. 2/5

Rainbow Cookies:
When I think of rainbows, I think happy thoughts. I tried their rainbow cookies and I was hoping my trip to New York was soon enough so I can get the real deal. This brought me great disappointment. It was dry and tasted so artificial. Never again will I try rainbow cookies from this town if it's not from Bagel Cafe. 1/5"}
{"text":"Almost 2 hours for what was supposed to be a 40m delivery. I usually don't review a place after the first try (well, this would be my second one in just a couple of weeks so I guess I can stop saying that now) but I'm gonna guess this is not unusually for Rocco's. Though judging by some of the recent reviews it seems they may have changed some.

I was disappointed because being from NY I love trying places that claim to have NY style pizza and use the term \"Pizzaria\" in their name (plus they have NY Giants memorabilia in the shop, what's not to like :)). The delivery guy was very kind and apologetic for the late delivery and when it comes to hard working young men and woman I never hold it against them. I wish I could say that the late delivery was a cause for the pizza not being to NY standards but the crust and the sauce just weren't up to par. This place came highly recommended by co-workers several times over so I just had to try it, again, maybe at some point they were but not anymore. We had friends over that day and ended up having to order a pie from DeLucia's because I didn't want them to leave thinking this was the so-called famed NY style pizza I've been raving about for so long. 

I'll definitely try Rocco's at least one more time in person but as NY pizza goes in this town I've realized that there are places that are pretty consistent in how they make their pizza and can't imagine Rocco's recipe changing enough to satisfy my occasional craving for a taste from home. Maybe they have Zeppoles? That would make me come back for sure!

Happy eats ya'll!"}
{"text":"Great Everything pizza! Fresh made zeppolis are addictive! Grubhub delivery so don't know about the premises, but food was great!"}
{"text":"I really had high hopes for this pizza establishment. So tonight was the night to have a cheat meal and relish some amazing pizza. The order was easily made over the phone but the time it took was well over an hour and then when the pizza arrived... it was LUKE WARM!! I mean seriously, first the wait took forever and then I had to nuke the pizza in the microwave to eat it?!?! Horrible!! So yeah almost $40 for some room temp pizza is more than disappointing.  Never will eat here again!!!"}
{"text":"Oh, you serve the holy grail of pizza, and you serve it so well...NY Style, by the slice.  You also serve it just like back home (which for me, is Scranton, Buffalo, Philly, and occasional trips to NYC). This is nothing like the imitators I keep running into in Dallas, TX.   The walk up glass counter, lots of Italian products and stuff in the freezer...if you're feeling like no one understands you, go to Rocco's and get that slice. 

The funny thing for me was it seems that there must be a prep or private school nearby, that lets out around 3:00 or so and all the moms pick up their kids, and make a pit stop at Rocco's to fill some hungry boy bellies.  I wouldn't have minded an after school snack like that on a regular basis."}
{"text":"My spouse REFUSES to eat anyone's lasagna other than mine. I've gotten lasagna from a number of different places, different countries, trying to find one she would be willing to actually eat, and save me the time of slaving away for hours in the kitchen. 

Finally, it's here the one and only \"Rocco's\". She loves it, everything we have tried from there is great. It's our official go to pizza place.  Also the convenience of the S. Rainbow location saves me also in drive time. 

If you haven't been to Rocco's, you NEED to, your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy eggplant and sausage pizza, I can  start and finish that giant piece of carb on my own and feel guilty later. Linguini with white clam sauce is also delicious. Too small to sit down with a group of more than 4 people. Take it home and enjoy it with your loose pajamas."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times with my boys. They love Rocco's Pizza!!!  Pizza always comes out fast and cooked the same every time. Staff at this location is always super nice and inviting when you walk in the door. They always pay attention to the kids and make sure they are enjoying themselves!"}
{"text":"Man I wish I could agree with a lot of the reviews here.. But is be lying if I said anything I tasted from Rocco's was excellent.  Also, I tried them twice, the time being almost a year or more between visits.  Both times the quality of the food was very weak.   First visit hubby & I shared a pepperoni pizza.  I should've went to Costco and had a decent slice at a great price.   So I didn't want to return but for some reason my hubby wanted to give them another shot tonight.   So we ordered the chicken parmesan entree.. I'd give it 1.5 stars... Previously frozen chicken, over cooked and soggy, in a very basic & mediocre tomato sauce. .  And don't get me started on the penne pasta that came with it.  All but 2 noodles went in to the trash.  We also had a pizza with pep, mush, onion & garlic.  I ate 1/2 a slice. -.- hubby said it was \"ok\" and our 6 year old said it was good.  
To end this I did read a lot of folks saying customer  service needs improvement, and yes that is a must. I hope this Rocco's is not related to the one on charleston & buffalo, they're great."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this review is only for the location on Rainbow. Delivery complaint aside (took over 2 hours to arrive), the food once it arrived was nothing to write home about. 

Pizza was over cooked and the crust was bland. Ordered a green salad and an antipasto and received 2 poorly made antipastos. Driver was very apologetic when he dropped order off, but food was definitely not with the wait.

If you are looking for a good NY pie, do yourself a favor and try someplace different."}
{"text":"Not one for leaving reviews but oh snap this place is scrumdidlyumtious! On the real though it's super good I'll be back no joke!"}
{"text":"I am only giving this 2 stars because I think the pizza is just okay. It seems like every time I have been here, they have screwed something up. The staff here are always rude and could care less if the customers are happy.

They have an antipasto salad that is nothing more than a chefs salad. If you are looking for an antipasto, do not order it here. You will regret it for sure. Be sure to always check your order before leaving, it stinks to get home and have it be wrong."}
{"text":"What can I say? I'm a Bronx girl that can appreciate a great slice of pizza. Rocco's is the best pizza in Las Vegas! Eat in or take out, you can't go wrong. The cannoli's are to die for! They even give you a little attitude to remind you of New York! Lol, you'll love it."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this little place while leaving my doctors office. I only wish I lived in summerlin. As an Italian New Yorker this place matches my expectations! It's hard to find authentic pizza and Italian treats in The Vegas area, and Rocco has all of that. Service is friendly, quaint little pizzeria that reminds me of \"home\" and my nyc childhood. Thanks Rocco! I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'd just like to say that after my review, management went above and beyond to make things right. Roccos is stand up joint that we'll continue to visit."}
{"text":"This pizza shop is located close to my work so I had to give it a try when some coworkers and I wanted pizza. We ordered a margarita pizza and a large (dozen) order of garlic knots. The atmosphere was pleasant and the World Cup was playing on the tv. We sat and waited for our order. It took quite some time for the pizza to come out but we didn't mind as we knew it would be freshly made. Maybe I'm a bit spoiled as I'm used to margarita pizzas being simple with tomatoes, mozzarella and basil. Well the amount of sweet yet bitter tomato sauce that soaked this pizza ruined it for me. The crust however, had great texture and crunch. I mainly scraped off the topping and ate the pizza dough instead. We were almost done with the pizza when my friend remembered we ordered garlic knots, only to be told that they were still baking. No worries, we just asked for them to go since we had to rush back to work. Three of those garlic knots ended up on the side of the road as we were all disgusted by them. I think they may have been frozen and heated up or something. They tasted like stale unseasoned pretzel dough that was toasted in a toaster oven. They were still cold on the inside of that doughy dry mess. The staff was so friendly but it couldn't save this place for me."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza spot in town for pizza. Good food and people at this location."}
{"text":"Great pizza and lasagna. Just made NYE a hit at my place with lasagna, garlic knots, a fruit platter and zeppolis. Simply the best."}
{"text":"Decided to get some pizza and garlic bites to go. I got the 12 pieces on the bites and wanted 2 sauces. The server assured me that there was 2 marinara sauces. There was only one. I asked if they had a garlic sauce and she said no, they have garlic sauce on them already, mine were quite dry. To top it off, the one sauce they gave me had a loose lid and all the marina sauce ended up everywhere except on the bites. The chain pizza places get a lot of criticism, but they are at least consistent. Would you pay $7 for this?"}
{"text":"Every single time we go to Costco Summerlin, the Bae asks, \"Want to get a slice of pizza?\"  I have to resist saying yes. Pizza is an integral part of a New Yorkers diet. Relocating so far from the food I love was a difficult decision. Whenever I feel that way, I have a slice at Rocco's. Had a slice at another location that was not up to par but Summerlin hits the nail on the head. Originally from the Bronx, you have to expect good pizza.  Every slice and pie we purchased did not disappoint. When I sit there looking at the pictures of NY and all that snow reminds me why I left. Since relocating to Las Vegas I have been fortunate to maintain my balanced NY diet!"}
{"text":"Their phone service is bad, the pizza is hit or misss. The cannolis though, so good."}
{"text":"I'm born and raised in NYC and spent most of my career in the Bronx. This is the real deal in Vegas.  I met the owner and he was born and raised in the Bronx.  Don't waste your time in Vegas going to any pizza parlor here except for Rocco's or NY Pizza on Sahara and Jones which is owned by a Queens guy"}
{"text":"Normally I'm sure Rocco's would get more stars and we'd get better service & pizza. However, the Mosley VS Mayweather fight was on and that had every employee's undivided attention.
They didn't have too many varieties of pizza at 8pm on a Friday so we tried a coule of plain slices and the Sicilian pie. The pizza was good, not my first choice of toppings but it was good and I could see us normally giving a more positive review.
More than likely we'll give it another shot before we head into the Red Rock again and hopefully a big fight won't be happening so we can get as much attention as the TV does."}
{"text":"Good Eastcoast style Pizza.  Love the eggplant topping."}
{"text":"Good East Coast Style Pizza.  They cook the crust till golden brown.  The sauce is good and not overpowering.  For a change, order Eggplant as a topping.  They fry it first before it goes on the pizza.  Adds a nice flavor to a veggie pie.  While not cheap, the pie is a good value."}
{"text":"I usually like this place but and the food is good generally. Unfortunately, while I was eating a stromboli  (which was delicious) I found something very hard while chewing! At first I thought it was a chicken bone but then remembered there's no chicken in this. Apon inspection of my bite, I FOUND A STAPLE. Yes, a metal staple. I'm happy I didn't swallow it, but unhappy I can no longer eat here."}
{"text":"When it was owned by Rocco from da bronx it was far better. Now a gas station owner from la owns it. Skimping on quality ingredients and listening to truly in competent employees. Sad. For the REAL Roccos got to summerlin. You will taste the difference."}
{"text":"So we made it to Vegas and needed to find food as the kids were hungry.  It was a long trek as traffic was bad, but always fun to be in Vegas!  We are staying at Red Rock and so I Yelped pizza joints and found this place nearby.  Simple place with a good variety on their menu - we ordered a large with mushrooms, sausage and pepperoni.  We also ordered a side of meatballs.  They were getting ready to close so people were sweeping up and we were one of the last two groups/customers for the day.  Anyhow, when the food came I was disappointed to see so few toppings on the pizza pie.  The crust was ok but all the toppings slid off the pizza - we even waited ten minutes before eating to let the cheese cool a little and settle onto the pie.  The meatballs were ok and so was the marinara sauce - nothing special but not bad.  One complaint is that the paper plates they use are so flimsy and the grease just seeps right through the bottom leaving the whole table greasy.  Overall just an okay place - wish it could have been better.  More a 2.5 star place."}
{"text":"Coming from someone who grew up on the East Coast and then spend ten years in Los Angeles (a.k.a. Pizza Jail), Rocco's is indeed the real deal for authentic New York-style pizza.  I haven't eaten at a ton of pizza places in town, mostly because after I tried Rocco's, I keep coming back. Pepperoni and mushrooms with extra cheese, please."}
{"text":"No. Or rather, Fuck no.

Our experience was by far the worst I have ever had, anywhere. Let's start with once you enter: There are no signs to indicate whether you should seat yourself, or order first, or what the hell ever you are suppose to do. And employees are the least helpful human beings on earth. They stare at you while you look around obviously lost as to what to do.

So we sat down by a wall of pizza boxes, and found a menu left there by previous customers. We decided on the special, a 16inch cheese pie for 9.99$. Nice right? Fuck no. With 2$ per drink and a time of ten minutes for the pie we waited. And waited. And then the unthinkable happens. A group of three kids and an adult drop the rest of their pizza on the ground. How the hell that happened, I do not know, but the end result was three left over pieces on the ground.

Two minutes later these fuckers get OUR FUCKING PIZZA. The employee says, \"Oh that' ok, we will get you another.\" Yeah, another person's fucking pizza they have been waiting for! Ar you FUCKING KIDDING ME!? Oh and no explaination when we get one HALF AN HOUR AFTER ORDERING! Ten minutes my ass.

Whatever, you may say, why freak out? I am freaking out because when I asked for a to go box, I was given a USED one! IT HAD GREASE MARKS AND CRUMBS IN IT! 

So my friend threw it on the table next to us, grabbed a clean one from the tower behind me, and we left.

This place is a complete and utter mess, not to mention the pizza was less than good and even ended up getting me sick. Never again."}
{"text":"Went in today to get some pizza for lunch and they didn't have any pizza. What kind of pizza place doesn't have pizza available. Said it would take 20 to 30 minutes. Pretty sad."}
{"text":"I love pizza and Rocco's has some of the best pizza I've had in a long time. The crust was delicious and crunchy. The customer service was also very attentive and helpful.  To top off the meal I suggest getting an Italian ice. Aces...."}
{"text":"Great great customer service but not a good product."}
{"text":"Got chicken parmesan.  It was ok.  I like thick chicken.  This was thinking but quite a bit, very cheesy and lots of pasta.  I got angel hair.  Just tasted bland to me.  Every one was carrying out pizza so maybe that's better?"}
{"text":"Our first time here with a dual military family of 5. Family friendly and ready to accommodate our hungry brood. Military discount on select items and the manager even brought out a free dessert in thanks for our service. A must for the larger family on the go!"}
{"text":"Rocco's! My little slice of new york. I enjoy their pizza, salads, and sandwiches. Their garlic knots are tasty! 

On this particular occasion I already ate so I went for dessert only. I got the dessert sampler and it was so worth it. I loved the cannolis, and their Italian cookie thing was good too. The Tiramisu was pretty decent.

This location has friendly staff and the food is good. One of my favorite aspects is they used to do karaoke. It's on hold until they can find a karaoke DJ. They also have TVs for the games and they serve beer too if you like a cold one with your pizza.

I give 3 stars because this place has good food and good service. I can't wait until they bring back that karaoke!"}
{"text":"You I had a slice of white cheese pizza and it was delicious. My only complaint was that the server / cashier was not wearing gloves. And touching my crust!!!"}
{"text":"Best NY pizza outside of Manhattan!  We never sit and eat there, but they do have much more than pizza."}
{"text":"You guys need to open up in henderson aka seven hills or anthem. Point blank by far the best pizza hands down in vegas. There is no other! Im telling you if i didnt have to sit in traffic to go to their joints i would be there every week! Keep up the great work guys. Not only are their pizzas primo but they always have a full menu cooking with some of the best Italian dishes to date. They even make home made Italian cookies and have a big selection of Italian dry food to stock your pantry with. They always have a smile and never treat you wrong! A++++++++"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the only places for pizza! I literally only come here to get some legit by style slices."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town to me! Their cucumber salad is on point and of course awesome service! I literally go here everyday and I see how happy everyone always are, gotta try if you never been you will prolly never go to dominos Pizza Hut ever again lol 
Thanks Cathy and Al"}
{"text":"New ownership. We ordered by phone and picked the pizzas up, a cheese and everything pizzas, the dough was super hard, the ingredients have changed, it tasted like an old pizza that was just reheated, we all got sick. I can go to little Caesar's and know the pizza is made fresh for $5, with low grade ingredients. The best reviews are mostly from 2014. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"I went here today and I must say that it was just OK. I had 2 slices of cheese pizza, and while that might not be the best choice to critique the place, I felt it gave me a good baseline. 

There's really not that much to report. The slices were huge and filling, the cheese was good and the service was pleasant. Speaking of the service, I went during lunch time and the place was empty, but since I planned to eat it, I had to be waited on. I didn't think it was necessary and it cost me more since I felt compelled to leave a tip, although not that much work was done on their part. 

Overall though, I would go back there again and try the garlic slider, that looks interesting."}
{"text":"Had the Sicilian style pizza, not bad but very expensive for what it was. Service was ok..."}
{"text":"The delivery I had today was very fast, very hot and fresh and much quicker than the time I was told
This happens on every delivery I get
The people on the phone and delivery drivers are outstanding and always take care of what I want"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and service is great!

We came here a couple weeks ago with my Aunt and father who grew up in Queens. They said \"pretty darn close!\" When we asked how authentic the pizza was. Initially my father and aunts pizza was a little too burnt on the bottom, after two bites and zero prompting from any of us, the cook came out and handed them both new slices. Was very kind of them. I also tried to buy a side of pepperoni for my salad well after we had ordered and the kind lady at the register insisted on giving it to me for free. 

This visit the same kind lady gave me a few cookies for free. I had asked if I can just buy 5 cookies, various types to try and she would not charge me for them and only rang us up for our pizza. The slices are out already but the food comes fresh when ordering a whole pizza. 

We ordered a pepperoni with jalapeños on half. DELICIOUS!! Thin, floppy crust, but also crispy at the same time. 

When servers or cashiers (maybe even the owner) goes out of their way to do something kind I LOVE IT!! As a business owner myself the extra smile, advice or free item does not go unnoticed.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit, was craving pasta but didn't feel like getting dressed.  Yelp recommended Rocco's. Service was good, I appreciate a cashier that can multi task. About 10 minutes or so and we had fettuccini Alfredo and a small pizza.  Alfredo sauce had really good texture and consistency,  wish for more garlic but realize that's a matter of taste.   Pizza had good ingredients and crust was perfect. Again more garlic in the tomato sauce would make it perfect for me. Definitely go back."}
{"text":"Uh oh. You disappointed me Rocco's. 

Your food is always on point but the delivery was less than sub par and it wasn't the driver's fault. Whoever bagged my meal was obviously not paying attention when he bagged my shrimp Alfredo. Just a quick tip y'all, put your pasta dishes in a plastic bag (or two) before you put it in a paper bag. It leaked EVERYWHERE and all over EVERYTHING. And my single kids slice pizza, yeah. It's not cool to have pizza grease dripping on my feet when the guy drops off my food. Either change boxes or put some grease absorbing SOMETHING in there to keep this from happening. 

You can do better."}
{"text":"If you're a pizza lover this is the place to go! Their wings aren't the best if you're a wing lover. Staff is always nice."}
{"text":"Definitely better than your delivery pizza and my favorite local pizza spot in Vegas! I thought Vegas fell off a little bit for pizza places but I really enjoy this place. It really does have a New York feel. Always come here every now & then on lunch break to enjoy their pizza. They have an amazing deal, 2 slices & a drink for $7.99 which my bf & I share. We also get garlic knots to go along. My favorite is their pepperoni & sausage, also the lasagna slice. Their pizza has just the right amount of sauce, not really greasy, also the actual crust of the pizza is crisp on the bottom which makes it perfect. Quick bite to eat, with really friendly staff."}
{"text":"It's called Rocco's NY Pizzeria! Well, I think that is not such a good name for this spot. I ordered the Italian sub. Now here's where you really will need to pay attention. The cashier R2 took my order. Not sure if each person had his or her own pass code or number when they used the register. Back to my order of the Italian sub. Server asked what I wanted on it, my reply exactly: lettuce, tomato, onion, oregano, oil, and peppers on the side. The server looked at me and said \"oil?\" We don't have just oil, it's pre-mixed with other ingredients. Ok, now I'm stunned a little. This is supposed to be an Italian restaurant, right? What Italian restaurant doesn't have Olive Oil?! What the??! He than asked me what kind of peppers? My reply, was hot wet peppers. His reply, we don't have them. At this point I was really tempted to run outside to look at the name of the restaurant displayed on the window, just to make sure I was in the right place. Maybe I had walked into the place next door by mistake. I am still really confused, disappointed and really hungry, so I decided to, shake it off and go with my gut and give it a shot. 
Now a female customer comes in, she ordered over the phone. The server had plenty to say to her and told her to enjoy her pizza and her sub. Welllllllll, he called my name, handed me a stapled!!!!! bag. So I looked and wondered why they would staple it closed. And that's all I got. Not \"have a good night\", \"enjoy your fake NY Italian sub\"...NOTHING! There isn't a sub house or place that sells sandwiches on the East Coast that would have given me the responses I got from this server. They would not have questioned my asking for oil...or peppers on the side. 
Once I got home, opened fort knox and saw that my oregano was in a container and not on my dry Italian sub! That really was it for me. I won't be back! I am now on the hunt for a real Italian sub shop that can make me a sandwich that reminds me of home, and when I ask for oil instead of mayo, they will say \"sure\"."}
{"text":"Here's my issue...I would rather give the food a 4, maybe even 5 star rating, but tonight's service was horrible to the point I didn't place an order.  We have ordered from Rocco's a number of times, ordering the same order over and over, with a slight Rocco's inconvenience (I need the mushrooms on the side).  (turns out I would not like anyone with a mushroom allergy to die....go figure).  Rocco's has never, ever dismissed this request....until tonight.  When I told the gal our need and that we had requested this a number of times she said, \"well, I can put it on half the pizza otherwise, not tonight.  We are very busy.\"  ummm..  what?  it's that hard to NOT put mushrooms on a pizza and them in a teeny-tiny container as they have done a number of times previously?  Sorry Rocco's. Work on your staff and then I'll come back.  Congratulations Hungry Howie's.  You now have my every Thursday football order!!!"}
{"text":"A place named Rocco's should do better than this.  

I liked the idea of the 2 slices and a drink for $4.99!  I added sausage for $5.99 still good.  Just like other places by the slice they add toppings on a cooked pizza and throw it in the oven for a few minutes.  I am generally good with that.

The service was friendly and the places seemed pretty clean.  All good so far.

I posted a picture and you can see my problem.  They added suasage that had been shaved so thin it was practically translucent. It was sliced so thin I could hardly taste it!  One slice of the pizza was soggy so I couldn't fold it the way I like - I had to fold it in half and then in half so I had a wad of pizza.  The other slice folded a little better.

I never thought I would say a pizza was too thin... but the pizza was too thin.  There was nothing to it...

The flavor of the pizza was just okay - I was underwhelmed by the whole experience."}
{"text":"Food is always good . The only thing that bothers me is the last two time I have ordered they have forgot stuff . A couple weeks ago they forgot my garlic knots And 2 nights ago they forgot my daughter's whole meal."}
{"text":"Nice little pizza parkour.   Pizza by the slice, calzones, salads, etc......

The people running this place are nice to deal with and take good care of you.  It always puts a smile on my face to come here."}
{"text":"Love this place! The service is good most of the time. I especially enjoy the pizza, garlic knots and gelato. We keep coming back weekly."}
{"text":"After seeing a movie at Red Rock Regal Cinemas last night, the casino was packed, so my pal and I headed across the street to Rocco's for dinner.  Always a reliable place for food, I ordered a rice ball and a small order of garlic knots (6).  There was a line of people waiting for their to-go orders, but we were able to snag seats at a table even though it's not a huge place and it was Friday night.  The rice ball was big enough that it was cut into four pieces.  Served with marinara sauce on the side, it was very good, and combined with the garlic knots, I had leftovers to take home that I'm re-heating as I sit here typing this review.
Customer service is friendly and prompt.  The only thing that struck me as funny (weird, not funny ha-ha) was that every time an order was ready for seated customers, the food server would come out of the kitchen door and go table to table trying to find the owners of the food, \"Salad?\" \"Uh, no.\"  \"Pizza?\"  \"Uh, no.\"  Maybe they should give customers those numbers on a stand so the poor kid doesn't have to stop at each table and see who the food belongs to?  Just sayin'.  My leftovers are ready to eat--ciao for now!"}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood joint, and I really couldn't ask for a better one. 

From the outside, it is just another Vegas Strip Mall hole-in-the-wall, but inside, the owners try to make their NY experiences come to life through images and stories and, of course, the food. 

The NY pizza (ie \"floppy pizza\") is very good. They've got the ratio of sauce to cheese down and the crust, although not perfect, offers the right amount of glutenous chewiness. But what I really come here for are the sandwiches. 

I know, the name says pizzeria, but the sandwiches are works of art served on an entire loaf of crusty, wood oven-baked, Italian bread. Yes, a whole loaf of fresh bread (a small loaf), is the vehicle on which their classic deli subs are built. I would really be perfectly happy to just eat the bread without the filling, but a few thinly shaved meats and some oil, vinegar and black pepper never hurt!"}
{"text":"This place was mentioned to me today and being a pizza lover, decided to check it out.  When we walked in, I was a little turned off by all the pizza pies laying around waiting for the pizza by the slice orders.  But, I decided to put that behind me and order a Large pizza with Pepperoni, green peppers and mushrooms.  Unfortunately, my favorite pizza topping is green olives, and they do not carry them.  I was told it would be 15 minutes until it was ready.  It took approximately 30 minutes :-(  I have to say, the pizza was fresh, hot, and surprisingly VERY good.  the only issue I had is that it was a little greasy.  I am not sure if that came from the cheese or the pepperoni, but it was one of the better pizza's I have had.  If they would only have met the time commitment they provided me, I would have given them 5 stars - even with the grease.  The place overall could have been a little cleaner, but it was, afterall, Saturday night."}
{"text":"Now perhaps I chose the wrong time to eat at Rocco's. The place was overloaded with high school kids for lunch, the staff was unfriendly and the food I ordered tasted like left over's that had been warmed up.  The crust was so hard that my pizza cracked in half. The confusion on who was in line and when my food was going to be done was also another down side. On the plus side the staff did a good job of wiping down tables and keeping it clean."}
{"text":"We LOVE Rocco's Pizza and I ate here almost weekly during my pregnancy. It was only fitting that we got them to cater our baby shower; and they did the most amazing job ever!!! 

We ordered the following:
Chicken Piccata: Amazing! Many guests went back for 3rds :)
Chicken Parmesan: Perfect! My favorite!
Penne Vodka: Great! We actually ran out (not because we didn't have enough...just that it was soooo good)
Spaghetti and Meatballs: A classic and perfect for our party!
Garlic Knots and Marinara: AWESOME!!! Our guests were gracious enough to leave a few for us to enjoy :)

Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely cater from them again. The prices were VERY reasonable (we fed 40+ people for about $5 each and still had some left overs--YUMMY!!!!)

Thank you Rocco's! We love your food in your store and love it even more now that we know we can get it catered :)"}
{"text":"Let's start with they offer breakfast on the weekends. What, A pizza place that offers breakfast!!! SOLD!!! Breakfast hours are 7-11 am!! 
Our first time in here today and it's totally \"cute\" okay maybe I shouldn't use the word cute to describe a pizza joint but It's decorated in a sports theme and it's very comfy. 
Ryan who welcomed us as soon as we arrived told us to pick a seat anywhere. He grabbed the menus and came over and conversed with us.  Telling us all about the breakfast and what he enjoyed the most about the menu (of course I asked).  We ordered pizza and fried ravioli. Ryan brought us some complimentary garlic knots which personally I'm not a huge fan of. These garlic knots were hot and fresh. They were tasty and not overwhelming in garlic (why I usually don't like them). These were pretty good I have to say. 
The manager Rangel was friendly and can by. The customer service here is outstanding and the food to follow was pretty awesome. I wish I wasn't so full, the gelato and cannoli look delicious!! They offered us a discount for being a first time visiter too!! 
We look forward to coming again!! 
Thanks again Ryan!!"}
{"text":"Rocco's has got to be the greatest pizza joint in Vegas. I'm originally from New York and eating at Rocco's reminds me of eating back at home. The truly is NY pizza"}
{"text":"I can't speak for anything other than the pizza. Called them at 9pm to order delivery, they told us it'd take up to 45min. Buuut they arrived within 15! An extra star for how stinkn fast they are!! 

We got a medium pepperoni pizza.. which was 8 even slices, kinda small for a medium?? Just enough for us two girls to gobble up with no leftovers. 

To be quite honest....their pizza tasted crazy similar to Napoli's! MINUS the terrible customer service haha! Wouldn't mind coming back here when I'm in the area! Definitely satisfied! (:"}
{"text":"Now there is pizza ( Domino's, Pizza Hut, etc. ) then there is New York Pizza. This place is the only place that I have found so far in Vegas that has pizza that reminds me of NY. They even sell pizza by the slice. The place is nice with about 10 tables and old pictures of the owners house and family back in NY. The have a huge menu of Italian favorites as well as pizza. When you first walk in to order grab a Zeppoli ( fried dough ball topped with powdered sugar ) for a free sample taste while you ponder the menu. I ordered 2 slices one pepperoni and sausage and one white margarita. The pepperoni and sausage was excellent. Not those little sausage balls used at other places but real Italian sausage thinly sliced so when heated it becomes a little crispy. The pizza was thin and crispy and the crust was crispy on the outside but soft and chewy in the middle. The white pizza was to die for. No tomato sauce instead they use olive oil. Then topped with mozzarella and ricotta cheeses, fresh tomato chunks and basil. WOW. I love a good white pizza. This place has the best pizza in Las Vegas. The owner is very friendly and the pizza is great. If you are looking for authentic NY Pizza this is your place."}
{"text":"13 days later and still haven't received our refund. Paid through yelp and been fighting my refund ever since. Bad experience on the Roccos side and the yelp side."}
{"text":"Coming back into town from the North side on the I-15, I was supposed to meet up with someone around the Aliante area after lunch time. Drove around the area looking for something, wanting to avoid a chain sit down restaurant or fast food, we saw Rocco's. 

Walking in, they have New York photos, sports memorabilia and such adorning all of the walls and most of the flat surfaces. Their menu was surprisingly huge for a pizza place as well. The cashier seemed a little cold and distant when we got there, almost like a true New Yorker, troubled that we would show up and make her do something.

Settling on a special of a salad, slice of pizza and drink, we sat down in the slightly cramped dining area awaiting our meals. Our salads came out first, they were decently sized, with lettuce that was almost fresh and not that brown around the edges of some pieces.

Next came our pizza, good sized, NY style pizza by appearance. Once it hit our mouths though... it was very bland. The crust was tough and crunchy, to the point of being tough to rip bites away from the slice.

I can't say that I was impressed by their take on NY pizza, or pizza in general, nor can I say that I will ever want to go back.

On the other side, the staff did seem less stand-offish once we were heading out, one gentleman held the door for our group and wished us well for the day."}
{"text":"After too many chances that I have given this establishment to provide fresh quality food and to get my order right, I have decided to never support this poorly managed place ever again.  

Save your money, try Old School Pizzeria directly across from the Cannery.  It's a bit of a drive for me but my family and I deserve quality food made with fresh ingredients and care.  Try Old School Pizzeria, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had some take out pizza from here and it was delicious. I would eat it every day if I could :-) but that could potentially be bad for my wasteline.

Yum yum"}
{"text":"The best kept secret in LV...  $10.99 dinner specials on Tuesdays!  We go every week, chicken marsala and veal parm dinners - off the charts!  Big portions, comes with bread and pasta.  You cannot beat this deal."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, you cannot beat the pizza.  Veal parm sub is awesome.  Alex is always friendly and the owner is extremely nice.  We love eating lunch here!  If you are looking for great food that is authentic, this is the place!"}
{"text":"we tried pizza and pasta to go from this place. Pizza was so dry and chewy. Pasta had no taste to it
Won't go again!!!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews online, we decided to check this place out. The menu is huge and I wanted to try everything, but we came here for the pizza. We ordered a large pizza and it came with free garlic knots with a yummy dipping sauce. The cheese pizza had a thin crust, which I love. They also have beer and wine available. The price is beyond reasonable for the great quality and quantity of food that you get. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Rocco's yet. One of my favorite places to eat pizza in Las Vegas, for sure. The people who work there are always so nice and hospitable. Most importantly though, the pizza is on point! The garlic knots are perfect, and the zeppolis are a must try! I crave Rocco's all the time! You will never find the place empty."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pepperoni and fettuccine alfredo with chicken to go for family dinner. Was fantastic! The pasta tasted homemade fresh and the pizza was delicious! Tasted similar to NY pizza style. If your craving pizza this is your go to place"}
{"text":"Nice to see some real east coast style pizza. Keep it up. Not a real sit down place but has some tables. People r your typical New York short with u style which isn't always bad. Will be back."}
{"text":"We order here at least once every two weeks, we usually order a personal pizza for my daughter and myself to share. And then pick a different pasta dish to explore each time. The food is consistent, and we enjoy visiting with the older gentleman who delivers to us each time! My dog and daughter love him and feel special when he comes to the door! We love garlic knots, the mozzarella sticks, and even the salad and fries! If you're in the area, stop in because the atmosphere is fun and engaging."}
{"text":"Extremely rude and unacceptable customer service. We walked in and started looking at the items displayed and menu. There were 3 workers behind the counter and we were not welcomed or offered any help upon entering. Two gentlemen walked in After us and were given service before us! I was completely shocked. We were profiled and not given the customer service we should have received as paying customers. We immediately left this establishment and will never return."}
{"text":"Rocco's sure looks like a NYC pizza joint.  Partial brick façade, pictures of old-time Italian New Yorkers strewn on walls, abrupt but not necessarily rude employees, and display plates of each dish laid out behind the plexi-glass counter, all work out to a great facsimile of what you find in the City.  Huge plus for me, even the New York-style service.  I've spent many a months in the city that never sleeps and have eaten my share of New York style pizza, which is one of my favorite dish of all time.  I'd have to say that pizza here is basically the same as what you will get in a \"typical\" pizza joint on any street corner in the City.  And that's a good thing.

I ordered a slice of pepperoni and a slice of pepperoni/sausage, with a fountain drink.  $9.50 for that, which is NOT like NYC.  You can get that for $2-3 cheaper out there, so it's not necessarily a great bargain.  First bite into the pepperoni and the bottom is a bit crunchier than I'd like.  The end crust is a bit crispier than I'd like also.  Pep/Sausage is better on both fronts, but I like the taste of the pep better.  The sauce is typical, not great but not bad either.  It comes piping hot after they reheat in the pizza oven, so be careful you don't burn your mouth.  I did.  They also have stromboli and calzone, both of which I'd like to try one day.

Like I said, it's really not any different than the typical street corner pizza joint with solid pies, awesome setting, and take-it-or-leave-it service.  So does that deserve a 4 or 5-star rating?  Well, the level of pizza is probably a 3.5 based on a 4-star for the actual typical NYC pie, and obviously service is somewhere around 3.  But with the authentic setting and the fact that this \"real\" NYC shop is a mile from my house, I'm upping it to a 4 even with the inflated pricing.  But seriously, $3.50 is too much for a slice, Rocco.

Table-for-1 Pizza:  One big reason I frequented Manhattan pizza joints often is the fact that you could eat there alone, unnoticed (not a loner, was there for work often).  No different here, so it's a perfect spot."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every time I come to Vegas I have to make it a point to stop here for their cheese pizza. We ordered cheese garlic bread while waited for our 3 pizzas to- go. They came out so fast and April was great! Will be back for sure on my next visit."}
{"text":"This place is great!  We just had lunch here for the first time. We ordered the garlic knots and they came out hot and soft.....so good.  We also ordered BBQ wings for my nephew. They brought out hot wings but immediately took care of the problem and bought out the correct wings with not much of a wait.  Then we ordered a medium white pizza.  This is by far the best pizza I've had in Vegas. We bought 2 regular mini cannolis and 1 chocolate mini cannoli to-go and our total bill was only $32!  Alfredo was our server and he was amazing.  The only complaint I have is all of the New York memorabilia. I'm from Boston"}
{"text":"Fugghetaboutit!  Meaning all the other places in Vegas that claim to have NY style pizza.  This is it baby.  This Queens girl is a happy camper now that I've finally eaten at Rocco's.  Not only do they have the pizza down, they carry WISE potato chips, Onion & Garlic to be exact AND Italian Ices.  So if you want an AUTHENTIC NY style, upper palate burning, 'SLICE' this is your place.  Now if I could only get ALL my loved ones to move to this side of the country I'd never have to go back!"}
{"text":"The white pizza is to die for. I've had other items which I've enjoyed, but I can't stay away from their white pizza... so good!"}
{"text":"I think I'm a little bit obsessed w this place - everything we've tried so far has been huge, cheap and delish. It's our new go to place for italian food, or hot and cold sandwiches (the 6\" is a lot bigger than you'd expect). The Brooklyn is a big pile of assorted quality meats and provolone on fresh crunchy bread that won't cut the roof of your mouth - get it w everything! 

We're also determined to try a bunch of their entrees while they have their opening special of $10.99 for all entrees. It's a significant discount off huge portions of quality food. We've had to wait about 30 min a couple times but seems like they do everything to order (heard them pounding the veal flat today) and its worth the wait. If time's an issue, just call your order in ahead of time. The veal sorrentino is my fav so far, veal marsala was least and even that wasn't bad, I've just had better.

Haven't tried their pizza by the slice yet, or calzones but both look good. They've had zeppoles w powdered sugar (Italian donuts) out for samples every time we've gone so far - be sure to try one, and you'll be addicted. It's $5 for a bag of about 30. Or you could also check out the tres leches cake at the Drago sisters bakery next door for dessert"}
{"text":"My title: AWESOME FIND
So I'm in town for a week and we keep passing this place, finally we stop in hoping to fulfill our NY pizza cravings. Walking in the first thing that hits you in the face is an authentic smell of Italian food,  a sweet indication of good things to come. We ordered the large everything which has sausage, pepperoni, meatball, mushroom, onion, green pepper on a nice NY thin crust for only $18 bucks! Sat down and waited, they brought this huge masterpiece to our table and it was a beauty which could easily feed four people, we had to take it back to hotel for later. Okay, so the crust is crispy and light the toppings a great generous balance the sauce perfect, a overall great pie! 
I will end up craving this pizza which for me is a five star rating because this is the goal for a restaurant, they achieved it here! Note: they have a big menu, there is much to try and given the opportunity I will, the pastas, stromboli, and subs looked amazing, also note the people working here were friendly and accommodating which makes for an overall great experience. PS they make homemade cannoli, shut up!!! Next time I'm saving some room it looked to die for."}
{"text":"I went to Rocco's. Not only did they not heat my pizza til it was warm, when I called to tell them the manager  told me it would be cold after half an hour. I live 5 minutes away. He asked me if I wanted them to remake my pizza. I said yes. When I got there it was ready. I showed him that  the sausage just fell off the pizza. Look at the new slice. He said this slice is well done!  I say not well done just prepared right. The big thing is he never apologized for the mistake. I will never go back. I'll just do Chicago style pizza which I like better anyway!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place, telling me it was great NY style pizza. As a New Yorker in Vegas I am always looking for good pizza.
So I call and order a large cheese pizza and a veal cutlet hero for delivery. An hour and ten minutes later no food. Mind you I am 3 miles from the place. 
So I call and this is what happens,
Me: Hi, i called for delivery over an hour ago and my food still isn't here.
Manager: oh your food is out for delivery, all food is out.
Me: Um, how do you know my food is out you didn't even ask me who I was.
Manager: i know who you are and your food is out.
Me: ok, then what was my order.
Manager: I don't know.

This interaction made my head hurt. After a few minutes of arguing with him he calls the driver who says he is 2 minutes away.

Food finally arrives and pizza is lukewarm. And the driver tells me \"oh no that pizza just came out\" really? Is that why I could put my fingers right on the top of a slice and not even blink? Normally the cheese is hot. 

Also don't order zepolies they don't know what real zepolies are as these were tiny, tiny dough balls with sugar on them. Zeppolies are large fried dough with powered sugar on top.

Will never order from them again.

Guess I am still looking for real NY pizza."}
{"text":"Pretty damn close to perfect! The pizza is spot on BRONX NY pizza! Everything else I put in my pie hole was just average! But hey no one is perfect!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Pizza in Aliante. Rocco's has an awesome staff that is excellent in customer service, prompt service and tasty food. If you ever feel like having a great pizza, pasta, salad or dessert and are looking for a family oriented atmosphere you must visit Rocco's!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza, a little greasy but it's good. They have large pieces And have been good since they first came in this neighborhood ten years ago."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. If you are looking for an italian restaurant with good food, but will consistently make significant mistakes on your order and won't fix those mistakes, this is the place for you. We decided to try again after a couple years hoping that management made some serious fixes in the operation of their business, but alas it appears it's only gotten worse. We are done trying again, which is such a shame as there are so few choices in Aliante."}
{"text":"Nothing better than Rocco's Pizza and knots! Perfect cheese to sauce ratio.  Staff is always ready to take your order and a sample of zeppoli's on the counter to stain your black shirt with powdered sugar (but so worth it). Try the white pizza sometimes for a change of pace. The cheese pizza deal on Monday's is one of the best deals around!"}
{"text":"We love Rocco's. We go there at least once, if not two or three times a month. We prefer mom and pop type places, and this is close to our house. But we made a mistake going there last night. I couldn't believe the service. We had had this waitress before, and we just know every time that it is going to be a huge pain every time. But we still go! But last night.... We arrived about 10 after 7 or so. There were two other occupied tables there. I think we were greeted, but then we sat. And sat. And sat some more. Finally, the girl came to take our drink order. By this time, we were ready to order our food. She seemed surprised that we were ready to order, but it had been about 20 minutes by then. We order food and drinks, and then we wait! There were other people working on the counter side, but I am not sure if they're not able to help fill drink orders. We got our drinks, and waited some more for the salads that came with the combo. Finally got the salads, and we overheard the waitress talking to another person about our pizza being messed up. The other person asked her what we wanted her to do. Well, she never discussed it with us! Finally my husband asked her if our pizza was messed up. She said yes! We figured out what we would be doing about it, and all should have been well. Drinks went dry. There was absolutely no pep in the step of anyone working. The place was empty! I don't understand what the issue was! But this has been a problem with this waitress in the past, so I guess we should not be surprised. 

I really hope that some changes are made with regard to the lack of enthusiasm with the staff. I had a coworker suggest checking in to see if that particular waitress is there, and if she is, we just go elsewhere. That sucks to have to do that, but maybe that's what we will do."}
{"text":"Great pizza. HUGE slices! Very much enjoyed Rocco's pizza. Noticed several \"regulars\" during my visit -- also a good sign. Simple food, very tasty - - I actually wanted to take some back to LA with me, but didn't think my car would survive the \"Fresh Pizza Smell\" of a 6 hour drive. I did take home a blister pack of yummy Joey's Italian Style Cookies -- which seem to only be available in New Jersey (unless you're special like Rocco)....this is a place I can whole heartedly recommend. The pizza itself is gooey and cheesy. The pepperoni slice was appropriately oily...this is not the type of place an LA model would enjoy, but if you are a normal, pizza-loving patron, give this spot a shot!"}
{"text":"We have been buying pizza at Rocco's to take home for several years and enjoy both the cheese  and sausage pizza. Often we get their antipasto which is full of good meats, cheese, olives, roasted peppers and lettuce. It's really quite tasty.
So today for lunch with a friend I decided to try one of their cold sandwiches. Based on my experience with their antipasto and in part on reviews here I chose the Staten Island. The Italian bread was fresh and tasty, the 6\" sandwich which is more like 8+\" is loaded with meat (prosciutto, ham, salami, capicola) and fresh mozzarella. I passed on the offered lettuce, tomato and vinegar and oil. The sandwich was excellent and well worth the $7.39 price. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing! Simply amazing! 
Everything was great! We order a half pepperoni, half sausage with mushrooms and bell peppers. The crust was crispy and the thing crust pizza with all the cheese and meat was on point. We also had chicken wings, a cheese cal-zone, Zappolis ( dessert donuts), cannoli, antipasti salad, and spumoni gelato. This place is a little gem, small hole in the wall but with great food. If your in the mood for truly Italian food, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"It's a solid pizza place for Las Vegas. Pizza i picked up was pepperoni and mushrooms.
It's better than anything we have in my neighborhood at this time."}
{"text":"Saw the name and reviews and hoped it would be NYS, or close. It was just okay. Not bad, better than chain, but okay. I would order again."}
{"text":"I consider myself a pizza expert. I loved pizza as a child and even used to work at a pizzeria back in college. My favorite style pizza is a high quality New York style pizza so I was supper excited that a NY Pizzeria had opened up a few stores down from my favorite Dry Cleaners. 

The staff was awesome. The lady at the register was helpful when I explained it was my first time here and told her what I needed. A Hawaiian pizza (not on the menu, normally a good thing for me but the GF likes them) and a combo with extra cheese for me.

The crust was just above average. It was definitely thin crust yet wasn't chewy or crispy and had a great smoky flavor. Not sure how they accomplished that but I thought it saved my pie. Really the only redeeming quality was that the crust had that good smokey flavor.

The bad was the ingredients. The Hawaiian pizza had what seemed like a single piece of lunch meat ham sliced up and maybe 1.5 rings of pineapple spread across a large pizza. I know they did their best to make me a Hawaiian but it fell horribly short. My GF took a bite spit it out and said this is horrible. 

I didn't have that problem with my pie. It had plenty of toppings and good flavor. In fact the crust couldn't hold up to the weight of them all. My/our only complaint with this pie was that it was greasy. A little is OK and expected but a white paper towel really shouldn't come away brown and saturated with grease.

They sell pizza by the slice so I may stop in to grab one when I drop off my Dry Cleaning but other than that I will be going to another pizza joint for my pizza needs. 

Just remembered they sell bottle water and the label claims is drawn from the east river. It was hot and I was thirsty but if that was drawn from the east river I may just have to bring a large water jug the next time I visit NY so I could fill it up and bring it home."}
{"text":"This place serves the worst pizza I have eaten in my life, the pizza from Costco/Sam's club tastes better and costs much less.  I have visited hundreds of pizza joints both on the east and west coast and this place is hands down the worst pizza joint ever.  

I purchased a large pizza which costs around $20 and the pizza was cold and stale and the ingredients weren't fresh.  It's pretty obvious that it's been sitting there all day and the cook tried to throw some fresh green peppers on the pizza to fool customers into thinking it's a freshly baked pizza.  

My friend ordered a pasta and all the ingredients were from the can, the mushrooms, vegetables etc.  and pastas from olive garden tastes much better and cheaper too.  

If you want real italian food, go to Streets of New York.  Their Pizza and Pastas taste 1000x better than this place!"}
{"text":"I came here becase I ordered on Eat24, and accidentally posted my review there before I finished. My bad.  Long story short, if you cant find my review, I ordered xxhot chicken fingers and a meatball sub at 1940, and nothing is delivered until 2135, after a phone call at 2130, with an excuse that there were only 2 drivers. Cool. I understand that. The problem was that our food was not only delivered an hour later, but with blue cheese all over everything. Decent food, but over 2 hours after the order was placed, and all it was, was 5 xxhot chicken tenders and a meatball sub. I have an issue with CS. 10/10 WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN. They dont care about locals."}
{"text":"Grabbing some amazing NY style pizza! They always make me feel like I am home. Great lunch deals! Amazing people! Tasty meals! I am so happy here!

Cookies are to due for! Pie is scrumptious, desert is awesome! We frequent this location!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Rocco's!! After living in Vegas for 3 years (from NJ), I'm glad I found Rocco's NY Pizzeria. I must admit, there's tons of places in NY & NJ that make a wayy better slice, but for Vegas, this is the best. I hate that there's so many pizzarias in town that claim to be NY pizza (i.e. Joe's New York Pizza) and it's nothing like an east coast pizza at all. Rocco's is the only place I've been to out here that tastes anything like an east coast pizza and trust me, I know.. I've been eating pizza from North NJ and NYC for 23 years.  Anyways, my favorite from Rocco's is the white pizza and pepperoni with sausage. YUM.  I tried one of their sandwiches before but it wasn't that great. Normally places that have good pizza have bad everything else. So I just stick to the pizza when I go there. I also love that they have Wise chips there since they don't carry them in many Vegas grocery stores. They also have a little italian ice stand in the summer which is nice. Their italian ice is super yummy as well!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place.. it's super convenient and pretty fast.. I do wish they would deliver though!"}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE the Brooklyn!! Real Italian Sausage cooked to perfection and thinly sliced...not the imitation crumbles seen in most places!  The sausage pairs perfectly with an amazingly seasoned pepperoni to make one of the best pizzas I've ever had!  Everyone we've introduced to this place loves it.  Unfortunately, we moved from Las Vegas in May and now only get it when we come back to visit"}
{"text":"I ordered the combo: 2 cheese slices and a soda for $5, not a bad price and the slices are huge! The sauce & cheese was very good - the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because the crust wasn't crispy enough all the way through the slice to the end, towards the middle my pizza started falling apart and I hate that. But overall a very tasty pizza."}
{"text":"I stopped by Rocco's on my way home from school and I ordered a pepperoni and sausage to go. My passenger side seat was coated in a light layer of grease by the time I made the 5 min drive home.Uh oh. The bag was soaking in oil. Uh oh. Anyways, I proceeded to eat the pizza. Uh oh. I ate it, but it didn't sit too well in my tummy. I chased it with a coke to settle my stomach a bit but otherwise the pizza was decent. Very greasy, and I think it had been sitting out for a bit too long. And you might wanna ask the guy to leave your slice in there for a bit so it's nice and hot. It looked like a cool place to eat, but I think I'll be sticking to other pizza places."}
{"text":"update -- pizza order meatball pie.. very very good I also got the special drink espresso coffee soda -- know I am up for a while lol.. But anyways pizza was really good..."}
{"text":"The garlic knot sliders are to die for. And the Zepolis are amazing. Service is always  good at the take out desk. I would recommend for catering and family fun days and soccer parties."}
{"text":"5 years ago, this place was a favorite of my household and the business i work for. I rated it a 5 star and would recommend to everyone. Now, myself and my friends have had multiple terrible experiences with the online ordering and customer service. 

More than 6 months ago, my business did a lunch order. We ordered a bunch of cold sandwiches and they all came with meat and cheese. no veggies available to add online or condiments. When I drove all of the sandwiches back to the store to say \"ummm why did you not include anything on these 7 dollar sandwiches?\" They blamed the eat24 site. I told them there is no option to add veggies or condiments on their sandwiches. They said they can't alter their own menu on the website...which i find hard to believe. I'm sure the manager didn't mail their menu board the EAT24 headquarters for them into input. So i said fine, but make sure you guys get that fixed because it's going to piss a lot of people off if they get sandwiches like mine. Well, months have passed and they have not fixed any of the issues with their online ordering. 

My friend also ordered wings and in the notes section literally typed \"NO SAUSE NO SAUSE NO SAUSE!!!!\". When she went to pick them up, they had sauce. She said \"my notes clearly said no sauce\" and instead of just remaking the order of wings and that being the end of the issue, the employee just said \"well they are made, so there is nothing we can do\" Even admitting the mistake was their fault but still not willing to make it right. 

I understand having young people work your storefront can lead to bad service from time to time. but not fixing your web menu is costing you money. If you don't understand how to fix it, call or hire someone to do it. They have probably lost nearly $1000 dollars in sales annually just from my small circle of friends not wanting to deal with them anymore over the past year. I love their pizza and their sandwiches too."}

{"text":"Not really a good pizza not even close to ny's pizza. If they only named it roccos without the ny i wouldhave given them another two stars"}
{"text":"We were visitors to Summerlin. We ordered the Everything Pizza and Ceasar salad as take out.  The pizza lacked flavor and was extremely salty. There was a lack of toppings for claiming \"everything\".  The salad had to have been lunch leftovers. It was soggy and for $6.99 was lacking in quantity. We will not return.  It was huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! First time here and have to say I was impressed! It was crowded, but didn't wait long. The pizza was so good! Definitely the best pizza place I've had in Vegas so far. Check them out!"}
{"text":"I am so glad Rocco's moved into Village center...The pizza is excellent the dinners are great...the Sicilian pizza reminds me of the pizza I grew up on in Long Island. What can I say, you have to try Rocco's."}
