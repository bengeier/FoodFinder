{"text":"This is the best coffee I've had in Charlotte.  Daily Press is in a neighborhood with a few great places to grab coffee and this one is by far the best.  The craft of brewing coffee is the first priority here.  

The coffee menu is beautifully curated with a wide variety of  locally roasted beans.  The staff is incredibly knowledgeable about different techniques and flavors. 

The atmosphere is relaxed and sunny during the day making it a great place to hang out and relax."}
{"text":"Great space with light and art - big tables and couches for lounging or working. And the drinks are even better. I've never been disappointed by their concoctions - the basic coffee is great but the mixed coffee and tea drinks are amazing. I even ask for a decaf \"free style\" - today they made it with fresh local figs and oat milk. It is subtle but still really flavorful. I need to get here more often."}
{"text":"Super inventive caffeinated beverages! I ordered the pumpkin honey cappuccino with a spiced rim and my husband got an espresso and they served it with pomegranate seeds to bring out the flavor of the espresso. Both were delicious and the temperature was perfect. Coffee shop by day, music venue (evening muse) by night. So cool :)"}
{"text":"I recently went by the Daily Press for the first time. I heard good things and since I just moved to the hood I wanted to check it out. I'm glad that I did. I stopped while I was in the middle of a run. The barista welcomed me when I came in and was very friendly (especially considering I was really sweaty at the time.)

She got me a glass of water, then made one of the best lattes I've ever had. It was amazing, including some cool latte art. It hit the spot.

Atmosphere: It's in the same building as the Evening Muse, so you get a very cool vibe walking in. Not too crowded, unlike a lot of coffee houses. Cozy.

Overall, I give the Daily Press 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I had heard so many good things about The Daily Press! And boy, does it live up to it's name, and blows any other coffee shop out of the water! The location in NoDa is perfect and the vibe here is brilliant. The owner, Lindsey, is so friendly, down-to-earth and chatty. Her space in the Evening Muse is excellent and so easy to lose track of time here. 

The coffee was smooth and the milk velvet-like in mouth feel. The Winter Menu is so eccentric and mystical, the Cobbler's Cup, was so different and tasty- I can't describe it in enough words. The presentation of all the drinks is eye-catching. This place has that certain \"Je Ne Sais Quoi\" about it. The Daily Press is the best coffee shop I've been to and I will definitely give them all my money!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere on the inside is not what one would hope for a coffee shop. It's essentially a bar / music venue that they set up folding tables and chairs to use as a coffee shop during the day. Coffee was good but overall experience is not one I would seek out again."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the neighborhood! The atmosphere is nice and intimate, a perfect spot for you and a friend or small group. My boyfriend and I frequent the shop and I always prefer to stay and enjoy my drink instead of taking it to go. He typically goes for the pour overs and thinks they all have great flavors. I typically go for a latte or something off the seasonal list that consists of their house speciality drinks (no to-go option for these). I'm excited to see what's in store for the upcoming season! Everything I've had is great! The baristas are all so friendly and put so much care into each drink. You might have to wait a few minutes for your drink but it's totally worth it! 

If you're hungry, they always have some bakery items from Whisk and Wood (muffins, scones, etc.) or there could be pop up shop from Joe's Doughs on Saturday mornings. 

Check out their Instagram! They always have updates for what's going on!"}
{"text":"Great place, friendly and creative people, really cool drinking and snacking options."}
{"text":"We ALWAYS hit up the Daily Press when we come to Charlotte. Lindsey is very knowledgable and passionate about bringing great coffee and tea to the Queen City."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, amazing service, and the baristas are babes! Come by and give it a try."}
{"text":"Quality coffee and cool atmosphere. Baristas are knowledgable, without being pretentious. This is the kind of place that defines what NoDa should be."}
{"text":"Lindsey is, hands down, the best barista in Charlotte!! You will not find a finer coffee or tea anywhere in this town. Expect a wait when you order, because quality takes time!! You can also always count on seeing a smile, as they make you feel at home at this quaint little spot. The Daily Press is a true hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"Up until a few months ago, I thought I've tasted coffee in the best ways possible. But to my surprise, The Daily Press makes coffee in even more unique ways than I've ever witnessed. Lindsey and her brew crew are experts at what they do here inside the shop. The attention to detail is clear in every single item on their menus.

What sets them apart from the rest of the Charlotte community is that they take specialties to an entirely new realm that I'm now surprised to never have thought of before. Drinks infused with bitters, house-made sweeteners in a plethora of flavors, sugar-rimmed glasses - shaken, not stirred. Lindsey is a master of tastes and flavor combinations that I would have never been willing to taste myself. Sweet potato? In coffee? Citrus and lavender? Hibiscus earl grey latte...? They all sound so crazy but they all taste so - SO - good. And it doesn't even end there. These specialty drinks are made to be enjoyed in the atmosphere of the cafe. Pomegranate arils, pie crust cookies, wobbly stemless glasses - details that most other shops wouldn't dare even have in their vicinity. All that to enjoy while you sit and observe and interact with the diverse neighborhood of NoDa and take in all the sights and sounds.

The Daily Press and the people who comprise it, the regulars, and the passerbys all make the place an extremely unique venture, and a very welcome addition to the Charlotte food community. I look forward to the seasons they prepare their specialty menus for, and hope they create a menu of their legendary seasonal menu items (I already miss the citrus lavender so much). If you haven't had the chance to stop by, do so immediately. They'll take great care of you."}
{"text":"We came here Sunday afternoon for a cup of coffee on a rainy day!

There is a decent amount of seats and cute atmosphere!

I ordered the brandied black walnut latte and my husband got the pistachio agave latte. The brandied latte was delish with a cute presentation. However, I thought the pistachio agave latte was the winner for the day. Super creamy and that pistachio flavor was spot on! Excellent drinks....we cant wait to return!"}
{"text":"It's an adorable shared space coffee bar.. it is also Salud's upstairs lounge with a small music stage and lots of beers on tap. I enjoy the atmosphere especially looking out the windows from the comfy couch covered in decorative pillows and the live plants hanging under the skylight. I really enjoyed the matcha latte made with OAK MILK... the barista let me sample this oat milk before I committed and it essentially is just a creamier, full bodied version of soy milk. I really look forward to bringing my friends back to hang out and my relax with my husband. Hopefully there will be a new artist playing on the stage the next time we drop in."}
{"text":"Trade and Lore has great coffee and the service was very friendly! Definitely stop by and check it out! The space is beautiful and they usually have live music which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Seriously such a cool place with an awesome atmosphere and delicious beverages! I was recommended to try the butterbeer latte and it was FREAKING delicious. They certainly know their stuff here at the Daily Press CLT and you will not regret stopping by! Ask for suggestions as they are more than willing to help you out. They know their coffee! Seriously! :)"}
{"text":"Best coffee in Charlotte. Amazing staff, cool vibe, and great place to hang out during the day. Will continue to visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee. Weird, though, that a place called \"The Daily Press\" is not open daily.  Still, easily the best coffee in town."}
{"text":"Trade And Lore is one of my favorite spots where I can post up for an afternoon. They have high-end coffee options and knowledgeable baristas who will walk you through their slightly quirky menu. They always have a few pastry options from local bakers for sale, and they have beer on tap as well. 

The space is spacious, with lots of large, communal tables, as well as a cluster of comfy chairs. There are a few game options and there's also a stage where bands will perform sometimes. 

It's a very relaxing, chill atmosphere with beautiful decoration. I recommend it to anyone who likes good coffee and a good vibe!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere. Good music choices and eclectic drip coffees served out of mason jars. Solid place to get work done and still feel like you're doing something sick! Wifi free, which is always nice. Not a place to memorize flash cards, but good for light reading or sending emails!"}
{"text":"Hats down the best coffee and matcha latte in Charlotte!  Most better than that, is the cozy nook it provides with charcoal walls starry lights comic arts and a window just the right size for a glance into the rainy world out there."}
{"text":"Such a lovely coffee/beer/sandwich shop in Noda. I really love the open, airy set up. Long wooden tables and booths for work productivity plus a couch and lounge area. There are even some games to play. Perfect hang out spot! There is a bar to sit at for coffee and or alcohol and the baristas are very nice. The wifi was a little funky when I was there but the barista was kind to give me a different network to try. Will have to try the food next time, loved the atmosphere and location (above salud)."}
{"text":"With so much local coffee shop competition, I must say this shop belongs amongst the best Charlotte has to offer. 

Very knowledgeable, friendly staff. The coffee is just to die for, very tasty, the latte had a fruity taste to it which sounds odd, but tastes amazing. The Morning Woodward was also amazing and a genius  combination of flavors and tastes, with an after taste that leaves you wanting more. 

I have nothing negative to say about this shop, I've been 3 times and love each drink more than the other. 
With great local shops like 'Not Just Coffee' 'Central Coffee' and 'Smelly Cat' this shop belongs amongst them for sure, so happy to see yet another great Coffee Shop here in the Queen city."}
{"text":"You know that yelp is a useful website, when it makes you aware of a place that just opened down the street before you even realize it. I will say that the Daily Press is subtly marketing itself and you could easily walk by the Evening Muse without even noticing it.

That being said, the wife and I have been there a handful of times now to try an array of coffee drinks that have been creatively thought out and crafted. From cold brew coffee to a \"butterbeer\" latte, to exotic beans used for pour over coffees, we have tried a good variety of drinks. It's basically open during the day when the Evening Muse is on downtime. They also have a produce framers market on Saturday morning that we will have to check out sometime. The drinks are all expertly crafted, which means other than the cold brew, most drinks take some time to make. Especially if they are busy, be prepared to wait a little for your drink. 

With the relaxed environment and the location, which allows you to observe the corner of 36th street and North Davidson street, there should be no rush. Enjoy your time there and chill out. We can all stand to stop and smell the roses, and the coffee of course."}
{"text":"I've been checking out a new coffee shop almost every Sunday to sit and write. I came to Trade and Lore because I had already visited Smelly Cat and I do love the NoDa neighborhood.

I came in soon after they opened so seating was a plenty. The barista helped me order a drink based on what I was in the mood for. I opted for the hop scotch latte. I was wonderful and the design with the foam, impressive, as it stayed in tack the entire time I sipped it.

I would definitely come back as there was plenty of space to sit and write, even once it became a little more busy."}
{"text":"A great place to hang out, chill, and have a nice cup of coffee. Would definitely go back. It was 4 versus 5 stars because I prefer my coffee a little darker than the one I got, but the coffee still had a great flavor."}
{"text":"I loved this coffee shop. The space is so chill and well thought out with tons of different seating spots. Bar seating, couches, benches and tables. It's really well rounded. Plus they serve coffee, beer, and wine. 

I think the best part was the amazing barista. I can't recall her name but she had blue in her hair. She was SO Great! I knew I wanted coffee but not sure what exactly. She helped me pick and iced American with pistachio and rose water Syrup. IT WAS AMAZING. 

She also helped my fiancé decided. He really has no idea what to get and she asked cold or hot ? Coffee or not? Light or heavy? It was literally exactly what you need when you can't decide what to get. He ended up with an espresso and soda water drink that he loved! 

I really wish I lived in the area still because I would be here almost everyday. It's so great and there's so many choices. You must go try it!"}
{"text":"They have passion for all things coffee here. The reason I like coming here is because you can see and taste that. 
If someone didn't like coffee, I would bring them here. It might change their mind.
As for my recommendation, the macchiato... Or the iced coffee."}
{"text":"I love it! Great vibes, great coffee! This is more of a meet up with a friend coffee place than a work alone coffee place. Great selection, lots of natural light, and a rock 'n roll vibe."}
{"text":"Trade and Lore is a hidden gem! Like really... an actual hidden gem. The front door opens to a staircase you take to the second floor, where you are welcomed with a homey open space and groovy vibes. 

I had no idea what to order so I asked the dude what he recommends and he was hyping up the drinks and asked me what I preferred. Super nice guy, I wish I knew his name to give him a shoutout, but all I can remember is he was wearing a shirt with cacti on it. I chose his personal favorite, Pistachio and Rosewater Latte. I got it hot, but I tried it cold too and I actually like it cold better. The nodes are a little bit stronger when it's cold. The latte art is pretty on point compared to other coffee shops!

There's plenty of space for collabs and study sessions for anyone who needs it. It's clean and totally hipster, aka my dream coffee shop."}
{"text":"So good! Great coffee drinks, friendly people, and amazing vibe. Had the spiced butterbeer cappuccino (so good and intriguingly different). They even serve beer on tap and by the bottle. The vibe is homey, trendy, artsy, and gritty (in the best way--and I would consider myself a yuppie so that says a lot). And, there's an exposed-brick music stage in the back. Loved this place. A gem!  

New to Charlotte and NoDa may be the closest thing to the cool neighborhoods of Chicago, NYC, etc."}
{"text":"I came here for some espresso and a place to relax on my day off. Great atmosphere, open space that is welcoming and gives you options to sit at a table, with friends or by yourself, or relax on one of the comfy chairs and couches. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that it took a long time for my drink to be made. I got a plain latte and the barista said it was made incorrectly the first time so she had to re-do it. It took a long time even though there were only maybe 6 people there on that Tuesday morning. Once I got my drink it was delicious. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"My husband asked for a coffee date and we ended up here.  Amazing coffee!  I had the Lavender Iced Coffee and a vanilla cardamom donut. Love the farmer's market and the local vibe. Highly recommend this for the great coffee and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great space to do work and get some coffee. Friendly baristas, great coffee, total win."}
{"text":"By no means am I a coffee buff, but they whipped up the best vanilla latte I've ever had. The great thing, too, is that they're really consistent, even with the fancier drinks that they might make less often.

Don't be afraid to try the tea! They are doing a bang up job of helping the elusive tea drinker out there and converting some skeptics.

It's usually pretty quiet inside, never had trouble finding a place to sit. A nice place to focus if you're working on something. Wish they were open past 5pm, but the coffee shop operates out of a music venue. Plus side? There's beer.

Keep an eye out for events. Sometimes they offer classes or host get-togethers for local groups."}
{"text":"The Daily Press is located inside of The Evening Muse in NODA. Went there today around 10:15 and ordered two brandied black walnut lattes. It does take a while to get your drinks since its a small operation and they take the time to handcraft your drink so be prepared to wait especially during high volume times. The lattes were delicious, not bitter at all and the small cookie that comes with the latte was my favorite part. The black walnut latte cannot be ordered to go so plan accordingly. Saturdays are the best time to go because you can get a donut from Joe's Doughs!"}
{"text":"Came here to do work on a random Wed afternoon. Awesome chill, calming vibe. Seats at the coffee bar, couches, or tables for all y'all \"productive\" people (like me)

1. Coffee - it's good. One of those places with different roasts that could get described like different wines. Not sure if they offer different types of milk, i.e., dairy alternatives
2. Room to work with nice big tables. I can see it getting cramped if it's busy but I love that the tables are large enough to put your laptop, phone, a notebook, and pen on, without awkwardly doing t-rex arms or constantly catching things from falling off
3. Dark wood and ceiling plants and background music ++++ (see photo!)"}
{"text":"I started off with a cheddar scone.... it was absolutely delicious. By the time my latte came it was completely devoured, that's how good. The latte I ordered was the HopScotch which let me tell was out of this world! So rich and smooth! Absolutely heavenly! Highly recommended! Great service and beautiful atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try out this new little coffee spot, had been hearing good things about it since it opened. I tried the pumpkin, honey cappuccino which was delicious. It is inside the Evening Muse which is already a pretty awesome spot and while we were there they had folks set up selling donuts and a few other goodies. Def. worth stopping by if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Came back and my experience was much better. 

Got the hop scotch latte with oat milk and I loved it, though I'm still wondering how I can get these cool drinks I see on the T&L instagram. 

Barista was friendly and quick despite crowd around bar - in great contrast to my last visit, with a slow, unfriendly barista despite an empty room.

Only complaints are unreliable WiFi and the shop started to get cold as I stayed. 

Will be back though."}
{"text":"Had the bourbon honey iced coffee and it was probably the best specialty coffee drink I've ever had. Drinks are so creative and I love seeing what's on each new menu. Also, they host a NoDa Farmer's market on Saturdays!"}
{"text":"Lindsey knows her shit--most inventive display of beverages. This barista has style and presents it well through her craft, and her staff is awesome, too. Keep up with the seasonal specials; they will blow your mind."}
{"text":"The Daily Press is the perfect place to grab a cup of Joe and have an experience in the process.  It uses the same space as the Evening Muse in the heart of NoDa, which makes for an eclectic setting.  They also host different pop up shops (Joe's Doughs) which is another bonus!  

The drinks are unique and artfully created so they take some time.  Don't plan on being in a rush!  It's worth hanging out and waiting.  You'll find all kinds of standard coffee house beverages as well as a host of things you've never seen before.  Given that it shares space with the Muse which offers a full bar, they also have some hair of the dog type coffee drinks which are pretty magical.  I think they have some food too, but frankly I haven't even bothered to pay attention to that because the drinks alone are enough to satisfy me.  

If you've been into NoDa (especially in the past couple of years) you probably know about the less-than-ideal parking situation around the 'hood, so finding a spot for you car can be tricky.  It's worth the hassle!"}
{"text":"Am I the only person who does not want to drink coffee or tea out of a mason jar?  Also, it is a coffee shop......in a bar.......and they would not serve me a glass of wine before noon (and it was NOT Sunday)."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the local coffee spots but for some reason, this place has not been up to par upon my last two visits. I wasn't greeted properly upon entrance to this place, nor was the service quick or friendly by any means. I've tried this place on a slow tues morning as well as on a busy Sunday morning. I  really do want to like this place as I'm a newbie, but I don't see myself visiting here anytime soon."}
{"text":"The coffee is quality here but the old location seemed to offer more creative flavors.  Maybe it was a bad day to go but I went on a Saturday morning a few weeks back while they were recording a radio or tv show.  I really liked the upstairs location and the large tables but thought it was more reminiscent of a micro brewery than a true coffee shop feel.  also a little pricier than most coffee spots by a buck or two but nothing too crazy.  I miss the vibe and innovative espresso drinks (butter beer Cappuccino, Dutch Mocha, etc.) offered at the old location but I'm willing to give this location another shot in the future."}
{"text":"I came here today for the first time (thanks Cloosiv app for my free coffee) and I'm in love with the setting. It's huge. I want one of these tables in my house!  
My iced vanilla latte was pretty good. Gotta appreciate that they use grass fed milk! Can't get any better!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty rad! I love the fact that it's located upstairs, right when you open the door there's a staircase that leads you upstairs to the coffee place. Inside they have tables where you could eat/drink your coffee or a \"lounge area\" with comfy chairs and pillows for you to sit and enjoy your coffee. The barista recommended the pistachio and rosewater latte- OK THE LATTE ART HERE IS ON POINT! The drink was also pretty good! I definitely recommend it as well. Overall I really enjoyed the vibes of this place. We were literally there for an hour taking coffee shots lol! (:"}
{"text":"I ordered a chai tea latte but it ended up being 90% milk with no chai tea flavors. I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere!  Coffee and service was smokin hot!  Ordered a latte.  Sampled the coffee on tap and it was good also.  Highly recommend for hanging out or if you just want a great cup of coffee."}
{"text":"First off the mini disclaimer, this is a very artsy place so if you are not comfortable with the artsy vibe you are not going to be comfortable here.  That being said, I cannot say enough positive things about the daily press.  The staff is very helpful in explaining and making some of their craft coffee beverages (some get quite intricate).  Then there is the beverages themselves and they are amazing.  I have yet to try one that I have not loved!  My to favorites so far have been the peachy Canadian (an espresso soda with peaches, maple syrup, and cucumber) and their spiced Butterbeer cappuccino.  I will definitely plan to repeat here in the future, it is especially great on breaks during the work day to get that extra boast."}
{"text":"Trade & Lore's coffee is literally the best small coffee shop coffee I've ever had. I'm so happy to discover the Charlotte location. I originally discovered Trade & Lore in Asheville when o was on vacation. Also, the work space is so cool and there is a beer shop right underneath!"}
{"text":"Great spot for always unique coffee (and more traditional options too).  On Sunday they had locals there selling their jewelry, knitting, etc.  I got a delicious chai latte. During the summer when they have a farmers market on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Their foam was Ah-May-Zing. Once I got past that, the rest of my latte fell flat and was weirdly not creamy tasting at all. A solid latte, but from friends' hype, I was expecting magnificence/my new favorite/best in Charlotte and it's not up to \"Not Just Coffee\" snuff, though it is more conveniently located. I'll still stop by and try some more things. I can't ingest enough sugar at once to be able to try some of their fascinating-sounding syrups, but The Morning Woodward looks like it might be a unique winner nonetheless."}
{"text":"The best coffee house in Charlotte. Lindsey is amazing! The specialty drinks are out of this world! I love being in The Evening Muse during the day. Great music, fantastic coffee; really lets call it my new office!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood and housing the Salud Cerveceria beers...before they run out.  Keep it up! Great vibe and drinks!"}
{"text":"Love the cool decorations and plants, but this is NOT a good place to get any work done. Because it's such a large space, the acoustics are crazy and there were a TON of people (and a screaming baby - seriously, take your child away), so it was very noisy. Wifi was spotty. 

Special 12 oz. latte was six dollars (!) and lukewarm when I received it. 

I would only come again if I were hanging with a friend and get a different, cheaper coffee. Maybe go early to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"Such a great addition to NoDa! Recently rode my bike on a random Thursday morning to check out the new coffee spot. What I love most is the open space and ample seating. Trade and Lore offers a variety of seating options from numerous high-top chairs at the bar to cozy couch corners next to the window. It's a great option for several people in a party, a one-on-one convo, or even individual coffee time. I thought the price for a latte was a bit high, but that's also because I usually order a $2 Americano. Super fun vibe overall! I'm excited to bring friends back to check it out."}
{"text":"I've been here once so far but enjoyed my experience.  The line on a Saturday morning was out the door- good sign.
The fancy coffees that my wife ordered were great. It took a while to get the coffee after placing the order but they place a lot of effort in making the coffee great. If take a little less great taste for faster turnaround time.
Because it's fancy, there seems to be a premium on the amount that you get. Seems pricey for coffee but it is good.
I can't justify going often but if want something out of the ordinary will return."}
{"text":"It's kind of like a Room of Requirement, right in my neighborhood; this place just always seems to fit the bill. I've had many work-remote days here, where I perch at one of the high tables at 8am and enjoy the ambient background noise all day, and I've had later afternoons here with friends, sipping slightly boozier beverages...every time, it's been a great time. 

The workers here are insanely friendly, the drinks are delicious, and the atmosphere is gorgeous. I almost held back on a full five stars because it's pricey and occasionally I've looked at my drink and scolded myself for dropping $6 on a coffee. Then I remembered all of the free wifi and air-conditioning that I've used here.

In a neighborhood that's full of fun corners and cool spots, this is near the top. There's nowhere I'd rather chill with a laptop for a few hours."}
{"text":"Trade and Lore is one of the best coffee shops in Charlotte and one one of the prettiest too. Their staff is very knowledgeable about their menu (and coffee in general) and everything I've had there has tasted delicious. My favorite drink was a surprise one they made just for me. It was an orange blossom chamomile matcha latte made with oat milk. So unique. Exquisite taste. Their drinks are definitely on the more expensive side... Expect to pay $6 for a latte. Totally worth it in my opinion though!"}
{"text":"Awesome use of space during the morning while evening muse isn't in use. Good atmosphere, good coffee. Only cons: parking is always a struggle, and on a Friday morning there was only 2 people working so to get a latte took about 10 mins. So it's not exactly a place easy to run in and out for a quick cup of coffee, but if you got a minute to stop and enjoy a cup, this is definitely the place to do it."}
{"text":"This place is a new favorite for me. I'm generally a black coffee only kind of person but when I go here I find myself wanting to branch out more. I've had several of their different coffee varieties, all delicious! The baristas are super nice as well just adding to a great atmosphere. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were super excited to go to Trade and Lore. However our experience has been rather a let down. The customer service was severely lacking this morning. We felt like aliens asking questions about the menu. Baristas just stared at us and made us feel rather dumb. Since this was our first time we had no clue what was offered etc. That said, the coffee honestly was nothing spectacular especially for the price and no refills. The space itself was awesome! Thus the 3 Stars."}
{"text":"Love this place! It is a perfect place to grab a cup of coffee, especially fancy coffee. It is all a work of art. The coffee is phenomenal and I especially love their seasonal drinks (which can get slightly pricy). The baristas are very nice and make you feel \"at home\". 

As far as ambiance goes, it's an artsy environment so if you do not feel comfortable with that then this may not be the best place for you, but I love it!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to all the hype! Nestled inside the Evening Muse (@ the corner of the road), the daily press is the place to be. 

Here's why! They have a great selection of espressos and tea. I got the spiced butterbeer cappuccino. I've had different versions of butterbeer before, and this one was definitely different, but in a good way. They really add flavor to your drink, so expect a kick in whatever you get. Not only is the flavor there, but their presentation makes the experience that much better. I also had a sip of a latte with pistachio flavor. It tasted like pistachio and it's something I'll probably get next time.

Workers were friendly and music fit the tone of the establishment. I'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"I popped in quickly only to check the place out...my review is based on the environment only.  I hope to go back soon for a coffee.  The space is awesome.  I love the second floor and the journey upstairs.  The décor is great.  It feels comfortable and secure.  It seems like a good place to hang out and talk over a nice latte or whatever.

I will update after trying some menu items.  I can't wait!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this spot to us and it didn't disappoint. I love the entire vibe of the place. From the cute lounge areas to all of the fresh flowers/plants to the artwork on the wall - I loved it all. We enjoyed our drinks and I especially loved that they carry oat milk. They had good beer selection but we stuck with coffee. The service we received was amazing! 

Overall, this is a great spot!"}
{"text":"A quirky upstairs loft full of fun seating and delicious drinks! I ordered the nitro coffee and it was served in a beautiful glass and tasted great, no sugar or cream needed. Hot coffee, wine, and beer were also offered. There's a tv behind the bar showing the game and friendly and helpful staff. The decor and atmosphere is really cool, industrial, and fun. Awesome art on the walls. There's a live music stage and foozball table along with some board and card games. Definitely the place to be for a nice drink if it's too hot or too cold outside."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely adorable in terms of authenticity of experience and the decor. Almost like a throwback to your teenage years hanging out in the attic of your friends garage in terms of coziness. The barista was great pretty much super friendly and informative about the coffee. The coffee is on the pricer side, ordered a lavender latte which was to die for and worth the money. However, if you are on a budget a $5-$6 latte might be out of the question. I will definitely be back for more study session and maybe even a post work beer. Love the concept of sharing space for different business that serve community needs at different times, so eco friendly!"}
{"text":"They love coffee more than anyone and it shows. Beautiful, handcrafted drinks with a smile. They even have locally baked goods, which are also delicious. It is a genius use of the space, which is a concert venue by night."}
{"text":"Truly a work of art, who knew coffee could be so beautiful. We perched ourselves by the front window seat with pumpkin spice latte and beer butter cappuccino. I've been in some pretty pretentious coffee houses and thank goodness Daily Press was nothing like them. The staff was extremely helpful in making the best coffee choice and you could tell they take pride in every drink they make. 

This seems like a cool place to hangout and have a cup of Joe or one of their many choices of local beer on tap. I love that coffee places are bridge the gap between craft coffee and craft beer. Makes total sense to me that you would merge the two."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to stop by here for awhile...and I'm so glad that I finally found the time!

Awesome vibes with a dainty decor. I don't even have to put my headphones in to do work....the music is on point (a mix of indie rock). Great customer service too!

The best part is the coffee though! The pour overs are amazing and they have a great variety. I also had the Dutch chocolate latte. The chocolate was subtle but rich so in my opinion it was the perfect latte. 

This is officially my new favorite coffee shop in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Had been wanting To check this place out for a while and finally did. I'd been to the Evening Muse at night before, but it was even better as the Daily Press (as in there was a place to sit haha).

Worked there during the week and got a really good (and pretty) latte, a quiet sunny window and free wifi. Can't beat it.

I want to try a signature drink when I go back!"}
{"text":"I could not be a bigger fan. This was my first visit and the barista, Carissa, was incredibly helpful. She offered suggestions and answered any questions I had when deliberating what to get. I went with the Figure 1, substituting the coffee for tea and served with a shot of espresso. It was amazing. I actually ended up getting a drink to go as well--coffee soda with fig syrup, so great. 

The atmosphere is great. I loved the plants and the lighting, it was so inviting and beautiful. I could have stayed there all day. Absolutely fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"New location above Salud! A hidden gem I would say. Lots of large booths, a shuffle board table, a gallery, a performance stage, and a coffee bar all rolled into one. They have coffee drinks and beers on tap. My iced latte was $5 and huge. It came in the same glass as a beer would with light ice. I would come back here to work or just to sit and enjoy a coffee in their light filled space. Funky music choices but that's NoDa for ya."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop in NODA. I've been here every day since they've opened. There's always something new, creative, and quality."}
