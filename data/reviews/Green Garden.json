{"text":"Green Garden is not, by any means, the pinnacle of Chinese food. It is, however, a suitable meal for reasonable prices.  The staff is very friendly and casual. After so many years of eating there, they know my family and it is nice to remembered after having spent so much money there.  Our regular dishes of fried dumplings, chicken and broccoli, etc. are all well done standards of Chinese takeout. It may not be spectacular but it gets the job done.  When push comes to shove, Green Garden is an acceptable restaurant with great service. I will always be a regular (save something horrendous happens with one of our meals, but is hasn't happened yet)."}
{"text":"Not the best I've had....but better than most in the area for the price. Dumplings were huge! Rice is good and breading on chicken was crispy!...something that seems to elude most cheap/fast Chinese places in Greentree/Scott/Mt Lebanon. Good egg rolls. Hard to beat for the price.  I'll be back to order the massive dumplings again and again.  On second thought, the best I've had in the month living in Pittsburgh.  Will try others, but to date stands above the rest"}
{"text":"My husband and I order from green garden atleast twice a month and LOVE it. It's so easy to order online and delivery is freaky fast! The staff is always so friendly and the food is great.  You get a lot of food for your money as well. I would definitely recommend Green Garden!"}
{"text":"I just got delivery from here. I got steamed dumplings and the lunch special lo mein that came with a side of fried rice and wonton soup. I saw a lot of reviews on how good the dumplings were. I wasn't impressed. The \"noodle\" part was really thick. I only took 1 bite and didn't want anymore . The wonton soup I have to say though was very good . The chicken lo mein and fried rice were okay. Nothing special . The price was fair and the delivery driver was nice. I probably won't order here again though."}
{"text":"Hate to give a middling review, but when I ordered from here I felt like the food was all over the place.  I've had much better \"fast food\" style Chinese food in more rural areas, so I felt disappointed by the lackluster performance of the meal.  The Good: The fried dumplings were amazing and while the wonton soup was strangely missing its green onions, it was still tasty. Actually, I'm thinking of always having my dumplings fried from now on like potstickers, because it really made my night.  The Bad: I ordered the classic General Tso's to get a good range of what they offered and Moo Goo Gai Pan, which is chicken and veggies in a white sauce (one of my favorite Chinese dishes). The food was...just ok. The General Tso's sauce was a bit too red in color but it was crispy like it should be and it tasted fine. The white sauce dish was sort of...off. I can't even explain it, but a couple of bites in I started hating the taste. The veggies were cooked well, but the chicken wasn't of a very high quality and my taste buds got turned off by the whole dish. These are classic dishes and if you can't get them right that worries me. My meal started going downhill around there.  The Ugly: I ordered both fried and steamed rice (again to get a good sampling), and the fried rice was bad. It was too brown, not really fried (just limp), and very sparse with a few carrots and peas and no scrambled egg bits (not de rigueur for delivery Chinese but I do love when fried rice has that in it). I'm not sure what happened - did they use new rice, or wet rice, or cooked it too long? Whatever it was, it was horrible. I might try to refry it tomorrow, but if it is still bad I'll probably just have to pitch it.   The price for all of this was about the same for what I've paid for Chinese meals at restaurants and delivery places that I consider to be a little more \"upscale.\" So I didn't think I was saving any money, and I was getting less quality for my troubles. There are several Asian places in the area that make great food, so I don't feel like I need to limit myself to this one."}
{"text":"Horrible food. It's hard to get a good Chinese restaurant around Pittsburgh. I wouldn't recommend to my dog"}
{"text":"Ordered General Tso's shrimp, Kung Pao chicken, soup and egg rolls. Price was slightly higher and portions maybe slightly smaller than similar stores, but food quality was certainly in line with food of this type.     The only notable ding I would give is the spicing. Both of our dishes are supposed to have a bit of spice flavor, and they are noted on the menu as spicy dishes, but there was a notable absence of spice.  There weren't even chilis in the Kung Pao sauce.  It's like someone forgot to spice the dishses."}
{"text":"I was leery to try this place because of the bad reviews but I've eaten here multiple times and have had nothing but tasty meals. They have also always delivered quickly. The menu isn't very inventive but for your standard favorites this is a great spot."}
{"text":"WARNING FOR VEGETARIANS:   the vegetable lo mein - and apparently all their vegetable dishes except those cooked with white sauce - are made with chicken broth. Wish I knew that before I ordered. Why offer vegetarian options if you're cooking them with meat? If you're gonna do that, just write it on the menu. (I found out by asking, since I heard that many Chinese restaurants do the same.)  Sesame Inn at least claims that their vegetable lo mein sauce isn't cooked with any meat broth. Plus, they told me they offer pan fried noodles! (Green Garden doesn't.)"}
{"text":"This place gets a lot of grief on here.  While it is not the best Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh, or even in Mt. Lebanon, it's a decent take out dinner for $10-$12 in under 10 minutes.  For that it is good.  The family that runs it has always been friendly and nice.   From the counter you can see the kitchen and it always looks clean.  If you want outstanding Chinese go to Sesame Inn but you'll pay twice as much and wait twice as long.  If you want a quick dinner, made to order, that's inexpensive and supports the local economy, eat here."}
{"text":"Yeah, don't order from here, unless it's for dumplings. since they arev fast and the potstickers are really good. Everything else we had sucked. Shrimp and Scallop with garlic was bland as hell. The Beef on a Stick was liked eating a marinated shoe with a skewer in it. Yuk."}
{"text":"Went in and picked up Chinese food and I was in a mood for it once .I picked it up I noticed that there was no green onion in the won ton soup .how could you not have green onions ,that's what gives it flavor. fried noodles were okay. let's be honest if you never tried fried noodles, you won't know. fried noodles and duck sauce ok. white rice you can't really screwed up . where's the fortune cookie man no fortune cookie how could you serve Chinese food without fortune cookie."}
{"text":"So disgusting! Ordered \"moo shu\" (in quotes because it does not taste like any moo shu I have ever had before). Came with egg roll wrapper as pancake and thick nasty hoisin sauce on filling. Never eating there again. (Also, no customer service when I called to complain.)"}
{"text":"I remember wanting to come to Green Garden for lunch one day last summer only to find out that takeout and delivery were their only options at the time. The other night, Kay didn't feel like cooking again, and luckily, GG delivered to Beechview.   I'll credit them for a speedy delivery. The food came in less time than the operator stated.   The story of the meal lies in the octet of gigantic and graciously filling fried dumplings. How the cooks wrap these pot stickers around so much ground pork remains a mystery, but their delightfully doughy composition and deep gusto is unquestionable. If I'd only had the dumplings, GG would easily garner a grade of 4 from me.   I did not sample Kay's Shrimp and Scallop with Garlic Sauce, but the Happy Family was as dysfunctional as the Bluth clan...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7oBAnEmklk  The advertised lobster was non-existent,  the crab was merely flavorless,dyed whitefish, the chicken was dry, and the roast pork was scant as were the scallops. The veggies were in abundance, however, and the fat prawns popped in my mouth. So yeah, this gathering was a little awkward.   The Beef-On-A Stick could have been a joy...if it was properly tender. I hadn't gnawed on meat this tough in years! I almost spit it out since my jaws were sore from chewing it and had half a mind to de-skewer the other slab and feed it to the dogs! It's a shame since the meat itself was marinated beautifully and pungently in what I assume was soy sauce, but the marinade failed to break down the meat.   This Garden is browned-out rather than Green.  I won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Well, finally tried the place with the Green door and High Step!  Always seem to be people going in and out.  Heard from one of my kids it was just OK, cause he had take out once with some buddies.  Well, we ventured in and ordered a few things so we could share.  General Ts0's chicken was  to be crisp and Ouch spicy...Well, the outer crust was crisp, chicken was hard..hard to chew, tasteless and somewhat sweet sauce???  The Shrimp Lo Mein was Ok but the shrimp was overcooked.  The Moo Shu Pork was forgettable."}
{"text":"The delivery guy had a nice smile and was friendly. The crab rangoon were different - triangles instead of folded and the filling had some substance - not just cream cheese. That's the extent of the good things I have to say about our order.   Two of us from the office ordered and neither of us could eat our food. The rice was awful. How do you screw up rice? The meats in our food were extremely fatty and so gross we couldn't eat them. The hot and sour soup was the usual gelatinous broth, but without color and completely unappetizing.   I will never order again. It could be $1 and I wouldn't order."}
{"text":"We always order from them via GrubHub, about once or twice a month, and I've never had a problem with them. The only thing is that they always take 45min-1hour to deliver to us, even though we're only a ten minute or so drive from the location. No matter what time of day it's the same rate. The food has always been warm and good though, and the drivers are always nice, so I just plan in advance for their slow delivery times."}
