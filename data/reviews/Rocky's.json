{"text":"I love this place. The hours are onlu saturdays and sundays, what's the perfect brunch time. It's like walking into a diner from the 50s. Super nice staff, food is tasty and really not expensive. Anytime again."}
{"text":"This place was awful. I ordered the breakfast special: the pancakes tasted like the batter had gone off and the water tasted like dishsoap. I was really hoping for a hidden treasure hole in the wall place, but boy was i wrong. Go somewhere else for your breakfast."}
{"text":"I had hoped this would be a diamond in the rough but I was thoroughly wrong. This was one of the worst restaurant experiences. The service was bad: the only server spent our entire time there sitting at a table talking on her cell phone with only short breaks to get us food. The food was inedible: the coffee was watered down, the water tasted of dishsoap, and the food tasted like it had been going bad. We didn't eat more then a bite of the food, just payed and left."}
{"text":"Rocky's breakfast food is exactly what you would cook yourself. For $5 this Saturday have someone else make you eggs, bacon, toast, home fries and coffee.  Feel like you're in your grandma's living room. Really, try it."}
{"text":"Breakfast is good but the service is a little lacking in the friendly area. Server and cook were both iffy with their attitudes.. it almost seemed as if neither wanted to be there."}
{"text":"Rocky's is a cool little place on Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield.  Not many tables, though.  Food is good, prices are cheap.  Most of the breakfast specials include the cost of your drink in the price.  So my breakfast, a tasty bagel sandwich with egg, bacon and cheese was $5.34.  And that included both home fries and my coffee.  The cook was our waiter but my cup was never empty.  I'll return for more."}
{"text":"Tucked away in an unexpected place is a great bar with great prices, fun live music, and no cover charge.  It's fun to watch a game here in the bar.  Their selection of drafts is nothing fancy, but they do have Yingling."}
{"text":"Rocky's is the kind of place my family loves, and I look at them like they are crazy.  Extremely greasy, divey joints are not my thing.  At all.  But they dragged me here one Saturday morning, and Rocky's is what it is.  No frills divey breakfast.

Exceptionally greasy food makes me ill, and Rocky's succeeded at doing that.  I don't eat potatoes, and every breakfast meal option came with potatoes.  There is no variety, the menu has 10 things tops.  To top that off, they were out of a lot of things.  But you know what?  Where else can you go for breakfast and eat for around $5 per person including a drink?

No bathrooms.  They must be grandfathered in, or they are just running a super illegal business.  Either way, when you are feeling violently ill after eating a meal here or just need to pee from drinking coffee, you'll be miserable, if you are like me.

Why three stars?  Because my dad is watching me type this and told me that I couldn't give them two.  So for my dad and the cheap prices, three stars.  Bring your family members ages 50+ here.  They'll appreciate it."}
{"text":"I heard that \"The Earth without Art is just Eh.\"
Well there is no art in this cooking but it is cheap and a \"real\" neighborhood experience. I eat here every once in a while and though I wouldn't recommend it to people, I would bring them there with me.

These people have been here forever and when they run out of something they simply tell you \"nope\". When they run out of lot of things... they close.

I hope they are here forever and ever."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, and simple.
Coffee was a little weak but my bagel, egg, ham, and cheese sandwich was greasy and delicious (just the way I like it)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Order a  diet pop.  The glass had tons of ice.  Then the pop has a very flat taste.  I wondered if it came from a bottle that had been sitting for awhile.  Again I am wondering, but the pop was strange. My lunch was average, if even that.  I generally leave a large tip at places.  Here I only left 20%.  This place is filled with ugly gossip.  The owner joins in the conversations.  There is an awesome man who sits at one of the window seats.  I think his name is Bill.  Very sweet guy.  I think he is borderline mentally challenged.  He always has many kind things to say.  This place is a couple foot steps from the transits to downtown, breakfast are okay, but not worth a trip of going out of your way."}

You'd never find this place if you weren't looking for it - a tiny little diner near the hospital. Their hours are somewhat erratic, I believe they're closed Fridays and only open until 1 on Saturday. Upon entering you're greeted with a prominent view of the kitchen(One guy cooking on what appears to be a standard stove), a breakfast bar that seats about 15, and about 10 tables that could seat 2-4.  We sat ourselves at one of the few open tables, the people inside were a few senior couples, one lone older man at the counter, and a young couple. Just about everyone seemed to be a regular and know each other by name. 

Their menu lists breakfast and lunch, with most of their 'a la carte' breakfast items being a few bucks each, and their breakfast plates being about $5. I got an egg sandwich with homefries and coffee for $5, my girlfriend got 2 eggs with toast, homefries, and juice for $6. My girlfriend asked if instead of meat she could get cheese and the eggs scrambled. When the waitress took the order back the guy behind the counter started at the slip in a \"what the hell?\" kind of way but didn't complain.

Our food arrived in less than 5 minutes, a large plate which had a sizable amount of food on it considering the price, and very few frills. Our coffee was kept full and our order was correct, no items having been forgotten. None of the food was notably good, but it was all tasty and had a \"homecooked\"(\"rustic\"?) feel to it. Also, bonus points that the eggs and homefries we were served were not dripping in industrial butter-like oil.

A point worth noting is that while our waitress was very nice to us, it appears they are happy to tell it to you like it is, telling and older man who seemed to be a regular after quite a bit of chit-chat that if he couldn't finish his meal by 1pm then he ought to not bother ordering.  

For $11 and a tip we got a  2 decently sized breakfasts, juice, coffee, and extremely quick service. $6 is about as expensive as anything in there is, so I'm sure we'll be in here on many weekend mornings in the future."}
{"text":"Greasy mess, we had two specials. Eggs and Sausage the sausage was burnt. I asked for eggs and bacon well done, it wasn't. She took it back then it was flabby and burnt. I didn't think that was possible! Waitress wasn't friendly at all. First and last time! Save your money, go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"This is a great little breakfast nook in Bloomfield! The prices for their classic American meals were reasonable, and the food was good! This restaurant area is small, and the menu is typical American breakfast food.  Not many staff members, and a cash only restaurant."}
{"text":"Rocky's is the rare place that I decided to wait until my second visit to review, and I'm glad I did.  I've been hearing about Rocky's for years from my dad, who loves him some buffet.  He is pretty indiscriminate in his tastes, and my mom rolls her eyes just about every time the subject of Rocky's comes up.  But buffets are one of dad's passions, and Rocky's his is second favorite (to give a sense of scale, his favorite is that cooked by the high school kids at Beattie Tech).  

I bet my dad will hear about this if Rocky reads this.  Rocky, if you are reading this, be patient, the story will get better as it goes!  During this first visit, I just didn't have the heart to write a review or the gumption to take any pictures.  I mean, who takes pictures of the Rocky's buffet?  The place is scattered with a handful of diehard locals and regulars.  There are no tourists, city folk, or young Yelpers up in the buffet's business taking pictures.

I started with salad, scraping up the last few bits of spinach, but mostly iceberg; very few toppings, croutons, baby carrots.  There was a house dressing and a bottle sitting out.  There were some cheap dinner rolls like you get for 99c at Shop-n-Save, rectangular pulls aparts.  Oddly, there was a buffet pan with two flavors of potato chips.  I have a soft spot for chips but unfortunately they were starting to get soft.  There was chicken and a bunch of non-descript American meats, gnoochi in a simple red sauce, kielbasa, Normandy vegetables (the frozen blend of broccoli, carrots, & cauliflower).  There were tater tots that were a little soggy, not crisp.  

My other half &I had been having a bad day, and we found ourselves being inexplicably revived by this awful buffet.  We were baffled.  We both felt comforted.  Somehow.

When I started eating the tater tots, I commented that I hadn't eaten them since I was a kid.  My other half replied that he hadn't eaten them since he'd had them in the school cafeteria.  Then we looked at each other and had our Ah Ha moment: this was school cafeteria food!  This is why even though we were eating stuff we hadn't eaten in many years, and wouldn't normally choose or even crave, we were enjoying it and were comforted.  For both of us, raised in different areas, it mirrored the food of our childhoods.

This is why I didn't review the first time: how do you quantify an experience like that?  That by our normal measures, would get a scathing one star (even though we went in with low expectations) but for a constellation of swirling reasons, was exactly what we needed that day?

I shouldn't have worried.  Dad, having been successful in getting the kids to Rocky's once, was on a mission for a repeat visit.  He got the schedule of buffet themes, and of Italian, German, and Polish, we picked Polish food.

So the family trip to Rocky's Polish buffet was scheduled two weeks in advance.  My parents said that in the past Rocky's mom, whom they call Mama, made the pierogies.  They had heard she hadn't been well, so we were prepared for Mrs. T's (but my opinion was that even Mrs. T's would be better than the cheap knock-offs that my parents buy in plastic bags).  My parents were excited when Mama greeted us at the door, but dissapointed when the pierogies were perfect half circles.  But hey, these pierogies were great, and they were so good, I at them for dessert.  (Probably has to do with the fact that when I eat pierogies at home I boil them with kale.  Mama on the other hand served them as they should, with onions and butter).  They were too the moon awesome.

The other stand-out dish was the sarma/golumpki/stuffed cabbage.  Neither other half nor I are big meat eaters, but these were tasty golumpkis.  The meat was moist and flavorful, the cabbage was tender, and there was plenty of red sauce.  There was also halushki, kielbasa, and baked ziti.  For dessert I had strawberries.  The Polish buffet was an all-around satisfying experience.  This folks, is a genuine slice of Pittsburgh worth trekking to.  It's not high cuisine but if you can't handle how the hipsters have taken over Lawrenceville, head out to Shaler, where they haven't made any inroads at Rocky's."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path, Rocky's has a ton of character and really cheap beer prices.  Great place to watch steelers, Pirates. Or Pens!"}
{"text":"Your typical greasy spoon. The hours are a bit odd; another yelper called them erratic, which is a perfect description. I have seen this place for years and I think I've seen it open all of twice, today being one of those times. It's also very small and manned by Rocky himself, who does all the cooking, so even though its small there can be a wait if the tables are full. They are only open for breakfast, so the menu is limited. Just eggs, omelets and pancakes mostly. The most expensive thing on the menu was $6.99 and you get a very large portion, so it's definitely affordable. Like I said, your typical frill-less greasy spoon.
*the Yelp header describes it as Italian, Mexican and Sandwiches (????) which is grossly inaccurate, so please don't try to go there for pasta or tacos"}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall plae with big portions and tiny prices... And it tastes good.  What more could you want from breakfast?"}
{"text":"This little diner is a staple in Bloomfield's Little Italy.
No frills design and decor as you'd expect a good diner to be. Though it does remind me a bit of a residential kitchen/dining area of the early 80s. 
It's clean and comfortable.
The food is good and solid diner fare at reasonable prices:
Eggs, toast, home fries and choice of meat for $4.99. Add a beverage and special is then $7.49.
Great way to fill up for the day.
Cheap and good doesn't get any better."}
