{"text":"I went to this place today for Dim Sum, and I liked it alot.  Dim Sum for 6 people cam out to 97$ before tip and taxes, considering we got a massive ammount of food.  The Siu Mai and Har Gow here are to die for, soft and succulant, and not dried up or too moist, just the right consistency.  The spareribs in black bean sauce, pork dumpling (-1 star for no lemon grass sauce for the dumplings) and stick rice in lotus palms were sure hits, and the won ton soup small is humongous. The portions are huge, and the value is there.  I really liked the fried rice with steak and shrimp, very tasty. All in all, I was happy with the service, the staff were very attentative and cleaned up the table in a fast manner.  Go on a weekday during lunch when its not busy, it can get pretty busy at night.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Service was not very good...  Dishes that were supposed to be served to us were left for the table to distribute..  Also brought a couple of incorrect orders to our table...  And finished, dirty dishes were left at the table for a lengthy time... I wouldn't go back to this restaurant but hey this is just my opinion! who am i to say what you will like! give it a try....  but to sum up... Sorry Asian King... you are Not TooTuff Approved :("}
{"text":"Worst restaurant I've been to in Thornhill bar none.   Was here for a birthday celebration, gone here from a recommendation what a mistake.  Food was salty, not hot, not fresh nor was it very good or prepared well. I think about the only thing they did right was the congee I heard. The tea was even cold?  Thing that topped it off was we were served semi raw pan fried pork dumplings here (they were pink),  brought this the staff's attention and told them to remove from the bill. Of course when the bill arrived it was denial we brought it to their attention. And it was a game of he said and she said, you spoke to who, and they said they'll remove it from the bill.. etc  Was expecting this of course. So I took a picture before hand if I needed to dispute. Needless to say this was damn disappointing for the birthday.   Don't go here unless you want to end up in the hospital pumping your stomach or hurling over a toilet.   0 star if there is such a thing, but posting this review more to inform others of what a terrible dining experience."}
{"text":"Went to this place today and ordered chicken fried rice and schezuan chicken. It was good and ordering just 1 was enough for 2 ppl. But it was not spicy at all. Recommended when you have less options"}
{"text":"Inexpensive, large portions, and decent-to-good food.  I've been here four times now, and we've had some inconsistencies from one visit to another.  The food has always been at least decent, but often quite good, the portions are almost always large, and I'm usually surprised by how little we've paid at the end.  We've had the Peking Duck here three times, and the first time it was pretty nice, the subsequent time our first course was mostly skin, and the third time was somewhere in between.  I certainly wouldn't suggest that you consider this the best Peking Duck in the city, or even within a half-hours drive, but it's here, it's decent, and it's not terribly expensive.  We've had three different congees here, and the House Super Bowl and the Fresh Scallop congees were both quite good, where the Lobster Super Bowl Congee was a disappointment.  We've also had the mixed meat chow mein twice, and I have to admit I have a soft spot for stir fried noodles that are cooked hard like these.  The 'assorted meat' includes a fair number of organ meats, so if that's not your thing, I'd pick something different.  Is it exceptional?  No.  But it's reasonably good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Good, authentic food, giant portions, good value, great service.  HUGE meal for $35 post-tax, pre-grat.  Came here w/ parents.  The resto is pretty new & clean, I like the decor.  I didn't feel dirty touching the table.  Servers speak both Mandarin & Canto, but more Mandarin friendly.  Extremely good service, I was shocked.  I'm a selective meat eater and they went out of their way to work around my & my parents' needs.  I got the stir fried rice noodles & they fried up the beef separately & put it in another bowl for my parents.  They made my wonton noodle soup in veggie broth instead of the beef they typically serve.  Their shrimp wontons are 100% shrimp, no pork.  Which is hard to find!  This above & beyond behavior prompted my parents to tip 18%, which is like me tipping 35%.  What I'm used to @ Chinese restos is people telling me something is vegetarian and then discovering there's bits of pork in it.    Typical Server:  \"What?  It's just a little pork?  You can't eat a little pork?  You're not Muslim!\"  Me:   \"............................*head desk*\"  A refreshing change @ Asian King.  they also take credit card.  Niiiiice."}
{"text":"Three stars over all but price/portion size bumps this up to four stars. As Geoffrey notes, prices are low and you get a big bowl or heaping plate of food, notably if they're rice dishes. Sides run $4-$5 and mains run $8-9. You WILL have leftovers.  Decor is nice, modern, and clean. Service is okay but I think they flubbed the order and brought us a congee dish instead of a noodle dish.   The menu is huge and dishes are flavorful. Not much in the way of surprises, here, but pretty much nothing disappointed."}
{"text":"Asian King is OK. I've been here a couple of times, for family dinners and such. I like their sweet and sour pork (or chicken) a lot! I've been to many chinese restaurants, and I find that Asian King is my favourite place for this specific dish. They use really good quality meat cuts in there, and the sauce is just right... not too sour or sweet.  The fried rice however, always comes unevenly seasoned... It's really weird. Sometimes I get a spoonful of rice in my mouth that's super salty, and then another spoon that is bland. This happens every time I order fried rice here... Not too happy about that... I've had their lunch menus and they're good value/affordable. It comes with corn soup, I've never had this type of soup before. It was alright.  I find that everything else on the regular menu is pricier. Especially their dimsum...main reason why I haven't tried their dimsum.  The comments about the servers careless service is consistent with all of my visits there. It takes a while before they get on with what I ask for... like asking for another bowl of rice. I also get the feeling that they dislike Canto-speaking customers... They usually give me a blank face or irritated face... I have yet to see a smile when they serve me."}
{"text":"It's true that service is kind of careless. Some of the wait staff don't seem to know English. But other than that the food is good, cheap, and large proportions. Went here with my parents & brother. We ordered 6 dishes that ended up costing us about 67.00. And we had tons of food left over. I liked that they had lots of different cuisines but there seemed to be a couple of duplications in the menu."}
{"text":"Only use in an emergency takeout situation. Yeah the decor is cute, but that's about all I like about this place. Service is always careless, like could-not-care-less-about-you type. The food is mediocre, the menu is so huge I doubt they can keep it all freshly made. The congee is somewhat ok, more ginger would do it good. As for the rest of the food it is sub-par, especially fried food, some of them feel like they have been taken out of Superstore's freezer section. So unless it is super late, and I can't go far from my place I will resort to Asian King for congee, but other than that Asian King is not a king of my heart (or should I say belly?)."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last week with friends and found that the service was simply abysmal and the food was not much better.    The menu is huge so it may that we simply made poor choices but of the three entrees that we ordered, only one was good - the Hakka rice.  It was spicy but not overly so and I did enjoy it.    The lemon chicken was just ok.  The sauce was overpoweringly lemony even for someone like me who loves lemon.  The Tom Yum soup was simply awful.  The broth was made up of what tasted like a watered down tomato soup with not enough spices and very few shrimp and scallops.  The calamari in the soup was rubbery.  There are not a lot of great options for Chinese food in this area of the City and I had high hopes that this place since it had been around for a while.  I thought if it had survived for a few years, it would be decent.  While I did enjoy the rice and while there are probably other good items on the menu, I would not ever give this establishment my business again mostly because the service was unpalatable."}
{"text":"I am reviewing Asian King based on their Lunch Specials.  Not too many choice in the area for decent Cantonese food... so you might be stuck with Asian King if you have that urge.  Decent price for lunch $4.99 for a soup noodle of some sort, and the portion is huge.  My Beef Brisket with Wonton Noodle Soup ($4.99) was really flavourable...by tons of MSG. I was thirsty for the whole day after that. On the other hand, my Hot Yoga Date Thai vegetarian Fried Rice ($6.50) with soup and Spring Rolls was really blend tasting.  Services here is cold and efficient......   I don't know if I would be back to Asian King  for more MSG experience!"}
