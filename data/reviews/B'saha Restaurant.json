{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches for lunch--Tuna was the best. Fried and sauce are incredible too. Get the mint tea!"}
{"text":"i love this place.  i live down the street and at points during the week i find myself savagely craving their lentil soup.  their merguez sausage is made in house and it is delightful.  the spot is super laid back - lively moroccan decor, no frills or hassle around getting a table or reservations or any of that, walk up ordering.  very reasonable and beautiful brunch menu.  staff are sweet.    basically the way i feel about this place is i want enough people to get into it so that they stay open forever but i also want it to myself.  which is a compliment :)"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this place. The food was delicious and authentic (I had come with some friends who have lived in Morocco). We had the lemon chicken tagine for four (call ahead to order) and a number of side dishes.  The owners are from there as well and were incredibly friendly. He makes all the food there himself so it's fresh.  One thing I appreciate, especially having a baby, is the presence of a baby change table in the spacious and clear washroom!  Would come back again!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS CLOSED! Planned a birthday dinner for a friend and did not find out until last minute that they are closed and the restaurant is for sale. An update on their social media accounts would have been nice."}
{"text":"Believe the hype! Had a fab first experience at B'Saha today - we tried the merguez spicy mutton sandwich  and the Burger! Both were really flavourful, juicy and packed with a perfect blend of spice and sauce. Prices were really reasonable too for the quality and uniqueness of the food. So happy this place has opened around the corner from where we live! Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is around the corner from me and such a delight! We've tried the lentil soup, olive tapenade, lemon chicken and beef sandwiches and the merguez sausage, all of which were incredibly good! I specially love the beef and apricot slow cooked meat sandwich and the merguez they are excellent!  I haven't tried the tagine yet but I am planning to soon."}
{"text":"Really fresh and tasty food. The mint tea is awesome too. A nice addition to College and definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Made plans with friends to meet here for dinner on a Monday night.    Checked the website and IG a few days before and all looked good. Got to the restaurant and it was closed. Like, forever closed. For Sale sign in the window and everything.   In an age of social media, I am pissed that they made no announcement on either the website (which went mysteriously blank when I checked again) or their Twitter/Instagram.   I know places shut down all the time, but make an effort to at least go out with grace and some respect for your customers."}
{"text":"This place has closed. Went on Monday and Tuesday and it's dark with detritus at the front door.  Waste of time and had to settle for a burrito (Burrito Boyz)  a few doors down, which was quite good. Wanted some African food."}
{"text":"Saw all the 5-star reviews and had to stop in. Totally worth it! \"The burger\" and braised beef sandwich were amazing, savory and cooked to perfection. Highly recommend this spot for a delicious bite."}
{"text":"Had a small group dinner. We arrived early, so had to wait there for a while, the server guy and girl chatted with us to keep us from feeling bored. They told us the tagines need to be ordered at least one day in advance, so that they could have time to prepare and cook the dishes.  We ordered all their three tagines, lamb, chicken and veggie. The lamb and chicken were tender and juicy, the veggie one was well cooked too. Eating with their freshly made bread, it was very delicious.  We also had few snacks, eggplant, mashed potato, and chilli. Their alleged-super-spicy-chilli was not that spicy to us, but still tasted good. We had two types of soups too. One was chickpea chilli soup, the other was made by saffron and some other ingredients that made it not smelling good, but I loved it.  The Moroccan tea tasted good too. Overall, it's a lovely Moroccan street food place."}
{"text":"Visited for brunch a couple months ago and have been meaning to write a review ever since. Food was excellent and the value was even better. You can tell there is love and attention put into both the selection of ingredients and the preparation. There are a lot of cookie-cutter brunch options in Toronto, so try something different and visit B'saha! I absolutely plan to return for dinner sometime soon!"}
{"text":"I liked this place, it was very cute and the food offerings where very fresh and flavourful. I had the Tasty Meatless and it was really good. I really enjoyed the patty with the marinated eggplant. It was warm, delicious, and really hit the spot on a cold wintery day! I am sad that they are now closed, but maybe they will re-open another location in the future!"}
{"text":"Delicious and well priced. The flavours were wonderful and a lot of things are made in house including the sausages."}
{"text":"When I think of a Morrocan eatery I think of eating exotic food surrounded by lavish decor: \"Street Food\" should have tipped me off.  Nice staff, clean place but I didn't know what to think of the decor. A whole wall dedicated to impromptu customer doodlings, local artists' work on sale on another wall and touches here and there of Moroccan decor; it was a mish mash of styles.   Ordered: - Braised Beef sandwich - bread was dry. I wasn't fond of the caramelized apricots so I took them out. Portion was small for the price. - Grilled Shrimp Salad - the shrimp were large and perfectly grilled, salad was fresh; I enjoyed this very much. - San Pelligrino Blood Orange sparkling drink - my fav! - my friend had their Moroccan Mint tea which was aromatic.  Would come back for the grilled items."}
{"text":"Outstanding flavours! Loved the burger and the Harira. I would definitely go back and try their other sandwiches!"}
{"text":"3.5/5. We made a reservation the day before as tagines need to be ordered 24 hours in advance. Upon walking in, it definitely felt more like a fast food joint in terms of decor (and many people did get their food to go). We had the chicken and lamb tagines, along with two cold salads (mixed greens and tomato/red pepper) and the zaalook (zesty eggplant spread). Bread is included free of charge and you will want to ask for more to soak up all of the flavours in the tagines. The lamb tagine with caramelized apricots and prunes was excellent, while the saffron and lemon chicken tagine was very tender, but not nearly as aggressively seasoned as the lamb. The mixed green salad was run of the mill, while the tomato/red pepper salad was more of a vegetable stew served cold. Likewise, the zaalook was also served cold. Both the tomato/red pepper salad and the zaalook had a strong olive flavour, which may not appeal to everyone.  The service was courteous but a bit haphazard as the staff were essentially trying to run a take out counter and a sit down restaurant at the same time. Overall, it was a reasonably priced and enjoyable meal and I'd definitely want to return to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"I've seen this place a few times on my way to other places in  Little Italy so I was excited to finally be able to sneak in before closing time and try it (close at 10pm on the weekedays at least).   It's a Moroccan restaurant that focuses on a small but impressive menu (they also do catering if you are interested).  We tried a few dishes to share:   - lemon chicken - I loved this - so simple, but juicy and flavourful   - beet salad - was a nice cool refreshing bite that went well with the chicken  - the lamb/beef sausage (I think it's called their merguez sausage) - they are small but pack a flavour punch in your mouth   - olive tapenade - delicious and it still had pieces of olives in it so it wasn't processed to death.  It went well with the nice hot bread they gave us (seriously ask for the bread).  The decor is definitely Moroccan with their lanterns and pictures on the wall, but it isn't in your face kinda decor, more like a no frills, lets concentrate on the food decor.  It's a small place, but definitely left me impressed.  When we were leaving the owners/chefs (??) indicated they would be changing up their menu shortly so I look forward to coming back and seeing what new things they have in store for us!  Next time though we are definitely getting the tagine - they said they will have a tagine each day that's ready made for quick order so I'm excited to try that.  Having been to Moroccan before I can safely say they haven't strayed too far from the cuisine.  Which is definitely a good thing."}
{"text":"Just tried the lemon chicken on salad. Fantastic. This place offers wholesome, exceptionally tasty food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious and so unique! I stopped in for lunch and ordered the tuna, boiled egg, French fry sandwich. The bread was perfect and the combo of ingredients inside the sandwich were super delish. The menu is reasonably priced and the inside of the restaurant is cute & clean."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's well set up, has an interesting menu, terrific prices and super friendly staff! We had the chicken sandwich and the meatless sandwich. The chicken was fine, cute little fries stuffed into it. The meatless was good as well. The mint tea is great. The washrooms are clean and well-maintained, and wonderfully located on the same level as the restaurant. The only things I would change: have specific cups, glasses and cutlery (not paper cups and plastic cutlery) for those people who aren't taking out. Other than that, it's pretty awesome! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'd rate the eggplant spread a 10/10.  I just think the texture is nice.  It has the chunks and the pur√©ed bits all combined into one."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were great - lemon chicken and merguez. Will do it again."}
{"text":"B'saha is a Moroccan street food shop located on the busy Little Italy strip that runs across College Street. The focus is on sandwiches, soups, and other refreshing dishes that you can tell were created by someone who is very passionate and creative.  Must-try items: The Burger Harira Soup (Lentil, Tomato, Chick Peas)  Everything about this place is charming, down to the friendly service and cozy atmosphere which is accented by photographs and heirlooms from Morocco. I was impressed on my first visit and will be returning for sure. If you're looking for alternative place to go for lunch, coffee, a bite to eat, or just a slightly unfamiliar atmosphere, you definitely want to try this place out."}
{"text":"Delicious. Homemade. Hearty. Food so good deserves better than a flimsy plastic fork. Next time, I'll bring my own. Food is worth it!"}
{"text":"So I've been here twice now and I absolutely love this place. I rarely post a recommendation/review but it kind of felt wrong not to post one because both of my visits were worthy of a five star experience. I'll get into the food first:  The first time around:  My girlfriend: The Burger - She loved it. Me: Lamb Burger - I loved it. We both had the Mint Tea. Despite being thirty degrees outside, it was really refreshing.   Second time around:  My girlfriend and I both had the sausage burgers. My girlfriend didn't like the burger as much as me because she's not into lamb. They're really fresh so there is a distinct flavour but if you like red meat, do it!   I'm looking forward to visiting again. Clean washrooms. Great staff/service (family owned and operated makes a huge difference).   Go!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Sunday morning when we realized that our planned resto ha about a 1-2 hr wait. This place has No line and its food is just so unique and amazing. Highly recommended brunch lovers to come here. The price is adorable too. And it has freshly squeezed orange juice!!!"}
