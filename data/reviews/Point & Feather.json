{"text":"To be fair, the burger met expectations and the beer menu was fine.  The TV's were all showing Monday Night Football, which is pretty much what I was hoping for when I decided to go there in the first place....HOWEVER, two dudes sat down to the left of me and one of them kicked off his shoes and propped his socked feet up on the chair.  That....is disgusting.  The waitress actually had to reach over dude's rank, socked feet to retrieve his empty glasses and she never said a word.  I'm not sure that's even legal, but I was immediately disgusted and asked for my bill and left.  Gimme a damn break.  Who let's people sit in their restaurant with their shoe-less feet propped up on an empty chair?"}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 10 years. Service is average. Food is a little above average. A regular neighborhood pub with a mixed crowd. Not many places you see 20 year olds and 70 year olds in the same pub! Lol   Other yelpers complain about service or other patrons-then tell them when your there. Don't hide behind a phone a complain."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick bite here last night with the boys. Beer was cold and my burger was hot. Staff was a little slower than expected but I would return."}
{"text":"Yikes. I met up with some coworkers here for wing night. The wings themselves were pretty good. Not bad for cheap pub wings, so that was a plus.  However, the service was beyond terrible. I work in the food and beverage industry and I understand it can get busy and things can get missed. But our server made us feel like an interruption to her night. A couple of people in our group had to leave early, so they settled their tab with her. She forgot to charge them for a dessert and instead of explaining it to us kindly, she practically demanded one of us pay for it. Mistakes happen, I totally understand that. No need to be aggressive with us like it was our fault. Her attitude about the whole situation really irked me.   We all settled with her after this as she also mentioned her shift was done. We asked her if she could send another server over to start a new tab and she said yes. Well, 45 minutes later, nobody came by to even offer us water. We saw a server walk past our table several times with no acknowledgement. Finally we had enough and left. These girls clearly didn't understand that the better service you give, the more money you will make. All I know is that our group of 10 will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"This is a typical neighbourhood pub but a good place to come for a casual night out. The clientele ranges from age 20 to 70 and the crowd is friendly. The food is generally good. The service is usually great. Often we come here on a Thursday night for ridiculously inexpensive flavoured ribs.  It's a pub. They sell alcoholic beverages. When the Calgary Flames are playing it is more like a sports bar. On those nights they sell lots of alcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"Great ambience and service, the chicken wings are the right size and taste. This is the kind of place that you can see friends and families (with their adult children) get together for a chicken wings night. The place is clean and new. This is the favourite pub of many of my friends for a chicken wings night. Definitely recommend the place."}
{"text":"Thought I should update this as the last review was from 2009. When I first went to the PnF, it was really quiet and bookish, with crappy beer. Not long after, they ripped out all the taps and refurbished them all and stocked an extensive line of craft beers. So now it's not all quiet and booky (too bad for me), but they do have great beer. The bartender will let you sample a few before you choose, and the service is pretty great, even when it's busy. This is my go-to meeting place, and I hope it won't be yours because it's already full most of the time! :)  Way to go, PnF - you are a success.  P.S. Order the lager chips \"well done\" and with sea salt  - they are to die for. Eat with Arrogant Bastard IPA for full effect."}
{"text":"Spotted this location online while looking for wings on a Wednesday night. Typical \"english\" pub with the decor and design, with pool tables and even an air hockey table. First impressions are important and this one came out medicore and predictable. Second impressions are something to build on.   No greeting at the door, despite wandering the pub looking around. Finding a table on my own, it was still 20 minute before a server came up and greeted me. Ordered a draft on special and asked to see the wing flavors. Was it a sign of what to come when the table menu lacked the daily specials or a listing of the wing flavors? Not sure.   Kept it simple, went with salt and pepper. Wings weren't spectacular, but were edible.   So why the 1 star? The service was terrible. Our server cleared our plates, which was nice, but if you clear the table with such gusto that you fling wing bones all over the table, it kinda ruins the action. Worse still, failing to notice, well that is just shit service.   I won't return, I wouldn't recommend this place for a good time."}
{"text":"I paid my first visit to the Point and Feather last night and I have to say I am honestly impressed with the experience I had. The bar is fairly large with plenty of space, my buddy and I found a nice table where we were able to socialize and watch the UFC fights without any interruptions from the other customers.   The drinks were reasonably priced and our server was very polite. I liked the warm atmosphere that the Point and Feather gave off, it was certainly a good place to have some drinks and escape from all the stress of everyday life.  A couple of issues I did have was the amount of time it took for our sever to get back to myself and my friend so we could order more rounds, the amount of time it took for our wings to arrive, and the noise level earlier in the night when we first arrived (then again it was UFC night so I can understand the ruckus!)  Overall I am very satisfied with my experience at the Point and Feather and look forwards to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times, and it's been great every time!   the food is great, the grilled BBQ chicken burger is excellent! I got it with a side of lager chips (basically homemade potato chips) and I've been dreaming about them ever since. Their chicken wings are also good, but there might be a bit of a wait on Wednesdays.   It's much nicer inside than i expected as well. It's huge inside, with tons of seating, a nice area for pool tables, and a cozy little area in the back.   I'm excited to see what else the menu has to offer, as they've had a promising start!"}
{"text":"This is a neat little neighbourhood place. I'd probably like it more if I actually lived in the neighbourhood. Otherwise its not exactly a destination. Average food (although their chips are tasty) and decent specials. Nothing dazzling but nothing to really complain about either. Service seemed to have some highs and lows over the course of the evening.  It IS a decent size so its good for mid sized groups or teams to hang out in. Patio is pretty small though. I was also surprised at the number of VLTs and how much they weren't being used. They probably could do something cooler with that space. I did like that there were mixed types of seating though.  I'd go back if I was in the neighbourhood for other reasons but probably wouldn't drive there by choice."}
{"text":"Every Monday night I come here with my family. Never a disappoint. Well I was disappointed with taco Tuesday. But Monday and Wednesday wings are the best."}
{"text":"My local friend thought this venue to be a dive, but I explained to him from my experience, it's just kick back with no airs, just a rather neighborhoody place. Not sure of all the game tables, besides some of the machine games and pool tables (I didn't notice foosball or other games, not that I was really looking). Pretty large place in comparison to some of the neighborhood spots I've been to various places I've lived. It's cool that my friend has The Point & Feather in his neighborhood."}
{"text":"Disappointed. It's been a couple of years since I've been here, and I remember why I haven't returned. The food was slow, hour and 20 and wasn't appetizing. The boys and I are going to a different location next week for sure. Please work on the food, and the service, felt like we were ignored on purpose.  Cheers  D"}
{"text":"A nice place to come to. Away from the hustle and bustle of downtown. I ordered for the lamb shank with great expectations. It was horrible!!!!! Don't even think of ordering this item. Completely bland to taste, no proper colours on the plate. Just mashed potatoes and lamb with the brown sauce. Try something else! Service was okay. As mentioned a nice place to come and meet a few people through meetup!"}
{"text":"Just experienced the worse service here. 4 servers standing around doing nothing, our glasses sat empty along with our dirty dishes. I proceeded to the bar to get more drinks, only to be sent away, \"I'll send someone to your table\", 10 minutes later Laura came back.  Doesn't asknowkedge that she's   ignored us.  Never asking how our food was,mid we needed more water, wine or anything."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood pub. Nice place to hang out with friends any time of the later afternoon or at night.  Large space with tables (indoor and out), TVs, and games. Haven't ever seen it too busy.  The food and drinks are decent, but the menu isn't that elaborate - so don't be picky!  Servers are friendly and prices are decent."}
{"text":"Ordered a 1\2 of nachos. Burnt chips. Al Most no cheese . beef invisible despite  Being a $5 upcharge A huge rip off"}
{"text":"My parents went to this bar 30 years ago and from what they told me today this place hasn't changed BUT that's not a bad thing.  The food is excellent.  We had the fish and chips and the fish was huge and cooked perfectly.  It wasn't super noisy even though UFC was on. Mother staff was friendly and our waitress was always making sure we were ok for drinks.  There are pool tables in the back, buck hunter and golden tee to the right.  There are also VLT's and I have to say its the first time I have been at a full bar and not one person was on them.  I have been to this bar many times over the past 15 years and it didn't disappoint me.  I guess it never disappointed my parents either.  The decor, tables and chairs are outdated which is why this place doesn't get 5 stars.  Maybe a little update would make the place even that much better!"}
{"text":"Good place.  Wing night is worth the visit (Tuesday and Wednesday).  Service is ok at best food slightly above average but priced above average.  Stick to wing night(s)."}
{"text":"Nice local bar. Good service, good food. Wings available Monday and Wednesday.  Best thing is the have Buzztime Trivia."}
{"text":"I've been here for an hour and I still haven't gotten my food. How long does it take to deliver dry ribs when it's their Thursday special??   Also, when we asked we got some serious attitude from the waitress.   #nevercomingback"}
{"text":"These guys are great,, especially mike the daytime bartender. A pub with continuous improvement in mind. Unfortunately they have fallen into the profit centre where volume is sacrificed. I totally miss the 20 oz pints and would happily pay more to not have a short beer."}
{"text":"The Point and Feather is your typical neighbourhood pub.  Local people, relatively cheap alcohol, and comfy chairs make this pub a nice, quieter place to have dinner or drinks with family and friends.  Located in the corner of a small Ranchlands strip mall, this local pub usually stays pretty calm.  I would attribute this to not many people knowing the place is there.  Besides the odd Karaoke and attempt at a live DJ night, this pub does not offer anything too special.  It would seem to be a nice getaway from the loud, crowded pubs you'd find in the more popular areas of the city.    The food and drinks are reasonably priced and do not fall short of the pub standards.  You'll get your regular bar food (nachos, wings, potato skins, etc.) and your regular beer or highball without any fuss.  You won't be blown away by the tastes of Point and Feather, but you shouldn't be dissatisfied either.  All-in-all, Point and Feather is not a place you'd expect to go if you're looking for a wild party night, but not the worst neighbourhood pub I've been to either.  If I lived in Ranchlands I'd be pretty happy to have a local pub... and Point and Feather wouldn't disappoint."}
