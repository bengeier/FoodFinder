{"text":"Love love love this place!    Tacos tacos    Firstly just need to say I put the habanero hot sauce on everything here to give it a little kick! ... If you love spice defiantly try it.  Also rule of thumb *squeeze* that lime on everything ! Tacos and in drinks .... Just go wild.   Shrimp tacos were juicy and great   Fish taco was great and flaky   They had a Trout taco day feature which was great (with a little lime and hot sauce)  Chicken and beef tacos had a decent amount of meat in them and were nicely cooked and shredded.   The Vegetarian option was surprisingly also very tasty and flavourful    Ceviche love the jalapeño touch inside but fish and tomatoes needs to be chopped up more for better chip grabbing fun.    Margarita pitcher could use a little more lime less agave and more tequila.... Less sweetness and more pungent twist and kick in the mouth to go with those tasty tacos. (I just ordered extra tequila and added to my cup.... But I would say about 4 more shots in the pitcher would fix it)  Over all very great vibes...music is beautiful loud and upbeat. Friendly staff. Great place to go grab a bite laugh and enjoy a fun Latin vibes time"}
{"text":"I have to say that I was not impressed, however our server Danielle was great.  A bit overpriced for a watered down Margarita and that taco's are ok.  I've had better at Bloor and Christie in this little dive called El Salvadorian....and cheaper.  Very dark, to the point I couldn't read anything.  I would not go back here to spend my money.  I think there are better options and I found the taco's to be too drippy - wet, making it a nightmare to eat.   First time and last."}
{"text":"I don't know why people rave about this place.  Greasy chips, mediocre salsas and guac.  Tacos were good (I had the chicken tinga) but I've had better.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I dined at El Caballito on King this past weekend for a friend's birthday. Overall, I felt that the service was lost and confused at times. Clouded by the loud music, communicating with servers and bus boys was difficult which disrupted the celebration. However, the food was tasty and I'd like to particularly highlight a moment where the service bartender, Charlie, was slammed given the volume of customers at that time. Having worked as a service bartender myself for two summers at Turtle Jack's, Charlie was calm and efficient attending to the loads of drinks rang in. A great moment to witness, from one service bartender to another."}
{"text":"Food was great! My friend and I tried all the tacos and I liked the pork the most. Be warned though the wait for it took forever.. Which is weird since it didn't seem like a lot of people were ordering food. Even my tequila soda took a half hour! I think because they are still be they are still trying to figure out queuing the kitchen or something. Worth another visit :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is pretty cool. When we went last time it was around 6 and still bright outside. We walked down a few steps to the basement and ended up in a dark restaurant/bar that looked like it was 10 or 11 pm in Tulum. it is very well decorated with great music and a cool ambience. However the margaritas we got were served in a glass that was smaller than a kids meal drink. Super tiny and super over priced. The food is good street taco style which I personally enjoy but options on the menu are very limited. I'd def go back again just to hang out and for drinks (just not the margaritas) because the place in general was good and the ambience was great."}
{"text":"food **** - Service ***** - ambience ****  They have some nice tacos. I have tried tacos from different places in the GTA and I must say their tacos were unique and delicious.   Recommended"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!  I was so impressed with how ghastly the service was that I have been compelled be to write a review for the first time.  I mean it was actually quite impressive how lousy their servers could be. I went here on Nov 22nd with 12 people for my birthday.  I will never go back there and would not recommend anyone else to go here (unless you want to walk up to the bar every time you want a drink).  We had a set menu (everyone had the exact same thing!!) and there were still complications.  Everything took forever!! Our servers would literally drop stuff and run from the table. We arrived at 8:30 and did not receive any food until about 10:30pm.  Our server kept telling us she couldn't count or keep count of the people at our table?? I mean isn't that your job??  The manager came over and said sorry but did nothing to help the situation.  One of my guests asked for a shot of Jose Cuervo and the server said they don't carry \"low quality\" tequila's and totally embarrassed the guest in front of the whole table.  They conveniently added the tip to our bill, so maybe that is why they felt they did not need to serve us.  Every time I wanted a drink I had to walk up to the bar and get one.  I get better service at McDonald's..."}
{"text":"Food: Delicious! I can't just name one dish that I liked!  Service: Friendly staff  Ambience: It's an underground restaurant - it's dark and has trendy decor. Crowd: young crowd- there was a mid-20s crowd on a Friday night. I'm 35 and I definitely felt old there. Maybe it's better during the day!  Overall: walking distance from where I live so it's a great dining option after work. The food and service was great."}
{"text":"BEST Mexican restaurant in Toronto. Tacos are flavorful and unique - not too heavy.  My favorite are the Flank Steak, Baked Fish and Al Pastor. The family style offering is incredible bang for your buck. Tromba & Soda... new favorite drink. MUST TRYS: Ceviche - served on a beat taco - unbelievable. Championes al Ajillo - different and delicuos. Décor is fun anf lively."}
{"text":"Food poisoning!!  Spent the night with stomach cramps curled up in a ball.  Avoid at all costs!!  Also, staff are awful!  Was told by the hostess 30min.  30min later she says it will be at least another 30min.  An hr and a half later we still hadnt been seated despite 4 tables sitting empty for nearly an hr.  Finally at and the food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Great place for a casual bite to eat if you're in the mood for tacos and guac and the like.  Definitely a trendy place with an entirely dimmed dining setting and loud music. The flank steak taco and fish tacos were good. The downside is each taco is priced at about $5 so your bill will climb pretty quickly if you're here for the food. The margaritas also have a lot of huge chunks of ice, but were really strong - so we weren't disappointed there.   The chips and guac are pretty amazing - huge portion of dip with lots of avocado chunks. The flavoured tortilla chips were also really tasty, especially the orange ones with a bit of sweetness.   Service was quite slow though and not the most friendly/enthusiastic for a Saturday night. I would go back for their half price Taco and Tequila Tuesday nights or their Sangria night."}
{"text":"Friendly waiters and good food and ambiance. We stopped in for a quick bite before heading to the Theater nearby. But it was pretty packed, so booking ahead is a good idea. We had Tacos- the 1$ steak special ones and pulled pork and spicy shrimp tacos. They were quite good, would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere.  Very lively and music is awesome.  The food is delicious.  A must try is a the pork belly tacos!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the following tacos: * Flank Steak taco, with bell peppers, roasted onions, salsa verde asada, and cow's cheese * Baked Fish taco, with macha marinade sauce, salsa cruda, crispy leeks, red cabbage, and lime * Chicken Pibil, which was a heap of pulled chicken, black beans, pickled red onion on a corn tortilla  Absolutely loved all three. The tortillas were great as they weren't thin enough to break but not too much dough. The filling was all seasoned and tasted amazing.  Guac was also good (but how can you go wrong with guacamole) and their chips were really delicious!  I'd come back for taco+tequila Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"I can't believe there is caldo de camarón on de menu and it actually tasted like the awesome soup you get in the markets in Mexico. Just in case this hadn't already made my day, the tacos al pastor were fantastic, certainly more upscale than what you normally see around Mexico City, but the taste was the same. The drinks were great as well, the Condesa cocktail was perfect not too sweet and not too sour. Aside of that they have negra modelo, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I love the vibe of the back patio and the tacos were delicious. We also indulged in a spicy margarita which was bomb! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Had an awful experience with the service here, and I didn't even eat... we were basically ignored at the front while the girls chatted to each other, but worst of all, they couldn't figure out if they had a table for our party or not. Literally, it went from no, to yes and they took our coats, to waiting 10 minutes and it being no again, to having one of the girls grab us again off the street saying they actually have one... to again being no.   We were furious, but hopefully I can update this review with a better impression soon..."}
{"text":"Amazing place.  Unfortunately, the clueless female bartender who works there redefines the meaning of \"incompetent, bad service\".  Thus, it negates anything positive that could be said about the establishment (and there is a lot - it truly could be a landmark Mexican establishment in the city).  My personal advice - until the bartender gets fired - I would call ahead and see if she is working before coming down.  :-)  Don't take my word for it... try it for yourself (or... DON'T SIT AT THE BAR!)."}
{"text":"El Caballito made my night.  The atmosphere is perfect - fun, casual and very street-Mexican.   Came here on a Saturday night for a post-dinner party and spent most of my time drinking, socializing and snacking at the bar. Tried two different tacos. Both were delicious! One was the midnight taco (don't remember the name of the other).  Had a margarita, a couple blondies and a tequila (again, don't remember the name).  All solid.  We had great service. Coat check was quick and easy. Staff was friendly. Bartenders were accessible and made some great recommendations.  Only complaint - a teensy bit hard to find.  Will be back.  Based on the tacos, I will be trying much more off their menu."}
{"text":"Went there for my sister's birthday dinner.  RE: Seating  Despite claiming they won't take reservations for parties under 8 people, we called at 7:30 and they were happy to reserve a table @ 8:30pm for 4 people. They weren't super busy which is probably why they were so accommodating   RE: Food -skip the salsa tower. It comes with 4 small offerings of different type of salsas, nothing revolutionary or even super enjoyable - not worth it.  -The guacamole is a must, very fresh and the chips - which are plantains and other root veggie chips - are very filling -Steak taco was the table favourite - we also tried Chicken and Pork Tacos and empanadas  -Chicken taco is VERY spicy - which the server did not tell us about and is not mentioned on the menu (beware).  -skip the $4.50 Churros - they were hot which was nice but again, nothing special and too pricy for the size of the order   Most Surprised -the margarita (classic lime) was OK. Ice could have been blended more. A little too tart. Lacked finesse   Ambiance  -great. loved the addition of the DJ around 9PM - still not too loud, but good music. Love the underground feel of the place."}
{"text":"When you are in a party of 8+, they have a fixed menu which is $24 for appetizers to share, 4 tacos and churros to finish. For a group of girls, this is a LOT of food. I wish there was an option to order less per person. We couldn't even take leftovers home with us because the restaurant does not do doggy bags (which I think is ridiculous)."}
{"text":"Love, Love LOVE this place!  Best Guacamole ever Yummiest Tacos Terrific Margaritas Awesome Atmosphere  Seriously, need a date so I can get back to this place pronto!"}
{"text":"I would come back to this place. My friend and I came here on a Wednesday evening and it was pretty packed but we were lucky enough to find a table on the patio. The servers helped us out because it was our first time there and they talked us through the menu. We ended up ordering some margaritas, brisket, trout and chicken tacos and dessert.  To be honest, tacos were more on the bland side but it wasn't too bad and the margaritas were smooth.  The best thing we ate there was the churro ice cream sandwich. I HIGHLY recommend it if you have a sweet tooth. It's a decent portion for 10$ but it was so worth it. I'll probably come back for this treat.  Overall, really clean, nice servers and amazing churro ice cream. The vibes were nice and pricing wasn't extreme (3 tacos for $12.75) . However, I'm giving it 4/5 stars because the tacos weren't the best I've had but did I mention the amazing churro ice cream sandwich they have?"}
{"text":"I wanted to treat my dad and brother for dinner after a film at the Lightbox but I was mortified with my choice almost as soon as we were seated.  I can't describe our server outside of physical appearance because of how nonexistent her presence or personality was at our table.   I asked about my brother's dietary restriction and was met with a finely crafted non-answer that didn't tell me anything about what I asked.  Once our drinks arrived we were left alone for 20ish minutes. We were given no water to go with our guacamole and incredibly over-salted chips. I actually laughed when my dad said they were too salty for him because he is a man who salts all his food before even tasting it.  I had wanted a second margarita because it was actually good, but also probably because all the salt had absorbed the life out of my mouth.   Unfortunately by the time our server came around again I was too dehydrated to function and wanted the bill so I could get the us the fuck out of there.  Food and drinks were dropped off by runners who named the food wrong and didn't do much else. An order was mixed up and the correction took a long time to remedy. I asked a runner for water for the table since our server was MIA. We somehow finished eating our impossibly built and slightly burnt tostadas and stacked our plates before this happened. A runner dropped off a single glass of water in front of me and then cleared our plates only to drop them on my dad's back. I've been a server for many years and dropped enough things on people. It happens and it's accidental. What's not acceptable is throwing your head back and laughing at your mistake while my dad had to put down his meal and stand up to clean himself.  Anyways. I did my first 10% tip ever and now that I've written this review, I realize I probably should have kept my $6.50 to buy the ingredients that made up my meal tonight and use them to feed myself homemade Mexican for the rest of the week."}
{"text":"Great tacos for vegetarians. It was quite delicious we had a mushroom taco and a vegetarian taco. They seemed like small portions at first but after 2 tacos I was stuffed. The ambiance was nice and the waitress was friendly. She also helped to create a drink for me."}
{"text":"Was my first time and was really impressed with the food. I didn't realize Toronto actually had good Mexican food!! The manager James was really helpful, so a big thanks to him for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"This review is for the Saturday brunch.   We came in with fairly high expectations for the food, and unfortunately we were a bit disappointed. Two of us split the Churro Pancakes and the Huevos Rancheros, and we were definitely satisfied portion-wise.  The Churro Pancakes were quite over-hyped. The churro itself had too much cinnamon, with the pancake being a bit dry. It was not fluffy as a pancake should be, and the flavour itself just wasn't there.  As for the Huevos Rancheros, the guacamole was the best part of the meal. It had a bit of spiciness, and the texture was very nice. The rest of the plate was okay - the papas bravas and beans were both decent but could have used a bit more seasoning/flavour.  The servers were quite nice, and the ambiance is quite relaxed, but this did not compensate for the overall average/mediocre food."}
{"text":"#1 in Toronto for TACOS AND TEQUILA!!! I'm a recurring customer and will always choose El Cabalito. Great place before a night on the town or a place to meet up with friends for that one last bite before heading home for the night. Customer service is amazing and atmosphere is very California chic reminds me of L'Scorpion in Hollywood."}
{"text":"This place is no longer a restaurant that it used to be when it opened a year ago. It seemed as though they have repositioned themselves to be more of a bar/small bites place rather than a full service restaurant. Their menu selection has shrunk considerably and the quality and portion size seemed to have suffered.  FOOD: not worth it. There are way, way better Mexican restaurants and eateries in this city that offer much better value for money both in terms of portion size and food quality. We had the following tacos: spicy shrimp, fish, chicken and steak. All 4 were quite bland and none of them really stood out. What did stand out is a hefty price tag of $5 per taco.   DRINKS: great selection of Tequilas and they also have drink specials every night. We tried their Margaritas which were quite tasty albeit pricey. Sangria was ok. They only have one choice of red and one choice of white wine which were of \"table wine\" quality. I would definitely stick to Margaritas.  AMBIANCE: fun, very loud, quite dark. This is actually a fun place for a night out with friends to share a few drinks and laughs. The place does get loud especially when the DJ is I so its hard to maintain a meaningful conversation. Definitely not a good place for a romantic date night! I do recommend coming here for drinks with a group of friends. They have DJ on Fri and Sat nights and there is a live Mexican band followed by a DJ on Tuesdays.  Overall: it's a fun spot to come with a group of friends and take a break from your usual bar scene. Don't expect much in terms of food as this place is more of a tequila bar with some quick bite options."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and had a lot of fun, a friend of mine made the reservations and told them it was my birthday and they were extremely accommodating.   Great service, great tequila, okay food. Some of the tacos are better than others and they're pretty small.  I would come here again, this would be a good place to go out for drinks before going out on the town."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends here for drinks and some food. Service was good, very friendly and our server even gave us recommendations for bars to go afterwards. The flank steak and pulled chicken taco were my favorite. The Don Julio tequila was very expensive but expected it would be. Great place to meet up with friends or co-workers and have good food and drinks."}
{"text":"This isn't really a restaurant, it strikes me more like a bar that serves food.   Their soups were far too salty, completely inedible.  The guacamole and chips with plantain was good but a very small portion.  Had 2 tacos, the fish and beef. Beef was with a very runny/oily sauce. Fish taco was the best thing on the menu (that we tried).   It strikes me they are going for the late night bar crowd who needs something to chomp on.   Music was loud and waitresses were there for a reason (if you get my drift).   Would only go back if I was in the area late at night and nothing else was open."}
{"text":"Too dark. You barely can see the person sotting in front of you. On a Friday night they ran out of both fish and shrimp tacos out of four tacos they have. I ordered chicken taco which was horrible. The barbacoa taco was OK. Motile de Tinga was the only tastey dish. I assume it is a good place to go for drinks but definitely not a food place."}
{"text":"When I first started going here a year ago, it was quite different from what it seems to have become.  Went there last night for an after work dinner/drinks with a couple of girlfriends, and here's what:  I get that change is (sometimes) good.  But I go once every month or so, and order more or less the same stuff that I like, and EVERYTIME it's a little different.  If it ain't broke don't fix it!    Most of this has been covered by previous reviewers, so I won't rehash too much - expensive food (except Taco Tuesdays, those are good), small portions (I'm a very small eater and even I've been ordering more food).  When I was there in May, their slushy margarita was new and it was good. When I went last night, the drink was literally, no joke, HALF the size as last time.   And unless it's changed since I last checked, no reservations for groups under 8 people, which kind of sucks."}
{"text":"Service 10 Food 11 Price 10 Ambience, music, crowd 10  Amazing. This place is amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to El Caballito a few times now and the food has always been great. However, a few weeks ago, me and my friends decided to go for their $28 Sangria Pitcher Wednesday. As it turns out, the deal is only available inside - outside, pitchers are $48 - something we weren't aware of until we got there.  I communicated my frustration on the restaurant's Instagram page, and their account immediately messaged me back with an apology for the miscommunication. They were kind enough to offer a free pitcher to me and my friends the next time we came in.   Tonight we went in to redeem our pitcher, and we were seriously amazed by the customer service we received. The staff had already prepared the pitcher beforehand and seated us in a really nice corner table. They also offered free guac on the house, a surprise that we hadn't been expecting. The staff continued to check up on us throughout the night and were very attentive. We were EXTREMELY impressed to say the least, and we had a fantastic time!  Thanks again for such a great response to my original feedback. El Caballito's concern for their customer experience really shone through their staff tonight - we'll definitely keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Food was incredibly greasy. I felt ill the next day. Margaritas were watered down. Service was friendly but slow. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday night. The ambiance was great, romantic and relaxing. Our server Helena was awesome and on point with her suggestions and menu knowledge. Best part was the food. They did not hold back on the meat for our Beef Brisket Adobo and Spicy Shrimp tacos ! The Chorizo Sausage Chicharron was amazing! All our dishes were filled with so many flavors :) Definitely a happy diner  ! Thank you El Caballito for this experience !"}
{"text":"My friends and dined at El cab this sat night. It's been over a year since I have last been and from what I remember the food was awesome the place was bumping and the service was so so. Not the case this time. Service was beyond terrible we ordered drinks multiple times and on 2 occasions I had to get up and get the drinks from the bar bc I could see them sitting there. We were not offered water, not given cutlery or napkins. We only saw our waitress three times in the 2 hours we were there. The food has gone down hill! The guac was good but the tacos were terrible . The fish was super fish the beef brisket came cold and was so sloppy and over filled and the shrimp was prob the best but nothing to brag about. After we somewhat finished our terrible meal we waited about 20min to get our bill no one could find the waitress! When she finally arrived she gave us the bill and left. We ended up paying in cash and once again could not find the waitress to pay the bill, and being a good citizen I didn't want to leave 300 on the table. Anyways the company is what made my night but I will def not be going back"}
{"text":"Your best bet for tacos & tequila in the Entertainment District. With a freshly opened patio -just in time for Summer -that offers a small selection of tacos & snacks and is the perfect spot to grab a Cerveza or Margarita! (Manny's Margarita will knock your socks off!)  They offer tequila tastings (there's a 3 page tequila list for you tequila connoisseurs) for groups. So if you're looking to plan a birthday or spice up an outing with co-workers this is the place!   Looking for dinner? Grab a sombrero and enjoy the a la carte taco list (tacos range from $4.50-$5.50 each) You can also get a Taco Six pack for $24 or $32 but note it has to be 5 of the same taco, no mixing it up.   Tuesday's you'll get $3.50 tacos. While I usually stick to the Baked Fish Tacos (Macha Marianade, Salsa Cruda, Crispy Leeks, Red cabbage served on a hand made Flour Tortilla) the new Cochinita Pibil (Pork Shoulder, Habanero Sauce, Pickeled Onion) adds a welcome kick to the menu. Mushroom Al Ajillo (Arbol Chili, Ajillo Sauce) & El Poblano (Poblano Pepper, Onions, Cotija Cheese, Crema) are offerings for the vegetarian amigos!  And expect to get serenaded by the Mariachi if you visit on Taco Tuesday!  FREE MIDNIGHT TACOS!! One of my favourite things about this place is that they offer a free taco to all guests at midnight nightly. The free taco is usually the Beef Brisket with an option to switch out for the Poblano for the non meat eaters. Definitely worth sticking around for when you feel like burning the midnight oil.  Drink specials? The $6 Classic Margarita on Mondays & $28 Sangria pitchers on Wednesdays are a sure Summer hit. Just note these special are NOT offered on the patio. So I'd suggest you order at the bar inside and take them out.   The food is always fresh, well seasoned and with authentic flavours. To be honest I miss the 2 person deal that offered choice of Ceviche or Guac to start 4 Tacos (any 4 tacos as long as each party got the same) & 3 pack of Churros to round it off for $25 per person. They should bring it back!"}
{"text":"I hosted a party of 25 here last night and from beginning to end it was an amazing experience! I'm from NYC and planned the event from tree so there were many opportunities for things to go wrong however that never happened.   The manager, extremely courteously, went above and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed and even brought down high hat tables from upstairs to make the room more to what I envisioned before coming in.   Out waitress Alyssa was excellent. She could not have been more friendly and efficient. The Tacos....oh the Tacos!!! They were great, reminded me of trips to San Diego and Hawaii. Margarita Pitchers were generous in Tequila and delicious.    There was a DJ there (Sat nights) who was playing a great mix and many 90s throwbacks which was also fun.   All in All an amazing night. Will definitely return next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Food was good (vegetarian friendly), but not a lot of options to choose from. However there were plenty of different drink choices, and I really liked the overall ambiance."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is what really stood out for me. My husband and I were going to watch Kinky Boots and we wanted something relatively quick but still nice. They gave us a corner booth and we had a lovely experience. Best Sangria that I have ever had! We found the tacos really tasty. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening (around midnight...so I guess Friday morning). The place was large and the lights were pretty dim...it's a nice atmosphere. They seem like they could accommodate larger crowds. Staff were friendly and there is a really nice patio out back...hipster/ reclaimed wood decor. To reach the patio from the front door, you have to go up a flight of stairs so, it may not be very accessible for some...  The tacos tasted ok... 3 tacos for $14.38...the tortillas were about the size of my palm...maybe 4\" diameter...? I would have needed 5-7 of these to feel like I ate a meal. So, the three tacos that I sampled...  Shrimp - 2/5 ...seemed like there was more sauce than shrimp.. Pork Belly - 2/5...diced pork belly...I think the way it was cooked didn't really bring out the flavour of the pork fat... Beef Brisket - 4/5 was my fav. The meat was very moist and flavourful.  I think if you want to hang out and drink, the tapas -style burritos would have been sufficient...if you want to eat something to sustain yourself, I would recommend going elsewhere..."}
{"text":"I celebrated my 30th birthday at El Caballito and it was terrible. I've been there a few times, service always left a lot to be desired and food was just ok, but I'd won a free birthday cake so I thought why not have my bday dinner there?   Nobody ate the cake. I have no idea what the flavours were supposed to be. The cake part itself was like a stale bagel and the icing was literally butter. No one ate it. It even smelled stale. I know it was free, so what should I expect? But I actually expected something edible. It was a real shame.   Then the service. It was sporadic but the worst part was when the bill came. They refused to help my group divide the bill and then tried to tell the last person (my sweet sister) that she owed $60. She had two tacos and a coke. He insisted she owed 60 so my smart friend asked him to please print a receipt that calculated all the payments so far. When he finally did, there was $25 dollars left. He said he didn't say 60. It was so embarrassing and I felt so guilty of putting my friends through that debacle of dividing the bill. And then it got worse.  As we were leaving the waiter took one of my friends aside to tell her he needed a bigger tip and was that going to come from her.   I was so upset my friends were treated like that for coming out to my birthday party.   I have two months left of free guac left from my prize...I'm not even going back for that. Just terrible."}
{"text":"I had my birthday party at El Caballito. Here are my findings:  1. After being exchanging emails with the manager almost a week with very slow response on her end,  the reservation was set to the wrong time.  I specifically requested 7.30pm and the reservation was done for 6:30pm  2. When I arrived to the restaurant I had to wait about 30 minutes to be assigned a table... standing up an no courtesy drinks or anything was offered in the meantime.  3. It came to my attention that another group of people was claiming to have a reservation but there was nothing entered in the system?? I wasn't the only one!   4. At the end of the night the waitress  asked us to leave since the table was reserved for another group.  She looked like she was in a hurry and tried to hurry us up (my guests felt is was a very impolite way)after all what happened to us.  5. When I emailed back the manager with my concerns she never got back to me.   6. Overall food was pricey and not enough...  So sad. I am not coming back or recommend anyone to organize a large party here."}
{"text":"Delicious MKexican food! Amazing guac, great tacos with all homemade tortillas, and great service. James, our server, was extremely accommodating and very friendly. Really love it here and continue to go back!"}
{"text":"Not terrible.  No wow factor to the tacos.  There's better places in town, with less overpriced drinks.  The service was pretty good on a Saturday, and the place was packed.  Decent DJ.  Fun experience, but the food could be better.  What I had:  Salsa tower with Tortilla chips - different levels of spice, no really great flavours.  The servers refilled our chips with fresh baked chips (which were pretty tasty themselves)  Mushroom Al Ajillo - possibly the saltiest taco I've ever eaten.  All I could taste was salt.  If you're vegetarian and thinking this could be your saviour, don't!  Eat beforehand and have some drinks with your friends.  Spicy Chicken Pibil - Decent taco, but most of the flavour came from the pickled onions.  Beef Brisket Adobo - the best of the bunch, but the soft taco shell kept falling apart on me.  Between the cheese and the brisket, I found this a little on the dry side.  Margarita Fresca - this was probably the best part of the experience.  Very refreshing, and a bit on the unique side.  For $13.50, they should have upped the 1.5oz to 2.  Side note: $8 Tecate?  I did not try it, but I'm sure it tastes like, well, Tecate.  It's possibly one of the worst beers, it's super cheap at the LCBO, why $8?  It should be the cheapest beer on the menu.  If you're going to charge higher end prices for beer, why not get a quality Mexican beer like Bohemia or Victoria?"}
{"text":"Went here on Friday for dinner/drinks with a few friends. We weren't that impressed. They have a lot of small tapas type plates that add up in cost really quickly. For somewhere as un-fancy as here, it ends up being pretty expensive. The music is really loud and you can't hear the other people at your table. The food is OK. Margheritas are good.  That being said, it is a \"bar\" so maybe I was in the wrong place. It seems to be a popular place for parties and pre-clubbing crowds.  My husband and I's stomachs weren't feeling so great the next morning either."}
{"text":"In town for a meeting and somehow went there 3 nights in a row with friends who I see once a year (what does that say about me? Haha). Found a good place so didn't bother searching for others. Food was great. No, not a huge menu but they offer a variety of tacos that were creative and excellent. Much better than typical bar food! Guacamole was excellent and a wicked huge variety of tequilas. Ask to see what's on special Thursday and Friday nights. Props to Erin, Adrian, and Nicole. And ask Alexx about his music."}
{"text":"While our server Morgan was GREAT, I'm not sure I would come back to this restaurant. The tacos are overpriced and teeny tiny. The restaurant was extremely busy and our food came out at very odd times resulting in half the group being finished before the other half had even gotten their tacos.   Morgan did an awesome job of accommodating our group (10 people). She managed to split the bills which was no easy feat and was friendly and helpful the whole time."}
{"text":"Really Disappointing. Cute little basement spot with lots of potential but lacking in so many areas.   Went here on a Tuesday for some after work drinks and snacks with a couple girlfriends. We tried the guacamole, michealada, poblano tacos, flank steak taco (by mistake), chicken taco, spicy shrimp and brisket.  Thankfully, Tuesday has a $3.50 per taco deal. If I had paid full price for any of these tacos except the poblano, I'd be angry with myself. Shrimp and black beans were not a good mix, not spicy at all. and the smallest portion I've ever been given at a mexican restaurant. My friends were disappointed in their chicken, brisket and steak. Tortillas fell apart, but that is common with corn. We had not orded a flank steak, but recieved that at no cost by their mistake, instead of the spicy shrimp. Guac was served in a tea cup...that should give you an idea of how measley the portion was.   What everyone else said is true - drinks are overpriced even for King West. Michelada came out a translucent yellow colour?  Service was sporadic and done by more than 3 servers? And what people are saying about checking your bills is good advice - we were charged for that flank steak taco that we had been given by mistake. Overall a very unimpressive dinner and we won't be back."}
{"text":"A can of pop is $4.00 in the can still.  The tacos are very small and a little pricey. (no cilantro, which is my fav)  Churros are tiny too for $4.25 30$ pp for 3 tacos a pop and churros.  OH and its dark as F."}
{"text":"Awesome spot downtown. Only Mexican place in the downtown area that does it right and actually serves authentic fare. Good drinks and food that's actually Mexican and delicious.   Go for the classic Mexico D.F. experience and get the tacos al pastor with a Negra Modelo!"}
{"text":"We had dinner with big family on the NYE 2014-15. Its placed very well in the downtown area. The seating is good, the staff friendly and the ambience great. The drinks are unique and the food is great. As we were over 8, we had to order from the family style menu. We were initially not to keen on it but then how the waitress explained to order it worked out great for all of us and the teenage kids. The churros were also really tasty and we got a lot more of them in a plate as the kids asked for a lot. We are very happy with that."}
{"text":"Went for dinner & drinks on Tuesday (5th night opened).  The bright pink doors is catchy and their light fixtures, private \"nooks\" for groups and the large bar area was was inviting.    After we were seated, the server welcomed us, took my coat for coat check and explained everything on the menu for us.  Wehad to get the futuras mixtas, basically a basket of totoros, taro chips, plaintain and sweet potato chips to go with our guac!  Lovely!  We tried 4/5 tacos available.  Baked pickerel, flank steak and the al pastor and the spicy mushroom.  Baked pickerel was my fave, then the pastor.  They range from $4-$5.5 each and 2-3 will fill you up.  I like the overall ambiance and the tequila bar theme.  You can get bottles of tequila as well, family style.  Can't wait to go back after their official launch!"}
{"text":"I had such a fun time here. The waiter was amazing, he kept checking back with us (very attentive), and he was hilarious. A friend and I went after work/school and had the guacamole and some tacos. They were so good and very filling. We also had the house Margaritas and they were great (on the rocks, not blended which is perfect). It was loud but after a crazy week we were just relaxing and the type of music was fantastic (not thumpy which gives me a headache but fun and makes you want to dance). It was very busy but I could see why, it was a relaxed and fun atmosphere. I would definitely recommend and I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Yes. Eat tacos here. ESPECIALLY on Tuesday. But even if it's a Wednesday still eat here. It's like that show You Gotta Eat Here. I'm the new host and guess what I'm saying? You. Gotta. Eat. Here."}
{"text":"This place has amazing atmosphere and knows how to treat their customers. Karen is awesome behind the bar and Manager James took care of a minor issue (cracked glass) with customer service skills far beyond any service I expected or have ever had in the past. We visited two nights  in a row and WILL be back!"}
{"text":"The service, guacamole, and sangria were good. The churros and tacos were OK.   I'll never understand why these \"fancy\" taco joints (in Toronto) always overload their tacos with unnecessary toppings.   Why. Why? Simple, tasty, and fresh. That's all I want."}
{"text":"Delicious  food. Service was excellent. We stopped here before going to a show at the Royal Alexander theatre. Food and drink was reasonably priced. We had a selection of tacos. The Baja-style fish tacos  were our favourite. We will be back."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The food was flavorless and not cheap. If the food was good, the atmosphere would make this a cool spot. The shots were really nothing to rave about. However, our server Morgan was excellent. This place has so much potential but really needs to improve their food big time!   Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I wanted to like the place but they made it very hard to do so. A bunch of us came here for a friends birthday so I figured they'd pay closer attention to our group...ummm I guess NOT! We ordered a ton of tacos which were all mediocre at best. The Beef Brisket Adobo was the only good one but two big thumbs down on the Flank Steak Asada. It was served so sloppy and dry it made it very difficult to enjoy. The service was absolutely terrible. Our server didn't care enough to remove dirty plates, refill our drinks and the lack of napkins was a pure amateur move. Never ever going back."}
{"text":"the food and service are good. however I didn't like the experience. I went for a birthday and they took our credit card for \" hold\" each account, the restaurant was empty, I dont know why they do that or what they were thinking, to be honest I will not come back"}
{"text":"El Caballito is a great restaurant to go to if you are seeking a fun, traditional Mexican dining experience! The entire restaurant is adorned in Mexican ornaments and in the evenings they often have marichias sing to the tables. It is quite loud however so it's not the best place to go to if you'd like to have a good conversation.  Further, it is a little pricey for what you get. I ordered tacos and paid about $6-8 per taco. They weren't the best I've ever had and were quite small. Moreover, the drinks were nice but nothing crazy.  From what I saw, the crowd mainly consisted of young professionals."}
{"text":"Highly recommend stopping here for beers and tacos! (and roasted corn- DELISH!)  Staff is extremely friendly and attentive. Beautiful patio.  Would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night with a party of 10 for a friend's birthday.  We were generally unimpressed.  The service was the biggest disappointment; each time we needed something, it would take 10-15 mins to be able to order as the waitress would disappear on us and our orders were all mixed up when they came out.  Plus, the waitress seemed exasperated when someone dared ask a question about something on the menu.  Furthermore, the food was on the expensive side for just okay quality and small portions. (The portion sizes were fine for me, but some of the men in the party were left quite unsatisfied.)  The salsa and chips were quite good as was my margarita, but the quesadilla and taco I ordered were a bit too greasy and nothing special.   Unfortunately, the music was so loud that it made it very difficult to have discussions.  I doubt I would ever return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We went to this bar to get our Friday night out started. The ambiance is great however a little loud (they had a DJ playing and our table was somehow pretty close to the DJ's turntable) and dark. We ordered the pork belly and steak adobo tacos and they were good. I don;t think you can have a proper dinner out of those but they were good to eat along with some beers. The service was okay and the bill a little bit high. I think we're maybe going back if it happens that we're near that area."}
{"text":"Walked into a swanky semi lit sit down restaurant with my partner, asked for the patio and was shuffled into a backyard party chaperoned by apathetic blonde plastics. The patio was cornered off by a taco truck and a kitschy bar with Mexican sombreros sitting in a pile on the counter. The music was *insufferably loud*--jersey shore top 40 dubstep, which kind of commanded you to either drink or leave. We were starving so we had decided to just wolf down a pulled brisket and pollo taco. The pollo was the weakest, the al pastor and brisket were more flavourful. At $15 for 3, this is like a more obnoxious Wilbur Mexicana but to their credit the tacos are loaded. No salsa or queso on offer though. Order your own chips and guacamole for $9. TL,DR: this place is for tired office drones and pitbull fans. It's a shame because the food is actually ok but the vibe and service is ostentatiously hotel-pool-party-like"}
{"text":"I tried 3 different types of tacos and liked them all (Fish, Shrimp, Brisket). They were delicious. My only issue from this experience was the slow and disorganized service. I would definitely go back for the food though."}
{"text":"This place is full of atmosphere!  You'd probably walk right by it if you didn't happen to glance down.  It's in a basement/garden spot, lit up by neon light pointing downwards.  We ordered a few different kinds of tacos---seems the shrimp Tacos got the best overall review.  I can't say that it tasted like the best taco I've ever had, but i certainly wasn't mad at it.  The churro ice cream sandwich was heavenly.  Save some room for that!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night at about 9:30 and they had a DJ playing awesome dance music. I felt like I was in someone's basement bar and dancing with a group of people (I say that as a compliment). I'm from the states, so the prices were a little steep, but my guess is it's on part with Toronto. But I have to say this place was a lot of fun. Will go back when I go back to Toronto!"}
{"text":"My friends and I usually visit El Caballito on the weekends when it's a lot busier, but since they have their Taco Tuesday offering with $3.50 tacos, we decided to go on said Tuesday.  Our server was the bartender who was pretty nice and kept our waters filled throughout our time there. The tacos were super yummy, we really enjoyed the baja fish tacos and ordered another helping since they were that good lol.   One hiccup that came up was I had made reservations beforehand just in case it got busy (though they opened at 4:30, I reserved for 4:45). Once we arrived, we were told there would be a wait until 6:45 on our table despite having made the reservation. The place was almost completely empty with small tables taken here and there, which confused us. In the end we just settled for the bar, which pissed us off a bit throughout our time eating considering the entire place was practically empty during our entire time there.   Overall food was good and I definitely recommend coming here for their Taco Tuesday deal!"}
{"text":"This place was okay. The service was excellent, the mid-night taco is a nice idea, everything was clean.   The only thing lacking is flavor. The food and drinks were a bit bland. I felt this place was a bit tacky and i sort of expected some real Mexican vibe and spanish music.   I would recommend this place for a mature group to end a fun filled evening. It has a very relaxing atmosphere to enjoy."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good overall... No stand outs to mention.  Best part about this place is their outdoor upper patio. Feels kinda like you're in Mexico. What a party! There's an outside bar and even like a food truck to sell street foods like Mexican corn. It's first come first serve and fills up quickly.   Like a super crowded communal Mexican patio. Would highly recommend if you don't shy from crowd's!"}
{"text":"Green Light! GO FOR IT! Wenr on a tuesday night and they have Tacos for 3.50! Very good flavours, fresh ingredients, some tacos better than others but very good mexican experience in Toronto! The place is cured in details in creating a mystical mexican vibe, a little bit DIA DE LOS MUERTOS, with melted candles around and tarot cards hanging on the wall. Margaritqs, Tequila y Soda...yo get easily drunk;-)"}
{"text":"Dinner on thé patio  Overall : 3.75/5  Food: 4/5 What we ordered: guacamole, fish/pork/chicken tacos. All were delicious. Heard good things about their selection of tequila selection and Margaritas.  Ambiance & service: Wurst style (on the patio) for Tacos. Crowd is mostly the scenester type.   Value: 3.5/5 on avg $5for a taco seems a bit high for this setting.  Repeat: likely. Would like to try their Resto."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food, love their pablano queso dip! Tacos are small but good, really enjoyed their shrimp tacos. Beverage wise, margarita selection is great and a great red sangria. Love that their food is great on a consistent basis as well"}
{"text":"Really cool vibe happening here. Originally, my friend was going to take us to El Patio, which is essentially at the back of the restaurant, but it was cold and windy that day so the patio wasn't set up. Nonetheless, we opted to go indoors and were pleasantly surprised. It's like a club vibe, but there was a mariachi band setting the mood before they put back on the music. Both were cool. The tacos were great! Very flavorful and a great variety of ingredients. This is an awesome place to enjoy some food, chill vibes, hang out with friends. Be prepared to get your hands messy :)"}
{"text":"Update* shout out to our amazing waitress from last night. Didn't get her name. We were the most difficult table of all time. Gluten free. Vegetarian. Peanut free. One didn't like cilantro. Once hated spice. We asked every question about every single thing. She didn't flinch once and handled us so well, and we really pushed her. Thanks for being so accommodating and smiling through our q's."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday for Taco Tuesdays. I found the fillings were a little too much for the wrap. I found the mushroom tacos underwhelming. But I especially liked the Maja and shrimp tacos. In addition, their churros were a little hard but still delicious. We didn't get a chance to try the tequila but the Margaritas were pretty strong, which is great in my opinion.   Also, make sure to make reservations in order to get a table!"}
{"text":"I always go here for taco Tuesday. I've tried the chicken, the beef brisket, the pulled pork, and the pork belly. They are all super delicious, and I'm lactose intolerant so I don't even get them with cheese but they are all still super delicious. I will say, though, that their drinks are hugely overpriced. The tiniest of sangrias for almost $10, but hey I guess this is downtown Toronto. The atmosphere is pretty fun and all the servers I've had thus far are super friendly. All in all, a great time at El Caballito!"}
{"text":"The back \"patio\" is a free for all when it comes to seating. A little structure and an organized line would go a long way so people are not asking everyone if they are leaving anytime soon. Have had the tacos a few times, and they are ok. Definitely have had better in town. Chips and quac are really good, it's probably the best item in the menu."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem.   Our visit after work on Friday was great. The interior is gorgeous. Dark and sexy - not everyone's cup of tea, but it makes for a great atmosphere.   The hostesses were wonderful and promptly took our coats to check them - for free. Service is a bit spotty, but as is expected with any new spot. Drinks are fantastic and go down way too easy. They aren't kidding when they say Tequila/Soda blows Vodka/Soda out of the water. I'm totally hooked. Drinks are a bit pricey, but I think that comes with the location - right across the street from Roy Thompson Hall.   Above all else though, the food is unreal. Playa Cabana, La Carnita, Milagro, El Catrin - all simply can't compare to the quality and taste at El Caballito. Truly authentic. The home made salsa tower is so addictive we had two. Guacamole was to perfection - although the portion seemed a little small. The Flank Steak Taco and the El Pastor Taco are spectacular. The menu is limited, but I was told that it will be expanding over time.   The manager came over to ask us how everything was and told us of the patio coming in the spring with a full BBQ kitchen outside. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I have had better service, food and experience at Wendy's than I did here and for a third of the price. I was in such shock and dismay I couldn't even complain because... where the heck would I even start?!   I ordered a Michaela... okay ,no biggie,. A drink I know well and always order from Mexican Restaurants, as it's quite possibly my favorite beverage ever. It was served to me, in a celery salted, rimmed pint glass, with about a shot of Clamato juice sitting pathetically at the bottom. No additional sauces or spices, with a can of beer served on the side. I called the Waitress over who clearly has never saw a proper Michaela and sent it back asking for more Clamato, ice- or anything really. It came to a point where I had to go to the bar myself and try to explain what exactly a Michaela was to the (new) bartender.   As all of this nonsense was going on our chips, taro chips and guac was brought to the table. All I can say is that the GUAC HAD ICE CHIPS IN IT. Meaning, not fresh, pre-made and uneatable in my opinion. Tasteless. I had to use force to break the chips, FORCE. I think I worked for my drink hard enough that I shouldn't have to use force to actually eat.   Next came the fish tacos. The fish was about the size of my fist therefore; even with my big mouth, I had to eat with a fork. Also, it didn't help that the tortilla portion was microwaved to the sheet it was served on so that was no help any way.   With all this uneaten food for two people the waitress happily, skipped over, cleared our table and handed us the bill with no questioning if we liked it (we hated it) and if we wanted anything else (we didn't). In fact, we didn't even ask for the bill.   With all the EXCEPTIONAL Mexican Restaurants in Toronto and even in that area don't bother paying King West's prices for something that is going to make you physically sick and ruin your night and even go as far as momentarily turning you off of the beautiful cuisine of Mexican Food in general."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed in El Caballito Tequila Bar.  First of all, this bar is DARK; it's-I-can't-see-the-person-at-the-end-of-the-table dark. I know it's a basement space, but it's a bit much.  In terms of drinks, the Manny's Margarita was a stand-out, but overall everything is overpriced. I guess I should have seen this coming given the tourist trap location.  As expected, the tacos are pretty tasty, but, like the drinks, also overpriced. The flank steak taco was my favourite.  Overall, I enjoyed the experience, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this bar."}
{"text":"Haven't had tacos for a while, and decided to come since they had a Tuesday special for tacos that day.   Ambience is nice. It's the usual casual setting: dark, rowdy and cosy.  $3.50 for all and any type of tacos. We tried the trout tacos, pulled pork tacos and the shrimp taco. If you're not a fan of beans in your shrimp taco, you can ask to have them held and they will gladly do so.   The tacos themselves were pretty good. I like them better than la Carnita as these tacos at El Caballito don't break apart due to the sogginess from the sauces. I especially liked the trout and pulled pork tacos but a slight complaint that the quality of tacos vary depending on luck on how fresh the tacos are. We ordered 2 rounds of tacos... the second round was amazing and we could tell that they were freshly made. The trout was crispy and warm and the pulled pork was generously given. A sign of a good restaurant is that all items should come out the same.  We also tried the Chicharron. ($12.50) It's a plate of melted cheese with meat toppings with tortillas on the side. We opted for sausage as topping. This dish was good but only because its literally a pile of melted cheese and who doesn't like cheese? Essentially, its a cheese taco that you make yourself. I wouldn't get this again, and I don't recommend this dish at all.  Oh and be careful that they have two menus. One for indoors dining and one for outdoors dining. The outdoors menu contains Mexican street corn which if you google it, looks amazing. It's super silly that they have separate menus as I was really looking forward to the corn.   3.5/5. The tacos are good, so only come here for that. Come in the summer for the corn as well."}
{"text":"Just because you think your trendy doesn't mean you can get away with serving me half sized tacos. $18 for a tequila shot? Wtf is this? I've eaten better butt butt holes."}
{"text":"The service was amazing!  Thanks to Nicole - our Tequila Master - we were able to enjoy our cocktails before dinner and learn much about the Tequila being poured!  Tables are very cramped so you get to meet your neighbours :-)  ... Food was good - the ribs are extraordinary!  The sauce was spicy and not too sweet - a little too much on the smashed potato that came with it - but still really yummy.  Tacos were excellent with the exception of the beef brisket - which tasted a bit dodgy and was promptly removed from the bill.  No problem - great service and fun atmosphere!  It was a good evening!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Good location, but be weary, it's in the middle of tourist-King-Street, and as a local, sometimes the overpriced flashy nature can make your head spin.  Service was a little overly friendly as such, but that is always better than the alternative.  We sat at the bar, the place was pretty busy by 6 pm.  Drink was good, not the best margarita I've ever had, but tasty.  I didn't eat anything, so I can't give it more stars, I'd need to go back.  And I will, the menu intrigued me, and the space was cool."}
{"text":"The decor of this place is very chique. It creates a very nice vibe. I was there for an event and was not disappointed! The service was very friendly and location can't be beat."}
{"text":"Honestly if you are thinking of celebrating you birthday.... Think again.  1. Fixed menu and everyone has to eat the same 4 types of tacos 2. Bill can only be split into 4 ways 3. Very little flexibility with special cases  4. Service is late, food come in batches, it is mostly cold and the taste has actually gone down.  Dont think ill be coming back again..."}
{"text":"We discovered this place when they were at Taco Fest, and finally tried them out tonight. Sat on the amazing back patio......you order your food and drinks at the bar, and they are served to your table. Love the bar in a shipping container, and the real food truck doing the food prep! For inside they have a real kitchen, I think....I think we passed it on our way through...... Food was AWESOME. Taco night, so discounted. Great taste combinations. Fabulous pitcher of margaritas. Only comment......so.....no one is taking out orders and watching our needs, yet at the bar, the tipping options on the machine START at 20%? Ummm................ A little cheeky :P"}
{"text":"After a fabulous Elite event thrown by our awesome CM, Evelyn, I decided to bring my cousin here for some Tacos and Tequila. We were not disappointed!  We ordered the Mediana menu and some Margaritas.  I like the set menu because you get a chance to try a bit of everything without having to make a lot of decisions. The value was quite good at $24 per person.  The chips and guac were delicious. I like the plantain and tarot chips, but I will admit that I do miss having plain tortilla chips and I think they'd be dynamite here because they make all their tortillas in house and you can tell the difference. They're some of the best I've had since Mexico!  The Panucho de Pibil was a yummy little bundle of meaty goodness with nice pastry, topped with salsa verde and shredded lettuce.  All of the tacos that came out were fabulous with my favourite being the flank steak. Meat was juicy and tender with really great seasonings. The Molote de Tinga was done with some nice hot haberneros that added as much flavour to the meat as they did heat.  Service was A+. Everyone who came to the table was friendly and attentive. This was also something that I was impressed with at the Elite event, but it proved consistent on a second visit.  Yes, it's dark. But it's a basement and it wasn't really all that dark until later in the evening. I thought it added to the cavernous feeling that makes this place so unique. I wouldn't hesitate to make another visit or to bring a large group of people here for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend after work, backyard patio is great. Had an issue with my food and the manager immediately came out and apologized and gave us another round of drinks. Great customer service, above any expectations. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The manager is amazing, super friendly. Chad is the best server ever, we've had him the three times we've gone. Shrimp.taco is delish and drinks are great. Guac and chips is overpriced and underwhelming.  Everything else is good"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I am not a fan of going anywhere in the core but as a person with celiac when I hear of new Mexican joints I get googly-eyed and all other judgments flop.  When I got there, I didn't even realize I had as there was no obvious signage (that I could remember). It was a cute hole in the wall, which is what we are all looking for, right? You walk in and it's quite dark with some hot pink accents throughout.  We were greeted by a very friendly host and since we were 8:00 walk-ins we were offered a seat at the bar. I had no idea it would be so busy as it was quite new, but word gets out fast when there's a new taqueria in town.   There is coat check which I was pleasantly surprised by. Either they learned from Momofuku's mistake or they are trying to create a lounge feel. I believe it is both as the restaurant has large booths to fit at least 10 people and offers bottle service.  Our seat at the bar was great, our server was very friendly and had some awesome suggestions for us.   Food & Drink - Manny's Margarita: our server told us it was the most popular. I loved it except I think I glassed over the peppercorns listed on the drink. It was still great and definitely gave it a kick.  - Blondie: Loved the top part, but the bottom had what I thought was blue curacao but it's not listed on the drink (not a fan).  - Chips & Fresh Salsa: loved this because it came in a perfect portion size - sometimes you are given way to many chips for the dip. The salsas come in a tower of 4 starting from mild all the way to hot. I think I can handle hot but this top 'salsa' may as well have been ground chili peppers...I still loved it:) The salsa verde is what I was stuck on.  - Flank steak taco: HOLY MOLY. This was fantastic. I am not quite sure what made it so amazing but it was to die for. It came piping hot, I had to wait for it to cool which only made me love it more because I love knowing food has come right off the stove!!! It was falling apart as I ate it but they are smart and give you the taco on top a thin paper on a tiny plate. I obviously took advantage to use this as a facilitator and lose as little food as possible.  What I loved in general is that I felt it was really focused on actually getting authentic food....not just presentation and frills. Seriously I cannot remember the last time I got food at a restaurant that was so hot I had to wait to eat it.   I pretty much fell in love with the cute little place. We got there are at 8 and it looked like a nice dinner crowd but by the time we left at 10 it was more of a bar/lounge with people mingling and the dj booth getting setup. I'll definitely be back for a longer night there!!!"}
{"text":"**Update to a review I wrote previously.  This place is trying to move away from being a restaurant to being more of a tequila bar. So while their drink menu expands, their food menu has decreased and it's not much of a meal place anymore. The things that I absolutely loved from the menu when I visited for the first time, are now gone.  I'm kinda sad about this transition."}
{"text":"Has deteriorated from mediocre to meh (at best). Blah tacos; expensive guac and chips (not fresh); weird service and blaring beats instead of live music as expected."}
{"text":"Manny is a class act! This guy belongs in this business. First and not the last time I come here."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. Tacos are good but overpriced for what you get. Beer is SUPER expensive even for king west! Overall I would not return. $100 + tip for a few tacos and beer?? Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends here. Let me start by saying that El Caballito is more of a bar setting, that just so happens to have pretty damn fantastic food.  On to the eats. We started with a chicharron for an appetizer. (A crispy pastry topped with salsa, sour cream, cottage cheese, and beef brisket.) This was definitely not something that I had had before, but I loved it! To compare the pastry to something familiar, think of a not cheap tasting version of Bugles. Your childhood will thank you :) For the main course we had an assortment of their various creative tacos. They were all really good, but the killers were the Spicy Shrimp, and another that had a filling with a crisp exterior and soft interior. (I think it was called rajas poblanas...)  I would definitely go back. I just wish the servings were bigger, but I guess that's what you get for going to a bar."}
{"text":"What a great time was had at El Caballito. The tequila was flowing at the Yelp party last month! The tasty, potent margaritas and flavourful chicken tacos were complimented perfectly by the very friendly and attentive staff. I truly enjoyed the underground atmosphere at El Caballito and will definitely be back to try some more of their menu items and may be easily convinced to try a few more margaritas."}
{"text":"Went once when it was fairly recently opened. The tacos and drinks were good. I was not blown away but not disappointed either. Would go back again to try though.   Service was pretty quick and located conveniently on king west. Suggest trying it once for sure."}
{"text":"Mi lugar favorito para comer tacos en Toronto y tomar margaritas. Cada vez que voy me gusta más. Margarita Rose es mi favorita.  Excelente servicio al cliente, todos son súper amables.  El mejor taco en mi opinión es el vegetariano (Rajas poblanas o mejor conocido como \"poblano\").  Lo único es que últimamente me parece que el sabor de las bebidas no es constante, supongo que no tienen medidas exactas para prepararlos.  Desde hace más de 6 meses tienen una parte del techo roto que gotea a una mesa y tienen un tobo en medio del restaurante para recoger el agua. Me pregunto si es demasiado difícil acomodar la tubería rota y así los clientes no tenemos que lidiar con el agua que cae del techo."}
{"text":"I went to El Caballito on Friday night. The food took about 1.5 hours to come (the waitress clearly forgot to punch in our order), I asked for more water which never came and I asked for more chips which also never came. I was very frustrated and probably would have never returned (even though we clearly just had in incompetent waitress). BUT at the end of the meal, I asked to speak to the manager. He was GREAT! I expected a small discount or something free but to my surprise, he comped our WHOLE meal ... and there were 6 of us!!  This took me by surprise. Great customer service.  Despite the mishap at first, the food was unbelievable and all ended well.  Dear manager who was working this Friday evening, you know what it means to give great customer service. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"For drinks and for a tequila bar, this place is amazing! From the neon pink sign to the dark stairs going down to the basement, I was a tad skeptical, especially given how I hate the dark. Instead, I was welcome with the cutest and most lively restaurant/bar full of people wearing sombreros!   My friends and I were pleasantly or unpleasantly surprised when we ordered shots and weren't given lime or salt. When we asked for them, the server almost seemed offended! He told us that with good tequila, you should sip it slowly and there's no need to throw the shot back and ...he wasn't wrong. It went down really smooth and we even ordered the cheapest tequila.   As for their food, I had some tacos and was not a huge fan. The ones I ordered did not have a lot of filling and the corn tortillas were crumbled very easily when folded. They tasted healthier than normal tortillas, but I'd rather take the unhealthy route."}
{"text":"While the fish taco was still in my mouth, I was thinking ~3 stars. Food and drinks are fine, albeit overpriced. Appetizers were probably the highlight of the meal. Music will drive you insane. But if you have to eat in the area and there's a special (namely Taco Tuesday) going on, it's good.*  *Minus the churros, which I nearly broke a tooth on.  The SERRRIVCE though! No. Not the servers necessarily, who are probably doing as instructed. Mandatory prix-fixe for tables of 8+ was annoying, especially since they limit you to 4 taco varieties, which is not great for groups since more people = more different wants and dietary restrictions. Obviously. But on top of that, paying the $520+tip bill (not Taco Tuesday, obviously) was a pain in the trasero.  Can we get separate bills? \"No.\" Oh...can we split it? \"I can split the bill a maximum of 4 ways.\" Uhh...can the couples, you know, couple off? \"The computer literally won't allow me to do it like that.\" Can we just pass around the credit card machine? \"No, I'm serving another table and it would take forever to go around.\" No, it really wouldn't. Actually, it's taking longer for us to discuss this.  We finally assigned amongst ourselves the \"payors\" of the group only to be brought bills divided exactly by 4...which doesn't really help an odd-numbered group, does it?  EL CAB!!! It's 2015. Your computer can do it! Is it a computer-shaped tortilla? You run a restaurant, you serve groups, your menu is expensive, you accept credit cards - please just deal with whatever negligible fees you're incurring as a cost of the business and allow your customers to pay you $600 how they want to pay you.  P.S. Love the taro chips + guac!  P.P.S. There's a fake 5-star review from the business on this page."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out for awhile and I'm so glad I finally did! My friends and I, came here on a Friday night.The place is crazy busy but we didn't have to wait long for a table at all, I would say 5 mins or so.   The music is really loud but crazy good! They play a lot of hip hop, R&B, old school jams. I would not recommend this place on a first date or an intimate date, since it can get pretty loud and rowdy.   The food is delicious and the drinks are super strong. A HUGE shout out to our awesome server. He came to our table and said, \"you guys are my best table, here you go\" and gave us free tequila shots! Thank you sir from Montreal, you are too kind.  Overall great music, yummy food and delicious drinks. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to unwind and have a good time."}
{"text":"What is better than tacos and tequila? Sex, probably. But other than that probably not much else. Who knew Canada would be home to a bar that masters this classic Mexican pairing. Asad and Stefan knew, and they threw it my way.   We started off ordering two GIANT pitchers of spicy picante margarita (because you know, we just wanted a low key night). This turned out to be a great idea and we all got pretty lubed up for what was to come next- los tacos. I ordered chicken, pork, and pork belly tacos, the last of which was an encounter of the third kind. Simply mesmerizing.  The only downside  was that I had to order the tacos a la carte because they were three different kinds. The difference in price wasn't huge but it would be nice for people to be able to try multiple kinds of tacos instead of just say chicken for example.   We can only expect to find more of these kinds of places popping up in Canada as Mexicans living in the United States make a mad dash for our friendlier, more tolerant neighbors to the North. I for one can't wait to join them."}
{"text":"Found myself back in the area on a Friday night and this place looked promising.  Ordered the chips and guacamole & salsa to start.  The chips were various fried starchy root veggies such as plantains, yuca and taro.  The chips were non greasy and held the guacamole and salsas nicely.  Guacamole portion was small...approx 1/2 cup but very flavorful.  Taco's ordered were the pulled chicken, and baked fish.   Both were outstanding and you could tell the masa was freshly prepared. Tacos come nicely garnished--the fried leeks on the fish taco were delicious.   Prices per taco range from $4.50-$5.00 they are small so one person could easily eat 2-3.  Tried the classic 'rita with Don Julio for $10.00 it was just ok.  Service was great, our server was very attentive."}
{"text":"Visited Fri Sept 22 for dinner.  This place is normally very busy, make a reservation in advance. Our server Chad Vince was amazing and took the time to explain items. Very friendly as well.   Pros Ordered these five tacos: chicken, brisket adobo, baja fish, cochinita and spicy shrimp and all were very good.   Cons $9.50 for chips and guac a bit pricy IMHO. The guac is made fresh daily.  Music and atmosphere a bit loud.  Entrance was way too dark.  $5 for a small taco is not good value IMHO, most could get eaten in 2 or 3 bites. The tacos should be a bit larger or reduce the prices.   Protip - You need to ask for the free taco every night at midnight.   Damage - $39 includes tax, pre-tip."}
{"text":"We were out looking for a late night meal and being right downtown there wasn't a ton of variety, but El Caballito was right across the park from where we were staying and it was open until 1 and wasn't fast food, so it met the bill. It's a pretty cool place when you walk downstairs. It has a great bar and by the looks of it, a great tequila tasting room. There's also a great outdoor patio in the back that gets really busy after midnight. Good drinks, awesome service and the food, although not the best tacos I've had, certainly fed our appetite and left us happy and content. Also, there was an awesome DJ the night we were there."}
{"text":"This place is best described as \"a bar with really good food.\"  I was invited to a media preview of El Caballito and we had a small sampling of their food menu.  The space formerly housed Baroote's; while it is a subterranean space it makes you feel like you're on the streets of Mexico with the cozy and welcoming decor.  The DJ was spinning salsa-fied versions of Coldplay... yeah, apparently it's possible.    But perhaps the most unique factor is their tequila tasting.  The private tasting room accommodates 4 at a time with Manny, who takes his tequila as seriously as a sushi chef takes his rice.  If your run-ins with tequila involve pounding it back and licking the salt off your hand - this isn't for you.   All bookings go through Manny, where he will tailor a tequila tasting suited to your tastes (he will ask you about your wine and beer preferences).  Everything from the way he pours the tequila into the glass to the way he explains it makes the experience amazing.  After wet-napping your hands, he will first tell you to touch the tequila (what do you feel?); then swirl it around for a minute or so (look at the legs); then smell it; then take a small sip, then another, then another, then another.  I learned that tequila has over 300 flavors and 200 aromas, which is why pounding it back college-day style makes you go all Buckley's face (there's simply too many flavors hitting you all at once which = overwhelmed).  Unlike wine or beer, every sip is different.  The first sip you get the heat; the second sip you get more caramel and the third sip was peppery.  It was an amazing experience.  Okay okay, enough about the tequila, how was the food?  My personal favorite was the Jalapeño Relleno ($4.75); the perfect mingling of spicy, sweet and tangy.  It was truly delicious.  My second favorite dish was the Tamarind Ceviche which used thin slices of jicama as the taco \"shell.\"  It was made from cod and mixed with mango + coriander.  The citrus didn't overwhelm like most ceviches I've had and again, the perfect mingling of spicy, sweet and tangy.    Drinks-wise, other than booking the tequila tasting, definitely go for the Polanco - mezcal, Lillet, Drambuie + plum bitters.  It was so aromatic and the taste was subtle but delicious.  A great drink for sipping because you wouldn't want to rush through it.  You'd lose all the aromas and flavors.  Happy hour is from 4-6 featuring different daily specials.  Check their website for details.  A place that's a great spot for a fun date night and definitely a great spot to go with a crowd.  This might just be my new favorite Mexican joint in town.  They don't make the BEST tacos in town, but the combo of ambiance, drinks, food and service make it a go-to spot!  The upper level will be opening up later this year under the name Los Colibris; an upscale Mexican restaurant.  Can't wait to come back when the weather is nicer - there's a patio out back!   *Meal was complimentary but opinions, as always are genuinely my own*"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a badass secret patio, great sangria, and a cool street food atmosphere, El Caballito is great. Great spot to meet up after work and split a Sangria pitcher or two. Highly recommend checking out some of their Mexcian Street Corn or their Churro Ice Cream sandwich.   I'm still drooling thinking about it."}
{"text":"This was a pretty decent taco restaurant on King West but I would give this one an average rating  AMBIENCE: perfect for a romantic date night as the restaurant is pretty dark and lit with candles at each table. It was also pretty loud especially on a Friday night so you might find yourself speaker louder than usual.  FOOD: tacos were decent depending which one you get; O ordered the spicy shrimp taco which was delicious but then the beef brisket taco was medicore, lacked flavour and all the ingredients were falling out of the taco. You'll need to order at least 2-3 tacos if you go hungry and expect to pay min $10-15 just on tacos because they were $5 each.  DRINKS: since this was a tequila bar, i'll have to commend them on this part as the tequila drink were pretty smooth and tasteful considering im not a tequila drinker.  SERVICE: our server was friendly and very attentive  Overall, this was an average experience."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Great atmosphere and great service - .5  I went on a Friday evening with my friend. It was our first time there and our lovely waiter walked through the menu. We both ordered a margarita Rosa which according to the waiter is the sweetest drink on the menu. But it wasn't to me lol..it was pretty strong.  The tacos are a bit underwhelming IMO, they don't fill up the taco. I ordered the spicy shrimp and the pork belly taco. My pork belly taco fell apart when I tried to eat it so that sucks. The meat was also a bit dry. However, I enjoyed the spicy shrimp a lot and it had a nice kick to it!   We also shared a basket of taro chips with guacamole... The guacamole is a bit spicy but I loved the taro chips they provided! Anyways, I think I do prefer la carnita a little more but if you're in the area..you can give this place a try!"}
{"text":"There's quite a number of Mexican restaurants opening up now, so quality needs to be high to compete.  El Cabalitto does a decent job and tries to differentiate themselves, although maybe a little too much.    Rather than the usual nachos, they serve a combination of plantains, sweet potato, totopos and taro chips.  I would have  preferred some regular corn chips as well, but I welcomed the change.  I didn't like being charged $4 for the salsas though.  They also change up the tortillas in the tacos, which each have different textures and ingredients.  Some interesting takes on margaritas as well."}
{"text":"Never got approached by a single waiter, 30 minutes after being seated. In addition had to inform the staff that there were empty free tables after being put in queue."}
{"text":"Went to El caballito last night to catch up with a friend as we both really enjoy Mexican, and it was an easy commute for both of us.  Review broken down into three parts: Atmosphere, Service, Food.   Atmosphere: 4/5 El Caballito's basement setting is dark and sexy - a nice combination of hipster and class district. Dim lighting, edged with red Christmas lights and candles whispered young and trendy to me. At some point, a live DJ came in, spinning pseudo Latin hits (think: pitbull)- fun, I guess, but playing the same tracks over and over has got to make you wonder if putting a play list on shuffle would have done the same thing.   Service: 2.5/5  I got there first, and was seated at a table for 6+ (although there were tables for 2 and 4 further back in the restaurant, and I told the hostesses that there would only be two of us, with maybe a third joining later). When the server came by, I asked if I could, or should, move to a smaller table at the back, to which she looked shocked, and said it'd be really out of the way...  So, I relented and stayed at my giant table.  In the (literally) 4 [FOUR!] minutes it took for my friend to arrive, I was asked if I wanted a drink three separate times by 2 different people.  Friend arrives- and before she even takes off her coat, the server comes to ask us if we wanted drinks. (\"no, please give us a minute\")  Friend sits, and we peruse the menu. Server stops again to ask for orders (\"no, we'll let you know...\").   Server stops to talk to another table- comes back to ask. (\"margaritas, please\").  After we get out margaritas, and the after several (I think I counted three) stop bys by our server, we got the salsa tower and chips. Not even half way through our mini bucket of chips, we were repeatedly asked if we wanted to order food. Repeatedly.  Friend and I wanted to try to tacos- so ordered one each, and a knife to split. The server raised her eyebrows (not necessarily in a rude way, but as to say: are you sure?). Smiled wide, and walked away. Tacos came shortly after, and I instantly understood the eyebrow raise.   Now, you might be a little exasperated at this point, reading about how often our server came by- which makes my point! The constant hovering of the staff made it difficult to enjoy our conversation.  On a couple occasions, when our server WASN'T hovering, a serious-looking, but friendly man came by to check on us (to which our server would come running back).   When settling our bill, our server awkwardly counted on our change right onto the table while Friend and I continued to chat. I don't think this alone would have affected my opinion... but it was awkward.   Overall, the service wasn't BAD... it was strange: with the constant need to impress and hovering around our table, I wasn't sure if I should have felt bad for her or annoyed.  Food: [Taste: 5/5; value 2/5] Ah, the good stuff!  The food here is undoubtedly delicious.  Started with classic margarita (~$9). Served over crushed ice, they were poured strong, and the perfect combination of sweet, tart and boozy delicious.  Salsa tower, served with mixed chips (~$4.25?), will likely be the only food I get if I come back here. Chips were made of plantains, taro and sweet potatoes, not too salty with a brilliant crunch. Amazing!  Flank steak taco (~$4.50). So good, but so TINY. (Hence the aforementioned eyebrow raise). Seriously tiny. Think the circumference of a mini cupcake: tiny. maybe 1 oz of flank steak... That being said, it burst with flavour, the meat was lean and tender, and the soft shell held in all the piping hot juices.    Mushroom taco (~$4.25). Amazing flavour, but again, same size as the flank steak: a one-biter. Softer and tender, with a really unique taco shell, I wish it were bigger!  Churros (~$4.50): served three to a glass half filled with some sort of pastry cream, these little bites were great. Crispy and light cinnamon sugar danced on my tongue while the pastry cream thing brought some weight to the dessert. Oddly refreshing, had I known, I would have gotten my own instead of sharing!  All in all, delicious, but very very pricey. I'm glad I had nibbled at work before hand, otherwise I would have left El Cabillito broke, or starving.   I think I'd come back to meet friends for a drink... but not for dinner. I'd like to see better values for the tacos (if they are indeed to focus on the food aspect of the restaurant, rather than just being a really good bar, with food as a footnote). It'll be interesting to see how they do in the upcoming months."}
{"text":"The place has a sweet patio in the back, which is like a hidden little gem and is the reason why it's getting 4 stars from me. The actual restaurant itself isn't anything special, it's quite dark inside and there are limited seats if you're with a large group. If you're in the area, definitely give this place a try just for its patio. Bonus: they have sombreros readily available in the patio area if you ask for them! There's also maracas, so why would you want to sit somewhere else?   They do have a good selection of tacos, ranging from chicken to rainbow trout. The portions are quite small though, so I would recommend ordering a few especially if you're hungry! The first time I came, service was quite bad, it took them almost 1 hour to bring us our food. However the second time, when I was seated in patio, everything was served up within minutes.   They also don't skimp on the alcohol in their mixed drinks, so definitely worth the $$.   It's a great place to go after work for drinks or a quick bite to eat, just make sure you head to their patio, otherwise you might be disappointed."}
{"text":"We came here for drinks on a Wednesday. It got pretty busy later in the night. It's probably not the best place for groups larger than 5 or 6 people.    There was a special on Wednesday if you buy Modelo Especial for about $8, you get a taco for a $1 which isn't too bad. The taco was pretty good.   As for the classic margarita, it isn't too bad. You can barely taste the alcohol and it goes down smoothly. It's pretty good to share.    The service was prompt. They also give out Sombreros on request."}
{"text":"The greetings were pleasant when we arrived. Our coats were hung up and we were seated a table. We were just there for drinks so a table wasn't ideal but we were told that the bar was full. Felt a bit pressured to order food (because we were at a table) but we weren't that hungry so we got some guacamole. It was great!   The drinks were OK but for $13, I expected more than a \"Canadian\" shot (i.e. a single one). The margarita was fine but a tad sweet for my taste and I couldn't really taste any tequila at all....at a TEQUILA bar. They could work on their drinks.  Finally, it was dark. Too dark. We couldn't read the menu which was only lit by a tiny candle. On our way out, there was no one at the coat check....so we got our own coats.  The ambiance is otherwise great. The space is semi-underground, cave-style with great salsa tunes toward the end of the night. The server was very friendly. Overall, it definitely caters to the Entertainment district crowd."}
{"text":"Okay, so this place is definitely more of a bar to hang out, rather than a sit down place to eat.  That's the impression I got anyway and unfortunately, I was not drinking the night I went to El Caballito - possibly a better experience if I were too inebriated to care what I was paying for. I'll start with the server though. He was very kind and super attentive. I feel bad leaving such a poor review because he was definitely chill and I bet the other people that work there are just as nice, but El Caballito, you definitely failed to satisfy my hunger.   My SO and I were at a convention and were super hungry, we stumbled upon this place thinking \"tacos? yes\". Right when we went down the stairs we heard very bass-heavy dance music. This didn't bother me, what did bother me though were the tacos. The thing is, the menu outlined different types of tacos - chicken, pulled pork and others that sounded equally as delicious. They have an option for single and triple, so naturally, both my SO and I ordered a triple thinking these tacos were going to be massive or at least a good three bites each - and we were going to devour it all :).  My thoughts were \"12-17 dollars for three tacos? That's reasonable\", however, these tacos are so small. SO SMALL. I looked down at the plate of six, very small, possibly 3 inch tortillas with maybe a 1 1/2 tablespoon amount of filling. I could eat one of those in one bite. I thought only one of our plates had arrived, but no... that was it. Taco Bell has bigger tacos, man. They were good, I'm not going to deny that, but come on, do people not care about the size of these things? Am I crazy?I didn't take a picture because my phone had died, but if you've been there sober, you should know what I'm talking about.  My SO was very, very disappointed and so was I. When our bill came to $30+ it was definitely not worth it. We were still hungry after that $30 overpriced snack, that we went back to the convention and gorged on street meat from a food truck. $7 dollars for a burger and fries that actually satisfied our hunger vs. $30+ for 3 measly bite sized tacos :(  Bottom line: Come here for drinks, the night life possibly, but not for food...unless you want to pay $30+ for bite sized tacos."}
{"text":"It was my first time here but I really like the whole concept of it. It's a basement like atmosphere, pretty dark, super loud music, and lots of tequila. Definitely not a place you go to for nice conversation because you literally have to scream over the music. It's more of a club atmosphere just without the dancing and with food instead.   To eat I tried the shrimp tacos which were unfortunately really gross--they had absolutely no taste to them but I was starving so I downed them anyways. The baja-style tacos on the other hand, were very delicious. To drink we got a pitcher of Margarita Rosa which wasn't gross but didn't taste like how I expected it to (our waiter described it as a sweet drink but it just tasted like tequila drowned with a splash of juice to me). For dessert I got the churro ice cream sandwich which was honestly to die for! I could've eaten like three of those. Definitely not enough to share though so make sure you order your own.   Overall, I've definitely had better tacos but I definitely would be interested in coming back for drinks and to try the other food on the menu."}
{"text":"Their pico de gallo is spicy! I love their taro chips. The tacos are also deceivingly filling. I ordered three, one chicken tinga and two pork conchinita, and was underwhelmed when they arrived at my table. They looked tiny. But while you are eating it you suddenly become aware of how packed they are with meat! Then it hits you that you are full. I was so convinced I was going to have room for dessert (ice cream and churros!) -_-  Prices are pretty good considering the area of Toronto it's in."}
{"text":"The patio was great fun on a Friday night. I met some new friends and ate killer conchinita pibil."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Toronto on King St. West for good food and tacos! The place is a bit hidden away as the restaurant is located underground so you can miss it when passing by on King Street. We made reservations but it wasn't too busy when we arrived. We all ordered drinks and tacos as I've heard this place makes great tacos. We waited a little longer as the kitchen was a bit backed up. We finally got our tacos. Our server messed up our order with different tacos coming to our table but he was able to rectify the problem with the complimentary tacos and getting our order right moments after.I ordered 4 tacos and each would cost about $5-$7 each. I ordered 2 baja fish, 1 beef brisket and the other one was the shrimp one. My favorite one was the baja fish one as I ordered 2 of them. With tacos, you can never really go wrong with the baja fish option. Tacos were on point and quite delicious. Loved the sauce and seasoning in each one. My only small critique here is the tacos shell are quite small so you can't really wrap it around to form the taco shape. They also have quite the unique shot selection with different kinds of shots at different price points. They also have a decent beer selection as we all ordered drinks. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed coming here. Great food all around and enjoyed their tacos very much. Staff are great here and the ambience was very hipster."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the vibe is pretty ~cool~  We sat out on the patio, and you have to go up to the bar to order FYI. They give you a number and then when the food is ready, they will bring it to you. You carry your own drinks tho! It's a solid spot if you're downtown and you want a fun after-work ambience."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, though our waitress seemed rather clueless. Service was a bit slow. Ambiance is perfect for romantic dates or a night out with friends! Food was a bit pricey but delicious - I definitely recommend getting the fish tacos and the churros!"}
{"text":"El Caballito is confused. It doesn't know whether to be a dive bar or a high end Tequila bar. And because of this it misses the mark in both cases. Drinks were good, food was good, service was ok, cleanliness was poor. Would I go back? If a friend really wanted to go there sure. Other than that, I think I will spend my time elsewhere."}
{"text":"The bartender was super friendly, the fish tacos were really good, I enjoyed the tres amigos and margaritas, I LOVE the mariachis, the place is beautiful and in a great area I also like that it's on the basement so it's very dark and cozy... The only bad thing.. It's expensive, I went which my friend and spent $300 and we didn't even ordered a main course... I'm not cheap at all I enjoyed everything but it's overpriced"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Excellent drinks. Delicious tacos. Take advantage of their Tuesday taco special."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because it was a Tuesday Taco Night and all tacos were only $3.50, or maybe it's because my Mescal Mule drink was a subtle spicy with warmth and love, maybe it was the funny and friendly Aussie server, or maybe it'd because it was late on a Tuesday night so the place was almost empty... But this place was a hole in the wall that totally exceeded my expectations.   Pork belly Taco was very good and the trout Taco was fantastic. I'm told the shrimp was also amazing. Guacamole was fresh with hot chips. All reasonably priced. Somewhat scuzzy downstairs location makes it unpretentious and relaxed. Can't wait to check out the patio! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good quality, authentic Mexican food! Come here for a good bite before the theater. We enjoyed the classic nachos with chorizo, and 2 tacos each (spicy pork and chicken). Delicious! Great atmosphere and ambiance in the restaurant. Their tequila sodas are great as well!"}
{"text":"I suggested this place as a low key place for drinks on a Wednesday night.  They have daily drink specials and on Wednesdays they have $1 per Oz Sangrias.  Sangrias were tasty, we had chips and guacamole.  Love the yam chips that they use. So good. Better than tortilla chips I find.  We ordered lamb, beef and chicken tacos. My friends enjoyed their tacos, the chicken taco was okay. Not much on the menu.. definitely a good place for drinks and apps."}
{"text":"Taco tuesdaysssssssss!   6 tacos for 10 bucks! Yes please!   Coming from a symphony at case loma and being starving this was a great choice! Well executed tacos. Great choice and variety and awesome service.   They were fast and pleasant and the flavours couldn't be beat. They've got great seating inside but also an awesome patio with a permanent food truck in the back serving tacos out of the back."}
{"text":"Great venue with awesome variety of food (from main dishes to snacks) making it a perfect spot for sit down dinner meals and casual drinks. When the patio is open its a must happy hour spot. Tequila selection is the best in the city for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  The atmosphere is lively and fun.  The food is ok.  The drinks are pretty good.  But overall everything here is more expensive than it needs be...but then again I guess the location on King W will dictate prices.  Their guac though is pretty good - fresh and has a nice citrus kick to it.  The tacos are ok - I've had the shrimp ones a few times and nothing to write home about, but with the drinks and the guac it overall was an ok meal.  I believe there is a patio out back (haven't had a chance to make my way there).  There is the tequila cage in front (tequila tastings) that sound fun but I've yet to experience this.  Not sure why you need to sit in a cage to drink tequila.....?  It's a fun time for sure and if I was in the area I would probably go back, but I don't think I would drive specifically downtown for this place."}
{"text":"The brisket here is delicious! The staff was friendly and energetic. Didn't have to wait too long for food. There is a lot to look at while you're there! Great place. I will be back here!"}
{"text":"Loved their chips and salsa....but I think they changed it.  It used to be root chips and it was heavenly and it was all u can dip kinda chips.  The tacos are really good... fish tacos for the win but ull have to order at least 5 or 6 if u want it for dinner.  3 is enough for snacks and drinks.  A bit pricey for dinner Mexican food."}
{"text":"Would not recommend this place to anyone. We went in a group for a friends birthday and the waitress said that since we were a group in order for us to get our meals all at the same time it would be best for us to order the set group menu. So we did, and it took 3 hours for them to bring us out the 4 bite sized tacos this set menu comprised of. It then took an hour for them to bring us the bills. Overall I was incredibly dissatisfied with the quality of the tacos, the forty five minute wait between each bite sized taco, and the price (24 bucks for what equated to five or six bites worth of food, spread over a period of 3 hours!!!). The waitress said they were very busy that night etc, and discounted it (a whopping 10%) but all in all an entirely negative experience that I would avoid if I were you."}
{"text":"Picture it: Taco Tuesday. Awesome band. Even more awesome DJ. Cool staff. Yummy food. And did I mention taco Tuesday? Lol I'm dying of satisfaction .... Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I can never say no to tequila, so I was delighted when the June Yelp event was held at El Cabillito. Margaritas mixed with mastery combined with tasty tacos make this place a standout. While other reviewers complained about how dark this restaurant is, I actually liked that about it. It gave the impression of being in a little hideaway, an escape from the busyness of the downtown core. The food was delicious, and although this was a catered event and thus I didn't have the chance to try many items, I would most certainly return to experience what else the menu has to offer. I'd especially like to get to know that margarita list. Mmm hmmm."}
{"text":"I've been to El Caballito a few times now with a group of about 5-6 friends, and it's always been a blast! The tequila selection is good, and one of the bartenders makes you custom drinks (which are delicious, but a little pricey). The atmosphere is a loud and fun, which makes it perfect for a night out. I've only had food here twice. The first time it was pretty good, although not the best Mexican I've had. But the second time, it was a disaster. The tortillas were soggy, the tacos were watery, and the sangria tasted pretty bad. So it's a hit and a miss in terms of delivering on food. But I keep going back because of the fun atmosphere - it's great to get a night out going!!"}
{"text":"Let me say that this review revolves more around their food menu then the 'bar' menu.  As we were in the area looking for a quick place to eat, we decided to check it out due to the 'taco' menu even though it is a bar.  FOOD  Five of us ordered a mix of multiple tacos and appetizers and everything we had was very tasty.    PRICE  The downside is that while everything we had tasted great, the tacos are essentially $5 each and we each had at least 4, plus appetizers and drinks.  As such, the bill hiked up quite quickly.  SERVICE  With regards to the food items at least, you should expect to wait before receiving your items.  Walking to the restrooms you can walk by the kitchen to see why as it is quite small with only two people working when we were there so if there is a lot of people ordering food and you are on a schedule, then this probably isn't the best place to go.  From a drink aspect, then service seemed fine.  --  Despite the sticker shock with the bill and it taking, way, way to long to eat, we still enjoyed what we had.    As a 'meal first' type of place, I would suggest going elsewhere due to the price and speed.  As a 'drink first and eat on the side' type of place, then I would go back."}
{"text":"I stopped in with a friend after attending a \"Taco Festival\" not far from here, (which turned out to be a terrible experience) so we were still craving some decent tacos and Mexican beer.   I was delighted to find that they had my favourite Mexican beer (xx Amber) and they could also make a Chelada. On the menu, they have only listed Michelada, which (in my experience) is like adding Caesar ingredients (Clamato, Worcestershire, lime juice & Tabasco) whereas I just wanted the lime juice with salted rim. I've never had ice with my beer, so that was a new experience, and not something I'd do again. Just goes to show that there are many variations of Michelada/Chelada depending on the area/region a person is from.   We ordered the chips and guacamole to start, followed by a couple of tacos and the queso fundido with chorizo, served with flour tortillas. The tortillas were greasy and stiff, but the cheese was delicious and gooey - better enjoyed with the tortilla chips we had with the guacamole.   The tacos were delicious but very tiny (about the size of the palm of my hand) They were loaded with ingredients which made for a very messy eating experience. No complaints there, just needed extra napkins! Our server, Zane, was excellent; he answered all of our questions and always seemed to be there right when we wanted something.   The restaurant was quite dark and the music a bit too loud to have a proper conversation, but I'll definitely return for more tacos."}
{"text":"Food was very good, tried both the vegetarian tacos and it was great and tasted mostly authentic.  Tacos are a bit expensive (4.25 per) but otherwise was good."}
{"text":"(Really delayed review)  Came here after Fan Expo 2016 with a friend to try out their tacos.  Their menus are pretty small but very concise.  I didn't even know they had a patio in the back but we were seated in the main dining area.  It's pretty dark and loud inside, not too different from the other big taco places in the city.  Tacos were great!  A little bit on the pricey side but not too bad for our first visit."}
{"text":"I've only been to El Caballito for Brunch. It's one of my favourite's. Great location, they take reservations and they put lots of love in their food.   Started off with their Mexican Hot Chocolate, wasn't a big fan of that! It was very hard to drink as there was so much marshmallow and the taste was a bit overpowering for me.   Moving on...   The Eggs Benny is one of the best I've ever had, they use a brioche bun and the sauce on top is foodgasmic! The potatoes and guac on the side are just fucking perfect.   The huevos was bomb! The sauce was so flavourful, and it worked perfectly with the eggs, potatoes and guac combo!   Lastly, I could go without the pancakes. They are really cool, who wouldn't love churro pancakes but for me they were a little too sweet.   LOVE THEM!"}
{"text":"Didn't love my experience here. The tacos were tasty enough but nothing all that special (definitely not on the level of the Playa Cabana family of restaurants). And the servers were not very friendly or welcoming. Our party of 6 was given only one menu for some reason and then the server comes over immediately and gets all impatient when a few of us hadn't decided what we want to drink. We felt rushed during both the drink order and food order. And when my husband went up to the bar to ask if we could get a pitcher of margarita instead of the 4 individual ones that we ordered moments earlier, he said the server was visibly annoyed.  On the plus side, there are lots of sombreros around this place. But as much as I love drunken sombrero photo ops, I don't think I'll be rushing back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Top stars for the service! My sister and I had stopped in with only 30 minutes to eat before our concert at the TSO started. When we told the hostess this, she was super accommodating and made sure that we could get in and out within 30 minutes by asking the chef before seating us. Our server was also great about our time crunch: he took our order and made sure to give us the bill right after so we wouldn't have to waste time at the end waiting for a machine. Everyone was super attentive and very accommodating!  The food was also very yummy, but slightly pricey (over $5 per taco). The atmosphere was also great - relaxed but upbeat; I just wish we could've had more time to enjoy it. The next time I'm looking to splurge a little on Mexican food, I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the guac with the taro chips & totopos!! So good. For tacos, I had the beef and rainbow trout - I only like the fish one. The drink I had was the guava soda + lime juice + tequila - pretty strong.  The server who took our bill was super nice and accommodating in our request for separate bills. I would return for more Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"This resto is an awesome place to hang out with friends after work!  Service - 4/5 Atmosphere - 5/5 Cleanliness - 3/5 Food - 3.5/5  We tried the Chicharron with the poblanas, this cheesy chorizo cheese dish, and the chicken, shrimp, steak and pork belly tacos. The Chicharron and the cheese dish was so delicious, but the tacos were just alright. After one has been to seven lives, nothing just holds up! We also got margaritas, beer, tequila shots, and some special gin drink. All of the drinks were meh, nothing special.  I do love the atmosphere at this place though. It was an early Wednesday night and it was really busy and lively already. The wait staff were so helpful and kind, even though we were always adding to our order. Definitely check this place out!  Tip: come on Wednesdays and get $1 tacos with your beer"}
{"text":"After a really awesome Yelp elite event here, I decided to return to try it out as a regular diner.  I learned why one shouldn't write reviews based on Yelp elite events as the experience as an everyday diner was noticeably different.  The SERVICE:  Completely scattershot.  This aspect had impressed me so much during the elite event, but was completely absent for our dinner.  Long pauses, forgotten items.  And the weirdest was the way food runners would just drop a plate off almost at a run, not making eye contact, not telling us what items it was, not even grunting.    The FOOD:  Mixed bag here, some of the flavors were decent, but the portion size is just too small.  We started with the mixed chips with salsas.  On my first encounter the salsas were awesome...bit more mellow this time, nothing very spicy.  I love the idea of homemade chips with plantains and other vegetables, but they should add some tortilla chips as well.    We then moved on to a tamarind ceviche at about $14.  One received tiny four 1\" diameter rounds with more of a salsa on top than a ceviche.  The tamarind flavour was overwhelmed by the weird watery jicama tacos underneath, and the portion of fish included was almost undetectable.  Terrible value here.  Also, as my friend put it, \"Mexican food is good enough when done well, one doesn't have to try to innovate so much.\"  The tacos...the main part of the menu...were good, but again quite small in size...too small for their $4.50-$5.50 price.  They also had structural issues, they were too wet for the tortilla, falling apart before one could eat them.  I have a nicely stained shirt to illustrate this.  Simply bad value...prices are 50% higher than Grand Electric for even smaller portions than GE.    The DRINKS:  Very limited beer menu.  They had quite good cocktails during the elite event, but we didn't try any tonight.  My friend ordered a Michelada, which turned out to be undrinkable.  It tasted like a small quantity of beer mixed with a huge amount of sour mix and no other spices.  I could have sworn my $8 Dos Equis was substantially smaller than a pint.    The AMBIANCE: It's a basement.  The owners really need to be aware of that, as for the first half of our meal we had to shout over an incredibly loud 3-piece mariachi band.  Both terribly cheesy and way too loud.    OVERALL, El Caballito has really let me down.  After an awesome Yelp event, they sincerely underwhelmed in my \"anonymous\" dining capacity.  Poor service; fairly tasty food but tiny portions.  It basically worked out to quite a bad value.  Too bad...I really hoped to have a standby dining spot on King West."}
{"text":"Very decent Mexican food with nice, attentive and spicy service!  The Mariachis and DJ are a nice touch and complement the ambiance and decor very well.   Location is great for a night out as there are so many nearby options."}
{"text":"@ELCABALLITO220 #YELPTO #FREEGUAC #TACOTUESDAY  So, I've been to this place a number of times, both before and after I won the free guac card. That's right, this girl has access to unlimited guac for 2 more months!   Some of my friends really like the place, some don't. I guess it's a hit or miss depending on what you like. Firstly, fantastic location - right in between cultural venues like Prince of Wales, Roy Thompson Hall; startups and bigwig companies on King Street; and very close to the clubbing district. The vibe of this place, as expected is very young, fun yet classy. On a Friday night, you may just meet the perfect man, or eye some women you strive to be.   I really like the rustic decor, the grunginess of the place and the neon lights - yet somehow it does not feel cheap; despite of being a basement. And the food certainly isn't. The tacos are about $5-$7 each and fairly small in size. But it's surprising how it can fill you up significantly. My advise would be to order one shareable and about 2-3 tacos each. The guac is fantastic, as is the salsa sampler. And they come with unique chips. I am a huge fan of the taro chips. Yum!! And the beef brisket is my favorite taco.   These guys have done a great job with their branding. Love how fun it is.  Ankie Tip: Keep an eye on their social media activities. They do a ton of contests and giveaways.    The only fails:   1. Margarita Rating: 1/5 Sadly, their classic traditional margarita is totally a fail. Every Mexican place I've been to serves a fantastic margarita. This one is so boozy on tequila that it tastes more like a tequila shot in a glass. I don't taste the agave or triple sec at all.  2. Your experience really depends on the server you get. I've had some friendly servers, and ones that are constantly pushy - \"either order tacos... or leave already\" kind. It's just so easy to eat and chill with a friend at this place, but some servers want you to constantly keep ordering food.   3. They changed their hours. So they will no longer be open till 1am every night. #sadgirls"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times with friends and once for a company party and have had fun at all. Amusing place to get some tacos/snacks and tequila and hangout. High energy by the crowd and the staff.   The food is good, but I feel like this is a place you come to drink rather than have a culinary experience   I liked the options they had for tequila and it was fun to try some different ones. They had a really nice tequila on special so we had a few shots of that--it was really tasty (this is coming from someone who doesn't normally like straight alcohol).   Could be a good date place if you come earlier in the evening, once it gets later it gets a bit rowdy and is a great time too"}
{"text":"I really like this place because they have good music and tacos but yesterday was a disaster. Service was so bad. The hostess was just incredibly incompetent. We had a table and they allow you to have it for 2 h. The hostess came to ask us to give the table back but we were waiting for food. We agreed even tho our food hadn't arrived yet. We ate while standing on the side! 2h after we got up from the table there still wasn't anyone seated on it!!! The surrounding tables were also empty but the hostess kept asking people to get up. Than we stood next to column that had a little table around it and there was a chair that someone left on it which apparently belonged to one of the high tables. So the hostess came to us again and asked us to put the chair back to the neighbouring table which was EMPTY and no one was sited at this high table for at least 30 mins! And if I may add the previous table and at least 3 other tables were all empty!!! I am not sure what this hostess was thinking but I'm glad I didn't react at that time and continued to enjoy my friends company however I hope you guys are more considerate and a bit more flexible in cases like this one as we would have spend more than what we had if we could have sat down and ate without being interrupted."}
{"text":"The staff at this restaurant make it what it is. I'd like to thank Nicole, Adrian, Erin, Dani, Chad and Jeremiah for always making it feel like a second home. Service here is Devine- don't ever change. Their knowledge of fine tequilas is educational and allows for a fine new experience if you've never tried a tequila before. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.   Also, the food is amazing Rodrigo and the kitchen staff always execute meals flawlessly."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here the other night before a show at Princess of Wales. The interior is cozy and warm, with candle lighting and an impressive tequila tasting area!  The food is delicious. We ordered the chicken empanada to start, which was lovely. We also ordered two tacos each; the flank steak taco and the baked fish. After devouring these, we ordered the other two tacos on the menu because those were delicious. Each taco was amazing! The tortilla on the flank steak taco had a different taste to it, which was great.   I wouldn't bother with their guac - it wasn't anything special. We also ordered the tuna tartar tostada, which I thought was mediocre as well.  That being said, the drink options aren't great. They specialize in tequila, so if you're not fond of that, and you're looking for a place to go to for just drinks, skip this one. Also, be warned that their daily specials end at 6pm.  Go here for the food though!"}
{"text":"Was by for some eats a while ago after meeting with a friend for a movie. Food was nothing special, there are better tacos around town. Seasoning was inconsistent from one taco/dish to the next and well overpriced for what you get. The $5 taco should be wiped from existence imo. Lots of good tequila and nice service by the cute brunette made up for the par food, but that seems to be the story of toronto for cool/hip/trendy places in toronto these days. Ply people with alcohol and hope they dont notice the standard/overpriced food. Will come back to try it again if im in the hood and someone else is buying"}
{"text":"It's an average mexican restaurant with daily specials. I came in for taco tuesday and it was pretty good for the area. The only down side is that I didn't really get full on just the set of three tacos. My group of friends also ordered the nachos appetizer for sharing. The guac was delicious and the portion was huge. There was more guac than chips that we had to ask for more chips (the waiter didn't charge us for the extra chips). Service was good but would have been better if he checked on us more often because we really were in dire need of water (salsa was spicy!).   Overall, I would go there again for the specials after work."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food I've ever had. And I'm not picky when it comes to food in general. I mean, Taco Bell would've made me happy, but El Caballito was in our vicinity. I was craving margaritas and Mexican food after a Jays game with my husband and this was just a total let down and waste of tummy space. I've been to the patio for drinks before and loved the vibe of this place. I had high hopes due to the good reviews. The indoor area is cute with a nice ambience, but it's hard for me to say any positives about the food. A two-star is being generous - only because the server was nice. My meal started with the most sour margarita ever (that tasted virgin). It was like all lime juice/bar lime and no tequila. I usually down drinks (especially alcoholic ones) really quickly, but this was one nursed until the end of my meal. I'm used to paying $15 for cocktails at trendy downtown bars/restaurants and for the most part, they have all been tasty and worth it (and actually had alcohol in it). This was just sad bc I love my alcohol lol  Our pico de gallo was basically chopped onions with an excessive amount of lime juice and 3 cherry tomatoes that were halved. I love extra lime in my Mexican food, but if I'm making a pucker face with every bite, that is not normal. The taro chips were the best part. We ordered the pork empanada and I could not eat more than one bite. It was drenched in sauce and feta cheese? I thought feta was a Greek thing? Anyways I couldn't taste any of the actual pork empanada because of the shit ton of saucy toppings. Who knows if there was an actual empanada under there. ? For the tacos, we had the carnitas, spicy shrimp, and baja fish. First of all, they were all bland and the tortillas tasted weird and very floury. The carnitas were meh, the spicy shrimp was dry and not spicy at all and the baja fish maybe had like a finger nail sized piece of fish. It was all batter!! Disappointing at $6 a taco. I seriously would've preferred a crunch wrap from Taco Bell instead. Go visit places like Seven Lives or Grand Electric instead for your taco fix. I would maybe only come back to have drinks on the patio."}
{"text":"This place is Mmmm Mmm good. The place is dark and pretty loud. It's crowded on a week night and there's a reason for it. The food's great. I love the tacos here. The flank steak was particularly tender and tasty, as is the fish taco. The guacamole and chips tasted fresh and delicious. The margaritas here are also wonderful and there's five for you to choose from, along with other options such as beer and cocktails. Overall a great Mexican food pace, just kind of pricey."}
{"text":"I've seen El Caballito have a chill, intimate vibe that's perfect for a weeknight date and a lively atmosphere for a weekend bar crawl. It's also a great place to sit at the bar, as the bartenders are really friendly and can explain all the different varieties of tequila.  I had the Chicken Adobado and Cochinita Pibil tacos. Both were good, though the Cochinita Pibil was a little watery and I would have preferred a spicier flavour.   Will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Go on a Tuesday for Tacos Tuesday.   I've tasted pretty much all the tacos without meat that were offered there.   My favourite was the mushroom tacos. I had about 4. The fish taco is incredible as well. The other tacos were good too but I don't really remember them as much, which means I would stick to the mushroom tacos and fish tacos in the future.   Nachos are crispy and delicious and guacamole is perfect, with well balanced flavours.   Do yourself a favour and try the desserts here."}
{"text":"I've been neglecting one of my favorite areas in Toronto, King West so I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that the June Elite event would be at ECTB. On the lower level of the building, this place looks like a 'hole in the wall,' but it's totally not. The mixed drinks were delicious - the margarita had the perfect blend of alcohol and citrus flavors. I enjoyed all the food as well. I absolutely loved the flank steak taco, with the vegetarian quesadilla coming a close second. Having fried plantains dipped in guacamole was pretty good as well.  Good for: drinks, tacos"}
{"text":"I went here with my girl friends on a cold bone chilling night. Left the place warm and happy after the four $4 tequila and soda special drinks for that night. I am a dipper... I love chips and dips and salsa. We ordered the salsa sampler with chips. The chips were unique , similar to Terra chips. The salsa sampler had petite portions of four salsas, ranging from mild to hot. The salsa sampler was sufficient for the three of us even though it looked like we would run out of salsa quickly. The tacos are served a la carte, where you can choose a single or multiple tacos. We all had various tacos and every single one was good. The ambiance is perfect for an after work social setting."}
{"text":"I've been to El Caballito a bunch of times now since it's close to my work. Great to have a mexican taco bar in that area and being able to stop by for a Margarita or two. Food is very good and drinks are delicious! It can get quite busy on a weekend night so make sure to arrive early. it is true that the place can get quite loud since they usually have a DJ or a band playing but it's a bar after all and not  a library. Can't wait to get a group of friends together to go for a Tequila tasting! Unlike other reviews on here I've never had any unpleasant experience with the service there."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service !  Manny's margarita is to die for.  Also love the bourbon cocktail on their menu.  The steak taco is second to none and the guac is not too shabby either -- the plantain chips are a nice interesting touch.  Our server Olivia was very attentive and charming.  Will definitely be coming back !"}
{"text":"Really expected better. The chicken breast was really dry and the favours left us wanting..."}
{"text":"This place has never disappointed.  Tacos are delicious, vibe is fantastic, great especially when there's live music (mariachi band) or a live DJ. Great place to chill with friends or on a date.   Just keep tabs on your, well, tab. I always overspend."}
{"text":"This is a must-do when wandering on King W. We ambled across this bar at random and had an incredible time. A great place to go for the foodie who is looking for a great cervesa, margarita or Spanish liquor paired with arguable the best octopus and shrimp tacos ever! The guac and chips are also incredible --- what started as a night out for drinks ended up becoming foodie heaven!! Even though they were super-busy the servers were all down to earth and kind!"}
{"text":"Went a few weeks back for dinner and drinks.  Excellent live music by djdoubleup.  Service by Akila and manager Chad were top notch.  Very attentive staff.  Food was fresh, cocktails were very creative.  All in all, excellent atmosphere especially for a Friday night."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times now and truly have enjoyed each visit.  Every time I have gone I have sat at the bar as to sit at a table they put a time limit on it; especially on Taco Tuesdays.  The pitcher of Margaritas are amazing, we had the house and hibiscus versions and both were boozy and delicious.  A good balance of sweet, sour, salty and all of what makes a margarita a good one.  The tacos are nice, you must eat them quickly or they will fall apart the tortilla's are fresh and delicate.    The chips and guac are not bad either, I am not a big fan of cilantro and they do not go too crazy on it so I can stomach it.  On Tuesdays they have a live mariachi band as well as a DJ which makes the night amazingly fun!  For those who want to get into the spirit there are sambraros around for you do don while you get your food and drink on!  I will have to try their Sangria which looks beautiful....stay tuned!"}
{"text":"Food was average and nothing special.  I've had better tacos at other modern type of places as well as traditional Mexican taco joints throughout Toronto.  Despite this, we were having a good time until dinner traffic starting showing up, which looked like a clubbing crowd.  We seated at a table by the front.  A female from a group group asked to have one of our chairs because her high heels were killing her feet...okay I let her have a chair...  Then, another group of three immature bratty females blondes from the \"East Coast\", as they told us, whom obviously have no class and weren't parented properly decided it was proper etiquette to drink at our table by leaning and putting their drinks on it (yes they were practically at our table having their drinks!!!!).  We told them that it wasn't normal to be at someone else's table and like a pack of wolves, these girls immediately verbally abused and yelled at us, as well as insulted my friend's outfit because they're insecure and have no class or disregard to appropriate manners, and one had the nerve to touch my shoulder with her hand as she walked by.  When we tried to ignore them, they kept interrupting us at our table still!  Two nearby tables witnessed it all.  I immediately walked up and complained to James, the Manager whom was very nice and professional throughout the night, but I think he was new and kept having to check with a Female Manager whenever I had a question and for this incident it was no different.  The girls escalated so I informed James again as nothing was done and eventually, the Female Manager came and talked to them for 5-10 minutes and showed them to a table and although James came to apologize, the Female Manager didn't come by to apologize until after quite some time passed by.  We were told that the girls were already upset that they had to wait for a table and then were told they could wait anywhere by the Hostess and when they waited at our table LOL, they had enough.  I was not happy with the Restaurant's decision to do this although James apologized and took care of our bill, it would have been better if the horrible customers weren't seated.  Seriously, what kind of customers goes to restaurants and verbally yell and touch other customers when they're being idiots and get seated?  Seriously, I should have walked out and called the police and perhaps their parents would finally realize what sort of children they raised.  After careful thought about my experience, I suggest restaurant management improve on how to handle terrible abusive clientele!!!!  I will never return to this restaurant and will not consider bringing clients here either."}
{"text":"I fully cop to thus being a revised review. I'm pretty sure they have new management up in there, and have really improved the experience.   Tacos were and are still great, apps were and are limited and a bit pricey (but hey - it's King West), and it was and still is pretty loud. More of a place to hang for your birthday... Less so a date.   But all that staying the same, the service has really improved, the tequila tastings are fantastic, and they have great specials like taco Tuesdays."}
{"text":"A nice underground bar that is focus on exactly what their neon signs says at the entrance, tacos and tequila. This is a place that you can enjoy a nice chat with your buddies with some great tequilas! It's great that their selections are Mexico imports...and no, none of them taste the same and you can tell easily. Reposado selections are what I would recommend. It got smoother texture and lighter taste then Anejo. It's less acquire taste and enjoyable for the ladies as well.  The Tacos are phenomenal! Tacos Tuesday is the best time to be here. The Shrimp Tacos were amazing, with nice flavour and texture with tasty avocados, it truly is delicious! I don't live around the area, but I would commute on Tuesday just to be here for tequilas and tacos."}
{"text":"Walking around TIFF we decided to have a try here. Really not impressed. Food was mediocre at best and pricey for what it is.  Waitress really took her sweet time to bring us the menu and water. We really wanted to order the corn but apparently you can't get it unless you sit on the patio - what kind of a requirement is that? If you won't be serving the food, don't advertise.   I do have to mention that the atmosphere was very cool, real candles everywhere, cool glasses and we even got our bill in a shot glass. I can see someone going on a date here but getting ultra disappointed by the food."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place near my place just because of the atmosphere, amazing memories and the sombreros! Firstly about their tequila, it's AMAZZZZZING. You might think you don't like tequila and it's just a shot you take to get turnt, but I'm serious the tequila here is so so so good! Whether in the form of shots or margarita or sangria I've had it all and it's delicious!   The tacos itself are a little ok they are satisfying but I find are a little too small for the price and there ms not enough on the tacos. The rainbow trout taco wasn't good it was waaaay too small, but the pig taco was ok, it still didn't have enough flavour on it."}
{"text":"Stopped by here when traveling and left here very satisfied. This place is amazing. Everything is SUPER tasty and the service is so great. Definitely going to miss this place."}
{"text":"Went here with some family members for a Xmas Eve Eve dinner. This place gets pretty packed, so we made sure to make a reservation.  To start off, we got an order of the guacamole--which was very good. I loved the fact that they served yucca chips, as well as tortilla chips because they provided a nice texture that went well with the guacamole.  I also ordered a couple tacos--the cochinita pibil and rainbow trout. Both were very good, but the cochinita was a bit spicier than I was anticipating. The rainbow trout was cooked perfectly and had a great lightness and flavor profile.  Throughout the night, we were drinking pitchers of their house margarita--which was alright--but had a nice touch of sweetness to it.  Overall, this place can be a bit loud and sceney, but the food was good and the DJ was spinning some great tunes. Not a bad place to check out if you don't mind breaking the bank a little bit."}
{"text":"Wasn't overly impressed with the food here. I had the beef taco which tasted like mushy beef. My friends has veggie tacos; they liked them. The chips and dip were classic. The one thing I do like about here is the environment ....super cool vibe, music playing, Mexican lights. The service was quick the only thing is we were a table of 5 and all our tacos came different times.. I got mine first and my friend got her 16 minutes later. Pretty pricey as well."}
{"text":"Loved the environment/ambience of this place. Great place for a late night meal/snack. Great music on weekends delivered by a live DJ (good mix of old school pop and hiphop and top 40). The taco's are well priced and decent. The drinks are also well priced and taste great (for the ones I had). I would come back. Great place to just lounge around with friends over drinks."}
{"text":"Came for a pre TSO concert dinner on a Thursday night. We ordered:  * Guacamole with taro chips & totopos - fresh and tasty but I wish it was a slightly larger portion for the price. * Chicken Verde tacos * Beef Brisket Adobo tacos * Pork Al Pastor tacos * Chicharron with Beef Brisket  Service was good. The host offered to hang up my coat. Our server checked up on us regularly & asked if we wanted more drinks or food. There was a DJ spinning some tunes which made the place livelier.  Will come back another time & try some of the different drinks they offer."}
{"text":"Love dropping in when the mood is right. Great food, extensive tequila and mescal lineup. Plus they get conga lines going!"}
{"text":"Came in around 11:30 with a group of five... Ordered food and drink and when midnight came we were excited for their free midnight taco! They denied us and said if we had of come around 10 and ordered multiple rounds of drinks we would be eligible... We were the only table in the whole bar! False advertising!!!"}
{"text":"El Caballito is a great option when they have Tacos Tuesday (yes, on Tuesdays!) with live music and discounted prices for tacos!  The restaurant is open until 1 am and is located, somewhat oddly, in the downtown area.  A rational starting point of your dining experience is with the guacamole and taro chips.  The chips are excellent and make up for the relatively mediocre guacamole.  But the combination is sure to be a hit.  The selection of tacos is great ... I quite like their poblano and mushroom ones.  They also have a vegetarian quesadilla that comes in pairs, and is quite compact and light.  If you are into drinks, they have a selection of margaritas, tequilas and wines that is sure to please.  I will come to El Caballito from time to time.  It is quite a departure from the formal setting upstairs at Los Colibris, a sister concern that is better suited for upscale Mexican fare."}
{"text":"Expensive for Mexican but delicious.   Good quality margaritas with real ingredients.   The tacos were very flavourful, and the non-taco food item too. Guacamole and chips were good too.   I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"After writing a previous review about having a bad experience at this restaurant (rude service) I am updating my review due to the great customer service I received after my negative review.   The manager who had contacted me was more than delightful and went out of her way to get to the bottom of my bad experience. This to me is amazing customer service and I will be back to the restaurant solely based on that."}
{"text":"El Caballito is a great place to chill with friends and their tacos are really good. TUESDAYS are Taco Tuesdays and the cost of the tacos are cheap and worth it. Although, make sure to reserve a table on Tuesday because it can get really busy. The patio was closed when I went but it looked interesting, the inside had a cool vibe to it but it was pretty loud and kind of dark. I ordered the Beef Brisket Adobo, Chicken Tinga, and Grilled Rainbow Trout tacos. Since it was Tuesday it took very long for it to be ready and even though they all tasted amazing, especially the Beef Brisket Adobo, the portions were pretty small; only two-bites."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday,  vibe is good, mariachi band moving throughout the restaurant. Theyve changed the original fish taco recipe, and tortillas are from a distributor now. The seasoned pork taco was delicious."}
{"text":"Let's preface this by saying I was at a Yelp event, so I didn't have to pay for anything which always is a sweet deal. Having said that, I really really enjoyed my visit to this establishment. I was down with the dim lighting and the candles. The atmosphere was fun and funky even down to the askew blinds on the window. We sampled the margaritas and enjoyed them. They were a bit on the sour side as opposed to sweet which suited me fine. We also tried the flank steak tacos which were pretty good and a chicken one that I really liked. I especially dug the various salsas, the hot one in particular.  The servers were all super personable and they for sure added to the overall good vibe I had about this place. I would for sure return."}
{"text":"Reserved a spot for 10 of us, celebrating my birthday. We came from a Paint Nite event, which ended relatively early so we arrived at El Cabillito an hour before our reservation, which seemed to be fine. They situated us in a dark corner with our own private table. Was a bit awkward as there was a storage room attached, so we had staff come in and out of there ever so often.  This place has a very small menu- both drinks and food. We ordered guacamole and ceviche for the table. Taro chips were great, everything else unmemorable.   6 of us also grabbed the 6 tacos for $24/$32 depending on your choice- fish, chicken, beef etc. Tacos were great, and double tortilla wraps. I remember previously reading a complaint how they were soggy and falling apart. Not the case for us.   5 members of my group decided to ask for hot sauce- they all immediately regretted this decision. They were all sweating, some in tears.   Would I return? Probably not. As a tequila drinker I thought this place would be a lot more livelier then it was... Granted it was 5pm and the Jays game was on.  Because of the outrageous cake cutting fee of $5/slice (more than the cake itself) the group decided to enjoy the cake elsewhere.   Picked this place cuz I thought it would be a livelier atmosphere. Definitely wasn't at all. I guess their version of a party is giving us sparklers - felt like a 2 year old - and a bunch of sombreros...which was cute I guess."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, nice decors similar to that of Pai's - exposed brick and rugged retro feel. Margarita were great and so were the tacos. Menu is limited to tacos and sides but perhaps that works out in its own way. We tried shrimp, flank and fish tacos. Fish taco was the best, I found flank taco could use bit more kick. Overall it's a great place and excellent location. We were seeing Kinky Boots at Royal Alexandria Theatre and it's right next door."}
{"text":"Yummy shrimp tacos and Sangria! Service was fast and the bartender was gracious enough to give us a sample of the Sangria, w/o asking! Atmosphere is great, walked into salsa music and there is a DJ on Saturday nights. There is a roof top deck which was packed, so I suggest getting there early. Happy to find good tacos while on vacay!"}
{"text":"We had 20 people at this establishment. Ended up buying a bottle of tequila and one of the members of our group talked to the owner who said we could have free tacos for the group. We ordered 18 tacos then we were charged for 18 tacos. The owner said there was never an agreement on it and he would do nothing about it. Avoid this establishment if you want to be treated fairly. Besides that the staff was absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Great tacos and a huge selection of tequila, I'm told they serve 200 different kinds. The first time I came, I had the tacos - very fairly priced and was stuffed quite generously. Don't expect to eat anything else though because this is all they serve for food. Also had a shot of tequila and it was good stuff! Super smooth.   My second visit was supposed to be drop in and take a shot kind of visit since we already had dinner elsewhere. Pro tip: do not just ask for a shot of tequila because as I said, they serve 200 kinds. Somehow I said surprise me because I didn't know which one I had last time (be careful because some of the good stuff cost upwards of $100 per shot)... And ended up with the reposado aka aged tequila, which cost $15 per shot. The bartender was great to talk to and I learned so much about tequila that night. Super friendly staff.   What I love about this place is they make it a big deal and gives everyone sombreros when you ask for a picture. It's campy but really cute."}
{"text":"The food here is really, really bad.  To start, our table ordered chips and a variety of salsas. The chips were dry and the salsas were bland.  We also ordered the ceviche to share.  It was a small portion size with hardly any fish.  It seemed like more of a salsa.    Then we ordered the tacos and that's when things really went downhill.  They were on some sort of pita crisp, the meats were gristley and greasy, and there weren't many toppings. No real flavour.   I don't know who management is paying for these rave reviews on here.  With so many great taco places in the city, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I looove El Caballito. The first time I came here was on a fun second date and there was a $3.50 taco + margarita special. The tacos here are the freakin bombbbb. So good. Maybe except the steak one, that one was super bland. The second + third time I came here= double shot tequila Tuesdays. Order the chips+ guac, it will change your life.  I love everything about this place, I always have a great time :). The staff here are also really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"We had so much fun here on St.Patricks Day (Friday night) while visiting Toronto! Mainly because the dj that night was the best dj we ever experienced. He was consistent in playing great music (R&B, hip hop from old school to new school) that kept us singing along and dancing all night. We were suppose to bar hop all down king street but we literally stayed here the entire night because we enjoyed ourselves that much.   The restaurant was pretty cool and the food is good."}
{"text":"This place has a cool vibe. The menu had pretty limited options. But the few things they did have they did pretty well. We got a ton of different things. The tacos were small and so good. I would stay away from the chicken. It has the least amount of flavor. The queso fundido with short ribs I believe was sooooooo delish. The guac was really good also. It was heavy on the garlic but I like that. The pico de gallo was very chunky and off putting when you first look at it but once you taste it... great!! The drinks weren't too strong but they were very flavorful. I loved it all. The downside was the service. I waitress either didn't like us or was not in the mood to do her job that day. Thinking back it is a bar type vibe so maybe she was trying to go for bad service. Who knows! But I like the food and drinks a lot and would go back and hope not to get her again. ?"}
{"text":"A must go if you're in this area of largely of chain restaurants or pricey tourist traps and in need of a pick me up. Walk down the stairs from King and into this bumpin' home of tacos and tequila. Order a margarita AND a Tecate - they taste best when enjoyed in tandem. The tacos come quick and tasty, but for me the queso fundido is a must. Everyone at the table was all \"what is THAT?!\" when mine was plopped down in front me. Order one for the table or get one for yourself and watch jealous eyes covet your oozy warm cheesy goodness."}
{"text":"I visited El caballito on a Friday night. The atmosphere is very lively and they have a live DJ playing. I ordered margaritas which were very good and you're given your money's worth. I also ordered the chicken tacos, brisket tacos, and queso fundido with pico de gallo. The chicken tacos were a little too liquidy and the tortilla was too small to hold the amount of stuffing. The brisket tacos were mediocre and a little salty. I'd say out of every thing I enjoyed the queso fundido the most. Our server was very friendly and explained everything on the menu to us. But I feel like El Caballito is a bit understaffed for the amount of customers they had on a Friday night. Over all I'd say the food is over priced for what you get but El Caballito is a nice place to go for margaritas and a lively ambience."}
{"text":"El Caballito's new patio is perfect for summer. I went with a few girlfriends on a sunny day and it was the perfect space for afternoon drinks - it was like a Mexican oasis in the middle of downtown. Service was attentive (and attractive!) The bar and food truck setup gave us a great excuse to mingle with the other guests.  Margaritas and Sangrias were plentiful. They have a special \"Manny's Margarita\" which pleased my more adventurous friends - tequila with pink peppercorns is a surprisingly delicious combination.   For food we had the ceviche and a few of the tacos. The ceviche arrived at the perfect temperature and was a generous portion. We had the chicken taco, which had a great kick to it, and the flavorful beef adobo taco, but everyone's fave was the shrimp taco.  Overall, my new favorite patio in Toronto. A must try for summer."}
{"text":"As a mexican, I'm hard to please when it comes to tacos and El Caballito is always the place I recommend. If you're more into fine dining, try Los Colibrís."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday recently, I made a reservation for 15 people and they were very accommodating, pretty spacious. It was my first visit, for a Friday around 10-midnight it wasn't even busy (which I didn't mind). There was a DJ spinning and he definitely created a lively atmosphere.   Let me tell you their tequila menu is longer than their food menu.... Their drinks were strong, especially for sangria. A got a few shots, there was this one guava- lemony one that was quite interesting. I ordered a corona and had to remind the waitress of this, but still ended up waiting 10 minutes just for someone to bring me a bottle.   I tried the ceviche which tasted fresh, the chips had original tortilla chips AND taro chips which were new but great, less salty. I also ordered chicken tacos, you can't even wrap the taco closed because it was so full of meat, but then again the tortilla was small.. Although they were flavorful they weren't necessarily filling. My group also received a pork taco for the Free Midnight taco, which definitely topped the chicken taco.  Although it wasnt the best Mexican styled restaurant I've been to, it was definitely fun and I would like to try their other items."}
{"text":"This was our first time at El Caballito and it comes with mixed reviews.   If you are looking for a sit down Mexican restaurant this is not a location for you. The vibe is very quick and re ordering is not something that is very easy.   We went for my wife's birthday as she is big fan of Mexican food. The food itself was good, but after a long line to get in, you feel sort of rushed to get your food and try to grab a seat. We wanted to explore the menu a bit but we received mixed messages from the servers on whether we could skip the line an led re order some additional drinks/food items. They allowed it but another server didn't agree with us being able to do so.   I would go back, but I would now be prepared for the experience it brings. I'd start my night there rather than make it a focus point of the evening."}
{"text":"Just your average tacos. Cool atmosphere and good server though just don't come FOR the tacos. Also the server over promised and under delivered by telling us that the guac is THE BEST which was absolutely not true the ones I make at home are better. I mean it's ok it's just not the best. Their chips were great though. The one taco I won't recommend is the octopus one bcos it smelled fishy."}
{"text":"Tequila tastings. Free sombreros. Mariachi.   On this Cinco de Mayo, I feel like the above should be enough for five stars and a mic drop, but I'll elaborate:   You know you're looking for some sweet gold nectar and possibly a tray of margs, and this place has a three page tequila list.   Their food price point is incredibly reasonable for the goods their giving up. I understand sometimes people think tacos should be 7/11 taquito prices, but come on... These babies are scratch-made and fresh, and are way cheaper than the hipster Tacos Toronto seems to heart sucking down."}
{"text":"We had no expectations going to El Caballito; and I must say we really enjoyed the food. We ended up here on a Saturday with a group of 6. We were all happy with the food.  What through us for a loop was the staff. I felt like I was at a hooters. We probably won't go out of our way to return because of the staff... The crowd was pretty different as well; very 905."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch because they started the Ritual app. I ordered a fish taco and Mexican soda, and my husband ordered a taco. When I went to pick up the items, the restaurant was completely empty, but the staff were very attentive and friendly. They had all the items wrapped up nicely and put in a paper bag.  Fried baja-style fish taco: They used real authentic corn tortillas made from scratch, and the slaw with battered cod was tasty. However, I found the portion very small and pricey as it was almost $12. I also ordered a Mexican pineapple soda but it tasted like sugary carbonated juice with some slight pineapple taste to it. Chicken Verde taco: My husband ordered this and it was definitely a bigger portion than mine. It looked more like a burger and was tasty according to my husband. However, also cost about $11. In general, the food was above average and definitely made with fresh ingredients but I think the prices were a bit high for the amount you get."}
