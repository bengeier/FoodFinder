{"text":"Connected to OHSO brewery which makes for a fairly large venue. The novelist has their very own bar with a great selection of wine. Breakfast food was delicious with nice high end touches like crab. Very cool atmosphere with walls of books that are painted over and receipts that come in novels as well. Overall unique idea you just don't see every day."}
{"text":"A little pricey but this place has great food, cocktails and beer. It's attached to OHSO. Whiskey Bundt cake is putting bundt cakes back on the map!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this place and the staff. I hosted a bridal shower there this morning and everything was absolutely perfect from the food to the drinks to the service. Devon, Rachel, Adam, Eddie, Mike and the entire staff of the Novelist made sure we had everything we needed and that the entire party was a success. They really went above and beyond to ensure the merriment continued throughout the event. Thank you guys so much. The bride was in tears over how amazing this event was and it really was thanks to all of you."}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic ambiance and great service. It's nice to step away from the busyness and enjoy a great conversation in DT Gilbert in a comfortable private booth.  Great spot for a date night!!"}
