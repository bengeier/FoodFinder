{"text":"Getting takeout biryani.. I'm sure it's gonna be great. I drove from Niagara falls to Scarborough....was in the area had to try some biryani..."}
{"text":"Not really clean. I didnt like the ambience of the place at all. I prefer not to go there anymore as i had a bad experience"}
{"text":"Best take out in Scarborough. Reasonably priced. Authentic food. Love their karahi, jalfaraizi and Chana. They put real spices in their food, not generic boxed masala taste you get from majority restaurants in town. Biryani is great too, less meat but it's $4 only.  This is not a fancy place, you are better off ordering atleast 20 mins ahead. Food is always fresh."}
