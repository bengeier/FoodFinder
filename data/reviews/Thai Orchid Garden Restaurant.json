{"text":"This place was amazing when the two guys owned it. Since then the portions and quality has gone down significantly. Kind of sad because there are not very many restaurants to choose from on the west side."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food and excellent service. The restaurant is casual, brightly lit, and quiet. The waitstaff is very friendly, cheerful, attentive and prompt. We had the pad Thai and the pineapple curry, and both were delicious. The Thai coffee was delish too - creamy, with nice robust coffee flavor."}
{"text":"I generally really like this place.  I love the pad krapow and have enjoyed most of the things I have gotten there.  Lunch deals are good and I've had no problems ordering pickup meals.  So why the 3 stars?  Last time I was there I went with a couple co-workers who also like Thai food.  We drove a little out of the way to get to here from our meeting and had very questionable service.  The first booth they tried to sit us in was filthy so we asked for another which seemed to cause some confusion.  Then when ordering we asked for our food to be made spicy.  At which point the waitress told us that they make all of their food without spice and you have to add your own at the table.  If that was the case I never would of made it for a second trip.  Our food came out bland, everyone was disapointed but the potential for good food came through.  I usually have my food ordered with some heat to it without an issue .... not sure what the issue was that day but they gained two people who will never think of it again (unless they dream about bland thai food) and one long term customer who is a little leery."}
{"text":"I had the  Pha Nan curry with chicken, and it was AMAZING.  The dish was $8.75 and I took half of it home to eat the next day.   We come here once a week to treat ourselves to Thai tea. So, so good.  Staff is always very sweet. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"We love this place, and are glad it has survived the \"restaurant apocalypse\" these last few years.  We usually go for take-out, but dine in when bringing guests.  I stick to the tasty yellow curry a lot of of the time (good deal for the lunch special), and often get the Tom Kha Kai (sp?) hot soup.  Just tried the spicy noodles last time and liked them.  We like spicy food so I can't comment on the milder stuff ;)  Spice levels do vary a little from day to day, but it's flavorful heat, not just heat for the sake of being hot.  The other good thing is that there is a generous amount of chicken (in the chicken dishes of course)."}
{"text":"I had lunch here the other day with my wife and 3.5 yr old daughter.  We ordered the Red Curry, Spicy Bean Chicken, and a plate of fried rice.  Red Curry - Very good.  As usual though when I ask for Spicy, it comes out almost spicy.  This happens 95% of the time so I do not fault them much. Spicy Bean - Was tasty.  It was ordered as 'Mild' but still had some kick. Fried Rice - Good. Stuff that comes with the lunches: Won Ton - Did not eat it Soup - VERY good soup.  It is like a regular chicken and vegetable soup with rice added.  My kid slurped it down quickly.  I am glad this place is out here as everytime I wanted Thai I would have to drive a good 35 miles to Tempe.  The service was fine, as it was not packed."}
{"text":"This is our family's to-go Thai restaurant in the West Valley! Spicy fried chicken, spicy drunken noodles, yellow curry, beef salad are our favorites. Their Thai iced tea is a five-star and is highly recommended!  Mondays thru Fridays they also have affordable, but very delicious lunch specials!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are big fans of Thai food and have eaten it in many cities around the country. Thai Orchid Garden is among our favorites and we are so thrilled to have it right in our neighborhood! We almost exclusively get it for take-out, but we've dined in two or maybe three times. Agreed that the creepy older guy is a nuisance but otherwise have no complaints. We've always found the place clean and the staff attentive and helpful.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ordered the pan thai number 35 for takeout and what I discovered was something I hear about but never experienced. My 5 year old daughter watched me take from my mouth a long hair that I could not believe was happening. Trust me I am not making this up. When I returned to show them the hair and the uneaten food, there was no apology, like I was making it all up. Just a refund was given. Talk about a novel experience!"}
{"text":"Since moving to the West Valley, we have been in search for good Thai cuisine! We found it!!!   We ordered lots of food, as it was a special occasion. We walked out with lots of leftovers, and more than satisfied with our dinner!  We ordered the Orchid Special Combination appetizer with egg rolls, satay, wontons, and fried vegetables. It was heavenly!!!!  Tom Kha Kai Soup - Rich and flavorful broth soup with lots of mushrooms and chicken. Some of the best I have ever had!  Phad Thai - a delicious noodle dish  Pha Nang - flavorful red cury  We will be back for sure!!!! The owner was sweet and checked in on us. The waitress was attentive and refilled our tea glasses countless times. Overall, we were more than satisfied by our experience! I am so happy I finally tried this place!"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant I've found on the Westside. My husband and I ordered the Spicy Noodle dish with chicken and it was delicious. My husband's dish was too spicy and the waitress offered to bring him a new dish. The food is definitely spicy and med/hot temperature definitely has enough spice. The waitress was very friendly and the food came out very quickly. We will be returning."}
{"text":"clean and nice inside. friendly staff.  As a vegan there are a lot of great options! They will make most things on the menu with tofu and they have quite a few different soup options  There are quite a few thai options in the west valley but this place is near the top"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the place. Quick service and great size portions. Friendly people and good prices also.  I would recommend people go here and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I have frequented this fabulous restaurant about 5 times now. I would never have considered writing a review, since I keep going back and that says volumes, however when I saw the ridiculous comments of individuals that consider themselves to be critics of dinning Establishments, I decided I needed to set the record straight, It is also amazing to me , that writing reviews has empowered people to come out of the wood work that probably should have stayed in the woodwork! Also, that there is even exists a forum for people to feel their importance, by insulting and giving misimpressions of an really nice restaurant where the staff is authentic and the cuisine is always predictably the same wonderful quality each and every time I come, and will continue to come. My first issue I wish to address, is to the customer that said he had wheelchair issues, well again, I have to say calling ahead , as my friend did, to prepare the restaurant, so they could put you in area that will be comfortable, is a way to eliminate any situation. It was actually the very first time I went to this restaurant, that I went, with my friend who is in a wheel chair and she had a completely different experience that other customer that was in a wheel chair, she was able to get around and go to the rest room, by herself without a problem. A lot of times you have to consider, if the person writing the review ,sees life in general, as the \"glass half empty\" The choices on the menu are really excellent, every time I go I try something different and have not been disappointed yet. Is this a huge restaurant ..NO, is it small and cozy?, YES, and it is beautifully appointed. I have been telling all my friends and business acquaintances about this wonderful \"New Find\" And if you don't like the owner talking to you, then maybe you should find some other restaurant, where the staff ignores you, to frequent. Personally, whenever I see a movie review by the \"critics\" and they pan the movie, that is the one that I end up liking!!!! So if you like friendly comfortable, great food at a great price this place is for you. If you leave the house with a bad attitude, then please don't come, because myself and my friends will probably be there. Bon Appetite! I give this 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  food was excellent, quaint, wonderful ginormous portiins so bring your appetite & service was excellent."}
{"text":"Really nice staff and restaurant. Ordered a curry and an eggplant stir fry with chicken. The curry was pretty good the chicken in the eggplant dish was quite bland. Another table at the restaurant had complained about a similar issue and took off right away. The staff were professional about the ordeal but it didn't change the blandness of the food."}
{"text":"Good thai food, reasonably priced and a nice atmosphere.  Been here several times and never had a bad meal.  Not the best thai I have ever had, but its good, close, and on the way home.  The lunch specials are very generous on size and tasty.  This place is my stand by Thai restaurant now."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple time. I wanted to write a review after my last visit. The food was lacking seasoning. I ordered the pad Thai and it has little to no taste at all.   The Dinner Spicy Noodle has everything else but very little noodle. The dish is noodles but has lots of onion, very little noodle! I was disappointed.   I also don't like the girls that run the place speaks loudly in their language. I find it rude."}
{"text":"I just cracked up reading this review!  Food is great, the owner needs to be behind the scenes!  My husband is going to pick-up some great Tom Kha Kai soup and Red Curry, both extra spicy!  Hope they get the message about the owner, we have been waiting for good Thai food for 6 years!  Don't mind enjoying at home, but would like to eat there at times with out being bothered by the well meaning owner!"}
{"text":"Tasty Thai food on the southwest side of Phoenix! Nice little restaurant in a new and clean shopping center --not a hole in the wall. The owners are usually present, and service is attentive. Favorite dishes include: Tom Kha Kai soup, Tom Yum soup, Spice Noodle (or Pad Kee Mow), Red Curry, and Spice Eggplant. Pricing is cheap to moderate, depending on how much you eat and whether or not you want to try lots of dishes (and take lots of leftovers home). :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I are vegan, and we love this place because it's only a few blocks away from our house and one of the best Thai places I've ever been too.   Several of the vegetarian options are also vegan, or can be made that way. Our favorites are the red curry with tofu and the flaming coconut soup.   There are always plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day, and the owners are very friendly."}
{"text":"I know some people from Thailand so I eat Thai food on a regular basis. This is very authentic and the Green Curry (Thai hot) was delicious! I'm in town for an assignment and I will definitely be back.  Most restaurants are too loud. This place was nice and quiet."}
{"text":"The hostess was very nice.  The food was OK.  We ordered dumplings as our appetizer and they were very hot on the outside, but very cold on the inside.  When our main dishes came out, they were very good."}
{"text":"I think the Royal Jasmine Thai restaurant up the street is much better. The food, service and ambiance is more authentic there."}
{"text":"I had never sampled Thai cuisine, though I had always been interested in doing so, and when I discovered a Thai restaurant near my house, last week, I thought it'd be a great place to have dinner with the fam.  First of all, the place is TINY!  I think there might be half a dozen booths along one wall and another half dozen tables.  When we arrived (party of five), all of the booths were taken and the front tables were occupied, so they set us up in the back.  Well, one member of our party was in a wheelchair - oh, boy!  This place is NOT wheelchair-friendly.  We actually had to ask the patrons to excuse us so we could pass, luckily, they were leaving anyway, but still, it's embarassing to have to interrupt someone's meal so you can be seated.  I ordered the Pad-Thai and other members in my party ordered the Stir-fried Eggplant, pork Pha Nang, pork Green Curry, and Thai BBQ sausages.  The portions were not at all large, but there was enough that we could each sample a little of everything.  The Pad-Thai wasn't bad; everyone in my party liked it.  I thought it had a weird texture and was awfully sweet, but when mixed with a little chili paste, it wasn't bad.  The Stir-fried Eggplant was really good.  It was supposed to contain jalepenos, but it wasn't at all spicy.  The Green Curry was actually the spicier of the two curry dishes that were ordered.  It wasn't bad, a little runny, but the yellow and green string beans were good.  The pork Pha Nang was by far the best dish.  It wasn't as spicy as I would have liked it (they season to order, but we were told they are prepared to medium, unless otherwise stated), but had a great consistency and was so delicious mixed with rice.    The Thai BBQ sausages.  *sigh*  We basically paid $9.00 for a couple of roasted hot dogs.  For that price, I could've gone to Costco/Sam's Club and purchased hot dogs WITH sodas that include REFILLS and still have money leftover for a pretzel or a couple of churros.  Now, of course, Thai dogs, er, sausages, have a different flavor and texture than Hebrew National or Nathan's.  They're similiar to longanesa, but with a higher fat content.  I noticed that the meat was mixed with rice before it was stuffed into the casing - sneaky, sneaky.  There was no sauce, or anything with it, and it was served on a bed of iceburg lettuce with steamed rice - very dry!    I wasn't too thrilled with our waitress (who I later found out was one of the \"partners\").  She brought the wrong order to my father and then argued with him saying that he ordered it, but changed his mind.  My mother was attempting to help my father and tried to explain that after the waitress took our orders, my mother asked my father what he ordered and he said \"the sausage,\" but she wouldn't let my mother finish what she was saying.  The waitress cut her off mid-sentence and began talking to someone else.  *jaw dropped*  I think we would have jumped up and left had it not been for the fact that we'd have to mow down some people with that darned wheelchair.  However, even after acknowledging that she brought out an order that my father didn't want, she tried to talk him into keeping it by saying that he wouldn't like the sausage because it was \"sour.\"  Now, the sausages sucked, I'll give her that, but they weren't sour, they were actually kinda sweet.  As to the owner, he was there the night we dined in.  He's actually a pretty nice guy.  Yeah, he comes up to your table and chats with you (I think he came up to us, like, 4-5 times, maybe because we indulged him), but he's harmless.  From what I discerned from his brief, but frequent stops to our table, he's not from this area and he just seems rather lonely.  He was polite enough to wait and approach our table when we weren't stuffing our faces or when there was a lull in the conversation, so as not to blatantly interrupt.  From what I gathered, he's one of a handful of investors in this restaurant and pretty excited about it.  I'm sure that after the business is more established (it's only been operating for a few months), he'll probably back off a little, especially if he makes more friends in this area.  From talking to him, though, we discovered that all of the cooks are actually from Thailand, which is novel and probably helps add an authentic flair to the dishes.  I wasn't completely thrilled with the experience, but the food was okay, not great - good-ish (factoring in amount and quality for the price).   I will go there, again, but only because I want to try their lunch specials.  Unfortunately, the Pha Nang isn't one of them, but they do have some other dishes I want to try out and the lunch specials, aside from having a reduced price, come with soup and egg rolls.  However, considering my experience with the waitress and wheelchair fiasco, I'll probably make my lunch order to go!"}
{"text":"Nice and clean place. The Thai iced tea and green curry were good. Not too sweet compared to others. We have also ordered the BBQ chicken and pad see yew, both were quite average. Overall an average place - not something I'll miss terribly if gone."}
{"text":"So glad this really good Thai place is in the West Valley.  They are a little pricey, but the food is great and authentic.  The decor is nice and the wait staff is very nice too.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very slow service,  few people here. Pad Thai was ok had an after taste. Heard another customer ask if the place had changed owners. Egg rolls small and almost burned. Thai tea was good."}
{"text":"Our food had no flavor at all. I ordered the panang curry (my favorite) and it tasted like peanut butter soup. It was awful. My husband had the Thai beef salad and the dressing literally had zero flavor. I do not recommend this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"5 stars for delicious and authentic Thai food 5 stars for the super nice and attentive service   my faves: fish cakes, yum woonsen, and shrimp salad= 2 thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"Took my kids to this restaurant, read they had good reviews. My kids and I love Thai food, however we where disappointed, the experience was less than satisfied. We ordered, Tom Yum Gung, fried shrimp rice and pad ewee, the soup was regular, could've been better, the fried rice needed more flavor and it had a lot of basil leaves, we also found egg shells, which my kid got groced out (they still charged us for it), and the pad ewee, the noodles seemed overcooked and needed more sauce. I will not recommend this restaurant. However the inside of the restaurant looked clean and pleasant."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I seriously love this place!! We've been to many Thai places in the west valley & they are typical Thai.  But Thai orchid's customer service is incredible & their food is delicious! The panang curry is to die for! & the pad Thai is delicious too! I love consistency, cleanliness, & customer service & this place has all three!"}
{"text":"This local hole-in-the-wall, is the best Thai restaurant in Avondale (well ok it's the only one). It easy to miss but once you find it you won't forget it. The menu is a bit beyond the standard Thai eatery, offering bold, authentic Thai flavors. If you love Thai food, this is the place to go. If you don't get Thai food, this is the place to go. For the spicy dishes they can make it as Thai as you would like or it. The service is very good and the owner and staff make you feel very welcome. You owe yourself a short trip to this humble, great restaurant."}
{"text":"We have lived in Verrado (west valley) for 7 years and finally found an amazing Thai place.  This was affordable, great food and amazing service."}
{"text":"so tried this out...had decent reviews..The place smelled delicious. The name is inviting. the hostess is hot.  So my girl and I go to try it out.   They brought us our drinks. $2.50 each. They brought us each a glass of ice and a soda can. LMAO-For reals??  No refills.  so for us each to have a refill would've cost $10 total in drink. I can buy like 4 12 packs of soda for that price. I mean if you are bringing it in cans, don't get mad at me comparing!  We told them we were going to smoke while we waited for our food. Then we just left. I would never dine and dash, but seriously, soda cans?  soda cans.  I have no idea how the food is."}
{"text":"Staff forgot to sub steam rice for brown rice and 'thai' hot is not actually 'thai' hot, it was fairly weak. Other than the small mistakes, the food is good, though I wish it had more kick."}
{"text":"Ordered online and my order was ready for pickup in ten minutes. The yellow curry with shrimp was amazing."}
{"text":"I can't resist a new Thai restaurant that comes across my path. Thus, I had to try the new Thai Orchid Garden that recently opened a few doors down from my favorite salon (Bella Rouge).   Two other friends and I went to Thai Orchid for dinner a few nights ago. They were already seated when I arrived. I parked and approached the door, and an older gentleman was sitting out front smoking a cigarette, which immediately turned me off. He started talking to me, greeted me, and opened the door to the restaurant. Ahh ... he worked there.  Turns out he more than worked there - he was the owner. He walked past our booth and sat down in the booth behind us. The smell of cigarette smoke was overwhelming.   After a while, the odor dissipated, and our waitress took our order. I had my old standby, Pha-Nang curry with beef. Cara had the Pad Thai, and Jenny had some kind of chicken and eggplant dish.   My dish was wonderful. We all devoured our meals and enjoyed each other's company. The only times I felt less than thrilled was once when I asked the waitress for more rice - she looked at me like I was crazy but then brought more rice - and when the owner came back over to our table and started passing out his business card. We were in the middle of a conversation, and he had interrupted ... it was just weird.   Will I go back? Yep. The food was good. But, more likely, I'll place an order to go when I'm over at Bella Rouge and then enjoy my Pha-Nang at home!"}
{"text":"The service over the years has declined, as well as the food quality. For what you get, the portions are a tad expensive. No complementary salad or soup either. Yellow curry and drunken noodles were just ok. Egg rolls seemed pre-made and greasy. This will be our last visit. There are other options that are tastier and economical."}
{"text":"Delicious thai ice teas and pad thai. Yellow curry is my wife's favorite and having several  levels of hotness make this a great place on the west side!"}
{"text":"Ordered Krapow Chicken and Pad Thai Chicken and both meals were excellent!  Had lunch before 3 pm so the meals came with a cup of veggie soup, fried egg roll and two crispy wontons.  The Krapow had lots of veggies and chicken & was served with rice for $7.25.  The Pad Thai had the glossy stir fried noodles, chicken, egg, bean sprouts, green onion and a peanut flavor to the sauce for $7.25.  You can add as much heat as you like.  The Jasmine  hot tea was also very good. Veggies were nice and crisp and not over cooked. Can't wait to return.  Check hours before going, Friday, Saturday and Sunday they are open all day."}
{"text":"It's good.  I come here pretty often, even more recently.  Especially for lunch.  Great lunch specials, can't really go wrong here.  I haven't had a bad meal.  The service is always exceptionally friendly.    Yeah, this is a go to spot.  I will probably make this a regular lunch spot.  Can't really think of why I've taken so long.  This is a definite yes, especially on the west side \"home of the bland\"."}
{"text":"My wife is Thai and we go to Thailand once a year to visit her family. I LOVE Thai food but can't always find one that doesn't cater to the phalang (think Gringo for Thailand). P. Generally the more Americanized ones are popular because they'll take it easy on the chilis and adapt some dishes to the American palate. Not this place, very authentic, hot means hot!    Fresh ingredients prepared the same way that I've seen them in Bangkok. I've had the Pad Kee Mao, Seafood Tom Yum soup (amazing), and the papaya salad, all were excellent. Service is good, restaurant is very clean, prices are very reasonable. This is my go to Thai place in the west valley."}
{"text":"We come here about once a week and it never gets old. Yellow curry is my fav but I always go for the  pad thai as well. The staff are always the best and the food is cooked to your tast, if you want to tone down the spicy aspect of Thai food."}
{"text":"I've only dined there for lunch and the food is REALLY good!!  The downfalls:  1. everytime I've eaten here there has only been one waitress.... The poor thing is running all over the place and very nice and apologetic BUT the time it would save (as I'm there on my lunch hour) to have one more waitress would make the experience much more pleasant!!!    2. only has 2 trays of spices for 8 or more tables  This is NOT the waitresses fault but the owner.  Please make the above changes."}
{"text":"Great food!  This is or first visit and the food was excellent!  It was quiet but the staff wad very friendly, clean & fresh food.   Fish cakes- fresh tasting & not a strong fish taste.  Pa'nang was terrific- hot but not Thai hot Thai iced coffee- delicious! Pineapple curry- sweet & spicy...Will make great left overs Pineapple fried rice-full plate & kick'n."}
{"text":"The best thai in the west valley, hands down. Now we just need a good vietnamese place!   Prices are a little high for what you get, but the quality is what matters. It's a nice quiet place, so its good place to go if you want to talk during dinner."}
{"text":"We're new to the area (just moved from California) and have been craving Thai so we tried this place out.  Ordered to go at about 6-ish and they stated food would be ready in 15 min. We waited 20 and then headed over for pick up.  When we got there, the food hadn't been prepared yet so we had to wait  - first bummer.  We ordered vegetable delight (name could be off) and it was just okay - second bummer; drunken noodles (medium) and they didn't have a lot of flavor or noodles - third bummer; and finally yellow curry with chicken (medium) and it was delicious....hurray!  One out of three - not sure if we will be back or not but if we do go, I'll only order the curry."}
{"text":"WOW!!!  This cute little places sits in an unasssuming strip mall on Indian School, just east of Dysart.  The owners take pride in this place, as the decor is very clean, contemporary, and colorful.  My first time was with three other friends, that were fairly educated Thai eaters.  I just went along with that they ordered...and boy was I glad I did!  We hade a coconut soup that was amazing!  So flavorful and the cute \"fire in the center \"pan it came in for us all to share was delightful!  Our pad thai and curry chicken was awesome!  I cannot wait to bring my husband here!  Way to go Orchid Garden!  Thank you for allowing me to have an amazing dining choice in my neighborhood (as opposed to all the chains)!!"}
{"text":"This is my sixth visit at this restaurant over the past few years.  I stopped in for lunch with a friend who has never had Thai food. I ordered pad Thai which is a traditional street food in Thailand, and chicken Krapow which I have never had. We also ordered Tom Yum soup which was excellent and has a great coconut base.  Personally I think their pad Thai is too sweet, maybe too Americanized.  Also I order lime to add to the flavor balance of spicy, sweet, and sour.  Chicken Krapow has a great garlic base and a variety of vegetables.  Dessert of fresh mango and coconut sweet rice is good- but be aware that sweet coconut rice is sweet.  Service is always good and the lunch menu is fairly priced with sufficient portions."}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant!!  VERY clean, excellent food, friendly attentive service. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Friendly, family run place with good and authentic Thai flavor.  Excellent Tom yum and drunken noodles. If you love spicy, then this is the place for you. For point of comparison, I can comfortably eat the hottest wings at anyplace I've ever been (BWW blazin, no prob). I ordered my meal here as a medium and it about blew my mind. So, kudos on some real serious heat while still having amazing taste."}
{"text":"The food was good but a little on the sweet side compared to other Thai restaurants I've had.  Nice staff though.  There's slim-pickin's in the far west valley for Asian foods so I can't really compare to others in the area.  Compared to others I've had around the country, three stars is about right."}
{"text":"One of my local go-to restaurants that isn't too expensive and has nice portions  Their Thai food is wonderful; especially their Pa Nang Curry and their Pad Thai. The food is great quality, in my opinion, and I love their Thai Teas and Coffees! The waitresses are all so friendly, the chef is very accommodating if you need something less spicy. They have a scale system of 1-5 for spiciness (1 being mild and 5 being deathly Thai spice). There is a wait for the food, but nothing unreasonable for such a nice restaurant!  I love hitting up their lunch specials, since it is so cheap for so much food!"}
{"text":"Great curry! Papaya salad is yummy too. I pick up curry from here to go about once a week. Can't get enough! Staff is very friendly. When I've dined in, the service was awesome. Love having this little Thai spot in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My husband and I like this place a lot!!!  We love the pineapple chicken fried rice and sample platter. Always yummy!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai was so amazingly good! We also ordered the yellow curry! Delicious! We are so satisfied that we will definitely return and refer :) service was pretty good too! Friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful Thai restaurant.  We have been going there since they  opened and it is always very good and consistent.  We normally order the same thing (chicken yellow curry and chicken red curry), so we can't comment on all menu items.  Medium spicy is, in fact, medium spicy, so we enjoy the fact that the food isn't bland.  The problem is every time my wife and I crave Thai from TOG, we are always in the mood for the same items that we always order.  We normally order To-Go, but the restaurant has a nice interior.  We like supporting this local, independent restaurant."}
{"text":"My girlfriend sends me an email and says that the cafeteria manager at her school, Wanna, has a Thai restaurant in Avondale.  After doing my friend a favor, she and her husband take me and my husband to Thai Orchid Garden for dinner.  My friends are rather new to Thai food - my husband and I really enjoy it.  We have found a new Thai food place to habituate!  We loved the Thai toast with its wonderful sweet dipping sauce.  The pineapple fried rice was the best I've had in town, and close to the best ever.  My pad thai was delicious, moist, slightly sweet.  More cilantro and more meat  would have made it better, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  My husband was less impressed by his pad see ew.  Friends' meat in garlic sauce and sweet and sour chicken were a hit.   We were quite full, but had a taste of the Thai custard and sweet rice - a perfect finish.  The service was very, very friendly and attentive.  The restaurant is clean and pretty, with hard wood floors, celiings in green and white and cool, multi-colored ceramic tile walls.  It is small - with booths and tables that can be combined or separated.  Friendly staff, really good food at good prices - we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Never again:  Bad food; bad service; billing overcharges on our credit card.    We do NOT recommend this restaurant.  We live in the area of this restaurant and went for dinner on a Saturday night.  It is a small restaurant that appears to be family owned.  We like to patronize local restaurants and prefer them over chain restaurants.  We are both raised in Arizona and grew up on very spicy Mexican food.  We asked for a medium-spicy sauce and told the server we did not want them too spicy as it was late.  But this food was beyond belief.  We got a scorching hot sauce. Both dishes we ordered were so hot we choked on the food and the inside of our mouths and lips burned for a few hours after the meal.     FYI, the food would not have been very good even if it were not so burning hot we could not eat it.    The service was awful.  We were never asked if our meals were to our liking.  When we finally flagged down one of the two servers, she took one of the two dishes in the back and they poured coconut milk on it but it did not help.  She did not offer to take the other dish back.  She could see we did not eat much of the food and finally just asked for our bill.  The server did nothing about the second dish.  When we got our bill of $26.90, we gave them our credit card for payment.  When the credit card slip and our card were returned to the table, we were charged $46.39!  Where the server got that number is a huge mystery as there was only one other table in the restaurant who had yet to be served their food.  When we brought the incorrect amount of our bill to the server's attention, the server told us she would give us another receipt?  That did not sound right.   We insisted they refund our credit card and charge us the correct amount, which they claimed to have done by giving us a second receipt with the correct amount on it.    However, the next day, we checked our credit card statement and found only the higher charge on the bill (the first, incorrect charge was never refunded).  It appears they did not send in a correction to get it removed and replaced with the correct amount.  So we called the restaurant the next morning to ask for the manager.  The woman answering the phone first told he was not in on Sunday and was at home.  When we explained the problem and told the person who had answered the phone that we were calling our credit card company to get the charges taken off, the manager quickly got on the phone to talk to me.  Interestingly, he seemed to know all about the overcharge as did the woman on the phone who answered.  The manager then called us back about 30 minutes later and said we should get a refund in a few days on our credit card.  Only time will tell.  Hopefully, that will be the case.  But it was a big hassle.  And, if we don't get a refund in a few days, we will have to go through the whole dispute process.  I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt that this was just a mistake, but it is hard to figure out how the bill could have been increased so much when only one other table was left in the restaurant and the amounts were not even close to the same nor were the numbers on the higher bill similar in anyway to the amount on our bill.    We really root for local restaurants in our area to succeed but there is no winner here. Sorry but this was horrible service and an awful experience.   We will not go again for obvious reasons."}
{"text":"Ordered something different today and I love it!! Beef salad yum! Normally I get the pad Thai, or the papaya salad but I was looking for something a little different and I wasn't disappointed! Very fresh and flavorful"}
{"text":"Me and my wife love this place!  We always get the Tom Kim soup, an order or 2 of fresh spring rolls (1 usually with shrimp). She gets the Pad Thai, which she likes better here than another Thai place we have been to.  I vary what I get but usually go fir a curry dish. We are wimps as far as heat goes and get everything medium, which turns out great for us.   We often will get a to go order for the next day whenever we make it into the city.   I use left over soup as a base for making an awesome rice dish."}
{"text":"YES. Delicious! Their papaya salad is fantastic! I am often disappointed by this dish, but lordy it was perfect. My go-to of tom kha was pretty decent, though it could have used more mushrooms. We must have come at a strange time of day/week - somehow the entire eating section was staffed by 2 women. They did an excellent job of keeping up with all the tables, despite the shortage of help."}
{"text":"We tried this place out with two of our best of friends for dinner one night.  Terrific service, delicious Thai food...some of the best I've ever had!  The yellow curry and pineapple fried rice are a-maz-ing!!  My only complaint, the restaurant is kind of small, they need to expand...it gets busy in there!"}
{"text":"Service was quick but im a vegetarian and their was meat on my plate. So that was a bit of a turn off."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  I'm sorry to have to downgrade my review. I've been coming here for a few years and I believe they recently switched ownership or management. Something is different. The chicken in the curry is always miscolored (gray spots) and very dry/tough. I can no longer order curry from here because it is so disappointing. I do still enjoy the soups though. I wish they sold the egg drop soup they sell with lunch combos, it's the tastiest I've ever had. Other winner is the clear noodle soup (veggie only, same reason for not including meat).    Original:  They have the BEST curries ever. Love the red, yellow, and Panang! Good lunch specials too, love their soups. Clear noodle soup is also super yummy here. Waitresses are very friendly! Definitely give it a try, it's a regular for us!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We recommend dumplings, pineapple fried rice, spicy noodles. and green curry. Homemade coconut ice cream and sticky rice with thai custard...oh my!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Probably my favorite Thai around. Small dining area with good service and excellent food."}
{"text":"I agree with some of the fellow yelpers... this is some of the best Thai food around. I came here with just the occasional craving that I get for Thai food, expecting maybe average results... boy, was I in for a Treat! I ordered the Yellow Curry for lunch which has Chicken and potatoes, side of rice and eggroll(Amazingly delicious) also came with a small bowl of soup(also really good). I will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"My go-to Thai place in the West Valley, probably because it's the only one. One warning though for vegetarians: order exclusively on the vegetarian menu. Once ordered a curry and asked for no chicken but still received chicken in it, had to take it back. Just made it easier on everyone by sticking to the veggie-exclusive menu. That being said, my only other complaint is that their dumplings are deep fried. But it's very good yes."}
{"text":"It's good but not the best. Service is quick and prices are decent."}
{"text":"The Pa Nang chicken and shrimp is phenomenal! The sweet rice & mango is also excellent. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai and spring rolls are great! The lunch specials are well priced. They have a military discount too. The service is always good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! They have the best wonton soup. Rich, flavorful, and delicious! The food runs on the spicy side so beware! But definitely one of the best Thai restaurants I have ever been to!"}
{"text":"We moved to AZ 2 yrs ago and have been looking for a Thai restaurant in the area and this one is the closest to us; otherwise we have to drive 30min to an hr out for any other options. We have never had a bad experience with the food or service, the gentleman is a veteran and is always friendly to customers and we have not had to wait for service although there may be 1 or 2 waitresses for the small restaurant. We have had take out and it can be 20-25 minutes for the order but I don't think we've had to wait any longer for it. It's the not THE BEST Thai food but it'sgood enough, no one will ever be as good as my mother's cooking was and I sure miss it. I have tried other places along the way and no one has ever come close to my mom's cooking, it depends on what part of Thailand they are from."}
{"text":"Food is good however service is slow. Still waiting for my bill.  Also the ambiance isn't anything special. But I would come back for the food."}
{"text":"When I was in Iraq, we had this term called Iraqi princess. This phenomenon would turn a sub-par/ fugly girl into a goddess, this would be due to the fact that they were the only girls in Iraq .   That being said, I have to conclude that this event has been mimicked in Avondale.  Extremely slow service with only 3 other diners.  I didn't know Maruchan made pad thai! It was a pitiful, tragic attempt at a Thai staple.  The noodles were congealed into luke-warm mass of mush, and the chicken was cold.  Insipid doesn't begin to fully describle the lack of flavor in this atrocity.    The Mus Sa Mun curry was watered down, chicken was tough, potaotes were undercooked, and peanuts were few and far between.  Oh yeah, the dirt and smudges on the tile next to my table looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while.  I am completely blown away by the 2,3,4,and 5 stars this place recieved. Just because it's the only one around does not make it \"royalty\". I would rather eat at any fast food joint. ANY."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try out this place since they have tremendous ratings, but it did not meet my expectations on several ways.  First off, it was a SUPER busy night and they only have one server. I felt really bad for the waitress but she was on a rush since it was just her. Didn't really had time to order.   Second, the food was ok. We order 2 pad thai, 1 thai soup with pork, pad see ew, and green curry with rice. The waitress ask us how spicy would we want the soup to be and we said mild, it was nothing near mild. One pad thai came with peanuts and the other didn't, ask for lemons and we never got it. Also, the pad thai was so sweet. I know pad thai is supposed to be like that but it was too sweet for this one. Pad see ew was very salty. It taste like they pour a bunch of soy sauce over the noodles and call it like that.   My experience was bad and I'll probably won't be back.."}
{"text":"This place is the best kept secret in Arizona!  Absolutely amazing food. I live in Michigan and stay at the Wigwam Resort every 3 months for business, since 2007. Each time I visit I eat here at least 2-3 times if my schedule allows. If I'm REALLY busy I have it delivered to the hotel by a delivery service.   I have searched numerous cities and States for Tom Kai soup and Thai Iced tea to match this quality but have yet to find a place that does them better; most don't measure up. Same goes for the curries, including the Panang. The flavor in the Papay salad is unparalleled but be careful - it's one of the hottest dishes they have; not for the faint of heart. Unless you routinely ask for (Thai level) hot, you might want to ask them to make the papaya salad mild (even if you normally get medium).    What would I give to have Thai Orchid Garden in my hometown? Hmmm... not my first-born child but CLOSE. This is my favorite Thai restaurant anywhere in the U.S., and since Thai is my favorite type of food, that's saying a lot. I'll be in Phoenix again 2 weeks from now and I can't wait for my first opportunity to eat here again!!!!!   An absolute MUST here:  the Tom Kha Kai soup (comes with chicken but you can ask for shrimp if you prefer;  both are great). I literally want to scream/yell out loud / shout to the rooftops in glee when I eat it....it's THAT good.   I have referred at least several hundred people to this restaurant since I discovered it in 2009;  everyone who's given me feedback later have agreed the soup is the best anywhere.   And again - I didn't realize how tough it is to make superb Thai iced tea until getting it here.  Several friends and I (all who live in different states, 2 of which are in New York) went searching for several years for restaurants at home and during travels which could make it as well but so far no luck. Several of us have tried making it at home and no luck as well even as we vary recipes.    On a scale of 1-10?  I rate this restaurant a 20.  I just looked at the other reviews and have some comments:  1) I loved the food with the first owners, but service WAS often slow. One of the partners was the older guy who always looked like he was in a bad mood - I just ignored the service issues in general because the food was so great. 2)  the new owners are very lovely people, the service is more consistent, and the food is as great as it used to be and on some dishes even better. They guy who said they were below average in 2011 must've expereienced them on an off night - I can't think of any other reason for a review like that.  In general, please note the dishes are a little hotter than they were with the previous owners. Definitely \"Thai\" hot.  I used to order medium for the curries and now I'm getting mild. I am not a light weight particularly in terms of heat."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food around.  The place can get packed, and they do tend to get a bit overwhelmed when that happens, but the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been to both Thai gourmet and Thai Orchid (same area).  Thai Orchid is by far a better Authentic Thai restaurant. Food is freshly made and delicious. Service was friendly and prompt.  You can't beat the price. While there try the green papaya salad and soup, It's exactly the way it's supposed to taste!  If you're trying to decide which Thai restaurant to go to, search no longer, go to Thai Orchid!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in my neighborhood. The Tom Kah Kai chicken soup is addicting as is the red curry chicken. Been going here for a couple of years now and have never been disappointed re food or service. Everyone I have encountered is very pleasant and accommodating."}
{"text":"BUG FOUND IN FOOD. MANAGEMENT WAS RUDE AND UNHELPFUL. Ordered from here today online, picked it up, brought it home. We ordered several meals, egg rolls, and wontons. We ate a few of the egg rolls and wontons. As we opened and went to eat our vegetable meal we found a BUG in the food and imediately left to go return all the food. We politely told the woman working the front of our situation and apologized to us for the problem and said she could probably get us a cash refund. However she had to go to the back to get her boss/cook (she mumbled a little). When he came out he blatantly told us we had to call a number from the online website we ordered from. We requested that we get our refuns upfront because he had to use that money to get our dinner somewhere else! He refused and his explanation was that it was going to cost him 10% more! He was being extremely rude and hostile of the situation. He continued to accuse us of putting the bug in our food just to get our money back! None of the other entrees were touched. As we demanded a refund upfront he kept saying that he can't afford to refund us due to his extra 10% loss. We told him he should take responsibility and be held accountable. We made it clear to other customers of our situation because people shouldn't eat in a place where a eatery's boss wont apologize for having a bug found in their food. He told us he didn't care that we found a bug in the meal, and told us \"it is a worm\". He told us we could call the police on him, he didn't care. We knew he would lie to them anyways and say we put it there. It was terrible customer service and we had to call the online company and request a refund that is going to take 3-5 days. I do not reccommend coming to eat here. 52393234420__634179CD-6C26-46CF-BF20-864096C621F5.JPG IMG_0766.JPG"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here with my wife.  Great food and a nice relaxed atmosphere.  It's great to have a quality Thai eatery this close to home!  I had curry and it was nice that they asked how spicy I like my food.  I'll agree with the comments about how quiet it can be but hey, its a small place."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent and efficient service...beverages arrived right away, food prepared and served hot and quickly.  If you enjoy Thai food you will like this restaurant.  Our waitress JC was sweet and pleasant.  This will be one of our regular haunts."}
{"text":"I love the food here. The service is always friendly and they seem to remember who you are which is amazing because I know a lot of people go through here.   Soups are fantastic and if you want pasta overload, their pad Thai is amazing."}
{"text":"I decided to hold off reviewing this restaurant after my first visit and I'm glad I went with my gut. This place is very inconsistent with food and service. Our first visit was spot on with hot food served hot, cold food served cold and EXCELLENT service. Our second visit was the polar opposite; food tasted 'old' hot food was lukewarm, drinks left empty for a long time, service very slow. Our 3rd visit was somewhere in the middle of both of these visits.  If you're willing to roll the dice and give it a try, I hope it's a good evening for you. When they are on, Thai Orchid is OUTSTANDING. The egg rolls are superb. The thai bbq was outstanding. The thai tea is delish.  The service can be friendly, fun, and spot on. I hope they work on consistency and get things in a good direction."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted on whether they should have picked the same font and color for their sign as The Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I like the food.  Love the thai iced tea.  I can inhale those.  The pad thai is very good and I love the pineapple curry.  I did order some egg rolls for the kids one time and the meat was bad but they replaced it so all is well but a tiny bit scared to go back."}
{"text":"I could have sworn I wrote a review for Thai Orchid...I've been here at least 10 times.  Weird.  Out of my several favorite Thai places around the valley, this one is near the bottom of my list.  Their food is a bit bland compared to others first and foremost.  But I also hate going in here when I see the white van in the handicapped spot right up front.  It means the \"weird old guy\" is in there and will create one of the most awkward eating atmospheres ever.  He hovers and says really weird things to us every time we are there.  The food isn't enough to make me come running back unless we aren't in the mood to drive too far for Thai.    I always get the Pad Won Sen while there and it is just okay.  I ask them to make it medium every time even though it is not part of the menu description and that gives it only a slight change in flavor.  My husband gets their Pad Cee Ew and he seems to like it as well as the Pad Thai that my mom enjoys each time."}
{"text":"BEST THAI FOOD ON THE WEST SIDE! Hands down! I love this place!! The food is amazingly delicious, the service is always great. Been here alone with friends, co-workers and they've never let me down. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best Thai restaurants in the West Valley.  It is a quaint restaurant in a diminutive strip mall along Indian School road. But it's exterior belies its magnificent cuisine.  We have been here to visit several times, and have yet to be disappointed by their offerings.  The last time we were here, we ordered the Satay Beef for appetizers. For the entrees, we ordered the Pineapple Curry, Mixed Vegetables, and the Chow Mein.  Every one of these items were simply exquisite in their flavoring, and the vegetables just tasted so fresh and scrumptious. The Satay Beef was delicately flavored, and the peanut sauce that came along with it just enhanced its natural flavors.  Another notable trait of this restaurant is the server whose name is Ohn(sic).  She is so energetic, animated and cheerful!   Every time we have been here, she has been the only server, and she still manages to efficiently take care of every customer.   She is just simply amazing in her ability to treat each and every customer very well, and with a grateful smile!"}
{"text":"I have never had Thai food before but it has always been on my food radar. We found this restaurant down the street and decided to give it a try with my Mom. It is in a shopping plaza and decorated very \"Thai-ish\" on the inside as well so it was very comfortable and relaxing. We had the jasmine tea which was awesome! I have become a tea lover recently and this was very tasty addition to our meal. We ordered the wonton soup, the coconut curry, pad thai noodles and a ramen type of soup as well. All of it was VERY TASTY. I was very impressed with the service and the freshness of the food. All of the food came out hot as well and served promptly. I have nothing else to compare it to though, but this was a great experience for my first Thai food!"}
{"text":"The phad-See-ew with chicken was delicious, I also had the pad kraprow with shrimps and another with fish they were very good but I ordered them to spicy. The restaurant is very clean and quiet."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Hubby likes hot! Coconut soup is awesome! BBQ rib meat fell of the bone! It's one of those places that is a locals place. Friendly staff! Many people take out!"}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! Yum! Need I say more... if you are craving Thai food this is the place you want to be... food so AMAZING you definitely have to come back for more!!!"}
{"text":"The \"girls\" went here for lunch today.  This is a place that I have been to several times, but hadn't been there in quite awhile.  The food was always so good.  The food was just ok.  We were told by the server that the soup today was egg drop soup. What came out was tasteless broth with bok choy pieces and nothing else.  One ordered the \"tureen\" of hot and sour soup.  I am not sure what it was, but it wasn't hot and sour soup.  It had tons of grease floating on top and was dark red.  It had 4 large bay leaves floating on top.  Service was horrible.  We were missing things and items were wrong.  It isn't as though it was busy.  There was only one other table with two people.  Our group decided that we were never going back."}
{"text":"Great food as always!  Panang curry is the best! A lot busier tonite got than we are used to seeing."}
{"text":"Great food! Although not exactly traditional Thai food... Americans wouldn't be so excited about it. But overall good food and service."}
{"text":"Food was good but not the best Theo food. Our waitress was super friendly and just awesome all around. This was my first time here but the great service will definitely keep me coming back"}
{"text":"Excellent Tom Yum soup and delicious Pad Thai! We go here about once a month. Love the food and quick service."}
{"text":"The place was clean, great service, great foods. My bf ordered chicken fried rice and they put too much onions that it overpowered the flavors. Other than that we would come again."}
{"text":"Nice quiet Thai place. Good food, near authentic, but with some Americanization as most Thai food places must do to suit American taste. Good service, adequate portions and tasty  food. Could be a bit more spicy, but I always ask for some spice and they give me a small plate of it to sprinkle on. The times I have been there (5), it has been fairly crowded but did not have to wait to be seated and wait times for food were certainly acceptable. Solid place that I visit when I want some Panang Curry. I will continue to look for quality Thai places, but thus far, Thai Orchid is near the top of the charts for my section of Arizona."}
{"text":"A co-worker  and I went to Thai Orchid Garden for lunch. I had chinese, and my co-worker choose a Thai entree, which gave us the opportunity to sample of both.    Thai Orchid Gaden offer beers, wines, and sake, but no full bar.  Our server appeared immediately, handing out menus and taking drink orders. They menu is large, with many tradtional Thai and Chinese food offerings.  On this visit we had Won Ton Soup, Mini Fried Eggrolls, Pad Thai, Chow Mein, and Cashew Chicken. All our entrée's were flavorful, and plated perfectly.  The chicken was moist and the veggies are tender crisp.  Everything was well seasoned and served quickly.  Thai Orchid Garden offers  a large selection of lunch specials at reasonable prices.  The service is good,  food is tasty, price are reasonable, and the servings are generous."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food - we had been looking for a place on the West side of town - so glad we don't have to drive to Tempe or Scottsdale any more. Green curry was excellent (secret tip - order Thai Hot if you want it really hot!) and the pineapple curry was really good as well. Spicy with hints of sweet. The fried shrimp rolls reminded us of lumpia and was golden brown perfection. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in west valley. Fresh spring rolls are fantastic as well as green chicken curry and spicy noodles."}
{"text":"Very very good Thai food, great prices, home cooked, great service, not much else I could ask for!"}
{"text":"The Good: Yummylicious Tom Yum, Garlic chicken and fried rice...Great location in the west valley, clean and pleasing to the eye. Food is consistently good...  The Bad: Bad service, esp. older guy, reminds me of Uncle Fester since he does not even talk or make eye contact when you enter.  Awkwardly quiet sometimes and you can hear everything everyone else is saying since it is a small restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the red curry chicken. It was a bit spicy but really flavorful! I'm definitely going back. Service was fast and the staff were really nice."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable. Fresh ingredients and lean chicken. Btw hot is hot. We like spice and can handle hot but we will order medium next time. Can't wait to try something new!"}
{"text":"Still my go to place for excellent Thai food.   The waitress was superb.  I couldn't be more pleased.  The red curry, so tasty.  I'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"I am just beyond happy to have a thai restaurant within a 15 mile radius of Buckeye, so I am not going to be too harsh on this place! After reading the other reviews, I can agree that the owner's presence is a little \"different\". However, it certainly doesn't detract from the food or overall dining experience. They are a brand new restaurant, and in his defense, I am sure he is just doing his best to connect to customers and make sure everyone is happy with their food and service. With time I am sure that will go away. I have gone twice so far, both times eating inside the restaurant. The food was really good both times. Certainly not the best thai food i've ever had, but i will take what i can get to avoid a long drive into downtown Phoenix or Scottsdale. The waitress, being Thai, naturally has a bit of a hard time understanding our English. This is to be expected in any ethnic restaurant you go to...cut her some slack. If she looks at you like you are crazy, it's probably either because you ARE, or that she is just trying to discern what you are saying. Service was always very friendly and warm. I intend to go back to this place as often as I can to keep them in business, and I encourage everyone who reads this to check them out. It will be well worth it.  They now serve alcohol here, which is a great plus! :)"}
{"text":"I have to start with the fact that we haven't had Thai food before.  The hostess was very nice and sat us and got our drinks. Sadly, it went downhill from there. My husband asked to sample a small amount of sauce to see if he would like it before getting an entree and after much back and forth was told no. We got a soup that I enjoyed somewhat but it had something odd in it that was not meat or mushroom no one asked how it was. Both of our entrees had ok flavor but both dishes had meat that was very tough and off flavor, my beef his chicken. Again she never asked if everything was okay. She asked if I wanted a to go and when I said no took my plate either not noticing or choosing not to see that all the meat was still there. So was it just that we are not fond of Thai food? Maybe but the service was less than helpful. I got the feeling that they have their regulars and if no one else comes they are okay with that? So if your a Thai enthusiast and know what you like go for it, but if it's new to you I would say find a more friendly to the newbie joint."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Thai food restaurants I have ever been too. I ordered the green curry and it was the perfect amount of sweet and spicy. The waitress was extremely attentive and friendly. I would definitely come here again :)"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for the first time here. Let me just say I rather take my money elsewhere. I was not given rice for my bbq chicken entree and the tom yum soup was not sour enough and lacking flavor."}
{"text":"Excellent food, affordable prize and great service... We all left satisfied."}
{"text":"The place was a little dirty and the food wasn't as good as I thought it would be. On the positive side, the staff was nice and I believe we were greeted by the owner upon arrival. I would not go back again as the food made both of us sick."}
{"text":"Very nice easy going American Thai. The lunch special is a great deal. Great service, my water glass is never empty. Youcan ouch your heat and Thai spicy is very spicy, I go medium or hot. I had had most of the items on their menu and have never been disappointed I especially recommend the #1"}
{"text":"I haven't been by in a few months, but I crave this place all the time.  The reason for the 4 star review is because its sooo far away, but the food is totally amazing.   I almost always order the PaNang when I go there for lunch.  It's served with a yummy bowl of soup a side of rice and an egg roll.  A great deal for lunch and super filling.  You can get the panang to your spice level preference, but I almost always go for mild as I'm a total wimp.  It is full of yummy peanut and curry flavor and the chicken is all white meat!  Definitely the best Thai food in the city, yum!"}
{"text":"One of the first restaurants we discovered when we moved out here turned out to be one of the best.  I had never experienced Thai before, I'm not a super picky eater, but I don't enjoy insanely hot food.    They took the time to explain the dishes, answer my questions, and accommodate my taste and order modifications.  We've been going back at least once a month since.    This is also another example of a restaurant that does take-out right.  They package things carefully, are sure to mark everything, and have yet to screw up an order, or leave out a side dish, utensil, etc.  In fact, they often include more sides than requested.  Not that I'm complaining.  If you've never tried Thai cuisine, or if you're a veteran, you don't want to miss out on this establishment."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai Food restaurants I have ever had. In comparison with some of the amazing Thai we've had living in Vegas, its right up there as some of the best. We LOVE the pad Thai, always consistent and flavorful with the right balance of peanut sauce to spicy. Never dry. We also love their fresh Spring Rolls with Shrimp and pretty much all of their appetizers have something great to offer. My husband goes gaga over their chicken wings. They are pretty great with the sweet chili sauce they come with. As long as nothing changes, we are customers for life."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Thai hot is actually \"Thai hot\". . . Hard to find authentic Thai food in the west valley but here it is!  Yum"}
{"text":"I got take out cuz I was too lazy to cook!  =)  I ordered:  Wonton Soup with pork - Good and flavorful Phad See Ew - It was pretty good Thai BBQ Pork - I did not like the flavor  Next time I am sticking with my usual (Phad Thai, BBQ Chicken, Satay)"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for dinner and I got the panag curry chicken with steamed rice, with Thai ice tea with cream and he got the spicy chicken noodles....mmmmm good! We'll definitely go back there again,  especially order the Thai ice tea with cream, maybe with a shot of vodka jk. Service was good too!"}
{"text":"This is a good little spot to go.. food is good the atmosphere is nice, stagf is very help full.. my wife is a vegetarian and they did have a nice choice of vegetarian meals for her.. we will go back to this spot and I do recommend this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"The food was good (fresh spring rolls) but the service was terrible. They had one woman in charge of seating and waitressing during the lunch rush.... Didn't seem to care much for her job or the patrons.  Update: It seems every other time we come here, there's a mistake in our order!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for years. But, between my crazy work schedule, taking care of two elderly relatives, and being so close to home, I never got a chance, until Thursday.   I ordered their Appetizer Combination Plate (a meal unto itself for 1 or 2 people), the Stir Fry Cashew with Chicken and steamed rice. And, of course, a Singha beer. ;)  Very good service, and the food was plentiful and delicious. While I was quite hungry when I went in (no lunch), there was enough to fill me up there, with enough left over for my lunch and dinner the next day.  I did find it a bit surprising that the dish, Stir Fried Cashew, didn't contain Cashews that had been stir fried. But, rather garnished on to the dish after it was cooked. I did make a friendly suggestion to put the Cashews in the wok, as it draws out the oils, and makes them more flavorful.  I've found my new Go To Place for Thai food. And, I don't have to drive half way across the Valley to get to it. :)"}
{"text":"Loved this little Thai restaurant. The ambiance is nice and the service was great. My daughter loved their wonton soup and my husband and I shared a spicy chicken pad tai. The restaurant itself was nice and clean and beautifully decorated. There was only one waitress tonight so things were starting slow but the waitress was so kind and apologetic that it didn't even matter. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"They have the best Thai food out here. I always go on the weekdays. The service is wonderful. The food is authentic and very flavorful in the right ways. I love their Tom Yung Seafood Soup. The Curry is also good. Yummy! I need to pay them a visit, I'm getting hungry thinking about it."}
{"text":"after reading reviews, i was SO excited to be impressed by this restaurant, but it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. I live nearby and stalled on trying this place but my recent lunch here was bland.   chicken wings were unseasoned and undercooked( frozen then flash fried), their pad thai had the basics but was lacking more tamarind/tart flavor by a longshot- asked for extraextra peanuts as well, their mongolian beef was a clear stir fry with the general cut vegetables(more than the beef) for their other dishes and lacking flavor as well. We both agreed not to come back."}
{"text":"Wonderful place! I drive all the way from tempe to eat here. It is by far the best thai food i have has in phoenix. I always hve thai tea, the coconut soup with chicken, green curry and if it is the summer FOR SURE the mango sticky rice for dessert! I love this place! I am a thai food snob."}
{"text":"LOVE. After finding this little gem nearly right around the corner from my house, I visited it nearly once a week for about two months. Pathetic, I know, but I couldn't help it! I take out-of-town guests there, and they all love it - with the exception of ONE time when we ordered take-out and it seemed like they had someone new in the kitchen and the food was very disappointing. However, since that was only one time out of many visits, I will give them the benefit of the doubt! I love the Chicken Pad Thai, while my husband gets spicy Vegetable Fried Rice. (Egg rolls are a must ... the spring rolls are not awesome.)"}
{"text":"I don't get out to eat enough to be a food critic, so don't take anything I say too seriously. I liked the style and ambiance of this place and enjoyed the quiet (although the owners might not have as the place was almost empty). The food was a little to spicy for my or my wife's taste, but that was expected."}
{"text":"The food is good as is the service however the menu is pretty limited if you are looking for more traditional thai food.  I tried the fresh spring rolls which were okay but not great and the pad thai which was a bit on the bland side.  Their deep fried tofu is excellent!  I would recommend Sala Thai restaurant as well!  They have a much larger menu."}
{"text":"Delicious food and speedy, friendly service. I especially like that they have stages of spiciness for any spicy dish."}
{"text":"The Spring Rolls and Pinneapple Curry were very good, but I just wasn't impressed with the atmosphere or service."}
{"text":"Went to try this place for the first time. It was 130 in the afternoon there were about 4 tables occupied. 3 other tables dirty. The waitress greeted us and offered us a booth but asked if we would wait so she could clean a table. We were ok with that. We waited about 10 minuets and she was doing everything else but clean the table we decided to leave. It was clean and the food that the other people were eating looked good but unfortunately their customer service was not so great. Probably managements fault because that waitress was the only one on the floor."}
{"text":"First time customer here. I ordered the yellow beef curry (spicy or hot) and I'm pleasantly surprised that I finally get a spicy dish.  I've been disappointed too many times in the past when spicy meant a couple extra peppers. This place has great food. The price is a few $'s high but worth it for the type of food I get.  I will defiantly get dinner from this place again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: B  (no music so created a abort of akward silence at times)  Service: A - very attentive and helpful  Food: delicious!  Price: B (a bit high for portions but not a deal breaker)"}
{"text":"Excellent food . Great customer service! If your vegan you def. want to come here . I love the fact you can order mild to extremely  hot . Great lunch and dinner specials as well ."}
{"text":"Chicken larb salad is one of my faves! As well as the Tom-Yum seafood soup. (Definitely order it if you are dining in for the presentation of the fiery cauldron it comes in!)   The staff can be hit or miss in friendliness depending on the server, but a good Thai place overall.   Oh, & definitely order medium heat if you are someone that likes extra spicy Mexican food. Unless you are eating with someone you are comfortable wiping your continuously running nose in front of -- The heat levels are more extreme with Thai chiles, trust me!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out tonight, and the only complaint I have is the crab Rangoon was the smallest I've ever seen anywhere. I know these are not made at the restaurant but I feel the management should know they weren't very good. Hardly any filling in them at all.  We ordered spicy string beans with beef and satay chicken. Both were spicy and delicious.   Very convenient to order and pay online through the Yelp ap!"}
{"text":"Green curry with vegetables is the best (and not on the menu, but they will make it)!  Mmmm...."}
{"text":"Upon reading all of these four and five star reviews I decided to try Thai Orchid. My experience was either drastically uncharacteristic of this eatery or it is a mediocre rendition of Thai cuisine. My entree dish was dry and over cooked and the spring rolls were underwhelming. How are they spring rolls with salad lettuce from the grocery store? I just think that is unacceptable. The service was slow, but I don't blame it on the two workers in the front. I am sure they were aware of how the night was going insofar customer satisfaction. A family next to me received the wrong meal and they voiced their concern. Overall, I don't recommend going here as it is not even close to the best Thai food in the west valley as many have claimed on the Yelp page. I dislike lambasting restaurants, but I can't hold back on this occasion."}
{"text":"We stopped in with our little one and the place was empty. They sat us at a table and the white table cloth was filthy! Someone had used it as a napkin. I told our server and she didn't move us.   I asked about a dish for our little one and they said they didn't have anything. we decided to get an appetizer to share. We ordered the spring rolls. It tasted like something you would buy from costco. At that point we paid and left. Such a bummer! We were hoping to have a nice Thai restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Terrible! Go somewhere else! We will NEVER go back! Awful Americanized non-authentic in the slightest! The spring rolls, although not representative of Thai land were filled with tons of shredded lettuce, celery stalks, shredded carrot, PARSLEY and 1 shrimp!!! When I asked about a separate menu with more authentic items, the waitress implied because the dishes we ordered were spicy it would taste authentic &  says Ohhh you ordered spicy! In my opinion hot does not mean flavorful!"}
{"text":"Tried Thai Orchid for lunch today...1st time.  Order was prompt, hostess was friendly enough but the food was less than satisfactory.  We ordered Pad Thai with chicken, two egg rolls and BBQ chicken entree.  Both orders contained chicken but are cooked very differently...both were extremely overcooked.  The chicken was very dry and neither of us ate it.  I will try again as this restaurant had great reviews, perhaps we caught them on an off day."}
{"text":"Very good dining experiance! Authentic and very tasty! The staff was honest and helpful, food was hot and and not to spicy unless you like it that way. In addition the place settings were clean and so was the restaurant. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Cute little place on Indian School with excellent Tom Yum soup and great lunch specials. The noodle dishes taste great and have a lot of meat and some veggies, but need more noodles."}
{"text":"The curry here is amazing.  I haven't really explored anything else. I am a fan of the spring rolls and the yellow curry.  They ask you how hot you want your curry so even people who don't like spice can still enjoy the delicious curry. The only down side is that there isn't a big seating so sometimes there is a wait"}
{"text":"Best TomYum soup ever love it ,live that it is so close to my house. I highly recommend this place,super nice people"}
{"text":"First time having Thai food and I love it! I love he fact that you can have a spiciness to your linking. I ordered the green bean beef and it was so delicious. The beef was tender and the green beans cooked to perfection. My daughters ages 7/10 had the chow neon with beef and they loved it. They loved the different types of  vegetables in their dish. It wasn't two pricey it's what I expected from a restaurant.   It was very clean. Waitress were phenomenal and checked in on my often"}
{"text":"First time here and the service was great and facility very clean. The server was very attentive and made sure we were okay at all times. The food was so delicious. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I enjoyed a quiet late lunch on a Sunday afternoon. The food was good and the atmosphere was special. I will ask for recommendation for my next visit . We played it safe ordering Broccoli with oysters sauce and stir fry chicken."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. Came here on a Saturday night and despite it being pretty busy, they only had one waitress. The waitress seemed flustered from the moment we walked in. It took about ten minutes for her to sit us down, although there were a couple of tables open. Finally when we sat down, we decided to order our drinks and food all at once so that we wouldn't have to wait forever for her to come back and take our food order. We ordered shrimp spring rolls, tum yum soup, mixed veggies with shrimp and spicy noodles with chicken. The rolls and soup came at a decent time. BUT we had to keep asking her for things she should have brought out without asking... utensils, straws, napkins. I've had the soup several times here and this time it was extremely sweet compared to other times. Not sure if there was a new cook. The rolls had ONE TINY piece of shrimp. Not worth paying the extra fee for the shrimp. After waiting about twenty minutes after eating our soup and rolls, the waitress asked if we were ready for the check. I reminded her about the rest of the food we ordered and she looked at me clueless. After reminding her what we had ordered she nonchalantly said that they had forgotten to cook it. You can imagine our disappointment to what should have been a nice, tasteful and relaxing Saturday night dinner. We asked for the check and didn't receive an apology for our main course meals never coming out. Horrible customer service. Will be looking for a new Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Thai places I've ever had. Placed my order and after about 15 mins it was ready. Out she came in a wonderful yellow box of awesomeness. I couldn't wait to get home. The small was amazing. I ordered yellow curry, cashew chicken, pork pot stickers and fresh rolls. I can't say enough about this place. I'm not a huge fan of spice and it was perfect for me. I'll defiantly make this my go to spot for Thai!"}
{"text":"I love Thai Orchid.  Food is fresh and they do a great job at special order requests.  Great staff and service."}
{"text":"Really great Thai food, nice green papaya salad and the way they make their tofu dishes is super, I don't know if it is the crinkle cut they use on the tofu, or some other cooking technique, but it was exceptional.  The veggies were cooked perfectly, not too crisp not too mushy and the spice level was just right."}
{"text":"I was craving Pad Thai really bad one time so I tried this place out.  I was hormonal and I actually cried because the Pad Thai was so bad. The noodles were over cooked and it had a weird aftertaste almost like a cockroach. It's hard to explain but I never came back. The Thai tea was good though. I was just so disappointed that they can mess a Pad Thai up."}
{"text":"The massaman curry, the drunken noodles, and...well... Every single item I've ordered has been delicious. Service is always friendly, and carryout is ready after just a short wait. They'll also give you small containers of Thai chili so you can adjust your spice as you choose."}
{"text":"Pretty good Thai food. I had the Vegetarian Red Curry. It was just the right amount spicy with lots of tofu. My friend and I also ordered the appetizer sampler which had fried broccoli, fried sweet potatoes, cream cheese wontons, chicken skewers and vegetarian spring rolls. It wasn't that great. Next time I'll skip the appetizer and just order a main dish. We weren't bothered by the owner, like other reviews stated. I'll probably go back whenever I'm craving Thai food!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere and excellent service.  We eat Thai food all the time and we know many Thai restaurants in The Valley . Orchid Garden is one of the best.  Fresh cooked food, excellent food quality .  Restaurant is very clean,  table settings are really nice - cloth table napkins, nice quality silverware,  clean glasses ( yes this is really not a standard in many places)  We will be back.  Papaya Salat was absolutely awesome, Tom kha gai soup delicious and spring rolls made fresh and  tasted  great."}
{"text":"I went there with my husband for the 2nd time on a Sunday for lunch. When we walked in, three booths had customers in them. We waited about 13 minutes before the \"grumpy old man\" came out and had the attitude as if we had bothered him. So he sat us and walked away. Finally, the one waitress came over and took our drink orders. While waiting to place our lunch orders, my husband noticed a cobweb coming from the window to the fake flowers on the table. There is a considerable gap between the booth and the window. It was pretty disgusting and appeared that it had never been cleaned along with the windows and seat backs of the booths, which are cloth. We most likely will not return due to the condition of the restaurant and lackluster service. I would rather drive an extra 20 mins to Phoenix or Tempe and be appreciated. I really did try to like this place and support a local business in my community."}
{"text":"We came in minutes after the restaurant opened at 11:00 after a hike on Saturday. We were greeted by our waitress who was just wonderful. We ordered a sampler appetizer to share and a side of sticky rice. It was really good. The restaurant makes their sweet and sour and peanut sauce that came with the order. Our waitress taught us how to say thank you in Taiwanese! We had a great time and will be back for lunch during the week."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE customer service by the waitress! Don't know if she has favorites and since this was our first time there if this is typical to service us the way she did. No smile when taking our order, bringing and taking our plate, rolled her eyes at my wife when she asked for a to go cup. Either she envied the way we looked or she's not cheerful at all. If so then she's in the wrong business.  Food was ok nothing to jump for joy about."}
{"text":"Really have enjoyed the food and the service was pretty good.  Some of the best asian food we have found in the Avondale/Goodyear area.  Their spicy soup is actually hot! (Yay!)  Of special note is their Duck Soup and their Thai Fried Rice.  Curry is good, but not remarkable.  Broths in the noodles are rich and flavorful.  This review is for our third and most recent trip.  I need to note that it seems they are starting to skimp some on the ingredients.  While still yummy, there was not much duck or noddles in the Duck Soup this past time.  Hopefully, they keep their quality up and we can keep visiting them.  It's a small, family-owned, and family-run place, which we like supporting."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant was absolutely great!! I had green ice tea which was made to order and settled for the lunch special, panang curry. This is my all time favorite Thai dish- the meal came it's egg drop soup, egg rolls and rice! I was the perfect portions for lunch and it filled me just right. I had the spice 3 but could have definitely had the spice 4. The meal was clean and the atmosphere was peaceful. I really enjoyed my lunch here and to top it off the lunch mea was only $7.99! I would definitely eat here again. I appreciated the hospitality from the waitress."}
{"text":"Awesome ... One of my favorite stops after work ! I came so hungry .., leaving Happy !!! Come try curry or spicy noodle !!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful and Clean on the inside!   What I love about this place is how fresh the food is. The mango and sweet rice is my favorite, but there is so much to try!   If you like coconut, try the coconut soup, you won't regret it! The prices are on point and the service is a tiny bit slower than it should, but for food this good I'll wait!   I have been here 10 times and have always left full and happy. The spring rolls are fresh and tasty, filling your mouth with an explosion of different flavors and textures. The curry chicken (I had yellow) was flavorful and delicate. I really could have had another two servings of this dish!   I'm not a fan of the fried rice, but that's mainly because I'm not a huge fried rice person to begin with. It was fluffy and full of fresh ingredients, so if that's your thing, enjoy!"}
{"text":"We love the Pad Thai and the curry dishes. Would give it a 5 star but, once and only once the Pad Thai wasn't great."}
{"text":"Came in here for Saturday night dinner.  Located just on W Indian School Road (in Avondale), just off Litchfield Road.  Lots of available parking and not difficult to miss with good signage.  The restaurant was very clean including all tables, with good lighting, and little on the noise level.  The inside is a bit on the small side (-1) but not a huge deal.   Staff were welcoming and friendly.  Very quick and attentive to take either your drink or food orders.  Wait times for the food was minimal and acceptable.  Very helpful with any questions we had.   Food portion sizes were great and more than adequate for even one person. Food was very tasty, fresh, and had lots of flavorful ingredients.   I ordered the ginger chicken entree that came with a side of rice (white steamed).  The rice was piping hot and sticky and was a perfect complement to the dish.  The ginger chicken dish was filled with lots of chicken and fresh vegetables and not too overpowered taste of ginger.   The menu is not that overwhelming and was very easy to comprehend.   Will definitely return as we thoroughly enjoyed the Thai food, the service, the atmosphere, and the location!  Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Extremely good service and very respectful which kinda surprised me tbh because we don't get that a lot in Az. Food was served in a timely manner and was very good, nice decor and interior, worth the drive, will go back."}
{"text":"To be fair this place was packed and it is not that big.  The first thing the server asked us was if we had reservation.  I was thinking in Avondale?  Huh?    So if you come here and you are reading this right now on your phone call and make reservations!  They had a table in back where they stacked all the server stuff and we asked if they could move that stuff and let us sit at that table.  They said that would be OK and they moved it for us.  Why they would put stuff on a table where a potential paying customer can sit beats me.  But they were nice and sat us.    The servers are really nice but can seem a bit confused at times.    We ordered a hot pot and two entrees.  Pad Thai and a Pineapple beef thing.    Our hot pot was freaking awesome.  Coconut milk and chicken cooked with lemon grass, ginger and mushrooms.  Very delicious!  The Pad Thai was nuclear orange and I can not figure out why.  I mean it was brighter then a suns jersey!  The noodles were mushy and the dish got cold fast.  The pineapple thing was very much an American creation.  I asked what the house specialty was and the waitress looked confused.  She suggested this as it was very popular.  After getting it I can see why.  I like traditional Thai food and was kind of disappointed that this was suggested as the house specialty.  The Thai ice was good.  Overall I will probably give this place another chance.  They need a little bit more work on management but the food was good not great and its Thai food in the west valley what can you say."}
{"text":"Came here a few weekends ago because we were in the West Valley and craving Thai food. My fiancé used to work at a Thai restaurant and we used to live by Thai Lotus on 19th and Glendale, so our expectations were pretty high. We started off with Spring Rolls, which tasted average and surprisingly were vegetarian. I ordered Pad Thai and it was the weirdest, worst Pad Thai I have ever eaten! The sauce was red and sweet, so sweet that I felt like there was extra sugar in it! Pad Thai and sugar?! What?! I tried to continue to eat it to be polite but ended up ordering a coconut curry dish to compensate for the flavors.  The good news is that they serve the largest Thai iced tea I have ever had. The decor is clean and simple, and the host was nice enough to not charge me for the Pad Thai.  Overall, the flavors of this place are bland or average at best, and if you still choose to eat here, avoid the Pad Thai at all costs!"}
{"text":"I used to live across the street from this place and would always order the same thing. Yellow curry with chicken medium spicy. It was always on point and tastes just as I would imagine it does in Thailand! Ha. All orders come with rice. I would usually get it for pick up and it was always cooked super fast and ready in 10-15 minutes! The staff was always friendly and after a while even remembered me haha. I'll be coming here when I visit."}
{"text":"My wife and I have never been here before. The food was fantastic and really fresh. The service was amazing and we never had to ask for a thing. I ordered the Vegetable Pad Thai. It was really spicy but really good. My mouth is burning but I like my pad Thai that way. The egg rolls and spring rolls were very good and the price is very reasonable. This place is a must for Thai on the west side."}
{"text":"Must say I was amazed with this place. The waitress was funny, helpful, and knowledgeable. We started by ordering the chicken satay,  I then choose the pa nang curry (hot) and must say I absolutely loved this dish. The gf ordered a spicy chicken, rice and basil dish which was equally good. As I always do, I ordered my thai iced tea with cream and must say that the large is just that. The pricing was more than fair, the place was clean, and staffed with very friendly individuals. I would definitely recommend it, and surely see myself returning in the near future"}
{"text":"New ownership has changed the flavor profile of some of the dishes. We have been back three times and we've given up - the food flavors are no longer true to the Thai concepts that were developed and served here. The original owners have left and the so have the original chefs. The Pad Thai that we were last served was not edible - it was red in color (?) and the flavor was definitely off. So, we find the menu is hit-and miss, at best."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place! Tasty, authentic food and top notch service! They always remember my order. I love the spicy noodles and the papaya salad."}
{"text":"Had the pineapple chicken curry for an early Sunday dinner. I've also tried out the fishcakes where delicious but not as good as the pineapple chicken curry. Looking forward to trying a different dish in the future. Service was really pleasant and it was quiet the time I was there as I was one of the 3 tables taken up at the time."}
{"text":"Really great good. We got the spring rolls which were really fresh and tasty. The pad Thai was delicious and my friend really enjoyed the curry.  My only feedback is the pad Thai noodles are too sticky. Definitely worth a stop in"}
{"text":"We arrived around 6pm on a Tuesday.  It was a dark and colder (colder for Phoenix, not cold for most climates) night.  The kind of night that is just right for some spicy Thai food.  It was easy to find a parking space near the entrance.  When we walked in there were plenty of available tables, so we got seated right away.  After we were seated, most of the other tables filled up quickly.  I have always thought of myself as a trend-setter and, well, this clearly proves that theory.  As I perused the menu, I thought to myself, \"yep, I am going to get the Chicken Pad Thai.\"  A short while later, I revisited that thought and pondered aloud, \"should I get the Drunken Noodles?\"  When the server came to take our order, the lovely ladies I was with placed their orders first.  That gave me just enough time to change my mind again.  I ordered the Panang Curry Chicken at a spiciness level of 2/5.    That little bit of heat was just right for my wimpy self.  The chicken was perfectly prepared, the dish had all of the typical ingredients, and overall it was some of the best Panang Curry I have had!  Would definitely order it again!  There was only one server that night and while she got quite busy with all of the tables she ended up assisting, she still gave us the proper amount of attention (other than my rice which was forgotten for a few minutes).    For dessert, we ordered the Mango and Sticky Rice.  Our server advised us that it is not mango season.  A tear slowly streamed down my cheek.  Oh well, I was better off not eating dessert anyway.  Overall, very good experience, but not my favorite Thai restaurant.  They will get another chance to try to change that.  For now, they get...  ****FOUR STARS****"}
{"text":"Delicious! Had their Pa Nang Chicken Curry and their Pineapple Beef Curry. Large portions with with plenty of meat and delightful Curry flavor. Would have been 5 stars except that Beef was a bit chewy. That of course can vary with cut of Beef. I will be back to order the Pa Nang and sample their other offerings. Great service and atmosphere. They do need to lose a phone system that gives an electonic announcement of who is calling over the restaurant PA system."}
{"text":"The Red Curry, Yellow Curry, Pa-Nang Curry, and the Pad Thai Noodles were loaded with sugar!  If you are watching your sugar intake, don't order those dishes.  I called to let them know their dishes were unusually sweet compared to other Thai Food I have eaten.  They told me they have always made those dishes that way.  The dishes would have gotten a 4 or 5 star had the sugar content not been so high."}
{"text":"Went to try this place today with high hopes because of the reviews. I made sure to express my food allergy to them and that it was vital that my allergen didn't touch my food, they guaranteed that it wouldn't.  I ordered veggie fried rice, looked good when I picked it up, got home, removed the giant slices of cucumber, and there it was!!! My allergen!!!  Ahhhh, first I'm not really sure why so many Asian restaurants use cilantro being that it's a Mexican herb.... Either way, that could've been a hospital trip   I called them and they were nice enough to offer to remake it, after telling me \"well it is possible it's not actually cilantro, you could probably be fine.\" I asked for a refund instead and brought the food back because clearly I can't trust that it would be made safe for me."}
{"text":"We went for my birthday dinner on Tuesday night. It was empty, but clean. Our server answered questions as best as she could and didn't rush us going through the menu (I hate when I am rushed). We had Hot Tum Yum with chicken that we ordered earlier than our main dishes along with Thai Tea. The Thai was great and you actually get decent size glasses for $3. The Tom Yum came out hot and fragrant. I am a chile whimp, so hot was on the edge of painful for me. It was making my ears tingle and mouth burn, but it seriously helped with clearing my insanely plugged sinuses (since we both got sick the night before). For dinner we ordered Spicy Noodles #32 I believe (Drunken noodles with chicken Thai Hot) and #44 Spicy Basil Chicken (Hot). I was at the edge of edibility with my lips burning, my nose running, my tummy gurgling and chugging my Thai Tea. We loved the flavors of the food. Some of the best Tom Yum I have found on this size of town. Just beware the heat levels. At Hot you can smell the chilies, Thai Hot smells like tasty capsaicin."}
{"text":"Great Thai food in the west valley. We go here for family events, order 10 dishes and go to town passing plates around. I've yet to have anything I didn't like, though I couldn't really tell you the name of everything we order (not much help I know). My only complaint is the size of the shop. When there's a big party like ours, we need to do a lot of maneuvering to let people out of the restaurant. Not much you can do about that except deal with it. Great for parties of 6 or less."}
{"text":"Overall, not a bad place especially since there aren't too many Thai restaurants in the area. Not my first choice but if you'd like a quick Thai food fix this place will do. I usually order the noodles and Thai Iced Tea. The wait time is quick and the servers are very friendly. I appreciate when I asked for the mango sticky rice the waitress told me the mangoes were not quite ripe so it wouldn't be so tasty."}
{"text":"The place looked cute. I got a yellow chicken curry from there. The dish had bamboo (which was the reason I got it) and chicken. They gave a lot of chicken but minimal bamboo. I got the dish at level 4 of spiciness with 5 being the spiciest. It was not spicy at all... it seemed like a level 2, more of a mild. For a Thai place, I was expecting something spicy. I don't know if the waitress told the chef a different level or what, but I was disappointed it was not spicy. Their Thai milk tea was good like any other Thai restaurant. I also tried one of their noodle dishes where the noodles look like fat rubber bands. The dish was good but a bit salty! This is also the first restaurant where I tried this desert called mango sticky rice. It was pretty good although I have no where to compare it to."}
{"text":"Roasted duck was way too salty. Papaya salad was way too sweet. Tom Yum seafood soup was just okay. I loved the white rice! Lol -_____-    The restaurant was clean and nice though. Service was kind of slow, but then again there was only one waitress. My friend knew more about Thai food than the server! Hahah   \"Best Thai Food in the West Valley\" Yeah right! Is it because it is the only one available? Lol. I rather drive 5 more hours West to California to get some good Thai food. I'm done with these mediocre to nasty Asian restaurants in the West side.."}
