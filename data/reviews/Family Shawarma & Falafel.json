{"text":"Regularly order from here. Good chicken Shawarma sandwich; order Extra spicy if you can handle it. There is another restaurant called Tasty Shawarma on west side of Pharmacy Ave which is also very good"}
{"text":"Every time I come I am satisfied. Literally. When I'm hungry and need to eat something I go this awesome place. This is one place I am never disappointed. And I am very critical. First of I order the beef shwarma. It is a mixture of warmth and crunchy texture. I believe the pickled turnips give it that extra kick. Price is  awesome! You can order three for  about 12 dollars. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Simply the best shawarma I've had. Very no frills but polite and fast service. Did I mention the delicious chicken shawarma?"}
{"text":"dont be looking for any friendly service here. food was average to below average depending on your hungry level...we had a group of 11, its seemed like two grumpy old men was just not interested in doing any business."}
{"text":"Having grown up on this type of food I'm well aware that the prices and deals here are amazing, however the food quality and portions are not up to my standards when compared to my other favorite spots for shawarma. They put very little meat and a lot of the times the meat is either tough or very fatty. If a deal sounds too good to be true it most probably is."}
{"text":"Two shawarma for 10 bucks, super tasty, chicken was way better than beef, but both still awesome, probably the better of the shawarma places around here"}
{"text":"Flavourful ingredients combine to make a cheap and convenient meal ideal for a lunch. The option to add fries to the wrap is a significant plus but the lack of pickles is a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"Been going here foreeeeeever! Seriously the best shawarma I've had and I've tried a lot of different places. I always get the mixed (chicken and beef) with fries inside ($1.00 extra and super worth it).  Two shawarmas for around $9.50 I believe!"}
{"text":"Shawarma competition is incredibly stiff in Scarborough, especially the far West end of Scarborough.  This isn't my number one pick for shawarma, but it is my number two! My friends and I are late eaters, and this place closes at 10pm. Even at the final moments before closing, their shawarma meats still taste super fresh!  Friendly staff, and amazing chicken shawarmas! A definite place to try!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  2 Shwarmas for $8.25.  Staff always accommodate when I ask for extra time on the grill."}
{"text":"From my understanding, this sprung up as a copycat of Tasty Shawarma (in the plaza next door) by some former employees, so the toppings, technique, and even prices are almost identical. Unfortunately they failed in some part of the execution because the resulting shawarma is dry and flavourless as compared to their neighbours. I would absolutely recommend crossing the street and going to the original spot instead."}
{"text":"Love this place! Most well seasoned, delicious shawarmas I've ever had...like ever. They have deals almost daily where you can get 2,3 shawarmas at a really low price. Didn't leave here hungry or unsatisfied. They have this spicy green sauce, I dunno if its jalepenos or what but it really takes the shawarma to another level. I urge you to try it out if you haven't. The day we went it was cold out but the food more than made up for it."}
{"text":"Good, cheap shawarma wraps. 2 for $10.75 after tax! Its worth the extra $1 to add fries to the wrap, it makes it so much better. Just wish they had pickles :("}
{"text":"We just hit this place up for lunch and I am satisfied!! Not only is the menu affordable, but the food is good. I ordered the Shawarma wrap with gyro meat.   I could totally see myself going back here!"}
{"text":"This is my new go to place for all my shawarma needs.  I've been to their neighbours \"tasty shawarma\" and I can definitely say this place wins hands down and for good reason.  As soon as I walked in I got nothing but the friendliest service, I ordered the veal shawarma plate with all the fixings and it was simply delicious, also came with a free pita bread.  Their garlic sauce was spot on and the salad was fresh.  Not much else I can say, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is great for a in-and-out snack. It's fast and surprisingly delicious. The only problem is that some times the chicken is a bit dry, and the sauces don't make up for it. The portions are perfect, not too big and not too small. I'm sure most people would enjoy it."}
{"text":"The best shawarma in the whole of Toronto !! I drive from Newmarket all the way down every time I got a craving !"}
{"text":"This is a cute little hole in the wall with good options and fresh delicious shwarma. I got some shwarma and a falafel plate. Both were delicious.   The prices were fair, 2 shawarmas for 9$ and a plate for 8$. It's really small, wouldn't recommend it for large groups. If you're in the area and just looking for a small bite though it's perfect.   The people in front was really nice and helpful to answer questions."}
{"text":"Schwarma is where it's at in Scarb! Another great family owned resto so if you are ever craving a schwarma plate or sandwich late, come here. They even have a wide selection of combos here which most places don't. And yes, just like the other reviews noted, it's super clean in here. The first thing we noticed was the cleanliness of the restaurant! We ordered the usual: chicken schwarma plate and a chicken schwarma sandwich. Ingredients were fresh but they don't have pickles which is a must have with your sandwich! I also like the fact that they grill their sandwich which makes it nice and warm with the char grilled taste to it. The prices are a $1 more than Schwarma Empire and they don't have homemade hummus like the other place. Still decent but not as comparable to lovely Schwarma Empire!"}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-3 Service-5 Food-5 Strikeouts-0/3  Small Dine in restaurant that serves Shawarma!!! Seats approximately 15 people, and mostly is for take out orders. This place is OLD, but they have kept the place in prestige condition. The price point is affordable to the point high school students will come in for lunch on the weekdays. Honestly, this place deserves a lot more customers than it gets. I've been here twice, and been happy coming out here twice.  $9.50 for two shawarmas. Forget everything else, chicken, beef or gyro. Not only is the dining area clean, but the kitchen is spanking clean. You think subway is kept clean? Look at each condiment and toppings and there's little to no mess at all. Ordered both chicken and beef shawarmas, but the beef has been sitting there a while, so it's a bit tougher than what I expected. The chicken was definitely my favourite.   If this place gets consistent people going in and out, I could see the quality of the beef go up because it would be more fresh. Just because it's rotating, doesn't mean it won't slowly dry out and lose it's freshness.   For price point, this place is probably better than most fastfood places in terms of quality and speed. On par with my favourite PHO place and that's saying a lot. Definitely worth coming here for the cheap food. No parking fees, and great service. There's usually two people behind the counter during peak times. Oh, they also press the wrap, so if you don't want it, you should tell them ahead of time."}
{"text":"We ordered a chicken shawarma plate for $8.85 and dined in the restaurant. Received a healthy portion of salad with a lot of tomatoes, but not enough rice. Meat was okay, just okay. Nothing special unfortunately.  I saw a lot of patrons ordering sandwiches and cheeseburgers and slightly regret not going in that direction."}
{"text":"Amazing, good quality, inexpensive food. My go-to sharwarma place Toronto! My favourite is the chicken sharwarma wrap."}
{"text":"a very good shawrama. I saw some people say it's too little filling? I don't think so, any more and the pita wrap will explode and it will be messy. I think it's a good amount of filling and what did you expect for 4.75? it's under 5 bucks.  the meat is nice and flavourful, they use an electric cutter to cut it and the meet is in nice small pieces. then grilled after it's wrapped up."}
{"text":"This place is dope. Exactly what I want when I go for shawarma- cheap food with huge portions for the price! If this wasn't an hour away from my place, I'd come here everyday."}
{"text":"I miss this place  When I was working in North York a co-worker got me onto this place  Two shwarmas for 6.00 was a deal that cannot be beat  That was my place to hit up and get a solid shwarma  Was always busy during lunch  I would always mix it up with one beef and one chicken  If I am back in the area will have to hit this place up again"}
{"text":"3 shawarma in pitas for $14 after tax. Portions are pretty big, but they could put more filling in the wraps, or wrap them better. The wraps were loose (as in you could very clearly tell there was space in them). They were also wrapped so that one side seemed to have all the salad veggies and the other size was all meat. Hot sauce isn't particularly hot. Kinda tastes like tabasco. Had I not known it was a shawarma, I wouldn't have been able to tell, based on the seasonings. It had the taste of regular grilled chicken. Their hummus is smooth, but a tad watery. Also tastes like supermarket hummus. They put a good toast on the wrap using a panini press though.   Upsides: The chicken shawarma, while on the giant rotating spit, looks like food porn. You can actually see the chicken juices dripping off of this huge spit of meat. It's beautiful. Service was pretty friendly too.  Interesting thing to note: The people running the restaurant are from Iraq, but they have gyros, souvlaki, and cheeseburgers on the menu. Cheeseburgers are like 2/$6.50 ish?"}
{"text":"They have really good prices and the taste is good. Though the customer service was horrible.  We were served by a grumpy employee, who was less than pleased to see a customer. Also our order of souvlaki looked nothing like the picture; in the picture the souvlaki comes with tabbouleh, we instead received lettuce and a few tomatoes with humus on it. I should say that the two shawarmas were accurate to the picture."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for a while since its in my neighborhood however, the customer service is absolutely horrible and I won't be returning again. The two men working here have terrible attitudes and really have no desire to answer questions properly. One of the men looks like he hates his job and his life and he doesn't care about how he makes your food. After getting upset at me for asking to buy a drink with debit because I had no cash they started complaining about me in Arabic and pretended that everything was ok. I felt uncomfortable because they would not explain the fuss they were making. Im guessing they just didn't care to explain themselves properly in English. It does not matter how well or how poorly your business is doing you should never treat any customer like that, it's very dissapointing.Now comes the food, this is NOT the best shawarma in Scarborough by any means, its average at best.  The garlic flavour is decent but the beef is often tough and the chicken either dry or too fatty. Go to Shawarma Empire or Ibrahim BBQ instead, their food is better and they treat you infinitely nicer."}
{"text":"I discovered this place through a recommendation made by a friend. It's in an unassuming strip mall located across Le Cafe Michi in Scarborough.   Family Shawarma does pretty well because of their meat and prices. I haven't tried the falafel sandwiches but the Chicken Shawarma is extremely tender and deliciously juicy. During lunch the line ups get a little crazy but they're less populated during late nights,  most likely due to the location.   The staff is short with you, but incredibly efficient at what they do."}
{"text":"My favourite shawarma lunch spot. You can't go wrong with any of their wraps, chicken, veal or gyro. I always ask for hummus to go with it. The wraps are toasted so it's nice and crispy on the outside and soft and tasty on the inside."}
{"text":"i love these guys.  falafels are made to order.  what i mean by this is that the falafels are scooped up like ice cream and then deep fried.  you get 4 per sandwich!!  ingredients are generous.  chicken and pork shwarmas are also made to order.  they do not pre-cut and have the meats laying on some tray.  they cut enough for an order.  service is great.  the servers may look cold and intimidating but they are cool guys.  i freaking highly recommend this joint for some wholesome food.  hell, eat here before you go to fairview mall.  why pay the excessive prices of the food court?"}
{"text":"Small out of the way place with really good food and great prices.  Seems to always be busy, so I am definitely not to only one who appreciates them"}
{"text":"Consistent shawarmas. They're not the most talkative people, and seem a bit surly - but they make a good sandwich! The prices are also ridiculous...in a good way. I think it's about $8 for any 2 sandwiches.   I've tried chicken, falafel, and the gyros.   If you're SUPER hungry go for a plate. I recommend Chicken - it's a huge portion of meat, rice salad, pita and a drink. I think you can sub the side.  Gyros taste good in the pita - Toppings include garlic (toum), onions, cabbage, pickled turnips (or are they beets? I get them mixed up) and I usually ask for hummus. Tahnini and hot sauce (a bit weak)  to finish off the sandwich. Then they throw it onto the press and so a nice crust forms.  Falafels are made when ordered...and they make a damn tasty falafel. I would definitely say their falafels are the best thing on the menu. crispy on the outside, nice flavour on the inside - and not too dry and not crumbly.   The fries are also decent-from frozen, but consistently good. I think it's a nostalgia thing for me though.    Cash only - but they do have an atm on site."}
{"text":"Just like Gina T. said they are not the most talkative people. I had to do the greetings and after placing my order for two chicken shawarma's it was made without a word. Finally, when it was time to pay I threw some change into the tip jar and finally got a thanks. Not that there was anything wrong with the service but some people may be turn off with the silent treatment. Some people are just more quiet than others.  The chicken shawarma's were excellent. Nice portion of chicken and all the toppings were fresh. A very filling meal for just under $9 after tax."}
{"text":"Great place. Food tasty and fresh. Amazing shawarmas. Friendly staff. No disappointments. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place must be the cousin to Tasty Shawarma...it is about 10 feet away from it with almost identical decor menu and style. They even have the same scoopers for meat!!!! It is, in my opinion, better in every way compared to its neighbor for the following reasons:  1) Not cheap on toppings - want a little more radish? maybe some extra hummus? some spicy chopped jalapenos? They'll do it with a smile and not charge you 50 cents for a spoonful  2) Sauce - the sauce is like day and night..it is so flavourful and not watered down. If you like garlic sauce, oh man this one has a nice punch to it  3) Condiments - as noted by pictures above there is self serve hot sauce, vinegar, salt, pepper   4) Beef Shawarma - The beef actually tastes....well like beef. Its falvourful, not too salty, and a good meaty taste. I can't tell you how many times I've gotten beef shawarma and it tasted like disappointment with a lot of salt.  Overall if you have to choose between here and Tasty Shawarma...come here. It is better in every aspect! (No offense to all the Tasty fans out there)"}
{"text":"Love this place! I heard of family shawarma , and stopped by to check it and ordered a Beef shawarma. It was very tasty and not too spicy at all. It's filled with fresh veggies and great taste hummus dressing. Portion size is pretty good, as well as the price 3.49 for a shawarma. The other day i tried their beef burger and it was very yummy. Good place to stop by for lunch, prices are reasonable and the quality of food is great.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ok so the shawarma is AVERAGE.  The sandwich is CHEAP.  The staff are RUDE. They add an extra DOLLAR for credit card payment.  There's another one in the next plaza which I think is better."}
{"text":"Delicious shawarma!  Prices are good also, really close to Fairview Mall so if your looking for for a place to get a bite to eat after shopping this is a great choice. Chicken is tender and tastey.  Too bad I live too far :("}
{"text":"New location on Victoria park south of finch. This is my go -to place for shawarma! Love this place and the older gentlemen is the definition of hospitality!"}
{"text":"Best shawarma's ever!!! I'm not an expert when it comes to shawarma's, but compared to other places I've tried, nowhere else can compare.  $1 to add fries to your wrap.  Delicious fries might I add... very addicting."}
{"text":"I've come to this place a couple of times now after I was told by a good friend it was pretty good for some fast food chicken schwarma!   Boy was he right! The service is very fast and the vegetables they use are very fresh! The only thing I would complain about is the size of the schwarma wraps. They need to fill it up a bit more! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!   This place is also very clean inside. Which is a great bonus! They have a special for 2 or 3 schwarma wraps! Love it here!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  Great falafel and shwarma.  They make it their way and even though I'm a regular and I alway ask for extra pickled turnip they never give it.  Oh well.  No debit but they do have an ATM there."}
{"text":"This is my favorite shawarma spot in town. To me it doesn't taste all greasy like other spots. it's filled with veggies and the perfect hot sauce. The shawarmas taste healthy if that makes sense lol.  They are friendly here and the shawarmas are a great price.  Pay the extra dollar and get some fries I'm the shawarma."}
