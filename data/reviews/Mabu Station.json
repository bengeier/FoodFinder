{"text":"Be warned not to come here, the food is not worth your money. Today me and my friends decided to go to Mabu Station because they have a wide selection of food and they were still open (compared to other cafes). I decided to order the mixed fruits with mango sauce topped on a scoop of ice cream, one of my friends ordered a waffle dessert. As me and my friends were casually talking, each of our dishes were being served, EXCEPT for one dish that literally took more than 20 minutes to be served. My friend and his girlfriend realized that their waffle was \"UNCOOKED\". In the picture, you can indicate the waffle does not display a golden brown colour which shows that it was not properly cooked and the texture of the bitten parts of the waffle looks like the waffle batter is sagging out. My friends decided to call out the waitress, her response through the problematic issue was \"sorry I can't fix this because you ate almost all of it\". In all case, a waitress should not be saying that if a waffle was uncooked especially if the toppings was hiding the uncooked waffle for customer not realising it was \"ACTUALLY UNCOOKED\". For my dessert, it was not appetising. Some fruits were fresh, but some of it killed my tastebuds. Seriously, why would they used canned preserved fruits to topped on my dish? I rather just go home and make the dessert by myself.    WARNING FOR FIRST COMERS: Just because the restaurant/interior or the pictures of the menu looks visual appealing, doesn't mean the food will satisfy your taste buds.    I will not be coming to this restaurant again and I will definitely not recommend this restaurants to any dessert lovers."}
{"text":"The restaurant was completely full when we decided to eat here. So we waited for about 3-5 minutes... service wasn't so great, we had to go up to give our order.  My friend and I ordered 2 drinks: - red bean and matcha with tapioca bubble tea? (not sure) - matcha latte (was too sweet)  Then we shared the: - seafood pancake - oyster pancake Both of them weren't so great, especially the oyster pancake...I swear, there was no oyster in it... we only saw lettuce and the pancake looked like a glutinous mess. It was just horrible. The seafood pancake was a little better, but it had noodles in it as well and the shredded dry pork on top of the noodles were SO salty.  Then we had dessert: - raspberry mango cheesecake (it was not cheesecake) - tiramisu (worst tiramisu ever)  I think both of these desserts were store bought. The descriptions on the menu were incorrect as well. The \"cheesecake\" was just raspberry and mango mousse with a bit of sponge cake. The \"tiramisu\" was basically whipped cream, sponge cake, and some cocoa powdered on top.  Then we went up to pay and noticed the horrifying colours of their macarons... they did not look natural at all. It looked like they were drenched in food dye. They also looked very inconsistent, in terms of the filling of the cream.  We just had a bad experience here and I don't normally write bad reviews... but I'm not coming here again. I honestly will not recommend this place to anyone I care about."}
{"text":"Went there for a late night anack.   I got my favorite Tara milk  tea and durian Pan cake.   Just an FYI that the pancake is light green in color instead of the ususlky yellow.   But just as tastey.  The wiped cream is light and fluffy and not too sweet"}
{"text":"--------------------------------------------- Review Amendment: The owner saw my review on Facebook and responded very quickly.  Our meal was comp'd and the liaison we spoke with seemed sincerely apologetic.  I may visit again but probably the location next door. --------------------------------------------- Sitting here on a Friday night and the service is so TERRIBLE that I am writing this review while Im still here.  I should mention beforehand that the waitresses' English skills are well below par.  First off, I came here with a couple of friends because the original Mabu next door was full.  When we came in, the waitress looked at us annoyingly.    We sat down and put our order through with three desserts, three drinks, and one snack.  The order form has a section for menu number, quantity, and extra toppings.  A different waitress came by shortly to ask us what size drink we wanted and whether we wanted hot or cold.  When we gave her our preferences, she gave us the \"why couldn't your order correctly\" look.  After we waited for some time, the second waitress came by to say that my friend's dessert was sold out and gave us one menu.  After yet some more time, food and drinks began arriving.  After about half hour in, we noticed my dessert was the only thing that didnt come so I waived the first waitress over.  The venue is loud and she was about 10 ft from me and expected me to shout my question to her because she clearly did not want to come over. When I explained that my dessert had not arrived, she checked my order and went to ask the chef. Then came back and said that my friend was already eating the dessert. I had to explain again that i ordered a different dessert which she then argued that we were informed they were sold out.  We told her and the second waitress that they only informed us of one thing being sold out at which the second waitress offered an unapologetic sorry.   It was at that point we were told they only had two desserts left.  I did not make another order.  Absolutely DISGUSTING service.  Better off somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from a friend.  We order popcorn chicken,  kimchi beef egg rice, curry goat and oyster pancake.   For drinks, I had a normal milk green tea.    We had lots of food left over... I never have any food left over.  This tells you that the place, when it comes to food, is pretty bad. Even I would not finish it and I finish pretty much anything.     Popcorn chicken was under cook, the rice was like rice with tomato sauce and onions,  oyster pancake was like booger... lol  ok that was mean.  But order it and you will know what im talking about.  Curry goat tasted like pure coconut.   Drinks were really sweet.  Pretty disappointed... went down street to get a sausage afterwards.   Will I come back... sorry.  Food is generally pretty good at these tea shops but this was not even close."}
{"text":"I did not like the food. Oyster pancake was no good. Their condensed milk toast didnt taste right . I wouldnt come back.Decoration is cute .Too pricy for this kind of food(taste wise)"}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant, they decided to make your entrance difficult by placing a mat behind the door so, the door opens halfway and you have to squeeze in. It's a small restaurant but it's pretty cute and their menu has a great variety of food and drinks. My friends and I just came for bubble tea which shouldn't take no more than 8 minutes to make. When you order bubble tea to go, the second one is free which was great to hear. We went to go pay at the desk and they told us they can't split orders ... We waited to get our bubble tea for 25 minutes! We asked the waitress, 'what's going on with our order, we only ordered bubble tea'. It was only then we heard the blender going on which meant they just started working on our drinks...  I don't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"NOTE: my rating of 2/5 is entirely based on food only. This rating does not include the service.   I came here with high hopes since it was new, and I was excited to see what this place had to offer. However, I left with disappointment.   Service:  My rating is not based on service since they are new, I won't expect too much from them. The service was below average. I had servers forget items that I ordered, so I had to remind them. They were also very slow, and they seem confused. But oh well, they are new.   FOOD:  -Pork belly on rice (chef recommendation): this dish was average. It wasn't great, but it is not bad, it was just alright.   -Mango pancake (chef recommendation): I was very disappointed with this item. The pancake was very bland, despite the fact that it is supposed to be mango pancake. All I tasted was cream inside, and there was barely any mango in it. For a dessert of $7, I do not expect them to cheap out on the mango.   Don't let the menu photos fool you! The mango pancake did look veryy appealing on the menu. It looks like it was loaded with mango inside. However, in reality, it was mainly cream inside the pancake.   -Drinks: we ordered a few drinks and they were alright. Nothing special to keep me coming back for them though. There are many other places around the area for drinks.   OVERALL:   I don't think I will be returning here since I didn't find the food that great, and the drinks didn't impress me either ."}
{"text":"Second time coming here to eat, it's always really busy but we didn't have trouble getting a seat because we had a party of two.   The brick toast was very good, we ordered the large one with ice cream as well as toast with condensed milk. The servers tell you it'll take about 45 min for the brick toast to come out but it's well worth it!!  The oreo milk tea was good but I found the prices for bubble teas to be slightly higher compared to other Taiwanese/Chinese cafes. The menu is extensive and the servers don't speak fluent English but the large number of pictures on the menus are helpful when ordering."}
{"text":"I was walking past the store and I saw that they had a special offer of buy-one-get-one-free when you buy drinks for takeout so of course I had to go in! I ordered the Tiramisu milk tea and the Cocoa Creama drink. It took about ten minutes to prepare and they packed it well so it wouldn't leak on my way home. They both tasted pretty good, not overly sweet but didn't blow mind. Worth the price I paid, but not much more. The other desserts and drinks looked amazing on the menu so I might go back to dine-in sometime! :D"}
{"text":"I second the comment from the reviewer about crappy service.  Food was decent but nothing special but the service just kills this place.  Service with a scowl and snarky comments is what we experienced. I don't think they realize that it's the customers that keep them in business.  I won't spend a dime here again."}
{"text":"This cafe seemed cute, so my boyfriend and I decided to try it. The peach and grape bubble tea was great, but the waffle was chewy with a weird after taste and fruits were from a can.  Quite disappointed."}
{"text":"We ordered 4 drinks (milk black tea, milk black tea with ice cream, coffee, and green mango slush) and it took 30 min to get the orders, and none of them tasted good. We drank maybe half. Also there was a weird smell that we kept smelling time to time. So weird that we kept having to cover our nose.  It was busy though and I noticed most people were ordering food more than drinks. Not sure if we ordered the wrong items but because their menu is so big, I thought I couldn't go wrong with getting the milk black tea, but I was wrong. Should've just went with our original plan- Gongcha."}
{"text":"Service ain't that good, bubble tea was very sweet. But hey, it was $5.65 for buy one get one drink if you get take out."}
{"text":"Oh I was so excited that a Taiwanese place opened up close to home, and boy was I disappointed.   The interior decor is certainly cute and cozy. The service is friendly and fast. The main issue is their claim of authenticity.  What we ordered: 1. Beef Noodle Soup - this is the common staple item in Taiwan so I had to try it. The beef is tender and the noodle had nice texture but holy eff the soup was salty. I told the waitress and she checked with the chef who apparently \"forgot\" to taste the soup herself... So they did offer a discount on this dish.  2. Popcorn chicken rice - as shown in my picture, there's barely any chicken.. Mostly just fried batter.   3. Oyster Pancake - So disappointed when this was brought to the table. It may sound absurd but the authentic pancake should not look this well presented. This dish is usually served messy and the sauce is supposed to consist of miso paste and tomatoe paste. Well Mabu certainly failed at the sauce which tasted like watered down ketchup.  4. Egg Pudding Milk Tea - so much powder! How can they compete with Chatime right across the street?   Overall, I had high hopes and was let down - wont be returning."}
{"text":"I ordered hot milk tea and tiramisu mille-feuille crepe. The milk tea tasted alright, but it came out lukewarm. It cooled down pretty quickly and I'd like to have it warmer. The mille-feuille didn't have a picture so I could only imagine what it would be, and what came out was pretty good, except that it was only a 1/6 slice of the whole thing and I guess I expected it to be bigger considering it's $11 before HST. Overall the food tasted alright. Cleanliness and prompt service bumped up half a star for a 4-star rating. I do not mind coming back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Nice roomy space and massive menu.  I find myself addicted to Taiwanese fried chicken cutlet.  Very much a surprise that it came with sides.  Had I known I wouldn't have tried the Fried Rice with Taiwanese sausage. That was pretty tasty too!  I think I need to come back here to try the other items in that massive menu.  I haven't even have room for dessert and just like the savoury items, they have so much variety."}
{"text":"Really fast service which was great! Also both the food and the deserts were pretty good! The prices aren't too bad either. Its a really nice small little cafe that suits both large groups but also just two people as well!! The waitresses are really efficient and nice. Probably will come again for nice taiwanese eats."}
{"text":"If Yelp had a negative star rating option, that is what I would give this place. When we first arrived the waitress seated us and handed us the menu. As we perused the overpriced desserts, we selected 3 items. Twenty minutes in, we were still sitting at an empty table waiting for our water which never came. The waitress finally brought the water and advised us that one of the three items we ordered is not available and asked us to select something else. We selected another item and she told us that the other item also isn't available either. After selecting a few other items which ALSO wasn't available, we settled with just the two items we originally ordered. Almost an hour later, our desserts still had not arrived. We asked the waiter and he went to check and then came back to  tell us that none of the items we ordered are available! I can only rate the service on this review and it sucked! I would rate the food but I never got it! There are so many options and  places to try nowadays. I can't see this place surviving. Worst customer service ever!!!"}
{"text":"Originally I was supposed to go to Cafe Bene, but I haven't been here before and there was always the option of eating food as well as dessert here so we decided to go in.   It was smaller inside than I thought, with tables on one side and booths on the other. My friends ordered a waffle dessert as well as the tiramisu french-style cake. I went with the hot mabu special grass jelly dessert. To say the least, we were not impressed with our desserts (perhaps I should've gotten it cold).   I also ordered the fresh mango lychee slush and that wasn't too bad. The lychee certainly got overpowered though.   There were also a bunch fruit flies pestering us throughout the entire night and considering it wasn't summer anymore, that's a little concerning (idk I'm no fruit fly expert).   Anyways, the service was great and an extra star was awarded just for that alone, but I'd definitely spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I wanted to go to this place for a long time. I love really close and whenever I pass by it, it's always had lots of people. I finally went with my husband after dinner. I ordered the grass jelly with red beans, green beans, taro, etc. It was a very very large bowl for myself, I could not finish. They provide you with lots of grass jelly with the toppings and sugar on the side. It was a nice refreshing treat.  I would order this again.  My husband had a pork belly rice. It's nice that they still serve dinner food during the later hours (after 10pm).   There were many other dessert options on the menu that I have yet to try."}
{"text":"Food 2.5/5 (60% of final grade) Meh. Is all I can say. For a place that is reminiscent of a bubble tea house, and for the size of the facilities, the menu is very expansive. But the grade of the food falls at that-- a bubble tea house. After eating the first time, I actually felt sick from the amount of oil they put in their foods. At the time of consumption, I didn't realize how much oil I was consuming, but afterwards I felt way too bloated and heavy.  Ambiance 2/5 (10% of final grade) Though there weren't that many people, the premises felt loud and stuffy, even though I could hear my friend speak from across the table. In general, the vibe they give off on their website is supposed to be very clean, fresh, light. In reality, they were stuffy, dirty-feeling, and heavy. Not enough air conditioning, perhaps, but it had a very peculiar sense of being run-down as well, despite nothing peeling off walls or anything. Not a place for a date, or anything to be honest, unless they up their facilities game with better air conditioning or ventilation -- nobody likes to be eating super oily foods and also being warm at the same time.   Service 2.5/5 (10% of final grade) The service wasn't particularly bad, but it was minimal to say the least. Even though we sat right by the cashier, where most of the employees seemed to be lounging (except when someone waves them over, away from their cell phones), our water was never refilled proactively. The people working their didn't really seem like they wanted to be there, or that they wanted us to be there either. What to expect from a taiwanese-style teahouse though.   Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade) Appropriate for the portion sizes and quality of food.   Brownie Points 0/5 (10% of final grade) Nothing fantastic in particular.   Final Grade = 44/100 = 1 Star  TLDR: Extra salty for getting so oily sick. Their only saving grace might be their desserts and drinks, but I only ate their savoury foods. Hopefully your experience will be better."}
{"text":"Mabu Station is a cute and busy dessert place that has good service but is a bit overpriced. I ordered the $7.99 mango pancake and it was filled with more whipped cream than the actual mango itself. Although, the tong sui is really good and definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I think this has become one of my fav places to head to for lunch. I've tried a wide variety of their menu including the pudding in egg shells, the cheese filled pork cutlet, the basil chicken rice, and my favourite, the curry fried chicken wings. I was really impressed with Mabu because they offered menu items that were not typical in average taiwanese bubble tea shops. In my opinion, the curry fried chicken wings is a must try. The wings are really crispy w/ flavourful batter and comes with a curry sauce to dip in (the curry is akin to the Jap. kinds, not that spicy). Perfect snack in my opinion.  I also like that you put down your order yourself in an order sheet they provide. Leaves less room for disagreements over the order, or error due to language barrier. The bubble tea however, is admittedly extremely overpriced. I actually recommend one of their hot choco/cafe items which are in a more affordable price range OR come in for a lunch combo where a green tea bbt is included in your meal!  They also have a plethora of dessert dishes, with some being trad. chinese, some taiwanese, and some new fusion ones that I have yet to try, but look forward to doing so in the future!"}
{"text":"MAN THIS PLACE SUCKS BALLSACK  Came here on a whim while passing by and decided to give the Oreo Milk bubbletea with tapioca a try. Upon ordering, the waitress let me know it was buy one, get one free but seeing as I was by myself I politely declined the offer since I would just look like a damn pig walking down the streets of Yonge with 2 bubble tea's in my hand right? How selfish can I be? LOL  And to be honest, I waited quiiiiiiite a bit of time just for a SMALL.... I had a phone conversation for almost TEN MINUTES - I kid you not so let me say that again - TEN MINUTES! Like what the hell was this guy doing?! Using a toothpick to smash the oreo's!?! - and literally there were only 2 other tables who had customers already enjoying their treats while one was already on the way out so CAHM ONNNN!  I paid $5.65 for the small and as I was about to leave when I finally picked up my order after taking an hour nap lol, the waitress came running after me to tell me they forgot to put tapioca in my drink *DERPINA* Surprised, I didn't even realize the mistake until she pointed it out so I obviously had to go back and get the tapioca *facepalm & smdh*  Needless to say no one else had an order so I wasn't too sure as to why it was a.) taking light years to make a small drink... and b.) couldn't the bubble tea maker take that time it took to make my drink to make it right and remember what the hell I ordered since it's simply written on the receipt paper?! GAWD DAYUM PPLZ IT AINT THAT HARD *that's what she said...*  Upon drinking it, the tapioca had a strange taste - I assume they use some weird ass syrup to soak the tapioca in that makes me feel like what I'm eating tastes like what flowers smell like.. oh geeze lol sounds delicious right? *barf* I also noticed it was still mid-day and they were out of certain macarons and during closer inspection, you could tell most of the shells were a bit cracked. Definitely won't be coming back nor suggesting this business."}
{"text":"All drinks were served in plastic cups, nothing like the pictures.  The prices are so ridiculously expensive, you would think it would at least be served with in a nice glass?   Shaved ice was served like it was randomly thrown together, the bowl was splashed with the red bean sauce everywhere.  Not that it tastes horrible...just that you shouldn't pay a premium for sth that looks even worse than tea 168...  Don't come here."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend to try their condensed milk toast and weren't disappointed. It's was so crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. Very delicious.  We also got brown sugar milk tea with tapioca which was very sweet and yummy.  The only thing I didn't like was that the bubble tea came fast and the toast came quite a while after so I couldn't drink and eat at the same time.  I will definitely come back to try their other desserts!"}
{"text":"This place is okay (and I'm usually not a big fan of Taiwanese places). The food was decent... nothing fantastic, but not bad either.   Servings are a little small I thought, for the price.   We didn't have any issues when we went for a late lunch on a weekday... food came out reasonably quickly.   FYI menu consists mainly of deserts and drinks.   I wouldn't oppose to come here again, although I most likely won't volunteer to go here   Takes credit card"}
{"text":"This is a great place for people who love desserts. There are a variety of options for desserts and meals. Price is not that cheap, but the quality is good. But always so many people there. Sometimes need to wait for 10-15 mins."}
{"text":"Holy cow. How long does it take to get Japanese beef on a bed of rice??? 15 mins too long. And then getting the bill. It's a small restaurant and had 4 people working in the front. There should have been no excuse as to why it took so long to get our bill. Food was ok at best, overall it was a fail."}
{"text":"Had the dark chocolate almond cake with coffee cream. Didn't look anything like the menu at all. Cake was stale, ice cream was melted - would not recommend. Awaiting the Mabu special honey toast with ice cream. Will update when it comes.   STAY TUNED.    Totally forgot to finish this review. So the Mabu special honey toast with ice cream was not that great. The toast was not evenly made, and it was stale too. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"one star is enough?really bad service? the cup is not clean?and the food is not like photo on the menu, not recommend"}
{"text":"Service Most Chinese restaurants are not known for having good service, but this place takes the award for shittiest service in the GTA lols. First off, there aren't many tables so with 2-3 staff you really should not be taking so long to take down the orders (especially since the customers are filling out the order). I asked for water refills at least three times before I got what I wanted. If I was a fish, I would have already died lols. Fast forward to the end of the night, it took us at least 30 minutes to pay the bill. No, it wasn't because we couldn't count (we are asians btw), but because they weren't able to give us the receipt or provide change in a timely manner.      Food The prices are not great for what they serve. The fries are so dry I almost had to cover them in ketchup from one end to the other. I don't even know where to start but the food sucks lols. In my order, there was cheese inside the cutlet and it tasted like Kraft Cheese slices...probably was lols. I don't know how they attract so many customers with their food but I would rather eat at a food court than to pay restaurant prices for what we ordered."}
{"text":"We came really late tonight to mabu but it was quite busy, and the server maggie was working alone, but she was still quite attentive and worked really hard.. She also came by and apologize because she felt like she neglected us.. Over all the food was good but service brought us a 5 star experience"}
{"text":"Definitely do not recommend this place! We were in the neighbourhood and their cute decor caught our eye. Went in wanting to try their desserts. Ordered their signature toast with honey and fruits, and the durian pancake along with a drink but was told the toast takes 40 minutes to prepare (not noted anywhere on their menu) and they were sold out of durian pancakes. We were forced to choose other things, many of which were out of stock or takes 40 minutes to prepare. We ended up ordering a drink and their green tea egg pudding with red bean. The drink was alright but we waited over half an hour for the egg. When we checked with the waitress who took our order, she was clueless and said she would go check (and never came back to follow up). We then waited another 10 minutes before getting the dessert...only to find it's a cold dessert (as in they only needed to take it out of the fridge and serve!). There was no apology, no explanation for the delay...they just dumped the dessert on our table and walked off."}
{"text":"This is one of the go to places for me and my girlfriend because the food here is pretty good and seating is very comfortable.   We weren't allowed to play cards for some reason and had to socialize. Why, mabu, why?  Prices are reasonable but for some reason, they do not have a lot of stuff available even if it is on their menu. Every time we go, they always tell us that something is sold out. This time, the pork cutlets were unavailable. No pork cutlets? No five star.   There is wifi, you just have to ask. Side parking is also free after 10pm."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that as someone who eats in this area quite often, I've never heard of this dessert place. So when my friends and I were debating where to go for dessert after dinner on Wednesday, I was really glad that someone suggested Mabu Station! The decor at this cafe was very cute, and I really enjoyed everything we ordered! I can't wait to come back again!!  Mabu Station actually has two stores right beside each other. One of them looked like all the tables were taken, so my friends and I went into the other one. When we went in and asked, the waitress told us that the two stores were exactly the same. There's street parking right outside the restaurant. It's metered parking on Yonge past 6pm on weekdays, and free parking after 10pm.   The menu was huge. There were sooo many items to choose from, and lots of unique items that we wanted to try! After a long decision process, we ordered 2 drink and 3 desserts. The drinks were good, the desserts were awesome! We ordered the following:  - Mabu Special Honey Toast w Ice Cream. When we ordered this, the waitress told us that this would take around 40 mins, and it actually did take that long. We had time to kill anyways, so we didn't really mind the wait. The portion is pretty big. The toast comes out in a big tower, with an huge scoop ice cream on top, and sauce drizzled all down the side. The sauce was nice and warm. The toast was crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside. The toast with the sauce and ice cream was just the prefect amount of sweetness.  - Red Bean, Barley, Mix Q Ball, Mung Bean & Condensed Milk Ice Crush. This came out in a huge bowl. All the toppings were good. My favourite would definitely be the red bean and barley, it complimented the sweetness of the condensed milk ice crush very nicely. I also really liked the chewiness of the Mix Q Balls.  - Egg Milk Pudding in the Eggshell. This was decent, but the ones I've had in Taiwan are definitely much better. Since it was $6.99 for only 4 puddings, I don't think I would get this again.  I can't wait to come back and try the other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, it took 5 minutes after we found a spot and sit then the waitress realize we are here. It is not a busy day, 4 tables are empty. The first thing she said to is to sit at another table. Food is average and priced above other place. I will not come again."}
{"text":"If I could give even lower than 1 star I would! I got my own menu,  I had to ask for water after and hour of patiently waiting, since we waited for an hour and I'm sure she forgot to process our order since others received their food first.  She didn't even check on our food until I asked her to. Giving absolutely no tip since it was a self service!!"}
{"text":"Being from Taiwan, I am always up for a good taste of Taiwan. I can tell you that this place didn't disappoint.   Got the fruit tea and the pork intestine hot plate. It was very good. Not too sweet and not too spicy. overall a good place for some Taiwanese food.   Saying that, there is one thing that I wanted to try. The last time I was in Taiwan, I tried the toast tower with honey sauce. I saw the same thing here and decided to order it. Unfortunately, they said it was a 40 minute wait. I didn't know this and thus didn't order it. I couldn't wait that long.   Service was pretty good. nothing fantastic to write home about. Overall a good experience.   Pros  Good food Not expensive  Cons  ORDER THE TOAST TOWER 40 minutes in advance....Was very disappointed that I didn't get a chance to try it."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to come hang out with friends if you're looking for a place in the Yonge and Finch area. They've magazines and free wifi which is nice. I wouldn't come here for the food, but it's a comfy place to sit and chat. Drinks are desserts are better than food menu items, but overall the food experience is pretty average."}
{"text":"I can't commend on the desserts here as I only tried their snacks (squid with sausage) and bubble tea but those were quite delicious. I wouldn't study here (slow wifi, semi loud volumed playlist in the cafe playing club music or K-Pop) but it's a good place to catch up with a friend or two. I don't think they take reservations but it's generally not too busy unless it is a Friday or weekend night."}
{"text":"Terrible food. We had deep fried pork chop with stuffed cheese. The cheese tasted like kraft and the pork still had some uncooked flour on it. The cold noodles were ok. So was the decor but still disappointed.  Maybe this is just a drink place but we were so disappointed, we didn't even want to try."}
{"text":"I only come here for ONE thing: their bubble tea. They've had a BOGO free special (take out only) forever now and it's the only thing I would get here. I tried their food once and it was overpriced and not good quality. Their desserts look very good.  It's a Chinese place so don't expect much in terms of service. In fact, expect really bad service. I personally don't mind. I'd had a few awkward moments with some of the servers. Whatever. I'm Asian. I'm used to it. As long as I get my food/drinks and it tastes good, I'm happy.  Is the bubble tea good? Mostly yes. I've tried almost all of them. I like how they have some unique selections I can't find elsewhere. I especially love their Tiramisu bubble tea, and their oreo bubble tea.   There are 8-9 bubble tea stores in the area and Mabu is the only one with a BOGO free special at the moment. I really don't know why there's no line up for it. I'm guessing the service turns people away."}
{"text":"Been coming to here ever since they first opened in K-Town. Their IKEA-esque decor and cute menus are great for attracting couples coming here on dates or those on a budget. Wifi here does not work. 2 out of the 3 times I've been here this month, neither my phone nor my friends' phones were able to connect to their hotspot. Food-wise, they are one of those places where you should know what to order before coming in and that is taiwanese food (eg minced pork rice) or taiwanese desserts (grass jelly). I've read some of the previous reviews on other combos they had come up with over the past few years and it's true that these new creations aren't always that good. After all, they are known for their taiwanese style dishes and a few of their staple dessert items (the flavoured toasts). Nowadays, you can see that they are trying really hard to appeal to everyone. For example, introducing pastas on the menus (really, who goes into a taiwanese restaurant for pastas?) But when you are in competition against all these other dessert places and asian foods, it's harder to stand out. The owners should consider simplifying their menus to serving their specialties before they lose the customers to the other restaurants in this competitive region."}
{"text":"When it comes to finding a dessert restaurant near Finch station that isn't limited to just bubble tea, there aren't many choices. One of them is Mabu Station, which has about double the amount of square footage as other dessert places in the area.  I came here after work with a co-worker for some late night sugar and was sadly disappointed.  The atmosphere and menu are nice.  They have a the pink-green-white colour scheme and a myriad of choices from honey toast to bingsu to slushes.  However, if quality is what you're looking for, then please come with some discretion.  Of course, you'll get some neat and delicious-looking options on the menu, but often times, like at most dessert establishments, what you get won't be what you ordered.  Subtract your pre-existing notion of what you perceived as a selfie-worthy/instagram-worthy and yummy dessert.  Then, replace it with a sloppily plated dish with a mild, almost watered down flavour.  Mmmmmm.  It's still a great place to sit down and have a conversation with friends for an hour or two, especially at night.  If you are an eager-beaver for some good desserts, though, give Orange Caramel a try instead."}
{"text":"When there with my mom a few months ago. First off, the service was just horrible. The waitress was inattentive and seemed like she didn't want to be there. There was no friendly greeting, no checking in, and not even an offer for take out containers when we obviously needed them. Then, the food tasted terrible. MSG overload. Never had I had such bad Taiwanese food. The drink I ordered was ok. But for a fruit tea it was pretty watery and bland. Then, I had to go to the hospital the next day because I woke up with a huge migraine and threw up several times. Since the only place I ate out at the day before was this place, it was obviously this place. Furthermore, when I got my blood tested and everything at the hospital, the doctor came back and told me that it was MSG overdose. I had an allergic reaction to MSG. Seriously. I'm Chinese and have eaten MSG my whole life. Never once did a restaurant add so much MSG to make me sick. I would not recommend anyone to come here. Unless, of course, you're immune to MSG."}
{"text":"The food looks great! Too bad we didn't get to order any.   I don't expect 5 star service in small restaurants, or Asian/south Asian restaurants. I am South Asian, and culturally customer service is not THAT important. So  as long as the food is good, I am A-okay!   This place, the servers were just chatting around the bar and didn't even pay attention to us. We had to ask to be seated, we had to ask for a menu. And we couldn't get anyone's attention to actually order. But they had no trouble catering to other patrons. One couple came in after us and got their drink before we could even order.   It was the ridiculous and we had to walk out."}
{"text":"Me and my friends are currently eating here as I type. Got here and we waited maybe 10 minutes before we got a table. From outside everything looked good. As we got our seat, we looked at the menu and we came here for desserts so we were excited to order. But the two things we wanted, Mabu special honey toast with ice cream and mixed Fruit Belgian waffle were not available. Big disappointment. We ended up ordering a chilled mango with sago and pomelo. It came warm and was basically tasteless mango soup. Also ordered the toast with tiramisu. It was alright. Wasn't exactly tiramisu. The drink I ordered was passion pineapple green tea. Not worth the money. Should have went to cha time down the street. As for service, there was no service here. They gave us one spoon with 3 people to share mango soup? And didn't even get the water we asked for. Worst service ever. They don't even know English. Just because we are asian doesn't mean we all can speak it.  Not ever coming back here ever again.   No stars rewarded."}
{"text":"I don't really write reviews as I'm quite lazy and I just really want to eat and let things be. But tonight was pretty special. Special because I have not waited for a take out item for so long in my life! I went to Mabu to get ice crush with taro and red beans. I arrived at around 7 and it wasn't so busy. I figured I'll grab some noodles from the restaurant beside it and come back to grab the ice crush when it's ready. I ordered and told the server I'll come back for it.  I went to the noodle restaurant and that too made me wait for a good 15 mins for noodles that I was also taking home to eat. A very special night indeed. I went back to Mabu and my order wasn't ready yet. I patiently waited for almost half an hour (I know coz I was timing it) and the server tried her hardest not to have eye-contact with me. Very awkward, I understand. I then flagged her and asked how much longer for crushed ice and taro and red beans. She gestured 3 mins. After a few minutes, she hands me \"my order.\" I was already hungry (HANGRY) and just wanted to go home so I nade my way to the bus stop. The bus wasn't coming for another 15 mins so I figured I'll check my food. It wasn't the ice crush!!!! I went back and complained and they handed me the correct order. But the ice has already melted. Meaning it has been waiting there for so long!!! I just really wanted to go home and rest and eat after a long day so I grabbed my food and left.   The food is good but the service is horrible!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I was in my hunger mode. So I sat down and ordered everything I was possibly craving for on the menu. I've ordered the Taiwanese Style deep fried fish cake $6.99 (too hungry so I skipped the glamour shots for the fish cakes) Next, the deep fried squid balls $6.99 was a nice chewy appetizer as I love squid balls, basically it is fried fish balls with pieces of squid inside. As a result of our  hunger level, I noticed my boyfriend has written a whole list of number on the paper to place the order already.   Basically between him and I, from the appetizer section, we've ordered: L01, L02, L04, L05 Deep fried tofu with garlic sauce $6.99 The tofu was nothing to write home about, but the Garlic sauce tasted pretty good, it almost reminded me of the ginger garlic dipping from the Chinese chicken. I saw the hotpot on their poster, so I asked for the spicy speciality hotpot. They have 4 different ones on the poster, but the bottom two, the one primarily with seafood was not available. I don't eat intestines, the speciality one does have intestine  but you can ask them to remove the items that you don't eat. Inside the hot pot, there were quail eggs, thin slices of beef, inoki mushrooms, tofu, clams and some greens and an instant noodle. The soup was nice and the spicy level was just right. So this hot pot is worth a try to share with friends.  The Taiwanese style popcorn chicken $8.99 I find the powder a bit on the powdery side so of course to save room for the other things I only ate 2-3 pieces.   The Taiwanese style BBQ sausage and minced pork on rice was good $8.99. It was very flavourful with the minced pork and the sauce.   The service was surprisingly good, between my friend and I we send them back to get us chilli oil like three times and they come in individual take out plastic containers. The waitress was attentive and kept asking me if I needed to refill water.   Last but not least, for my drink, I prefer drinking hot drinks so I've order my favourite honey Pomelo tea, the good thing about this is you can refill this like 4 times with water and can still last you through the meal."}
{"text":"I visited Mabu Station twice after being disappointed the first time and hoping to give them a second chance (mostly because they have a cute ambience and their menus look fanastic!).  After the second visit, I was asking myself why I give establishments like this a second chance when they already disappoint you so hard on the first visit.  Our first problem was that virtually everything on the menu was \"not available\" which was upsetting but we thought it might've been a one off (which is why I gave it a second chance I suppose).  But nope, came back a few weeks later and everything was still unavailable!  I think we tried to order at least 5 different items before we settled on something very simple - the mango crushed ice.  Let me tell you, this was absolutely the worst dessert I've ever had, and this is not an exaggeration.  It looked and tasted like they shaved off the ice off the side of a freezer and drizzled some mango puree over the top and a few mango bites on the side.  We couldn't get through the crushed ice with our spoons because it refroze and turned into a giant ice block.  The puree was only drizzled over a small portion of the ice to begin with, so a majority of it was just regular ice.  I could go on, but I think you get the picture.  I really wanted this place to be one of my go-to places in the yonge-finch area when I'm out with friends, but I don't think I will ever visit this place ever again.  I advise anyone who's considering going here to try out some other nearby establishments as I'm sure you'll enjoy them much better."}
{"text":"We came here for a light dinner. The food was a bit salty. The washroom was unpleasant as there was water on the floor and the toilet was clogged. One of the waitresses seemed to have an attitude problem."}
{"text":"I love their mango pancakes! Reminds me of home in Hong Kong! I'm a little disappointed they don't offer the original desserts they advertised as \"coming soon\" when they first open but the place itself is really clean and comfortable as a hang out spot. The prices however, are a little pricey in my opinion."}
{"text":"The popcorn chicken came out super hot and fresh,  very tasty.   The fried tofu was also amazing.   The Taiwanese sausage and minced meat on rice was full of flavour.   The oyster egg omelette was great,  texture was good and they use fresh oysters not the canned ones and that makes a big difference in the taste.   Overall service with a smile a big +++!"}
{"text":"Went to this place on a friday night, and it was packed. This is a desert house that became a dinner place as well. I've been here a few times and usualyl only grab the snack and deserts. Those have always been good, so i decided to grab the dinner.   We ordered a beef noodle soup, and a house special fried pork cutlet in Mapo Tofu sauce. it was one of the things in their menu that they recommended. The beef noodle soup was actually pretty good. It was a little saltier then expected, but overall the flavour and texture of the noodle was not bad. The portion was decent.  The Mapo tofu pork cutlet meal. I have to say that the mapo tofu sauce and the way ti was cooked was pretty decent, and was on average. however the Fried pork cultlet was where all the problems existed. You can tell that they had mixed it with too much baking soda, in order to make it softer. and then hammered it to no tomorrow to make it very thin. The pork was overly oily, and the excessive use of the powder made the pork chop not taste right. Overall the pork chop gave me a bad stomach pain, and was too much fat in it.   Overall this place has decent desert, and some of the food is pretty good, but i would avoid the fried pork cultlets like the plague. That was the reason it is down to 3 star, was becuase that one dish, had so many problems. The service was decent actually and the places interior design looked nice."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. It has a variety of snacks and drinks.  I probably wouldn't come here for dinner though.  The décor is nice and bright, when places are bright like this it feels less pretentious for me. My sister and I both really enjoyed our drinks and snacks.  The service here is pretty good.  If the owner sees this- I understand that Taiwanese dishes usually have pork and stuff in them. But if you can come up with some vegetarian dishes I bet they'll be popular."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, the food was mediocre but the variety of the menu items looked soooo appealing that I was willing to give it another shot. I came here last night and was so disappointed. The Honey Toast Tower was so disappointing, I literally felt like I was eating mountains of toasted toast that lacked flavour and appearance, at least add some fruits!!! This restaurant has potential, but nothing is executed properly, the prices are high, service is meh and the place doesn't feel clean."}
{"text":"Sevice/ Atmosphere: The decor is nice, cute.  The service was great. She made sure our water filled and cleaned the dishes once empty.  One thing I would suggest to change is music selection. Maybe some Asian popular songs rather than 80s/90s tracks. Food related: Our order was served pretty fast. Appertizers were good. The only downturn was the dessert. We ordered sweet potato w cocunut milk under dumpling dessert section. It was.  plain. Cocunut milk had an odd taste and so did the sweet potato. Drinks were great with lots of topping options.  Bottom line: would revisit for the service and food/beverage seclections"}
{"text":"We were in Tapei last year and enjoyed the local desserts not expecting that shops like this would hit our shores so soon.... i guess we should have expected it since Korean, Japanese and Chinese dessert places have taken over the city... Stumbled across this place after going for Korean in the area and decided to give it a try. We ordered the Grass Jelly with accompaniments, and the tapioca milk with mango and black rice. The Tapioca dish was very good, comparable to the authentic stuff in Taiwan, and we finished that quite quickly. The Grass Jelly came later and it was a huge bowl with assorted Taiwanese mix ingredients on the side, along with some coconut milk. I don't know if it was because we were still full from the first dessert but we didn't enjoy this one as much. The side dishes lacked sweetness, and was overpowered by the grass jelly. Anyways, the waitress was also not that attentive, and the calling buttons didn't seem to work that well, but i guess she was busy because she was the only one working on our side and the place was packed... I wouldn't come here on a regular basis, but a couple times a year would suffice.... man i'm writing an essay here on a Taiwanese dessert house... time to check out!"}
{"text":"Like many place we go to, we did not know where to eat so we decide to just park at Yonge/Finch and walk around.....right into Mabu station.  Must have been the nice decor visible from outside.  Service was decent (unlike some previous reviews).  It was not wow service since they did group around some friends at the back of the restaurant BUT no real delays when we needed them, food, cutlery and drinks were served quickly in a polite manner-definitely a passing grade.  We ordered the signature ribs with cheese and bowl of rice.  As you can see in the picture it was brought to me on a little oven which kept it hot and melted the cheese.  Also ordered a very spicy hot noodle dish!  Yeah we were sweating!  Both dishes were very tasty and good.  You must try the ribs!!!  Too bad we could not try their dessert.  The table beside us ordered them and it looked really good......next time !!"}
{"text":"We have been here many times. Good portion, friendly waiter(ess), service is a bit slow though. Tried almost all Taiwanese dish and cold drinks. Tasty but TOO SALTY!  Thant's it, our go-to little place when need a quick bite other than junk food. Our favorites: mud pie, egg pudding, taro balls sweet soup (without pearl), fried toufu, braised pork mince rice, kimchi & beef rice on hot stone, squid ball (sweet o'clock's better though), all sorts of cold tea drinks. My son likes their spaghetti, not me."}
{"text":"After lunch, my friends and I came to Mabu station for dessert. It's a nice small dessert place in uptown Koreantown. They have an extensive selection of savory food, desserts and drinks so it's always hard to choose. After 10 minutes, I decided to choose the Mango pancake dessert. Basically, it's a dessert wrapped with whipped cream and mango pieces. The dessert was decent but I didn't think it was worth the $10.  I brought board games and was originally told that I could play them in the café and was then later told that I could not play when I brought the board games out. There is a bit of a language barrier here if you don't speak mandarin. It's an okay place for desserts. There is limited seating with only about 7-10 tables in the café. Service can be a bit better though."}
{"text":"My friend and I had really high hopes for this place. The menu looked really great, lots of selections...but the food was ok. Not bad for the price..  but service!! THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!!!!!  You have rude waitress that snaps at you. All i asked for was water and it didn't come for 10 minutes so i asked again and she screamed \"OK! across the restaurant. She didn't even look at me for 10 seconds and then walked away. We then went up to the cashier to add an extra order, she snapped back and was like we don't have it and walked away.. she could have suggested something else. Instead my friend asked do you have mango dessert and she said yes but it felt like she was just annoyed with us. We are customers...  At the end she was all nice when she came to get our money but then we had to wait another 20 minutes for the card machine to work. We were just sooo upset about the whole thing and how we were treated.. So my friend and i said we don't have any more time for this, here is some cash ($15 although bill was $20) and then we left. If she was nice, we would have probably waited longer or made a bigger effort to pay full.  They BARELY know any english..I am not chinese. They should not limit to just catering to chinese...a lot of other cultures live around yonge and finch. Because of this, they probably lost a lot of customers.. haha they probably don't know about these bad reviews bc the owner probably doesn't know english either... -_-"}
{"text":"Waited forever on everything (menu, water, put in order, desserts, bill). Come only when you have lots of time to kill."}
{"text":"Service was poor,even on a late Sunday night when there was rarely anyone there. The pictures on the menu looks no where close to the actual product...especially the dessert section with the mango glutinous rice in coconut milk,the actual product looked like scoop of rice drowned in evaporated milk,mangos were too ripe,everything tasted like the fridge..everything was pre-made..i don't see the hype here other than being a nice hangout place for blind dates."}
{"text":"????first Markham?????????yonge finch???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????d????d?????????????????????"}
{"text":"So disappointed, we have been coming here for three years and now it seems that they are skimming on their quantity and quality . The drinks were much bigger for 6.99$ and now for the same price they have become smaller even when they up size u at the table . All the meals are less of the protein as usual and the plate is filled up with accompanied veges and rice .  For sure will not be returning . Now just a rip off !!!"}
{"text":"Another great experience eating here! Ordered a different toast and it was really good. The downside is that you have to wait half an hour for the desert to be ready. Anther thing is that the outer bread didn't taste good, it's more for the presentation than taste. Inside of the cubs were tiny cubes of honey toast which were the more edible part of the desert. I also ordered the Japanese brown sugar milk tea with pudding which was NOT worth it (almost $6). It just wasn't worth it. But I still enjoyed the toast dessert!"}
{"text":"Walking down Yonge Street towards the Finch subway station, my eye catches a glimpse of a whimsical wall mural inside an eatery. Stepping through the doorway felt like stepping into Alice's wonderland (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uUq0bMEjt202bMbRHkIcNA?select=QvhCxpoo5PMU6c9NyZEPBg&utm_source=ashare&ref=yelp-android).   The wait staff seemed puzzled at my endless questions and picture taking, I guess they've never had my kind of Yelper around before. Menu comes in two versions: one for desserts and drinks and the other for food. You write your order down on an order sheet and hand it to your server.   Today was the day I would try the famous Taiwanese Condensed Milk (Brick) Toast. It was more than twice as thick as Texas toast. Lightly crisp on the bottom and edges, inside the bread was nice and soft. It was topped with condensed milk and underneath it all was chocolate syrup drizzled onto the plate. Holy cow! Who was the culinary genius that thought up this simple but decadent dessert? I bet you it was a housewife working with what she had left in the pantry. This would go perfectly with a hot cup of coffee or tea.   I definitely would have given this adorable place 4 stars if it weren't for the blank stares and lack of warmth from the staff. It wouldn't  hurt to crack a smile guys."}
{"text":"There is potential here. What I like: the taiwanese food variety, tons of drink variety, the decor looks good, the wait staff looking good, the prices are fair and below many places.  What can improve: the wait staff could speak in language spoken to, they default to mandarin. There is so much selection it's hard to decide. The drink mugs are too tall, with the straw in it I must tip the glass to get to the top of the straw.  The website listed does not seem to be associated to this location. It looks like there is a place in Taiwan that serves similar stuff, and this place looks just like it, but they don't seem connected.  Most food options are under $8. I had the 3 cup chicken, it was oily but tasted decent. I liked the veggie served in this dish.  They have this pancake, very traditional Taiwanese street food. It might have oysters in it but I couldn't tell very much. The texture doesn't remind me of what I ate in Taiwan, but as a dish it tasted decent.  Overall, seems like a cheap option for food and drinks. Wish they had a dinner combo!"}
{"text":"A small but decent place. Four star for food and one star for service. So I will give them two point five star if yelp had given me the option. I really liked their food - reasonable amount for the price but tastes really great.  I was there once before with one of my Chinese friends and service was better, probably, because she could communicate in Chinese. But this time I was alone and was the only person in the restaurant who looked different. The server was serving water in every table but mine and didn't serve until I asked for it, and to make thing worse it happened twice. A different experience for Toronto - a hugely cosmopolitan city.  I ordered for Japanese style fried rice with egg & eel as the main course, deep fried fish cake as appetizer and some kind of coconut cake as dessert. They served the food in reverse order with an average 10 minute gap in between each course - dessert first, then the main course and finally the appetizer! I asked them why was that, the server replied until someone asks specifically they serve everything together or in the order prepared by the chef! Everything tasted amazing, though I had already lost my appetite because of the bad service. Probably I will never go there again, definitely not alone."}
{"text":"Wow!!wow!!wow experience!!!! It was a last minute decision to come here. We were at Yorkdale and we thought we wanted to try something new in the area. Of course I looked up Yelp reviews and it was mixtures of goods and bads... we still decided to give it a try!!  This place is known for its desserts. I had a little doubt after we placed an order... I thought ummm the food was probably just be meh u know...since its more like a dessert/bbt place.   My hubby ordered pork chop, I ordered a hotpot wow!!! Surprisingly, the food was actually very tasty!! Hubby enjoyed his meal finished it in no time. My hotpot was pretty tasty and the portion is decent!!! Loved the food!!  Our dessert- grass jelly with taro, sweet potatoes, and taro balls. We both think that they made the grass jelly themselves which is not bad. The only thing we didnt like was the taro ballssss.. I had one and it was nasty it was not even a taro ball..I had it and I didnt know what the heck that was....I hope they would see this review and change that please.   The service was good. Our overall experience was awesome!"}
{"text":"I went here with one of my friends l. I didn't know it before visiting, but there are two units of Mabu Station that are right next to each other. We had first went to the one on the right, and we were told to go to the other unit on the left because there wasn't enough room in the one on the right. Both sides of Mabu Station are quite cute in decor.   They did seem to have a lot of selection. It took a while for my friend and I to choose what we wanted to order. We were only there for the dessert and drinks though. I chose a red bean dessert with shaved ice. It was ok- nothing very special, but good red beans. It was literally ice milk with red beans, and mostly ice. In the end, I didn't end up eating all of the ice and it was a melted mess that wasn't very appetizing to look at or eat. I also ordered a brown sugar milk tea with grass jelly. That was also pretty average, and I'd say if you're looking for a milk tea, go to Chatime across the street. My friend on the other hand had a mango dessert with shaved ice and some kind of fruity drink. He didn't seem to have any problem with what he ordered and enjoyed it. I guess it's just what you pick.  Lastly, I wanted to mention that when we visited, they did not have any cronuts available. What a let down! I was interested in one. Also, since they didn't have cronuts, we ordered their honey toast dessert, but we were told would take 30 minutes to make. Not worth the time or money, so we chose desserts that were cheaper.   Overall, agreeing with the other reviews that I see for Mabu, quite a \"meh\" place. It was pretty expensive for my \"meh\" dessert too."}
{"text":"Cute decor but the food wasn't very good. Service was okay. I ordered the shredded chicken rice and my boyfriend ordered the pork belly on rice. Smells great, but the taste was bland.  The only thing that's good on the menu is the green tea latte. They need to change things up before I revisit again!"}
{"text":"Only come here if you have time to kill. Ordered 2 noodles and the first one came in 35 minutes. After I finished mine the 2nd one still didn't come so we just asked for the bill and left. When we got there it was only 2/3 full.  Everyone else had the same problem.  They like to bring one noodle out first and bring the 2nd one like 15 mins later.  Tables were also inches away from each other. You literally had to move your table to get out."}
{"text":"I get dinner a lot at Yonge & Finch and this place has been a go-to of sorts for me over the past two years. I've taken the boyfriend, friends, parents, etc. here not because the food is particularly impressive but because it is consistently and reliably good. Service is generally pretty fast and, in my opinion, relatively friendly compared to other Chinese restaurants (especially if you can speak Chinese).   Food: The pan fried chicken w/ basil, ginger, & onion on rice (C07) has always been a favourite of mine and the rices in general are a pretty safe (and delicious) bet. Appetizers are also all quite good, with the exception of the oyster omelet - I've never had the real thing in Taiwan but I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to taste that slimy. However, what really makes this a 4-star restaurant for me is that the chef is actually very accommodating and will substitute meat items for tofu or shrimp if you ask - huge plus!!  Drinks and desserts: I love Asian desserts and the ones here do not disappoint. My favourites are the marshmallow & coconut toast (E04), any of the honey toasts (these take 30-45 minutes to make so be prepared to wait), and the mango pancake (A16). Their tea drinks are done quite well (if a little bit sweet) and there are a ton of options to choose from. The green and black teas in particular are super refreshing!  Overall, the consistently good food and huge variety of menu items will keep me coming back for sure. Don't be deterred by the very low Yelp rating and try this place for yourself!"}
{"text":"After waiting about 20 mins for a simple dish, the waitress comes out with a well presented order. Presentation was nice (as seen in picture), however, the fruits was warm. The watermelon was mushy, like it wasn't refrigerated.  Other options on the menu surely did look appetizing, and well worth the price for portions.  But I don't think I'll be returning knowing that they would send out an order that was warm and not fresh.   The place is well lit, decorated, and reasonable spaces for customers to move around.    Try to avoid this place and head over to the other dessert locations down the street (Sugar Marmalade, etc)"}
{"text":"OK food but poor service. My friends I came here after dinner for dessert. It took the waitress about 10 minutes to give us menus and water. We waited another 10 minutes for her to come take our order. It also took the kitchen a long time to prepare the dishes. By the time I received my sweet potato toast, my friends had already finished their food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Highly recommended. Very authentic. However this place appears to be understaffed quite frequently.. food prices are good but drinks and desserts can get expensive. Loving this place overall."}
{"text":"Went here with the wife on a Saturday evening, and we weren't impressed. The prices were a bit high, but they didn't seem to offer anything that you couldn't get at other Taiwanese snack places. The main problem was the service though. The unfriendly and inattentive staff ruined the experience for us. I'd recommend the nearby Sweet O' Clock or ZenQ over this place."}
{"text":"June 16, 2018 - I'm really starting to like shaved/crushed ice desserts! After having dinner at Nemani, we wanted something sweet, so we went to Mabu Station at 2:30am. Good thing they close at 4am  I normally don't eat red bean food that much (except for Chinese red bean cakes) But I was really feeling it.   I ordered the Red Bean condensed milk & Brown sugar Ice crush. It was very yummy but I wish there was more red bean! But still very yummy! I would get it again and order more toppings on it.  I also tried my friends Mango milk snow shake with fresh mango & pop bubbles, it was yummy too. Next time I wanna try strawberry!  I will definitely go back again  FYI - if you pay cash it's 10% off"}
{"text":"Came for dessert on a Friday night, found some street parking nearby. Not sure I'm reviewing on the correct Yelp page, as there are two of these right beside each other. I'm told they serve the exact same things.  The menu here is quite large, so it can be quite challenging if you're indecisive. There are lunch/dinner options, a large dessert section and a drink section. I forgot the exact name, but we ordered the Green Tea Toast, which comes as a small mountain of toast cubes, topped with Green Tea ice cream and red beans. It was quite tasty, the bread cubes nice and toasted. The ice cream (which quickly melts into like a green tea sauce) goes well with the red beans. The only thing is ordering any of the Toast items has a 15-20 minute wait time."}
{"text":"My favourite late night place to go. Good customer service, great food. I love all their egg plant dishes, and desserts are great too. It's not too expensive but it's not cheap either. Overall, great place to casually eat in."}
{"text":"I love the environment, I order the hot pot for myself, it is crazily delicious! Though it is a killer expensive, it is worth trying! The only drawback is that the waiter is not that professional (like part time students), also probably because they want the restaurant to be like a dessert station, so more causal."}
{"text":"The waitress is really good and kept helping us refill our water. The food is better at this location than Mabu Generation. I had their tiramisu cake and it came with ice cream, whipped cream and marshmallow. A great place to hang out and chill."}
{"text":"I swear the Mabu Station restaurant is perpetually packed. Every time I walk pass this restaurant there's always people lining up at the door. This time I came in at around 12:30, only 30 minutes after opening, and my group got the last seat. My friend told me the other Mabu shop next door only opens for dinners, but I guess with the busy traffic even on weekdays, they should consider opening both stores and even opening before 12pm.  I initially wanted to try the marshmallow bread but the server told me it will take 40 minutes of waiting time because the bread is freshly baked. I do like the fact that the bread is fresh but my friend had to go back to work after lunch so I ordered the dessert bowl instead.   The dessert bowl was HUGE. It was like 6 bucks and it contained black grass jelly, red beans, taro, taro tapioca, regular tapioca, peanuts, sweet potato, and much more. They gave me some syrup on the side in case it's not sweet enough, but honestly I feel the dessert was already very sweet. The portion was so huge that I ended up packing a lot home.   My friend got a plant pot. They claimed that the \"top soil\" is made out of crushed oreos, but its overly sweetness and sugary texture made me think otherwise. This dish (well...pot) has many layers: crushed oreos, ice cream, cake, yogurt, and cake at the very bottom. It's definitely a surprise and what an interesting piece.    The one thing that kinda annoyed me was the service. They were clearly understaffed with only 1 waitress doing most of the work. My friend had to rush back to her workplace after lunch and it took them forever to get the bill for us and pack my super giant dessert bowl. I appreciate the effort of the sole waitress there, but I wish the owner could hire some additional help."}
{"text":"Good food but the wait was sooo long and the service wasnt that great...but food and drinks were good! I had the pork belly and the oreo milk tea"}
{"text":"Food is ok. The noodles taste the same. Drinks are expensive, and the size is too small. If you wanna have something to drink, like bubble tea, I will say try the chatime on the other side of the street!"}
{"text":"This place could have got a better review but there was this one problem. They didn't have the ingredients to make french toast with condensed milk. And this was in the middle of the day. Not even late at night where something like this could happen. I mean how can you not have 3 simple ingredients (bread, egg, condensed milk). So ended up ordering was an Oreo crumble milk tea $4 and a waffle with ice cream, whip cream, banana and chocolate drizzle $8.   BUT what I really wanted was french toast with condensed milk.... I just can't get over this  Everything was pretty decent. The waffle was chewy which was weird but somehow I liked it chewy. And the milk tea ....well its milk tea so not much can go wrong there.  Heads up...this place is run by Mandarin people and they will just assume you speak their language and understand them fully. So when you say \"table for 2\" you will get as a response \"A bunch of mando\" And when they told me they didn't have french toast, all I heard was \"A bunch of mando\" - but good service overall."}
{"text":"Cute Lil shop, came with some friends, decor is nice, love the lighting and green grass decor.  There is free wifi so i can see how people like to hang out here. Service is mediocre, and drinks were eh. Tried the brown sugar latte and be warned, stay away. The drink was watered down coffee, no brown sugar taste, not even a latte. Mega disappointment. Added tapioca and found it a tasteless and over cooked. Friends tried the food, said it was okay. Will not return for drinks."}
{"text":"I've been here before but today's waitress is pissing us off. 3 of us walked in for the buy-1-get-1 free bubble tea. The waitress makes everybody confused about the payment and the orders for no good reasons. What I know about mabu station is the dessert is alright, but I'm not sure about the service..."}
{"text":"Love the toast towers, the stir fried udon with light cream and bacon!!!! The staffs are nice too!!! Our girls night out spot!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place a lot! Authentic Taiwanese dessert and they taste amazing.I only tried their bubble teas and jelly ice crush...totally recommend! Next time I will try their meals there. The decor is cute and modern. They also open till late so you can go in for night snacks there."}
{"text":"Neat little dessert house. Plenty of desserts to choose from.  We ordered the mango pancake, tofu pudding, and macarons with ice cream.  The first two desserts were great, especially the mango pancake.  The macarons were terrible;they just tasted of sugar overload and had no distinct flavours.  I would come back, specifically for the mango pancake."}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the overwhelming selection of snacks, noodles, desserts, or drinks in the menu. Colourful and quirky, Mabu Station is an experience that you take on without questions or navigation.   Do not apply the usual rules. Throw a dart at the menu and you are going to strike gold.   Great for a date, and open late. Easily satisfy your taste for the salty, the sweet, and all kinds of eats.  5/5 would return, or call for delivery"}
{"text":"Pretty good place located in Willowdale south of Yonge and Finch. Mabu station is a good place to go if you are craving desserts, bubble tea, slush drinks, hot tea, brick toast, or some taiwanese food. The first thing that I noticed was how cute and quaint this tea shop was. There are semi circle booth seats and regular table seats as well. The decor is very nice, with a nice matcha green tea coloured theme to it. Decorated with pretty pots of flowers as well.  The service is excellent and food is great. I decided to try the Japanese Curry pork cutlet and it was great. It tasted freshly made as the breaded part of the cutlet was crispy and not oily. The sauce was a good flavour and not spicy. As well I liked how the sauce was thick and viscous instead of watery. The portions are good and just right as well. The drinks are quite flavourful. Tried the ginger milk tea and although it was a little too sweet the flavour was just great. Been here on a separate visit to try the mango slush as well and it was also great. Comes with mango chunks and quite tasty. In terms of the ordering part you have to write down your order on a piece of paper. The service is quick and they are super friendly. Definitely a good place and wouod come back"}
{"text":"This is my second time at this place. I came back because the food was good. The service was quite slow. My friend and I were seated right beside the door and exposed to the winter wind instead of the nice booths that remained empty the whole time. Water was not offered until asked and was never refilled. Their lighting is fairly bright and their decor is very lighthearted.   We ordered 3 items to share along with a drink for my friend. We had the deep fried squid($9), house special deep fried pork chop w/ mapo tofu sauce on rice($11), and the Mabu special grass jelly($10). The squid used the same breading as taiwanese popcorn chicken, was very crispy and fresh, just lacked a little salt. The pork chop had a great crust and the mapo tofu sauce gave it a good kick. The grass jelly for dessert was definitely the best part of the whole meal. I liked it even more than Chatime's grass jelly. I would've like a few more Q-balls but overall very satisfying. The price is reasonable given the large serving sizes, and especially with the cash discount. My friend didn't quite enjoy her drink and described the pudding as a cross between what a pudding should be and egg tofu.   Overall, their large menu selection, reasonable prices, and great tasting food made up for the service."}
{"text":"I don't know why people have to complain about it I just love the food here. Drinks are okay but food are delicious and come as good portion"}
{"text":"Been to this location several times since it opened. The food tastes very good and authentic. The staff is friendly and all smiles. The best part is their interior decoration and ambience - very cozy and comfortable. One of the best tea shop cafes in the area."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor that literally takes you into a Taiwanese setting. Service was great imo and they added the youcan machines too. You have to be a bit persistent to get water refills but overall we enjoyed our time there. Love the mango pancake although they had to use green crepe haha."}
{"text":"With all the bubble tea and Taiwanese style cafes in the area this place holds its on. Cozy little place with the nice booths and a extensive menu.  They offer a ton of food, dessert, and drinks. I got the matcha redbean slushie and my friend the pineapple green tea juice. By far the best slushie I've had, usually when I go to franchised boba shops there is too much ice and not even red bean. Mabu blended my drink to perfection."}
{"text":"The dessert and food looks great on the menu, but good luck matching it up with what u actually get. Service is horrible, waiter/waitress has no idea what's in the dishes, even those marked as signature dishes. We asked if it is fried chicken in one of the dishes, they just replied, we don't eat it, so we don't know and made no attempt to check with hmmm let's say someone that knows.  Not sure whether, 'we don't eat it' is a sign that i shouldn't be eating it either."}
{"text":"SIGH. I wanted to like this place so badly cause the decor is just SO CUTE. I first walked in having high expectations - adorable environment, adorable menu and the stuff on the menu looked appetizing.  My party of 5 got overly excited at the menu, and ordered a bunch of things... and then were terrible disappointed. 1) Green tea soy bean drink - This was $5 and NOT worth it. No green tea flavour AT ALL. Just a regular soy bean drink.. that was green. LIke come on.. for $5? And it came it just a regular take-out cup (even though we were sitting down), not pretty at all. So unimpressed.  We wanted to order the honey toast (the one that looks great in pictures, with the toast all stacked up). But be warned, they need 50 minutes to prepare it. So we gave up on that and ordered the following desserts instead, which ended up taking 50 minutes to come.  After half an hour of waiting while watching every other table get their non-dessert food, we asked the waiter when our food would be arriving. 15 minutes, they claimed, and after 15 nothing. Inquired again about the wait and after seeing the HONEY BRICK TOAST ARRIVING AT ANOTHER TABLE, 5 minutes they said. Since this time we actually sounded quite pissed, it FINALLY came in 5 minutes.   2) Mango crepes - Not worth it. More cream than mango. I can't believe this would take almost 50 minutes to come.  3) Taiwanese herbal grass jelly dessert - For $13... NUH-UH. My Taiwanese friend says this was not authentic and did not taste good. I wouldn't order this again.. this honestly just reminded me of the free desserts that come  with your Chinese family dinners...   4) Some marshmellow Belgian waffle - It comes with ice cream, marshmellows, bananas etc. Standard waffle.... but is it supposed to taste partially uncooked? The waffle part kind of tasted like batter... unless this is some 'unique' way of cooking it. Again, meh.  Although it was nice of them to apologize for having the items late be on the house, and give us an additional dessert free as well (the pudding in the egg shells). That actually tasted pretty legit, but nothing outstanding that I would purposely come here for.  Pretty much, things look good in pictures, but comes out disappointing. Just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We first came here with some friends and ordered three shaved ice bowls. The traditional ice was pretty good - about the standard Taiwanese type. It has different topping on it and in the ice there was sweetened condensed milk so if you finish the topping, then the ice would still be good. However, the mango ice was super bland with no flavour whatsoever. There were no actual mangoes on top and after the puree was gone, there was just ice.   The second time we came here we ordered a shredded chicken rice and a bubble tea. The bubble tea was amazing compared to other stores but the shredded chicken rice was okay I guess. If you dig down, there would just be oil sitting at the bottom.   Contrary to popular beliefs, the service was pretty good. We sat down with a computer and an iPad and just stayed there for a long time. When we wanted to order, we pressed the button to call the people but then a worker who was passing by after a shift helped us. The people are all super nice and friendly. After a while, they came up to us asking if we're okay with the meal. About after an hour, one lady came up to us to give us water because she saw that we've finished our drinks.   The place overall is pretty good. The atmosphere is fun and great for occasions."}
{"text":"I always get mixed service. The food is okay but asking for water is a complete pain. At least 3 of my 5 visits have ended with the service staff bringing the wrong food, and I'm kind of amazed at the prices they charge for drinks. I mean there are upscale restaurants in Toronto that wouldn't ask for $7.99 for a glass of orange juice. But that aside... it's nice inside, and they have amazing spaghetti, weirdly enough, and I always enjoy it."}
{"text":"The food is so salty!! Especially the beef noodle soup... Couldn't stop drinking water while eating. The service was not very good either... I had to wait more than ten minutes for someone to pick up my bill and give back some change."}
{"text":"They have A LOT on their menu which might be a good idea if you go with friends so you can try different things.   One of their most popular items is the grass jelly with beans and mochis. It's a common dessert in Taiwan and if you're a grass jelly fan this is the thing to try. It comes in separate bowls on a tray so you can adjust your own amount/servings. It is a bit filling though so either come on an empty stomach or share with a friend. Their bubble tea is pretty good, although on the sweet side; kind of like the ones at Cha Me Cha. Service, however, was a bit slow so you're pretty much sitting there watching people eat before you get your order.  The atmosphere is pretty casual but can be loud at times, especially weekends.  They really do have a huge range of desserts so chances are you'll find something here. Not 'the' greatest, but a good casual hang out in you're in the area. Just be careful of the times you go; it can get packed."}
{"text":"I'm a Taiwanese, it's taiwanese foods, of course I like it, I will be back :) I highly recommend u guys to order ??? & ????"}
{"text":"I would give this a 3.5 stars.   The good: the menu is extensive! It takes some time to go through it but there's something for everyone. The decor is cute and there are 2 cafes side by side, so if it's busy at one, you can always head over to the other one. The food and drinks are mediocre. As a group, we shared the toast that was topped like a tower, it definitely beautiful to look at.   The bad: Probably looks better than it tastes. The food and drink that I got wasn't amazing. The toast can take up to 30 minutes to make - so be patient!"}
{"text":"Average food, slow service, and overpriced.   Ordered some tofu pudding  and an iced chrysanthemum honey tea here since my friends normally come here when they're in North York.  Service was slow and inconsistent. The first bowl of noodles my friend ordered arrived first. 10 minutes later, I received my tofu pudding dessert. And 15 minutes later, my friend's meal arrived. Don't know why there was such a long wait.  Anyways, the tofu pudding had a nice display, but the toppings themselves were okay. I prefer the tofu pudding from other neighbouring places such as Zen-Q or Sweet O'Clock. The texture of the tofu was off for me, it had a texture that I'm not used to.  The drink was so overpriced! $7.99 for a large. I get the same amount for the same drink from Petit Potato for $6.99 .. not impressed.  Overall quality of the food was really mediocre in my opinion. I wouldn't come here again, there are better Taiwanese restaurants in the area that offer better prices. Go somewhere else.  Also, the wait was surprisingly long here.  TL;DR Drinks and food are overpriced. Go somewhere else to have some Taiwanese food. Service is really slow as well."}
{"text":"I was there over the weekend and its located at a convenient place. But its packed the minute I arrived. I went there on Friday, which presumely why its packed with crowds of people too, although the place is of decent space. It did fill up quickly. The food was very Taiwanese style, but had great variety of drinks and snacks. The Chicken shredded rice bowl which I had was kind of oily. Its almost like Chicken rice, but Taiwanese style. The Mango sago and pomelo dessert was yummy, but I find it too sweet for my tastebud.  Although I did find the Green soy latte interesting and was served at the right temperature to drink. One of the best dish I had that night was probably the Taiwanese popcorn chicken.   Service was good and efficient. Worth to try and if you want somewhere to chill and have bubble tea, its worth checking out."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try out this place for awhile. Paid a visit last sunday for lunch and was quite disappointed.  My boyfriend ordered the minced pork belly on rice, it was ok nothing special.  I ordered the 3 cup chicken rice ($10.99) - which had all the matching ingredients and flavor, but i found it slightly too greasy. I know that's the style of the dish, but it was too oily for my liking. We also shared the salty fried popcorn chicken ($8.99) as a side which was not good - i've had better. It confuses me a little though how they charge $8.99 for the fried chicken, but if you wanted it with rice like a meal they still charge you $8.99. hm?  One thing that really bugged me was our bill came to $29.69 - I didn't have change so I paid $35 (a $20 bill, $10 bill, and $5 bill). Obviously, the intent was for them to break the $5 bill. Turns out the waitress came back with a $5 bill and 31 cents.  ... I don't think they are stupid and wouldn't be able to make the connection that I wanted them to break the bill so I'm thinking they did it on purpose (which I know some asian restaurants do) to suggest you to pay more tip. No way i would have gave them $5 tip, so I called the waitress over to break the $5 bill into coins for me. This is a big negative to for me, minus 0.5 star rating giving this place 2.5 rating.  The food was okay but expensive and not worth it. You can find better taiwanese food elsewhere for a cheaper price. Don't think I'd come back."}
{"text":"I've only ordered food items here, so my review is only based on food experience.  They have extensive menu, so you may be a bit overwhelmed when the menu comes.  I've had Eel Fried Rice in a hot stone bowl, Beef in teriyaki sauce on rice in a sizzling plate, Curry chicken on rice in a sizzling plate.  I love my food served on hot and sizzling plates/bowls, so it tasted fresh and appetizing.  Flavourful, and nice presentation as well.   Service is friendly and attentive. Out of 5-6 times I've been here, I have never had a rude or unfriendly staff.   I would come back for my hot plated food, but would not likely to venture off on other items on the menu."}
{"text":"What a cute cafe! They have a variety of food & drinks.   Bubble tea - really good. Not powdery. Just the way I like it. One night after dinner we saw a sign for buy 1 get 1 free any bubble tea drink takeout so we decided to try it.   Dessert - our friends ordered a mango cake and they forgot the fruits which was supposed to come with the cake.   We ordered the Honey Toast - so huge! So crunchy! Soo good! If it came with an extra scoop of ice cream it would be literally perfect. The outside had the perfect crunch like a crouton and the inside was soft like a toast. Mmmm. Perfect amount of sweetness, not too sweet but sweet enough.   Price - average.  I must come back to try their food & other bbts :)"}
{"text":"Mabu Station appears to be a sit-down fast-food Asian cafe, as evidenced by the tray of pre-poured cups of water I saw the server take from. Dingy, worn mucus-green vinyl booths on one side, floor-scratching metal patio chairs with tables on the other, Mabu Station appears to be due for a decor refresher.  Service was relatively efficient. I ordered a mango lychee slushie and a bolognese spaghetti/chicken cutlet combo. Overall, not terrible. A basic tomato and mince meat sauce with cheese broiled over it atop very ordinary spaghetti noodles, something easily prepared at home. The chicken cutlet was okay as well, with a Taiwanese-popcorn-chicken-like crust/batter and the meat was not dry; the crust extended beyond the meat quite a bit and fell apart from it when cutting in. Portion size would have been acceptable had it been five dollars less. The slushie was actually not bad, comparable to sugar marmalade's with special bubbles that encase a burst of juice, but smaller for the price tag.  Overall, an unremarkable, slightly overpriced meal of convenience. Probably their strength is the variety in their menu should you be looking for a place to eat for a divided/indecisive group. Otherwise, given the various other choices nearby, I'd likely recommend elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of my friends for dessert after going out for dinner.  However, I wish we could've came here first as the food/dessert menu looked to die for!  I was already too full to eat dessert but I ordered the mango pancake.  Honestly, I didn't like it very much it was basically a crepe with yellow dye stuffed with whipped cream and small slices of mango.  Wasn't a fan of it, and it didn't have much flavour.  I would love to come here again on an empty stomach and try the hot foods and maybe their towered toasts with ice cream.  Maybe then I could probably give this place a better rating."}
{"text":"The food is okay. The menu has variety choices includes desserts too. But the service is terrible by the server, Michelle. We are there for food not listening to the staff complaining how tired she is. We were there regularly but becoming less because of the service. Literally, we don't even bother to ask for her service as she will look piss whenever you ask for help."}
{"text":"Friends and I contemplated for some time on whether or not to come here due to the many negative reviews and low rating. We decided not to at first but finally we gave it a shot... and... I'M SO GLAD WE DID!  There are 2 Mabu Stations situated right next to each other and it appears that both serve the same stuff. The first one had its seats all filled up so we stepped into the second one. Fortunately, there were still 2 seats left. Oh boy, the traffic here is non-stop! Once a seat is empty, someone's there to fill it up! Very busy restaurant however, service is great.   We ordered the Mixed Fruit with Mango Sago and Ice Cream. Not too sweet and very creamy. Loveeee the sago \"pops\"! I do wish that they use fresh fruits though especially the pineapples... just one small bite and you'd know it's canned pineapples. However, they do use fresh strawberries and kiwis. We also ordered one of their popular taiwanese sweet bowls: the Grass Jelly with Coconut milk, Peanuts, Sweet potato and Red Bean. Kid you not, we were all confused as to how we were suppose to eat this thing. We got a big bowl of steaming hot \"soup\" but it turns out to be the grass jelly and a platter of the toppings with coconut milk on the side. So, we had to chop up the grass jelly (with our spoons) in the big bowl then add in the toppings and then splash in the coconut milk. Does not look as good as the picture but it definitely tasted BOMB! I enjoyed it very much since the toppings were not too sweet; the unsweeten grass jelly helped balance everything out. Mind you, this bowl of goody is pretty big. The 3 of us couldn't even finish it!  Saw the other foods that people were eating around me and it makes me wanna come back to try them all. So... I will be back!  Now, I've read many reviews about service being terrible here and that is why this place is marked with the 2.5 stars. Honestly, service is pretty good here. Pretty quick and accurate in terms of requests (e.g. more water, napkins, spoons, etc) and food. Of course, they do not speak fluent English and when they do speak it, it may seem like they're coming off rude but, I truly believe they're not trying to be rude. It's a misinterpretion due to a language barrier. Anywho, they even provide feedback slips for you to fill out at the end so you have a chance to help them improve in certain areas. You don't have to leave a feedback but, they do add a 10% discount if you do!"}
{"text":"I'll give this place maybe like a 2.5. Just another typical Asian/Taiwanese cafe-type place in the area I think. They have a really big menu with lots of food options, but everything seems so damn pricey, especially for what you end up getting. I ordered some kind of rice dish with eel in it that was pretty basic, and I think it was around $10. When it came out though, I was surprised at how small it was, and not very impressed. The taste of the food was fine, but nothing special, so I didn't feel like it was that worth it. I will say though that their desserts look good (although I didn't try any), so if anything I would recommend having dinner somewhere else and just coming to this place for drinks and/or dessert."}
{"text":"i went there a month ago, had the mille feuille and japanese bowl of chicken and egg on rice. it was horrible.  i strangely got the dessert first."}
{"text":"They opened up 2 stores side by side! I think they're joined together? I'm not so sure. The expansion is really cool :)   The decorations in the restaurant is adorable and the seating arrangements are comfortable. It's suitable for groups to relax and hang out. The food is very flavourful, my favourites being the popcorn chicken and the kimchi beef on rice. Yuuum. Though I wish they could give better portions for the amount that they're charging. I remember counting only 3 pieces of beef in my bowl of rice.   The drink items are extremely expensive, about $8 for a large drink with tapioca. Chatime (across the street) is much cheaper and the quality is just as good, even better. Only good I see in getting drinks at Mabu is that they have more varieties.   Edit: The tapioca can be really undercooked at times...  I previously mentioned that their service was bad. I went for dinner the other day, and service was great! A lot of improvement."}
{"text":"Very good in Taiwanese dessert. Last time went with my family and although it was crowded in both of the restaurants that they have, the waitresses tried their best seat us asap. Recommend the waffle! Very chewy and"}
{"text":"Ive never experienced such WEIRD service... it was just... bad.. and when i say weird. I mean the two people they had serving us were VERY awkward and lost.   We arrived and sat ourselves. To order, we had to fill out a sheet. The waitress gave us a pencil but no sheet. We waited for about 20 minutes to finally get any attention from her even though the place was empty other than one other table with two people. It seemed as though she was avoiding us. When she finally came she looked very frustrated saying \"you have no order sheet?\" And proceeded to grab us one and fill it in herself while we told her our orders.  We ordered 4 black milk teas and 1 creme brulee. She got so frustrated not understanding our simple order that she just left the pencil and paper with us. She told us to fill it in ourselves... ok. I dont understand what is so difficult about 4 milk teas and a creme brulee but okay.   After another 10 minutes of trying to get any attention, a male server came and we tried to confirm what we wrote. Along with our order we also wrote the code beside it on the menu so there wouldnt be any confusion. Our server saw the creme brulee and kept saying \"this is not a drink\". We said we know its a dessert. It was STRANGE. He continued to tell us 3 more times its not a drink. Ok. We know. Then he kept saying wait so whats this? And 5x we said its black milk tea. He got frustrated and raised his voice like \"I KNOW BUT WHAT IS THIS?!!\" we answered \"its black milk tea\" for the 6th time and he said ohhh ok and left quickly.   I will say it again. It was STRANGE lol...  10 minutes later he came back and asked us what creme brulee was even though there was a code number next to it. We told him \"its fine just cancel it\" and he said NO and left really quickly. Okay.. Do you not know your own menu? :S  Honestly it was the strangest weirdest most awkward service ive ever experienced. After all the trouble, they managed to get our order right (shocking)  As for the drinks, they were actually pretty good. Creme brulee was just ok.   Overall, if youre really desperate for bubble tea and its 2AM (nothing else is open) and youre willing to have bad service. Come. As for me, I probably will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The design and concept of the cafe is really cute. But the desserts here aren't that great. Got the mango shaved ice. The mangos were hard. They were ripe yet. The sauce tasted like those bottle mango sauce. I don't recommend getting it.   The durian pancake was pretty good.    Their egg pudding wasn't good. I didn't like the texture or flavor.   The flowerpot cake wasn't that good either. The cake was kinda dry."}
{"text":"Went here one night last week.  I like how the other unit beside is also the same restaurant so they could check if the other restaurant next door had more room for a bigger party.   Service was okay. They can't split the bill for you.   Loved the decor, very cute for a first date. The food was  okay. I got the  tiramisu crepe which was good. The bubble tea was not that great. Wouldn't recommend the bubble tea, tastes very watered down. My friend ordered some mango dishes but they were just okay, they didn't finish it because it wasn't that good.    I thought the basement was sketchy, it smelled like uncooked sausages. The washrooms were downstairs, one stall for girls and one stall for guys. My girlfriend had to use the guy's room because the girl's room was occupied.  I would probably come back again and try something else next time."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch and bubble tea with 3 friends. The first unit we entered was full, so a staff took us next door where there were empty tables waiting.  ATMOSPHERE: Cute décor. Nice and bright. Very chill & casual vibe. They have two units side by side. So you maybe able to find a seat fairly quickly. Seating is tight though, so be prepared to get cosy.  SERVICE: OK. Nothing exceptional. There was a lot of staff socializing, but they were helpful when assistant was required. No issues had.  PRICE: Average. As expected for such a bubble tea restaurant.  FOOD: For the Eats - Portions are generous, but flavour is lacking. We tried the popcorn chicken. Still prefer Charidise's version more. This one, the batter was too thick and heavy. The sauce was ok, it helped at least with the dryness caused by the batter.  Also tried the okonomiyaki-style poutine. It was tasty. And again the portion was HUGE. But there wasn't enough toppings-to-fries ratio. A lot of the fries at the bottom ended up being plain - completely void of sauce and toppings.  The drinks were definitely the best thing about the meal. Good bubble tea, which I would return for.  Tip: They don't split bills here. There's a sign up saying so, at cash register."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Meh foods and drinks. Quite pricey and not worth it. Rather go a bit further into Richmond hill for this kind of establishments.  The rice combo was 10 bucks for very little food. Though the flavour was ok the rice was undercooked so it ruined the meal. The drinks were either too sweet or bland.   More than likely will not be returning."}
{"text":"We went for afternoon tea,  the menu pics look great,  we were going to order some drinks and dessert. But after the drinks came,  we decided that was it,  we don't want desserts. The drinks are FAR from what it looks like the pic,  and instead of serving it in glass drinks,  it came in disposable plastic containers.  It is apparently not a mistake,  but their standard. The taste is alright,  nothing spectacular.  Won't be coming back again."}
