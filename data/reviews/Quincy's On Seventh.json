{"text":"Love the new Quincy's nightclub.  Great intelligent electronic DJ's.  I come Fridays and Saturdays and occasionally Thursdays.  They play drum n bass (my fav), hardhouse, breaks, industrial/gilch/synthpop (thursday nights), etc.   the upstairs room usually has dubstep for those who are into that.  No cheesy techno here.      last weekend was by far the best DJ experience i've had lately in Calgary.  Great line-up of DJ's.  There were 2 oldschool dnb DJ's on the decks at one point who were inspiring to dance to.  They really knew how to play with the beats and keep it fresh.  great place to dance, meet people, and just feel the music.  lots of space and projectors.  not a place for top 40.  It's all about the music.  The only minor issue is that I wish the parties got started a little earlier.  Sometimes no one else starts dancing until after midnight.  I don't mind, but I'm sure the DJ's do.    great potential.  Really cheap or free cover (surprisingly).   I hope more people spread the word and come."}

{"text":"This place has so much potential. Great ambiance, great food but it seems to have lost all of its clients.  We used to go here to celebrate and its a good place to hold a party but there's never anyone there anymore.  Prices are a little steep but the quality's good."}
{"text":"Its been about five years since I was last at Quincy's and they'll be lucky if I return in another five years.    I work in the building right next door and one of my customers is a couple blocks to the east so seemed like a good place to meet.  Given it was just going to be a quick lunch we decided to stay in the upper/bar level which is fine but was surprised to see they had a much more limited menu vs. what I remember being served for lunch in the dining room (and what was posted on their website).  The menu was quite limited with just a couple of salads, a few sandwiches/wraps and a handful of burger choices.  We both ordered the chicken club with a side salad.  Seemed safe, honestly...how hard is it to screw up a chicken club?  Well, they gave it their best shot!  I'm by no means a chef but have eaten out enough to know there are certain expectations when it comes to well known items like a chicken club and for that sandwich the bread of choice has always been and should always be some form of sourdough, french or maybe even texas toast.  What it shouldn't be is a limp, crushed hamburger bun.  it got worse as you moved to the core of the sandwich.  If I had to guess the chicken was precooked (like the bags of frozen chicken breast you can get from costco...not spiced but lightly grilled) and kind of rubbery.  The tomatoes were looking a little battle weary and their choice of cheese was odd....a big slab of brie.  Seemed like an odd choice to me.    Given their performance on the sandwich I shouldn't have been surprised with the side salad.  All the greens were wilted and some looking like they should have made it into the trash and not my bowl.    We were there on a Friday and you'd have expected it to be packed.  Given the quality (or lack thereof) I can understand why they were only about 1/4 full.  Really is a shame since it is a great location and a good space.  Not sure if its inexperienced management or they've just lost the passion for the business but if there was every a Calgary candidate for Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares its Quincy's."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Quincy's on Seventh (restaurant section) for lunch.  There is now a Burger Lounge as well.  There is an entrance going into Quincy's from the train platform; it goes through the Burger Lounge.  The other entrance is facing east, right beside the platform pedestrian ramp.  The waiter brought out focacia bread as appys.  It's OK.  My friends both had the Steak Sandwich - came with mushrooms, steak on a toasted garlic bread, comes with fries.  They liked what they ordered.  I had the Prime Rib sandwich - changed the bread to brown Texas Toast.  I asked for rare and I got medium.  Came with fries and I didn't want fries; can't substitute for salad and had to pay extra $3.50 for a substitution!  Just took my fries back and gave it away at the office.  Conclusion:  It's OK.  Not what I wanted."}
