{"text":"Was at Locale tonight for dinner. As usual, everything was great...except the host. Not a smile to be found on this one. Not sure why it was such a big deal for her to find us a spot on the half empty patio. I did mention our interest in the patio when booking our reservation.   Food was great.   Server was great.   Host was subpar (seems to be a trend here) ...as they have yet to seat us where we request .."}
{"text":"Great first experience. Will definitely be going back soon. If you're looking for some great food and service - give it a try. Shared grilled calamari = decent. Enjoyed a grilled pork chop on a bed of sweet potato pur√©e, brussel sprouts, and a drunken apple. Wife enjoyed the short ribs. And the delicious sour-cherry pie with a nice espresso perfectly capped the night. Only ask, would have liked the pie slightly warmed."}
{"text":"Stopped into Locale on our way from Pearson to cottage country. We had traveled all day on flights from the west coast and wanted something fresh and satisfying. Locale did NOT disappoint. We all ordered pasta, I have a wheat allergy and was delighted to see organic spelt spaghetti as an option. I was told there was even gluten free pasta as well! The pasta was obviously made fresh in house-It was perfect. The service was good but could have been slightly more attentive. The draft beer list was not super exciting, being from BC I was a little bummed to drink an okanagon beer as i was hoping to try something local. Again the food made up for it and the patio was lovely. I would recommend this to any pasta seafood lover!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner and was surprised to find it so busy! This is definitely a hidden gem of King City.   Our dinner was exceptional. We ordered:  - Fried calamari and shrimp. This was lightly battered and perfectly seasoned with deep fried herbs.  - Lasagna. The sauce it was served in was delicious complimented the dish well.  - Funghi pizza. The crust was so thin, light and fluffy!  - Honey budino. Smooth and creamy - it was the perfect end to our meal.   Our server was very friendly, attentive and patient. He went into great depth explaining parts of the menu we weren't sure about.  Loved this place! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful. However, I thought the food was average. I found myself comparing the pizza and pasta to Marcellos, which I think is so much better and less expensive then Locale. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"came here a couple of months ago for date night as it was awesome, we sat upstairs, our waiter provided very good service ( cant remember dudes name). Wish we sat outside, next time...it looked nice and romantic, you know the stuff that gets you points! Food was super, went across street to Hunt Pub for drinks after. Good times"}
{"text":"Some like it -- not sure why. Slow service, so so food and overpriced. We went home hungry.  Underdelivers for prices charged."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the menu here. High quality ingredients lead to a very tasty outing. Super vibe. Great to have in King!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in King City! The exterior is covered with Christmas lights which makes it very festive. The restaurant itself is quite busy so I recommend making a reservation ahead of time.   We were here for dinner and decided to share a bottle of red between the three of us. Price was pretty reasonable, for reds, bottles start at around $30. We ordered a calamari salad (~$16) which was delicious and a PLT pizza to share. The pizza is a must try. Great presentation and the pizza itself was topped up like a salad!  Would highly recommend anyone looking for a Christmas dinner place and one that is not going to cost you an arm and leg while still having great food!"}
{"text":"Followed the highway sign from Hwy 400 and were glad to have done so. We managed to avoid the long line that was formed by the time we had left - maybe a reservation on a weekend evening would be a good idea. Our waiter was friendly and very helpful. If we are ever in the area again we will certainly try to eat here."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner based on recommendation from some friends. We were very happy ! The restaurant has a great atmosphere it was quiet and the staff were very good our waiter was excellent (unfortunately can't remember his name). Would definitely recommend for date night. The only thing that I would say was an \"issue\" was parking just be ready to look for something on the street."}
{"text":"Overall i thought it was average. I see that this restaurant tries to give off a modern but classy look, but it just didn't cut it for me. We had reservations for a Friday at 7:30. We got there and they told us that our table was just about ready for us and that we could wait at the bar. 25mins later, our table still wasn't ready which i was quite disappointed about. Finally we sat down and got to order appetizers and food. The wine list was impressive for such a small place. We got our appetizers which were by far the best part of the night. We had ordered a platter of food for sharing, which was very good and incredibly well decorated. It took quite a while for our mains to arrive, about 30-40 mins. I had ordered a pasta special dish with a cream sauce and when i got it, it tasted uncooked and a little hard. The cream sauce was too thick and didn't quite have enough seasoning. I ended up not wanting to finish it and took it home. Desert was very good. They have a great selection which i was told changed quite often, so its not always certain they will have the same desert there again if you are looking for it. I had an apple crumble cake which was very good but i had noticed i got one of the last slices and as i finished my cake, i saw them bring out a new cake that looked fresh out of the oven and hot. Im a little disappointed they don't heat up each slice before bringing it out. I would have easily waited an extra 5 mins to get a hot slice, or have my slice heated up. Overall for the food quality and service, I'm not sure it was all worth the price of the bill, but it was okay none the less."}
{"text":"The options in the area are obviously not plentiful yet I'd put Locale up against any of downtown TOs Italian fare."}
{"text":"I have to say that last night I went to the Locale for the first time and the service was above and beyond amazing from my waiter. I had the Soppresatta Pizza and girlfriend the Shrimp Pasta which were both exceptionally delicious. I definately will be returning back soon"}
{"text":"Service was weak. Poor refreshing of water and keeping wine topped up. Wife's pasta was barely warm and my aged steak was chewy and boring compared to a fresh Costco steak. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Originally reserved for 4, ended up just two. Frank the owner went over and beyond expectations for us two first timers. Ordered the calamari and smelts and were just delicious, and the thank you from Frank was even more surprising. The seafood pasta was delicious and I didn't need to ask for any salt. The flavour was bang on. I never was here before nor did I never meet the owner, but I and my date had a great first experience and will come back again soon.  The guitarist along tonight really added to the mood too. Great experience."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, especially in the summer. I've eaten there well over 5 times and found it to be consistent, I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking to have a decent Italian meal...... If you're trying to stay away from crowdy places then locale can be quite busy fri and sat nights"}
{"text":"Went for my mothers birthday.  Unbelievably disappointed.  My eldest daughter  asked for  prosciutto on her margarita pizza and the chef refused (that's right I said refused) because my younger daughter requested that chef prepare the gnocchi in just tomato sauce.  According to our server \"the chef insists the food served per his vision\".   I almost fell off my chair.  The restaurant was half empty. I was unaware that restaurant business in King City was so booming that it's considered ok to treat a customer this way.  Not to mentioned dinner for five was north of 5.  Never ever again.   Most restaurant do their best to accommodate their clients. This was  arrogance beyond belief."}
{"text":"I decided to take the advice from someone much wiser than I, and visited this newer business for lunch. A surprising taste of southern Italy in the tiny village of King City, Locale is located near the intersection of King Road and Keele almost directly across the street from the well known Hogans Inn.  Driving past it for the past 3 months almost daily, no new business has been on my radar for as long as Locale, who made the transition from take-out to a sit down dining space in December 2012. The menu which apparently changes with the seasons is primarily Italian/Italian fusion. However, after viewing the menu I would say it is more specifically a Southern Italian (Calabrese and Sicilian) influenced menu with items such as Arancini, and Smelts.   A contemporary looking spot with exposed wire lighting above and rustic looking wide hardwood floors below. Locale offers a splash of sophisticated casual fine dining in an unexpected and unassuming converted historical home. In layman's terms, this place is swanky. DATE SPOT ALERT!!! Impressive and surprising! Boys you'd be remiss to not add this to your list of places to take your lady.   After taking the tour of this unique space we took our seats and immediately began to drool over the delicious menu options. My DC and I looked at the pizza's that were pouring out of the kitchen and while they looked delicious (on my to do list for a future visit) we decided on a different course.  To begin we decided to share two appetizers; Fried calamari with smelts and Aragosta arancini (lobster arancini with Brie). The Calamari was passable and not much different from the norm, however the smelts were incredibly well done and the traditional strong fishy taste of the smelts was well managed and tasted amazing. The arancini was amazing! With the mix of lobster risotto and Brie in the middle it was a welcome difference from the norm - highly recommend this as a shareable appy.  Then came what I will call, the money maker, our main course. My DC and I both perused the menu and somehow both independently landed decided to have the Lasagna alla bolognese (with bechiamella). The portions that came to our table were massive. Wide, plate filling portions layered expertly with meat sauce, pasta, bechimella sauce cooked to perfection without the lasagna crust on top (which is caused by over cooking the top layer - I hate that. This was .... wait for it....   The BEST Lasagna I have ever had at a restaurant.   The moment the first bite hit my lips I was sold. It brought me back to my childhood and the excitement I would feel when I found out we were having lasagna for dinner. Have you ever salivated from a meal while you were eating it? Because that was a first for me and had I not been in a public place I would have made a mess of myself by discarding my utensils and going whole hog on this face first.   Service was wonderful and our server made excellent recommendations and was a pure joy to chat with over lunch. Thank you!!  Things to look forward to: Opening up a cocktail lounge on the second floor of the house, presently under renovation. After speaking to one of the servers they let me know that they plan on offering a mix of more fruity \"ladies night\" cocktails and traditional classics (Sidecars, Old Fashioneds, etc). I cannot wait to make this my alcoholic home away from home office - hopefully they have free WiFi.   Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"The decor, the music, the ambiance and most importantly the food are as close to perfect as I could hope for. Italian/ Mediterranean cuisine, good selection of beverages and our server was one of the most attentive and genuine guys I've ever met. We were greeted with some bread made in house that was divine.  We started with the Adriatic platter appetizer. It consisted of various fish and veggies from around Adriatic Sea. My wife ordered the short ribs and I had the Grigliate which consisted of select cuts of meat done to perfection. Nothing fell short of my expectations.  I had heard a lot about this place and it delivered. It was very busy so we did have a lengthy wait between meals but our waiter was so attentive he constantly checked in on us. Since we had no schedule to fill so we just spent our time with drinks and talk. Something parents never get to do at home.  If you're in the 30-50 range and want downtown style dining experience uptown then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I just went here with my family the other day. It is a cute place, spacious. The staff were very nice. The food was good- I got casarece pasta it was amazing. My sister got the fish pasta and spaghetti it was okay. We got the sangria- white and red both good, also cab sav was good. The calamari was average. The fries appetizer was good. The appetizer plate with an assortment of meats was pretty good. Overall, it was good I lived in italian so I have high expectations but it was good not amazing though."}
{"text":"Very popular restaurant. Came here to catch up with some old friends, ordered the calamari salad and the P.L.T. pizza, and shared a bottle of Seven Peaks cabernet sauvignon.   The arugula essentially melted in my mouth and went very well with the calamari, which was cooked nicely such that it was just right--not too tough. The PLT, on the other hand, not so much. I would have much preferred the pizza to have been warm/hot, as it was served relatively cold. Despite having many toppings on a flat crust, this aspect caused me to reduce my ratings. Service was decent, waiter frequently visited our table to check up on us/refill what was needed. We needed to be ushered out by 8:30PM because of a subsequent reservation. The bill turned up to be just over $90 including tax and tips. Not too bad for a fancy night out, but don't expect to be stuffed.  Overall, I give this experience 3 stars, as I was a bit disappointed by the pizza, but everything else was perfectly in place."}
{"text":"Great location.  You really have to love that old country look.  Service is excellent.  The menu lacks a lot of variety and they don't allow substitutions.  Pricing is okay but portions are rather small.  The pizza doesn't seem to be traditional wood oven and therefore lacks that taste or presentation.  Overall three star seems to suit it more.  Can easily move up if they add variety to the menu, be a little more generous with portions and try more traditional approach with the pizza."}
{"text":"Yummy food, great casual but sophisticated atmosphere, good wine. Great place to go for a nice homemade, Italian meal. Grilled calamari is just incredible. Tender and tasty. The pasta is homemade and you can tell, same with the pizza. Can't get much better than that. It's also priced very fairly. Thanks for the experience!"}
{"text":"So happy this place is near us. Now I don't have to go downtown. Great atmosphere, well managed, the food is fantastic. Great place to have drinks and apps on a busy weeknight when you want to get out of the house. Always a great experience. Hope they can keep it up."}
{"text":"What a lovely hidden gem! We were meeting friends from Bradford and needed an in between spot. Came here on a recommendation from a co-worker and glad we did! Setting is cozy and modern, set in a historical building. We enjoyed grilled octopus, burrata and prosciutto for appetizers which were fresh and perfectly prepared. Serving size was generous. Mains were branzino, boar pasta, pizza and steak, no complaints. Each were delicious and presented beautifully. My one complaint which we not stop us from returning was that service was slow. Very friendly but we saw tables who arrive after is get their food first and there was quite a lag between ordering and receiving our starters."}
{"text":"Delicious food, warm ambiance and excellent service!  We will definitely return.  We ordered grilled calamari, polenta fries, lasagna and PLT pizza.   All were delicious but PLT pizza was the real winner.  It's not something we would typically order but it was a unique and delightful surprise for our taste buds.  Our nice waitress informed us that there's live entertainment on Fridays and Saturdays...and oh wait...1/2 priced bottles of wine on Wednesday!  Need I say more?  :)"}
{"text":"I thought it may be just the response from my review but I decided to read through other reviews and Locale's responses. The response from Locale sees to always be arrogant and defensive. I can't speak for the other reviewers but I haven't been back to Locale since receiving my response.  The antagonistic tone certainly does not welcome visiting again. I can't imagine encountering this person inside the restaurant if there was ever an issue with the meal. Service has always been super friendly by the wait staff. Too bad it does not extend to their Yelp reviewers."}
{"text":"In a word: amazing. Locale boasts an outstanding decor and ambience (both upstairs and down, as well as outdoor patio) and a menu that had so many great sounding choices that choosing a single entree was very difficult. I ended up going with the salmon (crab and pistachio crusted) which was fantastic. My wife had the butternut squash ravioli which was equally superb. Friendly, attentive and down to earth service. Great appys (we had calamari) and dessert (my wife's rustic apple pie was ridiculous - and of course I was able to easily choke down my delectable pumpkin pie). Overall, I think this is my favourite restaurant in the York region so far (visiting in-laws from out of town)."}
{"text":"Gotta respond to this idiot manager who is keeping track of these details.. news alert.. the customer is always right!!   I left your nice waitress a $12 tip so in my books it was an $80 lunch. And we got to the restaurant at 1:20 and didn't get the calamari until just before 2.  A little defensive are we? And by the way Desserts Plus, Marcello's, Paoletti's and Abruzzo's all destroy this pretentious joint not only in quality of food, but value and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is seriously great! It reminds me of so many Italian restaurants in the city. It's cozy, the decor is stunning and the food is really delicious. Try their broccolini!!!  I did find the drink menu to be a bit pricey and limited but other than that, I'll be dining here again, without a doubt"}
{"text":"I love this place! Best restaurant I've been to in the area by far, reminds me of Northern Cali. Pizza was perfect, risotto balls always delicious. One of my favorite dishes was the butternut squash agnolotti. The flavor combo of sweet and savory was so good, and the pasta cooked to perfection. The servers know their stuff and are so friendly! My only wish is that they would open for lunch on the weekends."}
{"text":"I had a great dining experience here. Located right at the intersection of King Road & Keele Street, Locale is the perfect place to go to for Italian food in the area. The restaurant is beautiful both inside and out!   Pizza and pasta are my favourites, and there is surely a lot of that to choose from. I started with the Patatine Fritte, which was pretty much a huge portion of hand cut fries with truffle oil and parmigiano cheese. The house made balsamic ketchup that came with it was amazing and really added to the fries. Then, I had the Lasagna, which was absolutely delicious. The beef and tomato sauce were made just right. No complaints at all - would certainly recommend either of these dishes.   The service was wonderful. My server was VERY friendly, knowledgable, and attentive. What more can you ask for?  I'd recommend this place to anyone who is in the mood for Italian, especially for a date or a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Update: Went back to try it again and the service was honestly horrible. The server did not bring the drinks we had ordered to the table, and finally after repeatedly reminding them they finally brought them. Also, we had asked for the bills since we were in a hurry and had mentioned that to the server in a respectful manner, and they took a good 15 mins if not longer to bring the bills. Then they left and neglected to cash us out since majority of us were paying by card. Disappointing service equals a N O in my books. I eat out at a restaurant for the experience and to be served, not to constantly remind someone what is expected of them...."}
{"text":"I've been going to locate for the past year. Go there to eat at least every 2 weeks. Only thing about locale is that you never know what to choose to eat because it's all good. My favourite was the black cod a while back but it was a special of the day. It all good and the beer selection is good and getting better."}
{"text":"Waited 35 min for appetizers just to receive over fried calamari and bad tomatoes in a Caprese salad. Waited an hour for main dish which actually was alright but overshadowed by the whole bad experience. This is a typical restaurant mistake. Too many seats and not a big enough kitchen allows for unhappy customers."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in King City. It's pricey, but the best food around town. I enjoy eating here and bringing friends to this place for hang-outs and celebrations."}
{"text":"Great looking restaurant, our waitress Courtney was my favourite, I would definitely prefer her to be my waitress again. Food was much better than I thought it would be!"}
{"text":"We've been meaning to come here for a long time now and finally did on Canada Day.  What a great place! Lovely service, great atmosphere and the food was top notch.  And I've never seen a menu that small be that hard to choose from. Everything on it sounds amazing I had such a hard time choosing.  Will be back here again and soon, can't wait to try more of that awesome menu (and their specials sounded amazing).  My burger was great but sooo messy I couldnt finish it, otherwise food was top notch."}
{"text":"Locale has been serving King City for close to three years, and it's still going strong. Located right at keele and king road amongst a few other cute restaurants side by side. The interior is warm with the dim lights, wood and rustic furniture truly gives truly gives this place a cozy feel. On a warm night our party decided to hit a patio, and was it beautiful, spacious and clean. For food, we rated it a 3/5, their mezze mezze was a bit disappointing due to the choices of cheese and selection of meat. The margarita pizza we ordered which was okay...perhaps add more diversity of cheese to the pizza. For dessert we shared their crema de limone, served with a chocolate biscotti was quite satisfying. 4/5  Overall If you're looking for drinks in a nice area whether it be indoor or outdoor seating, this is a great place. However in terms of food, it's OKAY."}
{"text":"My evening at Locale started off to a bad start. There was a mistake with the reservation number on the fault of the restaurant. Unfortunately, the hostess and the assumed head of house were not very respectful and didn't admit the error on their end. We were squished at a small table. We raised our concerns and the owner came out and spoke to us and was happy to move us to a much nicer table.   Upon realizing a mistake was made, the night pulled a 180. The food was absolutely amazing!  The table split the cozze mussels and a prosciutto and mozzarella sharing platter. We also received a complimentary fried calamari appetizer from the owner.  The entrees were amazing!  We took a recommendation from our server for which bottle of wine to have and it was perfect. The grilled calamari is absolutely phenomenal.  We were there celebrating a birthday and our server was kind enough to bring out a complimentary dessert.   Despite the initial setback, we had a lovely night out and will return."}
{"text":"This place was really close to a park my friend and I were at. Seeing how cute this place looked in the pictures we had to give it a try.  The interior is classy with a bar in the centre of the place. Quiet ambience allowing you to have a conversation with your dining partner.  My friend and I both really wanted to try the same thing but what kind of foodie adventure is that? Instead I ordered the gnocchi and she ordered the agnolotti.  The gnocchi was cooked perfectly without the bitter aftertaste it can sometimes have. It was the sauce where it lost me, it had way too much basil and not enough asparagus flavour.  My friend really enjoyed what she had. She said it was cooked perfectly and delicious.  For dessert, we shared a salted caramel bundino. I fell in love as the caramel blended with the sweetness of the chocolate base.  Servers were prompt and cost was reasonable.  Definitely enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"I first reviewed this place when it just did take-out, and I've since been a couple of times and I've got to say ... I'M IN LOVE King City is my home town.  This historic building was a book store when I was a little girl, then it was a coffee shop that my best friend and I went to when we were in highschool, and now it's a casual/cool/elegant DELICIOUS Italian restaurant where I can stuff my face and grab a drink. The food is spot on in terms of flavour and preparation. Aranchini (rice balls) change weekly but are always tasty.  Pizza is authentic Italian thin crust and the pasta and salads are unique and delicious. I love their dessert Menu, they are getting their pies from Wanda's Pie in the Sky downtown this summer. Americano is one of the best I've had at a restaurant. Make the trek up to good old King City and enjoy Locale!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is honestly so amazing tucked away in the small town of king city. First impression is the atmosphere, so vibrate and lively with great decor. Next our server was very attentive to our large group of 11 people. Although, our reservations were at 8:30pm and we only started eating at 10:30pm!! Apps took about an hour to arrive, garden, arugula salad and calamari. Besides the wait, the food is seriously fantastic!! So fresh and flavourful! The pork chop is out of this world as well as the fungi pizza! Definitely recommend this place to anyone and will be back!"}
{"text":"Good service. Our server was pleasant and on top of things. Food was timely and tasted ok. Not great and not sure it was worth the $$ but just good.  The restaurant itself was welcoming, clean and trendy.  I would go back just for drinks and the company but the food was not be the driver of my return visit."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in King city.  Nothing comes close in the area.  The service, food and ambiance is nothing but spectacular.   The Chef makes everything with heart and every bite makes me want more.   I have been here several times now and I make it a local go to when I need something north of the city.   Excellent."}
{"text":"This is a little hidden gem. Very good food with a varied menu. A good date night place. Outside patio area has some charm and lovely trees. Service is courteous and generally good with the exception of busy nights. This place always seems to be busy which is a good indicator. We've tried multiple items and specials all were very good. Big love for the fungi pizza  Overall good vibe and reasonably priced good food."}
{"text":"Mmmm, it's just too good.  I had such a nice evening catching up with some girlfriends over a beer and good eats. I ordered the PLT (with all the rave reviews of it, how could I not?!) and man oh man, let me tell you... it was out of this world. The dough is crispy and and everything else just sits nicely on top. The figs, cheese, prosciutto, tomatoes, arugula, balsamic glaze... I just want more now. It was a generous serving and a tasty one at that.  My girlfriends enjoyed a GF pasta and they both mucked and loved it. I can't remember which one though. I also had a bite of the flourless chocolate cake which was decadent.   I've left Locale wanting more. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Locale Restaurant a diamond in the rough that most people drive by. Situated across from Hogan's Restaurant on Keele and Kingside Road.  You know the saying \" when in Rome do as the Romans do\". Sad to say I didn't and had a grilled chicken sandwich was good but not as good as some of the other Italian items I saw been served next to me. I was looking for lasagna but that is only part if their dinner menu.  Cute patio and very nice indoor dining decor.  Staff were very pleasant. Small Parking lot in the back of the restaurant, otherwise you have to take your chance on the road. Close to 400 Hwy.  I'll go back."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Great service, great food and kid friendly. Get the arancini to start and you can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes. We've been looking for a good local place we can count on for years...and we've finally found it. As good as any Italian you'll find in Toronto and the old house setting is beautiful."}
{"text":"For an Italian, there are only a hand full of good authentic Italian. Locale is simply the best and make you feel as though your in a hipster little corner of Italy. Amazing drinks, specials are away lavish and delirious, you cant go wrong with the fresh pasta's as it is made from Farina + in maple. The fried Calamari is so good along with any of the chequertree boards. for mains the PANINO (main), PAPPARDELLE AL CINGHIALE (pasta), P.L.T. (pizza). are just a few of the many dishes I've. mainly my family books parties upstairs and orders a whole bunch from there catering menu. Expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"Our family came here for our anniversary. It turned out to be such a treat for all of us.  Excellent food.  Actually, when the bread basket came with a dish of olive oil that was dotted with what seemed to be only a dime of balsamic vinegar, I was anxious whether we made the right choice coming here. Why would any restaurant be so conservative in dishing out balsamic vinegar? As it turned out, that dark dime nestled beneath the olive oil was not just balsamic vinegar. It was a balsamic vinegar reduction of sorts that gave off such a wonderful, fruity sweetness on top of the sourness. Sigh of relief.  The four of us shared three app's. The mussels, calamari, truffle fries absolutely floored us. Mussels were cooked just right, not chewy and overcooked like they often could be, in a tomato based broth that was crying out to be soaked up by the bread. The grilled calamari had crunchy, flavourful tentacles while the rings were so tender, complemented so well by the baby spinach and vinaigrette dressing. And the kids just loved the truffle fries, that came with a truffle aioli and a balsamic reduction ketchup. Suffice it to say the plates were gleaming clean by the time we were through with what was in them.  The mains were equally good, but we were already hooked by the app's,   For the mains we had a striploin steak that came medium rare just like we ordered, a flavourful braised wild boar sauce with pasta that bounced the teeth, and a savoury pizza. The bone marrow that came with the steak was a beautiful touch, and the steak itself was tender and flavourful. Apparently they also have a 45oz, 75 day dried aged tomahawk steak that gets on the menu every so often.  Excellent service.  Brendon was friendly and professional, and  walked us through the dishes making recommendation on his favourites. Sometimes when servers make recommendations, they could come across as being pushy or even disingenuous. There was none of that here. Brendon's recommendations were sincere and spot on. We felt he genuinely enjoyed the dishes he recommended. He was also attentive to the right degree. The water glasses were never empty, the conversation was light, and the timing perfect.  Oh, and on Wednesdays, wine by the bottle is half-priced!   Very glad we came here for our occasion. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. All the food is so fresh feels like it was hand-picked for me. I go here with my girlfriends on the regular and the menu is different seasonally. I was not a fan of the summer menu but I'm looking forward to the winter menu. The ambiance is great; the service is fantastic and I specially love sitting upstairs. I recommend this to anyone. Make sure you order the beet salad and the Calamari as appetizers you will not be disappointed and will have cravings for it thereafter."}
{"text":"Easily the best restaurant in King. The food is  consistent and the service is great. Very nicely decorated historic home makes for a very nice atmosphere. Not a huge menu but definitely on point."}
{"text":"On nice sunny Sunday eve we decided to seat in the patio. Truly enjoyed the service and relaxing atmosphere. Funghi Pizza, arancini and Belgium ale on tap  are truly 5 starts. The cheese cake with Gelato I will not recommend, there are better places to have it. Will definitely to come back for more Pizza:)"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to venture away from home tonight and head to King City.   After searching through Yelp for a few minutes, we noticed this interesting newish restaurant.  Reviews looked great and photos were appetizing.    Short review - food is fresh and staff are very friendly and helpful. Order the lasagna. The rest is just \"ok\".   The bread with oil/vinegar is fresh and delicious. We're thinking the balsamic vinegar was actually Nona Pia's from dragons den! I'm gonna assume so until someone proves me wrong! Ahahahahah #evilLaugh  We shared the arugula salad. It was fresh and tasty. Nothing to remember but nothing to complain about. It was missing something salty.   The food did come quick. A little too quick.   The short ribs were extremely tender and well cooked. It tasted nice but again, nothing great. The mashed potatoes were definitely the star of the dish.   We also had the spinach gnocchi. It was ok. Presentation was not great. Everything we lose blew this away. It was fresh and tasted fine. Again, nothing special.   We skipped on the dessert in favour of a dipped soft serve cone from a fast food joint ;)   We saw the lasagna dishes. We saw the photos. We saw everyone's reaction while eating it.   We made a mistake!  We'll know for next time.   We'll be back. Hopefully next time we'll get it a 4-5 star rating.   Ciao!"}
{"text":"I keep passing by Locale and have always wondered what that place was.  One day I yelped it and realized its an Italian Restaurant. I love Italian food!  So I bookmarked it to come one day.  Today was the day we decided to visit Locale.  I called at 6:30pm to make dinner reservations for 7:30pm but they only had availability for 7:45pm. So I reserved it. Got there at 7:45 pm and there were cars all lined up outside.  For some reason on a Tuesday night in King City this is a happening place to be!  Apparently there's parking in the alley right behind the restaurant but it was packed and street parking for 2 blocks was also packed.  So my boyfriend parking a few blocks down. I went in first to get us a table.  There was a line up to get in! I finally got our table. Our server Brandon was amazing! Very attentive and explain the menu very well and advised us which items are his favourite.   We got complimentary bread with oil and balsamic vinegar and also ordered the fried calamari to start. Calamari was great.  There were some shrimps in it was well.  For the mains, I ordered the bucatini.  I thought the pancetta should of been more fried and crispy.  This one was mushy and I can taste the fat on it.  But all in all good. My boyfriend had the pappardelle with slowed braised wild boar sauce.  He loved it! For dessert we had the Tiramisu.  It was good but not your normal Tiramisu served like a slice of cake.  This was essentially all the ingredients placed in a cup.  The lady finger was not thoroughly soaked in coffee.  All in all excellent meal.  Had to take off 1 star for the bucatini and Tiramisu.  I would come back and try the other items on the menu.  Also in January 2018 there's a new Locale opening in Aurora! Excited to try that one since King City and Aurora are not too far from each other."}

{"text":"Since locale has open it continues to explode with flavour! I have been a regular since my first review.  Excellent service,our server Gary is just exceptional.  He is well informed about all details of the menu including the wines, oh and lets not forget the desserts too.   Nice portions, and delicious desserts.  The pies are a must try for pie lovers.  I tried and loved the sour cherry and apricot pie.  But the in house made creme br√ªl√©e is to die for.  Made with real vanilla bean extract  perfectly tempered,served in a wide 1 inch dish, and the perfect ratio of carmelized sugar to brullee.  A true hats of to the chef.

{"text":"Pretty busy place for Wednesday night and for good reason too!  My best friend and our mom's went for dinner. The calamari was nice, pasta was yummy, and the pizza was pretty good. We had 2 of the desserts, the one with butterscotch had the perfect combination of sweet and salty. The Italian style donuts were a bit of a dissapointment though."}
