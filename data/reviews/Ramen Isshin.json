{"text":"very good ramen, good noodle with tasty soup. side dish option is limited tho, but the fried chicken is very juicy.
service is also good, friendly staff , worth to revisit"}
{"text":"I don't enjoy ramen or soups in general, but Isshin Ramen is fantastic. 

Spicy Black Sesame Tan Tan Noodle Ramen is listed is a recommended dish for good reason. They give you a small mortar and pestle to grind your own sesame seeds...sure it takes a little work but it's fun. Overall full of good flavour, spicy but without the burn. Their dishes definitely does not have the commercial feel. Will definitely go back and try one of their other flavours. Their

Also, order the karaage fried chicken as an appetizer, it would please anyone.

Loved it!"}
{"text":"The Tan Tan noodle was dynamite. Excellent flavor, chewy noodles...although it could use a little more heat (and I asked for it extra spicy.) Both the roasted garlic and light shoyu taken were underwhelming. Broth was overpowered by the mushrooms and the egg was cold. Wouldn't recommend either, stick with the tan tan."}
{"text":"This place gets really busy.  Be ready to flag down the servers because they will have a hard time noticing you if you don't. To start,  we ordered the chicken karaage. It was freshly fried and kind of too oily,  but still good. Next,  we had the takoyaki,  which had some nice flavours. My friend didn't like it that much, and said it was too floury, but I enjoyed it. I had the kottari shoyu ramen and it was meh. The taste was too bland. My friend got the spicy veggie red miso ramen and that was packed with flavour and delicious. I'm curious to try other flavours on the menu. Side note: I appreciate that they wipe down each table with what looks like a disinfecting spray,  whereas a lot of restaurants just use a cloth."}
{"text":"So good so good so good so good!!! Did I say it's so good? This is the crack of the soup world..been here about a dozen times and liked everything but my absolute fave is the spicy red miso ramen ($13.50)...it's an addiction. Other worthwhile items are the chicken karaage don, the dumplings and the black tan tan noodles. The reason it's 4 stars not 5 is because in the past month or so, they've upped their prices and the serving sizes seem to have reduced at the same time...disappointing. But service is great so I'll still eat here...just a bit less frequently"}
{"text":"Thank you Toronto yelpers! This place was everything you raved about and more. Searching for a delicious food one freakishly humid evening in Toronto, I found this place on the Yelp app, my friends and I decided to gave it a try.

The service great, and the food was very tastey as well.

We will come back next time to try other stuff they have. Prices is quite reasonable for it`s size."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a weekend and it was super busy! Had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, and even so we beat the dinner crowd because the lineup was out the door by the time we left. The restaurant isn't very big so if you're coming as a large group, you might have to wait for awhile. 

We ordered:
- Chicken karaage: perfectly crispy on the outside, so juicy on the inside! 
- Spicy red miso: even though the soup wasn't spicy at all, the flavour was all there. Also really liked that it wasn't just a bowl of ramen with some toppings sprinkled on top - the bowl was immersed with food! 
- Black sesame tan tan noodle: the flavour in this bowl was great as well, and it came with a small bowl of black sesame seeds for you to crush and add to the ramen. It adds texture and another depth of flavour!

Overall this is one of the best ramen I've had. Service was friendly and food was delivered in good time. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"First time trying authentic style ramen and really liking it. I tried the vegetarian ramen so my expectations weren't that high, but I must say, I was impressed! The toddy was nice and the noodles soft with tasty garnishes. Like the wooden spoons! Nice touch."}
{"text":"Service was fast and nice,  food was awesome and didn't cost much. If I come back in Toronto I'll definitively come there again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great Ramen. It's my go to spot and I regularly introduce the place to my friends. If you're a ramen fan like I am, you will LOVE this place. Shoyu FTW"}
{"text":"It was ok.... Not the best. I went at 3:00pm, had a few people there. I ordered the combo with rice and ramen, rice was only ok but I guess it's not their specialty so that's why it's not that good. I had the tsukemen, the sauce was pretty good. Service was pretty good."}
{"text":"Having ramen during the winter is the best thing ever and Ramen Isshin didn't disappoint! Great service and presentation of food."}
{"text":"Was visiting Toronto, had a craving for good ramen and definitely found it here!"}
{"text":"I love the ramen here. It haunts my dreams for days afterwards. The noodles have a lovely chew. The portions seem bigger than Santouka's. The broth is rich, but not too rich, and full of deep flavour. The pork is moist and melt in your mouth fabulous. The staff is warm and friendly just like the bowl of magical ramen they serve here.

The black tan tan is my favourite - I love that addition of ground pork! but the red miso is definitely delicious as well."}
{"text":"Authentic young setting with gorgeous ramen like never before. The best was the spicy ramen. The dumplings were yummy as hell, with a unique crust that made them taste delicious! Downside? Its a small place and sometimes you might have to share the tables."}
{"text":"It is one of those typical Japanese ramen restaurants.....The noodles are rich of flavors and a little bit salty for me(I am not a fan of heavy tastes). I even got sweaty because of drinking the hot soup,  which is a good thing for cold days and they know how to cook pork well.
Busy kitchen and polite staff."}
{"text":"I had a craving for takoyaki and ramen, and wanted to try a new place out - Yelp led me to Ramen Isshin. 

I am so glad it did.

I ordered the takoyaki (I've had takoyaki at about 4 other places, this was the best of the bunch). It was topped with delicious bonito flakes, takoyaki sauce and mayo, and had a crispy outside and a nice chunk of octopus tentacle inside. 5/5.

I also ordered the Miso Ramen, which had a rich, delicious broth, a great amount of yummy noodles and veggies varying in texture, and was topped with tender pork. I'm not usually a fan of meat in general honestly, and textures can very easily turn me off. But this pork was delicious in every way. 5/5. The portion size was large for myself, and a waiter very helpfully packed it up for me to go once I filled up. He separated the broth from the meat/noodles/veggies so nothing would go soggy. Such a happy surprise! 

This leads me to another awesome thing about Ramen Isshin, their service!
Having been to and frequented other ramen spots, sometimes you have servers who don't speak much, are not fluent in English, or aren't overall very friendly. The servers here at Ramen Isshin are the definition of friendly and helpful. The greeted us happily, spoke very good English, helped my boyfriend through the menu and helped him pick a ramen he would enjoy (it was his first time having ramen), and the entire kitchen/staff thanked us heartily as we left the restaurant. The water at my table was also always filled up. It added to an awesome experience and created such a welcoming environment that I cannot wait to go back. It's now definitely my #1 ramen joint in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I checked out this place last week. The place was pretty empty when we got there. We ordered the red miso ramen and chicken karaage. We also added a few extra toppings and that's when the comedy of errors began. Here's a tip...if you don't have the best memory in the world, use a pen and a pad. When the food came, the waiter pretty much got everything wrong.  An extra portion of chasu here, a forgotten egg there, corn order was doubled up, etc.

Now regarding the food, I'll start with the chicken karaage...wait, that didn't even come. He totally forgot about it.  I'll just start with the ramen then. The broth was really good. The problem is though, I don't there's enough broth...there's tons of stuff...but not enough broth. The proportion is off. The noodles were awesome...had a great texture and was cooked perfectly.  The more I ate the ramen, the more I started to feel that this dish reminded me a lot of Kenzo's King of King ramen....it's like a better constructed, more refined King of King ramen if it was in the hands of a more skillful ramen artist. (Reminding me of Kenzo wasn't a positive thing). Anyway, I think I'll give this place another shot and order the Tonkotsu ramen to really compare it with Santouka or Sansotei. At this moment, Santouka is still number 1 for me.

When the bill came, there were more errors...I guess nobody thought to correct the bill when they messed up the order.  The ramen had a lot of potential. I'm hoping it was an off night for the servers but it was really poor performance."}
{"text":"Nice place. Good service, got my good really quickly. Got the spicy red miso. Was just spicy enough to be enjoyable. It did taste a little burnt though, don't know if this was bad luck or just normal for this place."}
{"text":"After reading so many good reviews about this Ramen shop, I thought I give it a try on my stopover in Toronto back to Germany. I lived in Japan for quite some time, so I am always eager to enjoy this lovely food again (and again and again). Unfurtunately it could not live up to my expectations created by the reviews. 

Let's start at the beginning, we ordered gyoza (dumplings) and karage (fried chicken) for starters. The gyozas were completely deep-fried (which they mention on the menu), but I rarely saw those in Japan, usually half-cooked and fried as remember. This makes them crispier which some people might prefer. Karage in Japan is usually very fluffy, this one was hard.
For ramen, we tried the Tonkotsu-Shio (salt and pork based) and Tantanmen (spicy). Both were okay, but compared to Japan it's in the average field I would say. The tonkotsu was more salt based, which makes a little bit less fatty, which I liked.

When it comes to the prices, I was quite surprised. In Germany we pay double the price (e.g. in Munich), so I would call it a good deal."}
{"text":"I'm Japanese, and I think Isshin is one of the few places in Toronto where you can find solid authentic ramen. Kotteri shoyu is my favorite. Order kaedama afterwards for extra noodles."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best in downtown. No long lineup. The food is decent. Not overpriced. Recommend."}
{"text":"I've tried different places in downtown for ramen but Isshin ramen i s the best so far because they don not hv as much MSG in the soup and doesn't make me thirsty. Also the pork is tender and soft thinly sliced. The sesame on the side can see the detail of eating ramen. The octopus ball has big piece of chewy octopus inside. Service is good and welcoming."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of Ramen places in Toronto. I think Isshin has the best Ramen in Toronto."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen. The vegetarian broth is delicious. It's a very busy place yet the service is quick. Definitely a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"I come here whenever I want tsukemen ramen. So good. I haven't tried any other bowl because I'm always going to Kinton. But for tsukemen this place does it right. Hot stone bowl of broth and perfect noodles. This place tends to get busy so come early or late night. Good for groups."}
{"text":"I tried the White Sesame Shio. I believe all their ramen has the tonkotsu broth as their foundation, and they say on the menu they cook their broth for 18 hours. I think that's what Ryoji said too...(Another ramen place in Little Italy area). Anyway, I digress. 

The special thing about this place is that any time you order anything with sesame seeds, they give you a light pestle and mortar to grind your own seeds and put into the ramen yourself. I would note though, that the sesame seeds didn't have the rich aroma and flavour I expected, so it really didn't add much to the ramen. But kudos on giving this experience to their customers.

Another special thing is, they serve menma (bamboo shoots) as a basic topping!! If you hate bamboo shoots (they can smell a bit funny), you should ask them to leave it out. When the table next to us were getting their ramen, I could smell the bamboo shoots strongly, which I don't mind, personally.

Another thing! They flavour the yolk of the egg so it's just a little sweet and more flavourful. I think they put on a bit of light brown liquid on the yolk after they cut it in half. Interesting.

One more thing, their basic shio (salt) tonkotsu broth and chashu is very \"lean\", and less saltier than other places. It's a more delicate flavour, which I loved. I am very very sure that they skim off a lot of the fat as they boil their broth, because you don't see sizable circles of fat floating in their soup, just tiny beads of it. Their chashu is about 90% meat and 10% fat, which is pretty much the leanest it can get, for chashu. And it still tastes amazing! It's tender and chewy at the same time. I think the fact that it's sliced quite thinly contributes to that.

I tried a bit of the broth of the Light Shoyu (soy sauce), and man that was good! Imagine the broth of the basic shio tonkotsu, but with the smoky fish scent, and sweet flavour of katsuobushi. I am ordering that next time. I like that the soy sauce wasn't too heavy, it was quite light in the ramen, compared to some other places.
Just a note that they also have \"Rich\" Shoyu; the only difference is that it's more oily than the Light.

Based on the Shio and Shoyu ramen I've tried, this place has a more delicate and light flavour overall than other places I'd been to, but it was still pretty rich and satisfying, so five stars for such a good balance."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen I have ever had. Great atmosphere. Great location. Super nice servers. Very quick takeout service too. A must-go if youre a fan of japanese food."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here (a couple types of ramen and the octopus balls) has been too salty.  Is this what ramen is supposed to taste like?  Decor is modern casual--a bit cold for my taste."}
{"text":"There are few things I am more excited about these days than a good bowl of spicy ramen noodles, and Ramen Isshin does not disappoint.

While the location at College and Bathurst is a little out of the way compared to other ramen shop locations, it still drove a fair bit of a line on a Friday night. Despite that, the line moved fairly quickly and it only took 10-15 min to get our table of 4 seated.

We ordered the japatine (Japanese poutine) to split as a table and I ordered the spicy ramen. Loved the chewiness and texture of the noodle and while I didn't find the broth very spicy, it was very thick and flavourful, enhanced by some freshly ground black sesame that they provide for you to grind yourself using a mortar and pestle.

While I prefer the mouth-tingling spiciness of Santouka when it comes to spicy ramen with their Kara Miso Ramen, Ramen Isshin is definitely a contender for #2."}
{"text":"Everything was great.

Cozy little place with a more authentic feel, food was amazing with little wait time. Staff was friendly. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"aside from the usual line ups, their offerings are great and delicious. 
i'm really digging their curry tsukemen! i hope they keep it on their menu as it said it was just for their anniversary! if you go during dinner time expect to wait 30-45 mins for a table! its a small place."}
{"text":"Super delish ramen! Will definitely come back! It's one of my go-to ramen places now."}
{"text":"Terrible service, waitress let 5 groups of people cut in the line in front of us because we wouldn't share a table"}
{"text":"I tried the tan tan soup ramen for the first time. The experience is worth the try. The noodles were well made and the freshly ground black sesame is a hit.

They do chop up everything in fine bits so if you don't drink the soup you get.... Only noodles and pork. If you do drink the soup just be prepared for the sodium overload.

As with every ramen place I tried chicken karage. It's not very good compared to other places like Kinton. But that's not usually what people are here for anyway."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful and this is a great meal if you are looking for a bargain, but the egg in the ramen was not cooked correctly, it should have been softer as supposed to a half of a hard boiled egg, also the broth was not great. A good ramen should have me drink the remaining broth at the end. This broth was not at this level. Again a good restaurant with great service and great prices, but the ramen is mediocre.
I had the rich miso ramen."}
{"text":"Best ramen I've tried. I arrived on a Monday afternoon so I didn't expect it to be too busy and I was right. We were kindly greeted and seated as soon as we entered the place. The cooks and waitress were extremely kind and our food came incredibly fast. I ordered the Spicy Red Miso Ramen, which was not spicy at all however still tasted delicious (I'll try the Red Dragon next time), and my friends ordered the vegetarian and white sesame shio ramen. They both agreed the food was delicious and we'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now have to say that ramen in Toronto is pretty decent these days.  Isshin has become the go to in my neighborhood.  

I've tried both the spicy red miso ramen and the roasted garlic & shallots ramen.  The spicy red miso isn't really spicy at all but the wok fried pork and vegetables are nice and different than other ramen places. I think I prefer the roasted garlic ramen though.  The taste is less busy and simpler and I really like the personal mortar and pestle that they give you for the black sesame.  Plus I like the half egg that it comes with :)  Ramen isn't ramen to me unless it comes with a half semi hard boiled egg.  

I say stick with the basic Shoyu Rammen and you won't be disappointed.  I also tried the karaage and it was pretty good but I think karaage from the other places are pretty good too.  Hard to mess up chicken nuggets, no?  Last time I went on a week night and it busier then I expected so they're doing something right."}
{"text":"We waited for a long time for our order to arrive. There was not even a lineup that day.
We ordered their black tan tan and their white shio. The soup was pretty good, however their noodles had a strong alkaline water taste too it. My friend thought it tasted like chemicals.
I didn't reply enjoy the black tan tan mainly because of the type of source they used and also that their ground pork was cold. 
I liked their white shios soup, but too bad it only came with half an egg.
We also ordered their karage, each piece was pretty big and moist. I enjoyed it but my friend thought there was too much batter.
Overall, I think it's slightly below average but maybe we just didn't order their better dishes."}
{"text":"The spicy vegetarian miso ramen is soooooo good!! I am beyond impressed with how flavourful it is!! I added an egg for $1.50 and asked for roasted garlic oil on the side it was incredible definitely will come again. Also, it gets packed so be prepared to wait. It's worth it though and they are so nice here too:)"}
{"text":"Good food at a large quantity. They have  a lot to choose from and also have a few vegetarian options. It is very clustered and small, other than that it's a nice place with beautiful art!"}
{"text":"Came for a 2nd time tonight. Sunday at 7pm. Place was busssyyyyyyy. Had to wait 50 minutes for a table. So if time is an issue call ahead. But waiting 50 minutes for ramen? Yes,  it's that good and was worth every minute! 

Got some apps which I didn't last time,  very good. Food was delicious as hell again,  and despite being so insanely busy the staff was great and super attentive."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The broth is so flavorful and the noodles are amazing! We both ordered a combo & felt like we had too much food! But the rice dishes are very good too. Highly recommend! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wanted to get the combo where you can get any ramen and add on a bowl of rice on the side. My sister and I had eaten recently so we had considered sharing the food, however the waitress told us that we \"are not allowed to share\". Everyone else at the table also ordered the combo (ramen+rice). I asked if it was stated anywhere including menu, which it was not. Someone at the table also pointed out it made no sense since anyone could've shared with anyone. The waitress wouldn't give an answer and proceeded to stay silent or only would say that we had to order (another) ramen in order to add the rice. To avoid a scene, we ended up ordering ramen without the rice. If it was restaurant policy that food cannot be shared, it should be stated. Horrible experience. However, the food was good."}
{"text":"Ramen was good we went for the vegetarian apparently it was the best in Toronto. We didn't see a major difference. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"I saw reviews on this place last month and thought I'd give it a try. And I think I've gone back about 5 times. It's soooo good. I usually get the vegetarian spicy red miso and it is delicious!  The depth of flavor in the broth goes really well with everything else they put in it.  I like that they actually tried to make vegetarian options as good as their meat options. Great place :)"}
{"text":"We are new to Ramen but had an excellent visit.  The staff were very helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"We werent super but was in the area and saw this cute little ramen place. We got there maybe about 1 hr before closing. we ordered a takoyaki and tried a Shoyu Kotteri Tsukemen which is a dipping ramen. I typically love my food pipping hot but i was skeptical about dipping noodles into a broth -  just didnt feel it would be hot enough. I was proven wrong with every pipe! The broth was rich and flavourful, the noodles were warm, perfectly cooked. what more can you ask for in a bowl of delicious ramen?"}
{"text":"When I went in, there were only few people here, so I was quickly seated. Nice service.
I ordered roasted garlic ramen with extra thick noodles.
The first spoon of the soup was surprising. You can actually feel that it was homemade. The noodle was really really chewy. Another surprising thing! I am not really like the flavor of the roasted garlic ramen, but the soup and the noodle were fantastic.
Be careful if you want an extra noodle. It is huge, super huge. I was too full to finish it."}
{"text":"Unique ramen offerings compared to your typical ramen shop! This is one of our go to place. Our usual are the black tan tan mien and spicy red miso ramen. New favourite is the Tsukemen, which is served on hot stone bowl to keep the soup piping hot!"}
{"text":"Never had ramen before, not sure how I made it this far in life without it. If all ramen is this awesome I have truly been missing out. I had the black sesame and it was a murky, brooding beast of a bowl, with silken pork belly hiding just below the surface. Delicious !"}
{"text":"MY FAVOURITE RAMEN PLACE IN THE WORLD. I cannot describe my excite when realizing that I could eat REAL ramen despite that I am vegetarian. I recommended it to my other vegetarian friends and they all loved it. I got in one of the most popular choices of the vegetarian ramen. It was absolutely delicious and even better than some that I remember from Japan. Its so rare that they're accommodating towards vegetarians. The broth is extraordinarily similar to actual ramen broth that I've had before. PLEASE VEGETARIANS TRY THE RAMEN HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"Authentic ramen, good broth, well portioned.
miso base and pork bone, each equally good.
Short cut to frying tacoyaki was a disappointment."}
{"text":"The best ramen in Toronto - by a country mile - if you have not been, go! Spicy miso is my favourite and highly recommended."}
{"text":"The only 'bad' thing about this place would be the wait time. Had to wait 20 minutes to get a seat for 2 on Friday night. But I'd recommend that you stick it out and hang around till they call your name. Flavourful broth that isn't too salty or greasy. Texture of the noodles and ratio of noodles to topping was perfect. Next time I go, I'm getting 2 extra eggs because they are just that good! And I'm positive next time will be very soon (like, I already have plans for next week)."}
{"text":"Extremely good ramen. Worth every penny spent. Will go back. Highly recommend to any ramen lover"}
{"text":"Came here on early Thursday around 5ish 6 and lucky there was no wait at all :D

Got sit to the long table facing the wall since I was by myself :P  

I order the Isshin Red Miso Ramen with Chicken Karaage... and a half pint Asahi. :P  

Food: the Cha shu or pork on the ramen was really good :P taste good so as the distribution of the fat/meat.  The texture of the noodle was perfect as well.  However, I found my broth was on a lighter side...  Chicken Karaage was not too oily as I can see my paper did not had much oil on it :P  they give you kupe mayo to go with which was very tasty.  The whole meal with perfect with the Asahi :P  

Service: Very friendly.  However, they seem to have trouble understanding English at time. 

Price: a little pricey if you are student since each bowl cause you at least $10+   I paid around $27.5 with everything including tips... I think... 

Overall: nice decent place~!  Very clean and they actually offer mouth wash if you need one.  I will definitely come back again to try the other ramen and dessert.  However, you would need to pay extra to customize the type of noodle (thick/thin) you want for your ramen bowl and need to pay extra for noodle add on."}
{"text":"Great' Real Japanese ramen!!!
I love Miso ramen here. Their ramen reminds me of the ramen I ate in Japan.
They did great job!!!"}
{"text":"The spicy ramen with ground pork and black sesame seeds was so good that I wanted to cry. CRY. 

I was pleasently surprised that such a small and understated place could be so delicious. The prices are really fair, especially if you ge the ramen + rice bowl \"combo\""}
{"text":"We went here on a cold winter evening, the waiting time was around 30 minutes and the waiters seemed a little bit disorganized but when we finally got our seat, the waitress apologized for the long wait and everything else from then on was awesome. We tried the vegetarian spicy miso ramen and it was delicious and so filling. Quantity is really good and the taste is amazing, the correct amount of spice and Taste. When I saw the picture of oil on the spicy ramen I was a bit worried but it does not taste it feel oily at all. I also tried the marinated egg and it was yummy, it was a little sweet but super delicious. We got some food back coz we weren't able to finish and the waitress separated the noodles and broth which kept the noodles great to eat the next day too. On the whole very very nice place to go on a cold winter evening."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and the best vegetarian ramen I have ever had! My partner had the kottri and I let him try a spoonful of mine and his face lit up - he thought mine was more tasty! Will definitely be coming back! One teensy thing is that I wish the noodles were firmer/springier (like the momofuku ones mmmm)"}
{"text":"This was my first ramen experience, and it did not disappoint. Took myself out for a birthday lunch on a Wednesday, and it was pretty great. Service was fast and attentive. Ate the Age Tofu (excellent app), and the Dragon Ramen (I may not have the name quite right - spicy red miso) that was fantastically spicy and delicious. I would go back in a minute."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
??????????????????????????????????????????
????????????????????????????????????????????????????
??????????"}
{"text":"I have to say I was really disappointed. The food was delicious but the service was the worst. There were 8 other people in the restaurant ((10 including me and my partner). There were 6 or 7 staff working in total. We ordered 1 ramen and 1 lunch special. The waitress mixed up every part of our order, we had her read it back so we could ensure it was correct. 
Then when our food actually came there was a wrong item.
We pointed this out to the staff and they took our item off our table and gave it to another table. This was followed by them taking the item off that table. Giving it to the waitress and having it placed on our table. The portion of this item was substantially smaller and had been on the other table for several minutes.

We intended on getting Mochi Icecream for dessert however we were presented with the bill the second our plates were taken away. We had not been rude customers in anyway, we just wanted the food we ordered.

At the end of it we still tipped despite another issue from their debit machine not connecting to the internet.

The ramen is good, but for the extra cost and little to no customer service?  1 star, 0 if I could."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why everyone has rated this place so high! 
It does not live up to the hype. 
We ordered the veggie spicy miso, the dip noodles, red dragon and the octopus balls.
The octopus balls had 1 small piece of octopus in each portion and that was true for all 5 pieces.
The pork in the soup was suuuuuper thinly sliced. As well, the flavours of the soup was muddled. It was MEH at best.
To clarify for others- service was NOT fast (it was about 15 minutes from the time we ordered until we recieved our octopus and another 22 mins on top of that until we recieved our ramen) 
The marinated egg tasted plain and over cooked. The veggie miso tasted like expensive mr noodle. 
Overall this place must have a great profit margin because for 3 ramens and 1 octopus order we spent $60. 
People, lets not hype a restaurant up for hype sake!!!!"}
{"text":"Their red miso ramen is amazing. Nice place to chat with friends, too. People there are friendly. Isshin is a really nice place."}
{"text":"Soup base was delicious. I could come here everyday. He atmosphere has a great feel to it. Friendly service as well."}
{"text":"Found out about this restaurant from The Globe and Mail. We had the miso soup ramen. This is probably one of the best ramen I had for a while. The broth is rich but not overly greasy, with a lot of nice spices. The noodles is nice springy with great texture. The chicken karaage appetizer is a must!"}
{"text":"Another new ramen place opened up in Toronto, this time in the Kensington Market area. We picked to go on a snowy / rainy day hoping that the other people will be too lazy to go out so there will be less people. We got there around 7pm on a weeknight and we go a seat right away. There were people already dining away and as it got later, more people came. The menu had a lot of new different soup base that is unique.

After reading through the menu, I decided to try the Isshin spicy black tan-tan ramen - thick wavy noodle in miso broth with wok fried ground pork, black sesame, pork belly cha-shu and chilli oil. What is unique is that they give you a mortar of black sesame and a pestle for you to grind your own sesame to add to the noodles. That part was fun, you can smell the fresh sesame. The noodles was chewy, the broth was amazing, miso with black sesame, it wasn't too spicy but you can add more chilly oil if you prefer more kick to it. It was too bad that it didn't come with a soft boiled egg, have to add it for extra $$. I will definitely return to try another bowl."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a rainy Saturday.  

Between the three of us we ordered the gyoza, chicken karaage, and three types of Ramen really hit the spot."}
{"text":"This is my favourite spot for vegan Ramen. It's hard to find 'regular' restaurants that put as much effort and thought into vegan/vegetarian fare as they do into meat dishes. Ramen Isshin is certainly one of those rare places in Toronto. 

Their Spicy Vegetarian Red Miso Ramen is to die for. It's a perfect blend of textures, colours and delicious flavours. I also like their Red Miso Meat Mince Dipping Sauce with cucumbers. It's a great, vegan appetizer.

While I've been to this place a few times, what keeps me coming back is their amazing food and growing vegan/vegetarian menu that is getting better and better. 

Their servers are quick and attentive. I order from the \"vegetarian\" menu and they always confirm if I'm ok with egg noodles. For a fully vegan option they offer rice noodles that have almost identical colour and texture to egg noodles. 

This place is an amazing addition to the growing number of \"veg friendly\" places in the city. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Gone are the days when one can get a good lunch for under $10, so lunch under $15 is always good in my books.  Ramen Isshin hits the spot with their lunch special of $11.75.  Choice of ramen, side dish and a drink.

I ordered the Garlic Shoyu Ramen - Isshin roast garlic oil, bamboo shoots, nori, marinated soft boiled egg, pork belly cha shu, green onions and thin wavy noodles.  The broth was flavourful and not too garlicky, so I managed to finish most of it without dying of thirst.  The pork belly was tender and tasty, plus all the ingredients complemented the ramen dish, plus the noodles were thin and cooked al dente.

For the side, I ordered the Takoyaki - deep fried battered octopus formed into balls topped with bonito flakes, takoyaki sauce & kupe mayo.  It was cooked nicely, crispy on the outside and soft inside which bursted with flavours and so delicious that I almost ordered another side because it was that good.

For the drink, I ordered the green tea which to my disappointment was a tea bag in a cup. I was expecting loose tea leaves or perhaps a pot of tea.  I would have prefered they just poured me a cup so I didn't have to see the tea bag.  It wasn't a good impression for me since I prefer loose tea leaves and thought that was what was being served.  Not a big deal, but I just find loose tea leaves taste a lot better and makes for a better presentation.

Service was welcoming and friendly, plus quite attentive as my glass of water and tea was never empty.  

Decent size restaurant with Asian inspired decorations and decor which made it seemed authentic.  Plus always nice to hear the servers greet customers in Japanese as they enter and leave.

Looking forward to my next visit so I can try the other ramens and the kobachi (small dishes)."}
{"text":"I only had the veggie ramen which is delicious! I also loved the short wait and the prompt service"}
{"text":"The best ramen soup we've had in a long time, this is the real 'shit'! Lol Seriously the giozas were excellent, so was the spicy miso ramen soup. The place was full and all the staff took the time to salute us at our departure... It was a really familliar goodbye ! We reccomend."}
{"text":"Just checked in tonight for a quick bite and was left quite satisfied. The noodles were very different - more gelatinous. The flavors were great for the Isshan Miso ramen and their Takoyaki were the best that I've had. But what pushed it to 4 stars was the service. Rarely have I seen this level of warmth from a ramen place but truly a great experience."}
{"text":"Hidden gem, the ramen here is the best I've had so far. So glad my friends took me here to try.  We went at 6pm and luckily the wait was not too long.  It's a small place with mostly tables of 4.  If you're a table of 2 and the next available table seats 4, they still seat you there so be prepared to wait at peak meal times.  Also, great value for the portions that you get.  

Food: 
We ordered the special salad, okonomiyaki and karage don to share and I had the Tsukemen.  The dressing for the salad was very refreshing.  If you don't like veggies, you'll still like this salad.  The okonomiyaki was also well done.  The karage don was ordered as an add-on to the noodles meal for just $3.90.  The Tsukemen is a dipping noodle which was really really good.  The noodles were perfect texture and portion size came with 2 pieces of meat, egg, seaweed and veggies.  Broth was accompanied in a hot stone bowl that stayed hot until I finished.  If you were still not full after 1 portion, you have the option to add another huge plate of noodles for just $2.80.  Great value, you will for sure leave satisfied and full.  My friends also had the black sesame tan tan noodles.  They were very impressed with it.  I can't wait to come back to try more noodles.  

Service:
Good service, food was served fast and together at the same time.  Although a small place, turnover is pretty quick as most people do not linger after their meal."}
{"text":"Please make reservations if you go to this place. You will need to wait 40-50 mins for a table during the weekends when they're busy at night. The wait was worth it! The miso ramen had a good broth and the noodles were soft. I would definitely go back to visit again."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the Tsukemen ramen as well as the black sesame ramen. Be forewarned that the broth for the Tsukemen is VERY HOT and will leave you very full! However, the dish was not what I had imagined it would be. The noodles were cold (which is fine because it's to be dipped in the broth) but tasteless on their own. The broth was particularly salty but lacked depth. I didn't feel as satisfied with this dish as I would have if I ordered a soup ramen instead. It's also pricier than the other options.

Comparing the Tsukemen with the black sesame ramen I would have to say I would reorder the latter. It had a lot of sesame flavour but you could still taste the rich original pork broth underneath it all. They give you a pestle to grind extra black sesame to throw on top of your soup which is nice. Gimmicky but nice."}
{"text":"For what you pay for I'd definitely opt out for this place. Portion is so small I finished mine in about 7 mins which usually takes me 20 minutes at any other ramen place. The broth was a little too heavy and it made it feel cheap and difficult to eat with the plastic take out bowl and mini plastic spoon. I'm not sure why the prices here are a little more than their actual location. On top of that, the debit/credit option has a tipping option? It's not a sit down restaurant, it's a food hall."}
{"text":"Ordered the black tan tan ramen with chicken karaage don as a side 
Definitely a hit for this cold weather we're having.
The added black sesame afterwards really boosted the flavor and made for a pleasant meal overall"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and will definitely come back to try their other ramen.

Food: The Isshin Red Miso Ramen did not blow me away in flavour. The noodles were chewy and broth was hearty and steamy. I also tried the seafood okonomiyaki which I enjoyed the most and would come back for.

Service & atmosphere: On a Saturday afternoon, you can get a table for four but overtime the restaurant can get packed. It is a nice spot to eat on your own too.

Price: Aligns with other ramen establishments in the city."}
{"text":"Great service, great quality. Had the Vegetable Spicy Miso Ramen it was absolutely delicious and filling.

Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Ramen Isshin has one of the best ramens I've had in Toronto! I think they are as good as the ones I had in Osaka ;) 

We walked in Isshin for a late Sunday dinner and were surprised they were still plenty of people near closing time. We had the white sesame shio ramen and black sesame tan tan noodle, both are very delicious. The soup base is flavourful, and I particular like the texture of the ramen. The noodle is made perfectly! I would definitely come back to try other ramens on the menu. 

This place is rather hot on a warm summer night, it would be nice if they have better temperature control. However, the ramen was so delightful that I would definitely come back even I was eating with sweat coming out of my face haha."}
{"text":"Had to come back for seconds, this time around had the spicy red miso and I LOVED it. Not in your face spicy like other places, but a very pleasant 'punchy' taste to it. Waitress was very nice and remembered our faces, she gave us a free crispy chicken appetizer. Gave me a smile on my rather boring day."}
{"text":"great place but were missing pork in my ramen take-out order.  would love to come back here again.  will dine in next time though."}
{"text":"Tonight I have been there around 6:00, no line up, should be dinner time not started yet, customers are less. I ordered their most popular Red Miso Ramen and a bowl of Karage chicken rice.
The rice is not recommended since it is so dry, karage chicken is crispy but not juicy enough, since the chicken & rice didn't come with any source, only green onion and mayonnaise is not help, so i finished the large cup of cold water quick, but there are at least 4 servers+ 2 chefs but no one figured out my need until I raised up hand asking for water refill.
Miso ramen is nice so far, the noodle itself taste good enough, topping is full including fried pork, onions, bean sprouts, carrots, wood ear mushrooms, chives green onions, pork belly chasiu. And seemed they have fried those vegee before put onto the noodle rather than just warm it, so the taste is more stronger and delicious. But the soup is disappointed me as I tried, felt like finished instant noodle, and quite thirsty for an hour. Soup layers are simple but just taste strong, since I found that they have only a small pot onto stove during business hour, I am guessing they are just like Ajisen, using instant soup packets rather than cooked it by themselves like Kyouka/ Hokkaido.
Overall experience is not that bad, also want to try other products there, I will be back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening around 6:15 and got a seat for two right away. I got roasted garlic ramen. Broth was light yet flavorful, not too salty and just the right amount of garlic. I liked the Japatine (Japanese poutine, $5.20, as at 23-Jan-2014). The taste of nori in the japatine lingers in my mouth for a good 24 hours, or maybe I'm just imagining it. Service was very kind and timely. Even though there were lots of people waiting for a table, they didn't rush us to leave."}
{"text":"I have had Ramen Isshin's main restaurant bookmarked for the longest time, and now that they've opened up right next to my workplace there's really zero excuse to not try them out anymore. The ramen is absolutely as heavenly as everyone else says (see other reviews on the other location for much better descriptions of the taste)! The broth is rich and smooth, the noodles just the right amount of chewiness and texture, the soft boiled egg to die for, and the flavour is exquisitely delicious.

Appetizers were average, but then that's really not the main point...service was very nice and friendly, given that this is a food hall downtown we're talking about. 

Portions are definitely reasonable, although certainly not cheap. Urgh. Time to rethink my budget to account for weekly ramen splurges."}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing people, amazing ramen!!!! Best I've had in Toronto and I love me some Ramen!"}
{"text":"I have been on this quest to find the best Ramen in the city and I finally found it at Ramen Isshin.

Japanese owned and operated - Ramen Isshin brings the authentic Ramen experience to Toronto.  Their broths are flavourful and noodles the perfect Ramen texture.  This place was given two thumbs up by my SO's Japanese mom.  She was raving about their Ramen for days.

Ramen Isshin gives both meat eaters and vegetarians Ramen soup options.  I am a big fan of the Red Miso vegetarian Ramen.

You can ask for extra noodles for $1.50 if you have extra broth/soup left over!  How awesome is that.

I am planning my next visit to Ramen Isshin soon and I hope you do too!"}
{"text":"Truly the best ramen I've had in the city! Got the Red Dragon and it was delicious. Hot, spicy and so very good! Service was fast and friendly. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great fast service. Best ramen ever. No watery broth here, the broth is really rich. I've tried 3 different kinds, all fantastic but garlic shoyu is the favourite"}
{"text":"I have come a few times during peak hours, both times have had to wait, nothing too crazy, something to expect from new blooming business like this.

The first time I went, I had their black sesame tan tan noodles, which came with a side of sesame that you can crush on your own for added flavour, a pretty cool little gimmick. The broth isn't very spicy, yet well balanced. It wasn't overly salty, the cha siu was very tender, and thinly sliced, almost melts in your mouth. 

The second time I went, I had the spicy red miso ramen, once again, it wasn't overly spicy, a little more than the black sesame noodles, but nothing crazy. 

My overall experience at this restaurant has been pretty good, the only downfall is the wait time during weekends and evenings, atmosphere is very cozy, you can see them prepare the noodles as you wait, all servers are kind and are always smiling!


@eatingwithv"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I was surprised to find a comparatively \"large\" vege-friendly selection, four options to be exact. There's a Shio, Shoyu and two Miso options, a regular and a spicy. 

Went with the Shoyu for my first visit and though it was personally a tad too salty, the broth had a deep richness and the noodles were perfection. By which I mean the noodles tasted fresh and we're cooked just right so that they retained a certain \"bounce\" or chewiness-----delish! 

Will definitely be back and will be recommending it to friends."}
{"text":"I would have given this guys a better score because almost everything was perfect - service, presentation, etc. But I got the white sesame shio ramen and it was just so salty, it was almost inedible. The saltiness overwhelmed all the other flavours of the broth. And if you are serious about ramen, you know the broth makes or breaks the meal. Not sure if I just came on an off day in the kitchen or something. But yeah, I couldn't drink it at all. I'm still downing water as I write this because I'm still parched from that meal. Everything else was great though - they were busy which was a good sign, and yet we didn't have to wait more than ten min for a table. While we were waiting, we both got to sample the sake they were promoting for free. Servers were attentive and the ingredients were fresh. But I love my ramen broth and I couldn't love theirs. :("}
{"text":"10/10 ramen places in toronto- came back 3 times had super good exp, will be back for more!   The ramen feels handmade if not its must be fresh and chewy. The soup base is thick, boiled with the meat. Portion enough, price worth 15-17 cad with combo rice don~

The combo with Karage don...i just want to eat 10 of those xD nicely fried and tastey with mayo / seaweed. 

They put a heart making them- Service friendly, also 10/10."}
{"text":"Came here for Ramen and it was to die for! Had to wait about 15 minutes although the waitresses were very nice in giving us menus to look at and told us how much longer it would take. Had the fried tofu - I did not realize this was battered and then fried - had to return it due to gluten intolerance - they comp'd me which was nice. Overall, it was delicious and I ate every drop of my ramen with rice (gluten and egg free) noodles!!"}
{"text":"My partner couldn't stop commenting about how he'd never seen ramen toppings being wok-fried before placed atop the noodles.  \"Wok-fried!? Who does that?! So un-Japanese! Y u do dis?!\"

His judgey-ness aside, I must concede that I'm not sure how I feel about it either.  

We had the Spicy Miso and the Garlic Shoyu, both of which seemed heavier on the salt than most other ramen places.  The noodles were alright, but I think I prefer them with a bit more al-dente bite.  I'd say it's just all-around mediocre.

We came by around ~3pm for a post-brunch meal (cause we're winners like that) and almost all the tables were full.  It's a popular spot, but just not quite for me.

Tip: If you hate stuffy air like I do, avoid this place on warm days, I was sitting pretty close to the door and it still lacked air circulation.  Coupled with the warm ramen, it made it feel even stuffier!"}
{"text":"Not busy around 11:45 on a weekday morning. Starting to fill up as we finished around 12:15.
Tried their summer special soy milk miso ramen (vegetarian) with the option to add the egg and cha su. The broth was kept cold with a special ice cube and very flavourful. Noodles had good chew to them and is balanced well with cucumber slices, spring onion and black fungus. A good change from the regular menu!"}
{"text":"Awesome ramen place - reminded me of Japan.  Quality is up there with Santouka.  I enjoyed my shoyu ramen (light) but I think Shio is also very good.  Those are more traditional flavours.  My husband had the tan tan - he really liked it too.  The service was very good (also reminded me of Japan).  Definitely a place I would come back to."}
{"text":"One of the BEST ramen places in town!  I'm a very critical ramen consumer - and Ramen Isshin is an absolute gem!  Very friendly service (think Guu - they all holler at you when you arrive and leave to thank you), amazing delicious ramen and quaint little space!!!  My fave is the garlic ramen!  They also have tons of options for vegetarians!!!

I always bring friends here - and I def recommend this to anyone with a ramen craving in Toronto!!"}
{"text":"This place was so good I forgot to take photos.
Broth is flavorful and noodles are perfectly chewy.

Oh yeah, they offer a $5 Asahi stout"}
{"text":"Best Ramen I've had in the city.  This is true comfort food that you crave in cold weather. I don't eat pork and am always on the look out for non-pork broth Ramen.  They have vegetarian Ramen that does not cop out on flavour.  Isshin makes a point to let the customer know that it is important for them to ensure that the vegetarian options are like the real thing.  I had the Vegetarin Red Miso Ramen.  The broth was velvety and thick with just the right amount of spiciness and was not overly salty.  Can't wait to make more trips here before the winter ends! ; )"}
{"text":"I LOVED THE NOODLES!!! Great flavour, great amount of options, and now one of my favourite ramen restaurants in Toronto. I highly recommend trying the Shoyu Tsukemen (aka. Dipping ramen), the broth is a mix of seafood and pork broth and comes in a steaming pot accompanied by a large plate of fresh noodles, green onions, mushrooms and pork slices. An amazing meal to warm up with... especially in -20 degree weather like today! Definitely try and beat the line by going before noon on weekends!"}
{"text":"Two things that I really disliked: 
1) Soup is very oily! I had their signature dish and I usually enoy tasting the hot soup before I indulge in my noodles but it the oiliest soup!
2) All ramen places give you one entire egg if it comes with your dish, but this place only gives you half an egg. Really??  But why cheap out? 

Two things that I liked:
1) The soup came hot hot hot. Nothing is worse than a lukewarm soup, especially on a cold day in Toronto!
2) Soup base was delicious and had lots of flavour! Just too oily."}
{"text":"This place is located inside Chef's Assembly Hall and so it's surrounded by multiple other options. However, I urge you to try their ramen. It's made in front of you and their black sesame broth is amazing!

The portions are huge and filling, and the service is fast and good. We also really enjoyed their special lime ginger drink.

I'll definitely be back when in the mood for more ramen (which is almost almost always)"}
{"text":"I like their food but I've been turned away twice late at night but still within their posted operating hours. The staff is lazy and closes early so they can go home. I'll never go back because of this. It's not like there aren't other cleaner and more professionally operated ramen shops in this city."}
{"text":"Spicy miso ramen was on point! 

Service was friendly and fast. This is not the place to romance your date coz unless you're in college. But the ramen is as good as any we've had, and they seem to have instagrammable dishes. What is not to like....something for everyone!

Repeat: Hell Yea!"}
{"text":"I've never been exceptionally picky when it came to ramen, but I do like great tasting soup, and I love the red miso soup here!  

Came here at around 8;30PM and found the place to be half empty - which is actually pleasant since a lot of the hyped up ramen places have a huge line up.  The waitress constantly refilled our water, which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Delicious ramen but I don't like how prices are much more expensive at this location compared to the college location. Menu also seems to be a hit and miss. I didn't like the roasted garlic shoyu ramen but the white sesame shio ramen was delicious. Broth is also a bit on the saltier side."}
{"text":"Ramen Isshin is one of my top 3 ramen places In Toronto. I have tried almost all of their ramen dishes. The ramen noodles have just enough bounce /chewiness and the soups are very flavourful. You can also request less salt. With some of the soups, you even get to crush sesame seeds to put as a topping on your ramen. Great place."}
{"text":"It was good but not better than the sansoteis, santoukas, etc.. they are pretty much level. I tried the tantan ramen as per their recommendation and my wife had the garlic shoyu ramen. I love garlic so I found the garlic ramen better than my order. There is a touhenboku in Richmond Hill and the garlic tonkotsu there gives me the same satisfaction."}
{"text":"I heard this was the only ramen place in Toronto that serves Tsukemen so obviously I'd had to come by and see what the fuss was about - well he had to see. We heard many things about this place and came in with high hopes. 

We ordered the seafood okonomiyaki and he ordered the Tsukemen which he really enjoyed and I got the Spicy Red Miso Ramen. I did not enjoy the Spicy Red Miso Ramen.. I mean yes, it's ramen it's decent but I can get ramen any where. I didn't taste the TLC that went into the soup base or lack of. We did enjoy the seafood okonomiyaki though! Maybe I ordered the wrong ramen but I'm willing to give this place another go in the future."}
{"text":"Fantastic Ramen! 
Place is small but the wait is worth. I'll definitely come back to try more types."}
{"text":"It's hard to get ramen as a vegetarian, but I was able to get the Veggie Shoyu Ramen here. However since I am a picky eater as well, I didn't want mushrooms, and they weren't able to substitute them with anything else, so I just added corn instead, which was an added charge. 

The dish itself was tasty though. Not the best vegetarian ramen I ever had, but it is up there. I would give this a 3.5 stars for the taste, but I enjoyed it enough to not just give it a 3-star rating. The shoyu ramen is soy based, which I wanted to get based on my other experiences with vegetarian ramen. The noodles had the right chew, and the broth had a good flavor as well. Nothing too unique from ramen in general, you just have to try it. 

The atmosphere was lively and fun. The waiters really enjoyed their work and making sure the food was up to standards, and enjoyed playing with the customers with celebratory sake shots and chants. 

I totally see why there is a line for this place as it is one of the better ramen places in the area. If you are in the mood for ramen and have time to spare for the wait, this is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"There have only been two times I have ever lined and waited for food for longer than 30 minutes. With 10 minutes usually being my breaking point. For some reason both these times have been for Ramen joints and both times it has not been worth the wait.

I think i was nearly waiting an hour, on a Sunday evening! so yeah this place gets slammed. 

Me and my friends when we did get a table were quickly served, you can sense from the staff they want to turnover the table quick but it was not much of a bother.

I ordered the Spicy Pork Ramen. It took a little longer than my friends dishes to come, not sure why there was no eggs which i usually expect and the pork was not as fatty/tasty as other places I have had the similar dish. The broth was not too salty or oily which was a bonus but definitely not blown away by it."}
{"text":"Had Ramen with red miso and it was oishii!!! Noodles was perfect texture was amazing, crunchy and right firmness! Brith was creamy and full of taste. I also had the takoyaki, it was good but i think Kenzo's takoyaki is fluffier and creamier (own preferrence). Service was amazing and great! Ambience is good with the rustic twist on it. Worth it to visit!!!"}
{"text":"This place just isn't anything special nor even good.  The broth had no flavor, the spicy miso ramen wasn't even mildly spicy.  The Rice Don chicken as an add on was actually good, crunchy with taste.   Looks like a god place to drink in the area but I would definitely venture elsewhere if u want good ramen."}
{"text":"A great option for Ramen in the city. Definitely recommend you pay these find folks a visit."}
{"text":"Impressive selection of vegetarian ramen. It all starts out so very very well and delicious. But it is also SUPER salty and like all very salty foods you get to the point of enough is enough. I couldn't finish it and it wasn't for lack of appetite. Still delicious though. All this said they do have the best fried tofu I have ever had. You should order this."}
{"text":"The ramen soup was rich in flavour, but not something that catches me off guard. I also got the chicken karaage and for the portion and quality, it was definitely overpriced. 

Overall, decent ramen but not exactly great, especially for the price."}
{"text":"Wow!  How did we not know about this ramen earlier?  Definitely a stand out ramen.  We came around 1 on a Sunday and had to wait a bit.  We started with karate and it had great flavor and juiciness.  I had the ramen with the dipping soup.  I loved it!  The noodles had a great chewy texture and the egg was great.  The meat and wood fungus was also great.  I loved the concept of dipping the noodles in the soup.  My husband had the red dragon with extra noodles.  He usually likes extra noodles because other places are skimpy but here he didn't need it.  It had a great flavor and texture to the noodles.  He said it wasn't that spicy.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"After two trips to Ramen Isshin I can confirm it's the best ramen I've had in Toronto. Having said that, I'm no ramen expert... But this is a heartwarming bowl of soup. 

The noodles have a great feel and a delicious chew to them. The vegan kale noodles were every bit as scrumptious as the normal egg noodles, as well! I honestly think I preferred the vegan variety. 
It may have been that when I had the kale noodles they were in the veggie miso broth which I thought was a bit more flavourful and tasty when compared to the shoyu ramen I had with the normal noodles. 

I'm absolutely a fan and will no doubt be a return customer multiple times over. 
Arigatou gozaimas!"}
{"text":"Fun and busy atmosphere with friendly staff.  We went with our kids and they has a great time. The tonkotsu ramen had depth without overly salty and the special cold ramen was very refreshing."}
{"text":"Ordered the spicy vegetarian ramen, delicious! Small space but the wait wasn't bad. Even offered us a drink while waiting. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I had the spicy miso ramen, I liked it but I've had better. The place was pretty packed for a Sunday evening. The soup itself wasn't very spicy. Service was good and hospitable."}
{"text":"Today's review is not indicative of my previous visits to Ramen Isshin.  I have loved it...the food has been great and so has the service. Today was a whole different story.  I have food allergies and ramen places are not usually restos that I go to...but after much research and many conversations I was told what I could eat without issues.  I am there almost every week. First I'm told that the dish I've always eaten contains allergens.  I'm very appreciative of the fact when it's pointed out to me however if I'm saying that I have had this dish multiple times and recently...then you need to drop it.  I'm capable of making decisions as to what I'm comfortable eating and where. While I understand that the restaurant is protecting themselves they're alienating a regular. I'm not looking for a lawsuit...I'm looking for a nice quiet dinner with my friends and all this back and forth and arguing is just putting a damper on the evening.  To top it off, we had to to ask a few times for the beer that was initially ordered...the bill was dropped on the table before we were asked if we wanted dessert and then one of the dessert orders forgotten. I get it...there's a line-up however I didn't come for dinner with a timer attached.  I think an hour and a half is quite reasonable when you've ordered appetizers, a main and dessert...and part of that time is spent waiting and repeatedly asking for what you've ordered."}
{"text":"After some lab work at Toronto Western I needed something nice as it was starting to rain, so in a popped and have to say LOVED IT.  When I entered I was the only client but that quickly changed.  I am not knowledgeable about Japanese food but my server was wonderful in going over things. Even after y order she came by and asked if all was okay and showed me how and what with each dish.  She is an A+ for me.  The food was very good and the bathrooms spotless.  Loved it and hope to go back soon"}
{"text":"Overall pretty satisfying meal. 4.5 stars in total. 

Went there on a weekday around 5pm. There was pretty much only 2 tables seated. I went there by myself, so the waitress led me to the chairs facing the wall. No problem with that. 

I ordered the Black Sesame Tan Tan Noodle. The taste was great, not too salty or tasteless. I give it 4 stars. I really think that Isshin tastes better than Sansotei. My only oppinions are that there was no eggs (I hope it had some, instead of ordering them on the side), it only had two thin pork bellies, the wok fried pork was served COLD in my ramen, and the noodles were far less than enough. 

Since I didn't feel full, I ordered a mango pudding, which is the BEST I have ever had so far. It was really small in portion but the taste is fantastic. There were either jellies or mango cubes inside the pudding, and it was nothing like those mango puddings you get at Cantonese Dim sum places. There was a mint leaf as decoration, a frozen grape cut in half and some whip cream. You honestly have to try the pudding if you're not satisfied with the ramen. Its a freakin' 5 stars dessert."}
{"text":"-The short version- 
A favourite Ramen place! Both the sake and the ramen were delicious! 

-The long version-
It's a small space and busy during lunch. We came in on a Friday at 11:30 AM and luckily, we managed to grab a 4 person table before the noon rush.

I ordered a Tako Yaki to start, followed by Vegetarian Shoyu Ramen. Both were really great (and filling)! It was lots of fun to order the special sake shot, so much energy and cheers from staff! It's a clever sales tactic too, after we ordered one, 3 other tables ordered a round too! It was fun to watch!"}
{"text":"Worth to wait.
Their menu has need revised since my last visit, more choices & combination now. I like their soup base, rich but not too salty, it was so delicious! The noodle portion is just right, especially for ladies. This is one of the precious places in downtown, I can't help keep coming back ^[]^"}
{"text":"By far my favourite ramen place in Toronto! Be prepared to wait 30-60 minutes, so don't show up starving."}
{"text":"Been here once and already my fave ramen place in the 6ix.  I was never too fond of the other ramen place here until I came to ramen Isshin. This is a cozy little place with super friendly staff.   Ramen Isshin feels and looks authentic and by far the best soup broth in the city hands down.  I will def be back for more."}
{"text":"Still a huge fan of this place and think it is the best in downtown Toronto.
Amazing price for the quality, amount of tippings and size, and nice lunch set meal at a great deal...that is, if you do not come in a group. A bit peeved because their group gratuity is a bit steep at 18% (really 20% because it's off of price with tax, and the server solely took our orders and gave us our food) and they will only split the bill max 2 ways. 

Anyways let's concentrate on the food, which is very good and definitely worth your visit! 
They have a lunch set meal Monday-Thurs (11:30-4:00) for $12.75 meat options or $12.90 veggie options, which includes a choice of 4 ramens, plus a side dish and pop/tea. I ordered the 1) Garlic Shoyu Ramen, 2) Deep fried pork gyoza and 3) Coca Cola. 
Their ramen noodles are cooked perfectly and unlike many shops in Toronto, their soup base is perfectly seasoned and not overly salted! It also comes with a lot of toppings which you would have to pay $2 for each at other place, but here it's part of the bowl: bamboo, green onion, nori, half a soft-boiled egg. Gyoza were nicely fried, not super porky in flavour and average. 

If I lived closer, I would come here more often to get my ramen fix because it is so delicious and a good price!"}
{"text":"I can't say it's the best, but I believe my Yelp friends it's one of the tops for ramen. You can feel the buzz of this narrow College Street restaurant sandwiched along the strip going east of Sneaky Dee's. We arrived before the rush and only had to wait a few minutes, but on a Saturday night expect a lineup and I don't know how they deal with it.
The ramen was so much fun to slurp, just like on the videos, meanwhile trying to keep with the 8 to 10 minutes you officially have to effectively consume them all, lots of fun!
The fried chicken appetizer, served with lemon was crunchy and good. We also had a bowl of edamame, warm and chewy. 
The spice level on my spicy miso was perfect for me and there are two levels stronger, wow!
The sliced meat on top was so delicious, and along with the medley of textures and flavours beneath, I enjoyed every drop, (almost). 
The desserts are compulsory. We had a mango pudding, along with black sesame and matcha ice cream. And the Japanese Asahi dry beer on tap is great! If I had known how delicious this beer is, especially while eating ramen, I would have ordered a pitcher instead of a pint.
That said, respect your neighbours, get in and get out!"}
{"text":"This place is just amazing ! We started with the fried octopus. For the mains, I had the spicy tan tan ramen. It comes with black sesame seeds on the side for you to grind with a pestle and add to your ramen if you like. Very rich taste. Goes down really well. My wife had the spicy veggie miso ramen. She also enjoyed it thoroughly. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Ramen is a staple for me during the winter, so naturally I had to add Ramen Isshin to my list.

I'm a Shio ramen kind of gal, but when I flipped open their menu and saw their Spicy Red Miso Ramen... My loyalty faltered and I knew exactly what I needed to get in order to warm me up from the winter blues.

The noodles here are pretty good, nice and chewy. Definitely could be spicier, but they happily provide you with more chili oil if you need. I was intimidated of the Red Dragon Ramen at first (looked hella spicy), but the Spicy Red Miso was mild enough to make me curious about whether the Red Dragon was even bad at all.

I know a bowl of ramen has me hooked if it makes me want to pour the remaining broth into a cup and drink it ('cause I'm so classy, right?) - but Ramen Isshin's broth didn't really blow my mind.

We also got the fried chicken to start, which was nothing crazy special in my opinion. Guu's Karaage will still forever be #1 in my books.

Will I come back? Yea, for sure. Noodles are still up to par and the line-ups don't seem as bad compared to the other ramen places in Toronto. Plus, I'd like to challenge that Red Dragon next time! And the Tsukumen. I hear that's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"My friend got the Shoyu Ramen and I got the Shio Ramen, and they tasted delicious. Honestly the best ramen we've had to this day. We asked for extra bean sprouts and they just hooked us up with a huge bowl of them blesssss.  The staff were really nice and energetic, and though it was busy they served us well. This place was great 10/10 would go again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite ramen places in downtown. Really liked their Spicy Black Tan-Tan Ramen.
The noodles were aldente and thick. The broth was flavourful. The pork can be better - I found it a bit tough.

What I really loved is that this ramen comes with fresh black sesame that you personally grind using mortar and pestle."}
{"text":"Came here for my first Toronto Ramen experience, second Ramen I've ever had and was happy with it.  My last Ramen was in Edinburgh and it had  a lovely smokey garlic flavour with miso.  I fell in love.  At Ramen Isshin I ordered the spicy red miso and enjoyed it though I missed the roasted garlic.  It got better as I ate it though and decided I really like that flavour.  I really enjoyed the noodles, firm and springy, not starchy.  The pork belly was tender and sweet deliciousness.  We also ordered the pork gyoza which were good but mostly because the dipping sauce was delicious.  They are deep fried and I found them a little bland and dry, I would have preferred pan fried.  All in all only slightly less than amazing, and well worth revisiting even if only for that amazing pork belly."}
{"text":"It was an excellent ramen place in Toronto. They have kind staff and clean environment. Staff always ask if were doing good however, the waiter tried memorizing our order and literally came back 3 times cause he couldn't remember . Please use paper and pen! Ramen was awesome and i suggest ordering spicy miso ramen and the chicken katsu. Feeling adventurous? Try red dragon! Overall, it was pretty bomb!"}
{"text":"Delicious ramen with the most number of veggie options I have ever seen! The broth was seriously amazing. Huge portions too. Definitely a must try especially for vegetarians who tend to feel left out at most ramen places, it's a luxury to have more than one choice of vegetarian ramen."}
{"text":"I came here with a vegetarian friend and really tried hard to like this place. At the beginning, things were looking bright - the atmosphere was lively with the waiters pouring sake shots for people waiting in line. We waited around 45 minutes in line for a table for two. While waiting, we sifted through the menu and were super impressed by the allergy chart - listing everything from meat to shellfish content in each of their dishes. They even have a section of the menu dedicated to vegetarian ramen options. If you have any sort of dietary restrictions, rest assured that Ramen Isshin can cater to that unlike most ramen places! 

Once we got seated, I ordered the spicy red miso (vegetarian) ramen. What really upset me was that they absolutely refused to do any sort of substitutions in their dishes (ie can't substitute mushroom for corn or even a cheaper item). EVERY ramen place does substitutes. Ramen Isshin made us pay extra to remove the mushrooms and add the corn. How strange, when both are worth the same price on their menu. 

After that off-putting interaction, I just couldn't be impressed. The spicy red miso was alright, but just not as flavorful as the one at Hokkaido. Maybe I just need pork lard in my broth to make me happy? My friend liked his shoyu ramen broth, so I don't know. The amount of noodles in the regular sized portion were pretty generous though. 

tldr; come here if u have dietary restrictions/are vegetarian, but expect to pay extra if you want to make any sort of substitutions in their dishes. For a place that markets itself on vegetarian friendly, they should be more open to substitutions."}
{"text":"Got here at 7 pm on a weekday and was seated at the \"bar table\" within a few minutes (for a party of two). Expect a wait if you prefer to be seated at a regular table instead. I value my time too much to line up at a restaurant so I was content with the bar table setup. 

The appetizers are standard fare. The ramen is to die for and the portion size is generous (almost a bit too much, I would've preferred a cheaper and smaller portion). I ordered the Spicy Miso but it doesn't come with an egg (can be added for $1.5). Asahi on tap ($8 for a pint) is delicious, a must try if you've never had it."}
{"text":"Ok... I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen.
It was good.  No complains.

Now this is a tip for all you ramen lovers.
Leave half of everything that comes, the soup and all the toppings that you ordered.

Now, go ahead and ask for KAEDMA.  You'll get extra noodles!  
Now You have a second bowl of ramen!!!!

ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed by the lack of vegetarian options of ramen in Toronto, luckily I stumbled upon Ramen Isshin. They pride themselves on their vegetarian ramen, in that they worked really hard to match the flavors with the classic meat-stock ramen, and boy, did they ever do a good job. There certainly is not a lack of flavor in the veg ramen and have matched it to taste but also the silkiness of the stock and have matched the textures. I'm overly impressed in that they don't give you one veg option but give you four vegetarian options to choose from! I've been to Japan and found Raman Isshin's ramen even better because it's not nearly as salty, and they do a good job of the décor keeping it very traditional and intimate. Also, the add-on options are also cheap and a great way to customize your ramen to your liking. The staff that work there are charming, diligent and very sweet. They are always yelling HAI!, smiling and nodding. The staff are just the cherry on top of a wonderful-authentic experience."}
{"text":"The wait staff were friendly and welcoming. The food came out quickly and the portion size is pretty decent. The atmosphere was cozy, quiet and though not a huge place in size, it was very welcoming. I am a vegan and was able to enjoy a delicious bowl of ramen. I ordered the Vegetarian Shoyu Ramen and substituted it with egg-free noodles. It tasted delicious and was very creamy and not watery like some vegan ramen is. The variety of mushrooms in the bowl gave it an extra special flavour. I will definitely be coming back here as I believe it's one of the best places to get ramen in Toronto."}
{"text":"Liked it!
Great ambiance. Staff at Japanese restaurants usually greet you together, which can be surprising if not prepared, but I really like their positive attitudes.
The ajitzuke egg was cooked perfectly (in my view at least).
Dipping ramen was perfect for a chilly windy day like today. The double broth was extremely rich, but I think ramen broth is supposed to be salty and rich. 
The portion was not too big for me and I also had black sesame ice cream for dessert, which was very rich, creamy and tasty."}
{"text":"The worst thing you could ever do to me is make me chose my most favorite bowl of ramen. There are so many great ramen houses in the city and Ramen Isshin is definitely one of them. Although you won't find them listed on BlogTO's list of best ramen in the city; it's just as well, as I've never had to line up to get into Isshin, like you would normally have to for Kinton, Kenzo or Sansotei. 

Not sure of what to try when you there? Go for their famous Black Tan Tan Noodles. The fresh ground sesame will blow your taste buds away and transport you into whole other dimension of umami goodness. If you are one of those people who can never finish a bowl of ramen, I challenge you to leave any of Isshin's tonkotsu broth, chewy noodles or delicate slices of pork behind. It just won't happen."}
{"text":"We came in on a rainy Friday night and the line had already reached the door. The waiting area was cramped. There was a bench and a few chairs along the wall, but there was also a line of people standing across the other side, leaving a narrow path for people to enter and exit. Normally, seeing a crowd like this would make me come up with a backup plan, but we had already walked a mile and a half from our Airbnb. We were committed. 

The dining area was just as small as the waiting area. There was a counter area and table and chairs setup. Service was efficient and the wait time was about fifteen minutes. 

There were four vegan choices and I went with the spicy red miso. Additionally, there were several handmade noodle choices, including two vegan options. I wanted to try the eggless kale, but they were out, so I instead got the regular vegan noodle. The ramen wasn't spicy at all, but had a really good flavor. There were brown bits in the soup and I was worried that it was meat, but it was actually tofu. I wasn't expecting a faux meat, but it was a nice touch. I knew I wasn't missing out on a good bowl of ramen just because I do not eat meat. 

The portion size was just right. I'm accustomed to restaurants that serve gigantic bowls of noodles and the guilt of letting half of it go to waste. Extremely courteous staff and excellent quality food. It was the perfect cold weather date spot."}
{"text":"Given this ramen place is of Kingyo descent, it lives up to the reputation.  

We had two bowls: one tonkotsu shio with sesame, the other was the tonkotsu shoyu with garlic.  

Distinctly flavoured broths, good noodle chew, and the egg was cooked perfectly.  One topping was missing, so upon notifying the server, a small dish of wood ear mushroom was brought over.  

I would go back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. There was about a 10 min wait for seating because it was dinner rush, which wasn't a huge deal at all. Chicken karaage side was super yummy, loved the texture of the rice. The ramen was incredible, super flavourful and filling with nice thick noodles that weren't too soft but also not too chewy. Service was quick, the server was friendly and the food was great!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for ramen. Even converted my cousin who wasn't a fan before. I tried the Black Sesame Tan Tan noodles, Spicy Red Miso, and Red Dragon. They were all very flavourful, but I enjoyed the Spicy Red Miso the best. My cousin liked the Black Sesame the most. The Red Dragon isn't that spicy if you're used to heat, but it does have a Szechuan feel to it so they probably use some of those peppercorns. The staff are all so friendly & nice. Apparently they cook the broth over 8 hours & make all the noodles in house. There's definitely a difference with this place & other ramen restos."}
{"text":"This place always has a giant line! 

Good thing my friends and I managed to snag a spot on a Sunday night. 

Ramen lovers flood to this place, and how was it? Well the noodles were really chewy and good, the broth was fatty and good, and the meat is soft and good but... maybe I'm not a good taster of ramen, but I honestly thought there was nothing above and beyond about the food. Like I've tasted similar ramens at other locations before??? 

I'll need to come back and try it again. 

TLDR: Is the long line worth the wait???? If you really love ramen, I guess so."}
{"text":"The vegan kale noodles in vegetarian soup is phenomenal!!!! It was so good I got extra noodles after I was done with the first batch. I want to go there every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I love their ramen! We discovered this place in December 2014 when we were looking for vegetarian ramen. Ever since, I have visited this place over 10 times and still enjoy it every time. The best ramen I had in town! Spicy Red Miso Ramen is amazing and a great option for vegetarians. 

It is a very popular place and you have to wait in line, especially on the weekends but it is totally worth it!

Atmosphere is really nice along with the decor. Staff is very friendly and the service is pretty fast."}
{"text":"Good ramen place for some casual dining. Had their house special black sesame tan tan ramen, which came with some black sesame seeds in a cute little mortar and pestle--ground your own seeds kinda experience. Odd, but kinda cool! 

Noodles had great texture, the broth was rich and flavourful. Portion was a little small and I never got my bok choi as advertised but service was quick and price was decent ($12). Beware that the kitchen closes quite early (9:45) on week nights!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends. They do not take reservations so be prepared to wait a bit! However the servers were very nice that day and when I called saying I had a large group they said they would hold a table for me. Thank you for your delicious ramen, we were all highly satisfied."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday lunch and everything was average. The service was average, the quality was average and the price was a bit pricey. There are a few options on the menu but they are all very similar so you don't really have a huge range of choices. The noodles were on the chewy side but the broth was really good with a deep taste!"}
{"text":"Black Tan Tan is one of the best dishes I've ever had! The staff definitely deserve the 5 stars alone; always friendly, helpful, and genuinely happy. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Got the red miso ramen ($14) and takoyaki ($8).

The red miso ramen consisted of ramen (well duh), a lot of bean sprouts and veggies (which I don't really care for), and 2 very, very thin slices of pork. Very good ramen and soup base, but for the price I don't think it was worth it (again, very thin meat).

Takoyaki was pretty good, but $8 for 5 is a bit on the pricey side too.

Quality: 7/10. Service: 8.5/10. Value: 6/10. Overall 7/10 (Not an average)."}
{"text":"On a cold evening, you can never go wrong with Ramen. A group of 5 people, we were lucky to snag a table at the back. I ordered the white sesame shoyu ramen and an side order of karaage Don.

The ramen was creamy and flavourful. It was also my first time grinding the sesame seeds, which was an interesting concept. A friend ordered the shoyu kotteri tsukemen- that's the one I'd try next time. Nonetheless, my ramen was so filling, I couldn't finish the small karaage Don. I ate it at a later time, but it didn't have the fresh crispy texture anymore.

4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"The vegan broth here is amazing!! It is very rich and so flavourful. My favorite is the spicy miso  veggie ramen. They even have vegan noodles. My only complaint is the cost for subbing for vegan noodle!! It's the same cost as Rosing extra noodles!"}
{"text":"One of the best, for sure the top 2 of Toronto most delicious ramen. I don't recommend the guioza but I do recommend the karage."}
{"text":"This place is aammmmaaazing. Was recommended by a friend. Came around noon on a Sunday, got right in. But by the time we were leaving there was a line of about 15 people. This place was packeddddd. 

for 4 of us it costed 80$. 

We all got ramen & dumplings to start. 

The dumplings were amazing and so was the ramen. 

I don't have any complaints & will deff come back if I'm ever in the area"}
{"text":"I have been on a Ramen craze these past few days and being an avid yelp user I chose this place after scrolling through a few options in the downtown Toronto area. I must say, I was not disappointed.

This places is a lunch room style establishment, meaning you sit in close proximity to other guests. There were only Pork option Ramen, so I decided to have the vegetarian Spicy Miso Ramen and it was absolutely delicious. I also had the small bowl of chicken and rice on the side. Everything was cooked to perfection. Service was great everyone greeted us including the chef who was cooking in the front of the restaurant, a really nice touch. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok. It had been close to two weeks since i had visited this restaurant. I went back to other places that I thought of as decent.  Now I can conclude one thing. The conclusion is not that this place is flawless. But if you go to a ramen place when they are busy. Then you should expect shitty food.  I was smart to pick one of the coldest nights to try this place out. Thus it was not crazy busy. And the food was at a much higher quality relative to the others that I have written about. 
I had an appetizer and a garlic flavour ramen.  I am not going to comment much on the appetizer as it is nothing special.
So here is the Ramen.  First off is my kudos to their soft boiled egg. They yolk was clear and nicely cooked; not a bit of raw taste in it. The egg white portion is infused with the sauce that was used to cook it.
I am not going to comment much on the meat. Let's just say that i prefer lean pork. 
As per the noodle, they are definitely well done.  Of all the places that I had been to, If this place is considered authentic, then I am visiting to Japan. The noodles are close to instant noodles cooked well (good instant noodle do not mean bad quality food).  I am sorry that i cannot provide any deep analysis on the noodles. But let's not kid ourselves. Who doesn't like instant noodles. 
Finally the soup, of course they are mostly high in sodium. So I am not going to whine about that like many others. Just one thing that surprised me but I cannot confirm if it is down to the soup. I tasted wonton noodles flavour when I ate the noodles. It is not that it is good or bad.  I kind of liked it.
Anyway, to conclude; this place is definitely worth a try. Just don't go when the weather is nice. Better to pick the worst day of the year."}
{"text":"My favourite ramen spot in the city. I get the tsukemen every time. The noodles have excellent texture, the broth is flavourful, the egg is perfect. Takoyaki here is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Came back again! This time I tried some different appetizers and a new ramen bowl. 

Chicken karaage - yum I love deep fried chicken. It was quite crispy and hot. The dipping sauce was great (kewpie mayo); I would say that it's kinda like aioli but different colour and japanese-influenced.

Seafood okonomiyaki - if you  like takoyaki, you will like this. It's basically the same thing but in pancake form!

Black sesame tan tan ramen - this was great! In my previous review, I said that the miso ramen had an odd kind of sweetness in the broth. This one didn't really have that, probably because of the flavour of black sesame but I like it more this way! Some people say that there is a bitter taste but it suited me just fine.

Overall, I'm glad I got to try other menu items. All were great but my faves so far are black sesame tan tan ramen and hiya yakko (tofu dish)."}
{"text":"Been waiting to try this place for months... the hype is real! Very flavourful broth, great atmosphere, and friendly staff! We came on a Saturday at 11:45am and got one of the last tables. We got the spicy miso which was AMAZING, veg shio and takoyaki. Everything we got was so good... can't wait to try more!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best vegetarian ramen I have had in this city, and I really appreciate they put in the effort to make them tasty! My only gripe is they are waaaay too salty, which you start to notice the further you dive into your bowl. I am posting this review  in the hopes they might see it and tone down the sodium level because then the ramen would be perfect. :)

The japatine (Japanese poutine) is also really delicious and a must try!

Oct 29, 2015 update: Seems they have toned down the saltiness a bit which is good.. though it can still be toned down more. There are 3 or 4 veg ramen options! The Japanese poutine is no longer on the menu.. please bring it back! They have a delicious fresh soft tofu dish on the menu. In the summer, the cool lemon shio ramen is to die for.. refreshing and delicious! Thanks for having so many tasty veg options! They can also sub in gluten free ramen noodles upon request (and I think a bit of extra $ but I may be wrong)."}
{"text":"It was very easy to walk by this store because there is no sign. There was writing on the glass store front in very thin marker. 
I came in and was greeted with in Japanese and could pick where I wanted to sit as it wasnt busy.
The place is decorated very nice! I ordered:
Takoyaki - deep fried squid batter topped with fish flakes (balls, 5 pcs). Different to traditional takoyaki but still very good! I loved it 
Japatine- Japanese curry and green onion on fries. It was alright - I dont really recommend it but it is a very cool food idea.
Karaage - Deep fried chicken. Yummy, especially with the mayonnaise. A bit too dark though. Woulsve preferred if they pulled it out of the fryer 30 sec or a min before. 
Then I tried the ramen..  the red miso ramen. The noodles were yummy and FRESH! I wasnt too fond of the broth because of the super pork taste. There were also so many vegetables in my ramen that I was not expecting.
Overall an OK place. Super friendly service (it was almost annoying tbh. Waiters said sorry as they were filling your water cup) 
I loved the appetizers but will go somewhere else for ramen next time."}
{"text":"The Red Dragon ramen may be the best ramen I have ever had. 10/10 amazing flavor, not overwhelmingly hot."}
{"text":"I got the Spicy Miso Ramen. The broth was good but it wasn't spicy at all. The noodles were a bit al dente but I enjoyed my meal overall. My friend got the Black Tan Tan Soup and I really liked her broth. Unfortunately, my stomach didn't agree with the meal later on but it did taste good while I was eating it at the restaurant. The servers were really friendly and fast with the food."}
{"text":"The spicy vegetarian miso was an eye opener!  Traverses the filling yet light line perfectly!
Great service, great prices and awesome food!"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend to this restaurant because a friend recommended it. It's really small inside and crowded but that's part of the atmosphere in most ramen places. I have to commend this place because they are quick, not 5 min since we ordered and we already got our food. I got the regular Miso based ramen, it was rich in flavour, the noodles were perfectly done and the toppings were cooked to  perfection. Along with our meal we got takkiyaki and gyoza which were  a compliment the ramen perfectly. We also got the chicken I suggest you don't it's not all that great I would of just ordered another set of gyoza. Otherwise this place is a perfect 10 in my books."}
{"text":"Being from the Vancouver area, but now living in Brampton, my wife and I often mention how much we miss quick access to good Ramen - so when we were in the area we took advantage came here.

The place is evidently quite popular by having a wait for tables 8pm on a Wednesday. The wait wasn't too long though and we loved our service.

I went for the Black Sesame Tan Tan Noodle. I believe it also has a nut base in the soup which I LOVED along with the sesame. Pretty cool to receive your own supply of sesame to ground on your own for freshness and deciding quantity. I might even say it was a favourite Ramen broth ever. The ingredients were solid too, but I'd have to knock a star off for value. At some Ramen places, I swear the quantity is so much that they have to be sneaking ingredients in through the bottom of the bowl, since it feels never-ending. I was a little surprised at how quickly I went through the noodles, and meat in particular is very slim. My wife's bowl came with egg, and it was only half an egg.

All of this can be rectified by ordering more - and I can only assume that's their plan. We both ultimately loved our food which is most important, but again, the value could improve."}
{"text":"With the exception of airport lounges and movie theatres, this place takes prize for least value ever award.  It's expensive! Really expensive!  $16 for a small serving of noodle soup? That's crazy talk!  Want chilli oil with that? Add $1.5!!  Ginger ale?  Add $4.5.  

I don't usually discuss pricing much in my reviews.  But nothing at this place was nearly as noteworthy.  Also, am I supposed to enjoy the wads of unmixed miso that kept finding their way into my mouth?  Most unpleasant!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch while in Toronto for work. Had the normal ramen, not the Miso. It was amazing. Might be some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner on a Wednesday night. The only people in the place aside from the staff was a couple off in the corner. Kitchy Japanese music played in the background from old J Dramas and Kingdom Hearts. I ordered the light shoyu ramen with garlic chilli chives and extra bean sprouts. The broth was creamy, flavourful, and light. You get two thin slices of tender cha su pork which leaves me wanting more. The chives really add a great bright flavour to the noodles which became a bit mushy towards the end of my meal, but I'm a slow eater. Next time I'll know to ask for the sesame seeds with chillies; you get a pestle to grind it fresh at the table. The ramen here is pretty standard for the current Toronto ramen trend, a bit over priced for a bowl of noodles ($15). Will try the red miso ramen next time since it's their signature, maybe that will make the difference."}
{"text":"I came here for a late lunch and ordered the Tsukemen. Interesting way to serve tsukemen (in a hot claypot-looking bowl). This is the first time I've had tsukemen served this way. Great since I love my soup really hot. 

the food itself was good. The broth could use a little more depth and thickness, and the fish/seafood taste was pretty strong. Not bad, but I like porky tsukemen better. A very solid dish overall, still a step down than my fave tsukemen out in LA: Tsujita LA. 

I will come back and try their ramen."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service.

Came here with friends on a BUSY Sunday evening. I've been craving ramen for the past few months and was more than happy to bus it downtown when my friends recommended this spot. We had the Karaage appetizer and I had the Tan Tan noodles. The karaage was excellent, crispy on the outside, hot and tender on the inside, and very flavourful. The ramen was super good. The black sesame seeds in a mortar and pestle are a fun touch, and definitely necessary, because it turns your broth grey. How unappealing would it be to get grey broth brought to your table? My friends had recently taken a trip to Japan and gave this place the gold star of approval for tasting (and feeling) just like what they experienced there. It truly feels like you're no longer in Toronto at this spot."}
{"text":"Ramen Isshin has been packed the first and second time I came. The first time, they had a 20-25 minute wait list and the second time we were lucky to score bar seats. I got the Asari Light Shoyu Ramen, one of their cheaper ramen options which included Isshin Shoyu broth with bamboo, seaweed/nori, soft boiled egg, pork belly, and thin wavy noodles. The broth was very light yet still flavourful. The pork belly would literally melt in your mouth with that delicious sweet and bbq flavour. Egg was soft boiled, my favourite! Service was good however they lost a star because the portion was quite small and they are unable to split bills. I would understand if people sitting at the same table could not split bills but my friends and I were sitting on bar seats. Our orders could have been entered into the system as individual seats and therefore individual bills. They could definitely increase efficiency while maintaining their loyal customers."}
{"text":"Great options on the menu, fast friendly service, and delicious. Probably my favourite ramen in the city. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday & checked out assembly hall. In the end i ended up choosing this stall. Surprised at how much i enjoyed the sesame ramen (their most popular one as per the staff recommendation). Compared to other ramens I've had, i usually feel the broth is fattier, heavy and saltier. This one had a great sesame aroma & broth that wasn't that thick which i really liked!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening at around 7pm and there was already a line. This place is popular! Didn't have to wait long though - we were seated within 10 minutes. 

Had the takoyaki for appetizer. This was the best takoyaki I've ever had. Granted, I've only eaten takoyaki two other times in my life. But still! This one was delicious. Could taste the octopus inside, and the outside was nicely fried.

For ramen, I ordered the black sesame tan tan noodles. I know some other ramen places allow you to pick how salty the broth is. I kind of wish this option existed here, because I found the broth to be too salty. But I still enjoyed my ramen. The consistency of the noodles was chewy as expected, and the flavour of the broth was good. 

And for dessert, the mango pudding! Yummsville! I had read other yelp reviews about the mango pudding, so I wanted to give it a try. Super yums, definitely better than those ones you get at chinese dim sum places. This one had pieces of mango, and was more grainy. It came with a mint leaf, which I ripped into tiny pieces so that I could get some mint with each bite.

Overall, solid food, nice ambiance, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Damn tasty ramen. Service is incredibly polite and welcoming, and the ramen itself is absolutely delicious. There have been some times that have been less than excellent, but overall, and 99% of the time, the food is wonderful. If you want the rest to go, they also package it up lovely :D"}
{"text":"With the new wave of ramen joints sweeping the city, this has to be one of the top 5 places in the city. A must try for any ramen enthusiasts. 

PRO TIP: Ramen comes in so many variations it's important to know what you want before you get there. You must study up on the variations because most ramen menu's don't explain the differences sufficiently. Because of this most negative experiences come from someone ordering randomly. 

The things that stand out to me from my several trips here are the incredible quality and craftsmanship that comes through in every bowl. I am also continually surprised how full I get from eating there. There is definite value here. 

The consistent line ups to get in are a good sign that this place is here to stay."}
{"text":"People love this place. We waited 40 minutes for a table but the food is nice. However, the ramen is a little salty for my taste. I love that they cater to non meat eaters too. I recommend this place if you don't mind waiting in line for a bit."}
{"text":"One of the best Ramen places in Toronto for sure! I honestly wasn't a huge fan of ramen in general because I had a so so experience at Kenzo. Kenzo was where I tried ramen for the first time, and it wasn't anything spectacular. 

This place though actually changed my mind about ramen. The noodles were way more tastier and the broths were much more richer tasting. I have had the Red Dragon Ramen and the Spicy Miso Ramen and both were awesome! And the price is great too! 

Only thing was my husband can't eat pork or beef, we asked the waitress if the vegetarian ramen broth was actually from vegetables, she wasn't able to answer it so we just decided to play it safe and ordered chicken rice for him! 

Overall, still delicious and well worth the trip! :)"}
{"text":"Safe to say I've been to about 75% of the ramen eateries in Toronto, this one is at the top. The very top. I've tried almost all of the Ramen bowls here with the \"asari light shoyu Ramen\" being my favourite. Isshin does an amazing job with their broth that other places, yet good, don't seem to come close to. 10$ a bowl you definitely can't complain. Gyoza are perfectly cooked with the meat on the inside not being over seasoned at all, which most of the time is the case. Keep up the good work isshin I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I come here distinctly for the Black Sesame Ice Cream. It is rich, creamy and very tasty! I have ordered the same dessert at other restaurants and it always disappoints. I've also tried finding a similar kind in grocery stores but to no avail. It has even crossed my mind to infiltrate the kitchen to find the ice cream brand - it's THAT good. Ramen Isshin serves mochi ice cream as well which are store-bought. The Black Sesame Mochi Ice Cream lacks the richness and creaminess of the former dessert I mentioned. I like the Green Tea Mochi Ice Cream but will not order again knowing it is available at T&T. 

But how is the ramen, you ask? It is one of the better places in the GTA but not the best i've had outside Japan. The Spicy Red Miso Ramen is my go-to. The broth is flavourful but it lacks the extra kick you would be expecting. The wok fried pork bits are a good addition and the noodles are perfectly al-dente. However, I think Hokkaido Ramen Santouka better represents the quality of the ramen in Japan. Make sure you order the premium ramen there though! 

The servers are friendly. But it is a hit or miss whether you get someone who speaks fluent English. 

Eating a delicious, savoury bowl of ramen makes the Toronto winters a little more bearable."}
{"text":"Great service and very good ramen. Serving sizes are large as well. I always order my ramen with reduced salt as I find the regular dose is a bit much. Awesome place overall."}
{"text":"I love this place so much I told my boyfriend I wanted to come here for my birthday. Unfortunately, they don't do anything special for you on your birthday.

They were running a special on Mazu Sake and we decided to give it a go. The staff came out with a bottle of sake and poured it into the glass inside a wooden box until it was overflowing. You have to say ottoottotto while there is a whole lot of cheering from the staff. It was a fun experience but slightly embarrassing because the whole restaurant's watching you as they do this.

The ramen was excellent, as expected. I've been here three times now and every time it's been excellent. The chicken karaage was also amazing!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice in the past week. I can't get enough! Finally a great ramen joint that I can access from the path, now it's easy to cure my lunch time ramen cravings.

I must admit that I had never heard of Isshin prior to visiting the Assembly hall. But am I ever glad that it found its way into my life. My first visit I ordered the rich shoyu ramen, which has the addition of pork belly fat to the broth. The broth was rich and flavourful, just what I needed for an extremely cold day. The pork belly was tender, I just wish there was more than two thin pieces. On my second visit I ordered the white sesame shio ramen. The broth was much lighter in both texture and taste. I also really liked the addition of mushrooms and bamboo shoots. 

Overall Isshin serves a tasty bowl of ramen! The noodles are thin and have a great chew to them. The broth is flavourful and the pork is tender. I hope they start to bring some of the other selections from their College location to Assembly for us to try."}
{"text":"Asahi on tap!!  Best ramen that I've had in Toronto. Must try the red miso and red dragon spicy miso if it suits your fancy. Delicious! Also their chicken karagge is the best \"Japanese fried chicken\" ever."}
{"text":"march special with deep fried pork, egg, sprouts, noodles and curry soup base. The meal was delicious but it's a bit pricey -$18.50."}
{"text":"This is only my second time trying ramen. I know! It's just I don't eat pork and ramen is almost always made with a pork based broth. The only other time I tried a non-pork based broth.. It was not good.
Anyway, my friend mentioned that this place had some veggie based broths for ramen so I decided why not give ramen another chance.
I'm so happy I did. First, this place is pretty small. And it seems that it's also quite a local fave. I'm not surprised after eating here. The service was excellent. I ordered the spicy veg red miso ramen. It had ground tofu, mushrooms, bean sprouts and thick wavy noodles (which I found out they make in house!) in a delicious and spicy broth. It wasn't burn your taste buds spicy, but a nice kick.
I also tried my friend's chicken karaage don which is deep fried chicken with kupe mayo and rice. I was too full to order he combo myself, but next time I'm definitely ordering myself some chicken karaage don!! It was so good! By the way, if you order a ramen dish you can add any rice bowl (like the chicken karaage don) for $3.80 more!
After I checked in, I got a lunch deal to be used Mon-Thurs... I'm definitely going to be returning and this deal is just extra incentive but it's really nice to see businesses offer Yelpers little things too."}
{"text":"Good Ramen. May not be the best, but it's good. There's different options like the gimmicky black sesame ramen, which you can grind your own black sesame as garnish. or the spicy ramen. 

They also have some staple Japanese snacks. Takoyaki was a bit soggy and dough heavy (but still good). 

Its not a place you want to sit for a while and chat with your friends. Its loud, and more suited to quick meals and possible with a large group.

Its a great addition to the over saturated College St establishments."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite ramen joints in Toronto and actually my first one here. 

When I was vegetarian, their spicy veggie miso soup was my go to. It was tradition to come here whenever I flew in. It was the right amount the spice and the noodles were great. Now that I'm vegan, I actually prefer Jinya over Ramen Isshin and I'll tell you why.

Ramen Isshin has vegan noodles, sure, but they charge you $3 to make it so. Jinya already has a spicy vegan ramen ready to go and it costs only $12.50 whereas the vegetarian one here charges $13.80 before extras and noodle changes. The noodles are good, but I felt like there were less of them than when there's a bowl with their traditional noodles. Also, there aren't sauces on the table like Jinya, which I like 'cos sometimes, I want more spice while I eat my ramen especially as it gets colder.

One more thing - their fried tofu is really good. 

Overall, I'm a fan whether vegetarian or vegan. It is closer (I think) than Ramen Isshin is to me. I will still come here in the future whenever I'm just wanting a different vegan ramen and don't mind spending a little more."}
{"text":"The black tan tan men was delicious, 5 stars! The red miso was okay, I would give 3 stars. I liked the black tan tan men because it had the deep roasted black sesame seed flavor plus the broth they used was very delicious. The mango pudding, oh my gosh delicious! I would so ordered a second one! Glad I came here and if I come back go Canada ill definitely return back!

Plus the service was awesome as well!"}
{"text":"This place is such a treat!  We went on a Friday night so obviously there was a line.  We had to wait about 30 minutes but it was SO worth it.  All the servers were friendly and attentive.  Once we were seated our food was out fairly quickly and everything tasted amazing.  Out of the five of us, no one had a single bad critique of any of our dishes.

While it was a little loud due to it being such a small place filled with a lot of people, the rest of the setting was nice.

We ordered the Deep Fried Pork Gyoza, Tako Yaki, Red Dragon Ramen, Vegetarian Shoyu Ramen and Black Sesame Ice Cream.  I would order it all again.  All the portions were reasonable.  I was happily full with my Veg Shoyu Ramen and my partner couldn't even finish the Red Dragon Ramen it filled it up so much.

I would say your meal is worth every penny and I'm pretty frugal when it comes to eating out."}
{"text":"Our first time here and had to wait almost an hour to be seated as the place was packed on a Friday night. Was the wait worth it? Definitely! Had the Black Tan Tan Noodle and my boyfriend had the Spicy Red Miso Ramen. Between the two I preferred mine, however, the spicy red miso isn't off my list. Service was great with attentive waitstaff. The lighting was a bit too bright for my liking, and even though the place was full it didn't feel overly cramped, once we were seated and dining. Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"This place makes, hands down some of the best soup and ramen I have ever had. My buddy said that it was at least as good as the stuff he had while he was in Japan. 

The mango pudding and black sesame ice cream were a deal and also tasty.

I am not sure what else to say other than that it was absolutely delicious and very affordable. Super impressed."}
{"text":"I love how chewy the ramen noodle is. The pork was okay, sometimes I don't find it not piping hot enough, I like my pork piping hot, but that is just my personal preference. 

I've ordered the tan tan one, it has a good spice level. I've asked the staff if that particular ramen comes with an egg. She said \"no\" so I ordered a side order of the egg. I ended up with three eggs. Wasn't too happy about that, but anyways, good noodles!"}
{"text":"Very nice. They have lots of choices, which other ramen places do not provide. You should have a try."}
{"text":"So glad they came to chef assembly hall since I was dying to try it but it was too far away! This location did not disappoint! I got the white sesame shio ramen and the broth was very creamy and rich. Noodles were perfect and egg was also equally good. The service was very efficient and fast, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This Ramen restaurant really surprises me. Even thought they were packed, everything was quick and Attention to detail, very attentive staffs. Quick service, everyone works like a team.

We were seated right away and served ice water immediately. It was a hot day outside.

I ordered the garlic ramen, noodles were chewy and soup base was delicious. Egg was perfect. 

Dessert was green tea and black sea same mochi, it was okay . 

Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"So this place is in my top 5 for ramen shops in TO (possibly top 3). It stands on ramen rushmore with fellow heavyweights sansotei, santouka, ryus and kinton/hakata shoryuken. The service is efficient and prompt. The restaurant is clean. Varying lineups outside depending on the time of day. Both sesame ramens (black and white sesame) are very interesting. I've only tried the white and it was delicious. What I usually get is the roasted garlic shoyu but occasionally I go for the monstrous red dragon that boasts 15 diff spices (if I feel like splurging a little).

Pricing very similar to the other ramen joints I mentioned above (Santouka still the most expensive imo). Proper noodles, proper broth. Come check this place out!"}
{"text":"From the first slurp of noodles and soup, I was in heaven. I had as my main the Shoyu Kotteri Tsukemen. And my gf had Asari Light Shoyu Ramen. I liked mine more since it had a slightly more flavourful broth that reminded me of soba except this was boiling hot and had more pork flavour. Also I liked the thicker noodles. 

The appetizers we ate were octopus balls. Those were cooked perfectly. The tako yaki's sauce was a great harmony that didn't over power the octopus like I've experienced at other places in Toronto. 
The Karaganda chicken tasted great. It crispy outside and juicy inside, without tasting oily.
The cabbages which is cabbage and cold cha shu pork was surprisingly tasty even though I normally hate cabbage.

I was happy with my whole experience. 

In terms of the atmosphere it felt more like a Raman stall in Japan compared to other Raman places in Toronto. All the staff were friendly. I'll come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm amazed to find a place where I can call it Tokyo in Toronto. This is the first place where the chefs and wait staff welcome and treat customers with amazing Japanese hospitality. We ordered deep fried pork gyoza and tako yaki(octopus balls) to start with. Our mains were red dragon ramen and spicy red miso ramen. 
Food was heavenly and very enjoyable. Spice level for me was perfect but then again it differs from one palate to another.
Customer service was awesome and the staff work with perfect coordination displaying team work at its best.
You gotta eat there and I surely will."}
{"text":"My daughter and I love this place. Lovely atmosphere, very cozy, with friendly, helpful staff. Yummy ramen. Love the mushroomy veggie shio."}
{"text":"Waited 20 min for a table on Sunday lunch. Decent wait.

Staff were courteous.
I got the Black tan tan noodles. Broth was great, I'd give it 5 stars. Very rich and flavourful. Noodles were meh though, 3 stars. They seemed undercooked and prepackaged.

I'd come back, but wouldn't wait again."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen! I went for lunch on a Friday with a friend. We got there at 11:30am when it opened and luckily we were seated right away and didn't have to wait in line. By 12:30pm, the place was full with customers. Isshin offers lunch specials but only from Monday - Thursday so we had to order off the menu. I ordered the Miso Ramen which was delicious! The noodles were chewy and the broth was so good. It's the best ramen I've had in the city! The prices are very reasonable too! I think my ramen was $12.90 + tax. I would highly recommend this place. I've only been once but will be returning to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday evening, and had to wait about 20 minutes for seats for two. This restaurant is quite popular/busy, so they'll likely ask if you're okay with bar seats or sharing a table with others.

We both ordered the white sesame shio ramen, which we enjoyed, but I think I prefer Hokkaido Ramen Santouka and Sansotei a bit more. The gyoza was also good!"}
{"text":"The new menu arrived some while ago and the additions are great. So good, I decided to update my review. But it's not only the menu that changed, smaller decorative details have also sprung to bring Ramen Isshin closer to what it truly can become. 

To begin, they have a sign! Perched a top the storefront window, written on a wooden board. Much better than the old tarp hanging out front, you can now see the cooks working and making ramen much clearer through the windows.

What else is new? The menu. Not just the items, but the actual physical menu itself. Pictures now accompany dish descriptions, the \"Isshin Way\" (as I am calling it it) on their wall is explained, \"how to grind sesame\" instructions are in an easy-to-read diagram, and the menu is now glossy, water resistant - much needed in a soup-centric restaurant.

The new items are delectable, much welcomed by my palette and stomach. Things like their crispy crunchy popcorn shrimp with spicy mayo dip, crispy crusted okonomiyaki with a tender, creamy center are things you comeback for (but really, it's the takoyaki and karaage that take the cake still). 

Then we come to their spicy red miso, which is really unique- semi-spicy, but sweet too from the red miso. Balanced well with the saltiness and overall savory mouth feel you want and expect from good ramen broth. 

Is that more and thicker pork slices I see in my ramen bowl too? Yes, yes it is- I needed that. Everyone needs that. And is this a new spoon I'm using to slurp my broth? Yes, yes it is - surprisingly, it makes the ramen eating experience even better, somehow, I don't know how- but it does.   

I also saw a post about the new Red Dragon Ramen- \"Super Spicy, Super Good\", which is something I really want to try now- because I believe them, they wouldn't lie.

Overall, Ramen Isshin is improving, still. This is really comforting to see for me in a restaurant I loved since they've opened. It's nice to witness improvements in an already great restaurant as it continues to grow. They are constantly trying to become better than they were, setting the benchmark higher and farther than their own expectations. The benefits from their work ethic filter straight to us and I am happy about that. Not only because the bowl of ramen in front of me will be guaranteed delicious, but I'm happy to see restaurants work, re-work, and build upon things beyond just the menu. The details matter too."}
{"text":"Ramen Isshin has been my local go-to ramen shop for the past 3 years. Now, they're open in the Assembly Hall and I cannot be happier. At their original location, you can expect lines out the door (especially during colder months) and although there are lines here too, they're not nearly as long. 

The quality of ramen is the same from the original, just served in tossable bowls instead. Currently, the ramen that requires wok-fried toppings (spicy miso for example) aren't available yet, but I was assured that they will have it very soon so the menu isn't limited at all. The soup is still smooth and full-bodied, while the noodles are chewy. 

Seating is in the Assembly Hall, which is super casual and plentiful as well. Overall, one of the best options for ramen in the area for an affordable price that's quick and easy."}
{"text":"Good beer good food good atmosphere. The chicken karaage is so delicious...only wish there was a bowl of it. Sigh. Would definitely go again and again."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. My favourite place for ramen. Pair it with beer and I'm in heaven! Perfect place to be during winter."}
{"text":"4 of us went there on random week night.
Great great ramen!! Loved the spicy one!
Everyone at the table loved their soup!
Def coming back!!"}
{"text":"Black tan tan noodle exceeded my expectations. Soup had a nice strong flavour, just the way I like it. They gave this mortar and pestle to grind up sesame and put into the noodle. I thought that was interesting, though bit unnecessary. Will be back to try other flavours ^^"}
{"text":"I've been coming here long before this place blew up, so definitely have been returning less often due to the long lineups. However, I have nothing but great things to say about the food here.

I had the spicy red miso ramen, their signature menu item. In the past, I've always gone with the shio, but this is definitely my go-to now. Unlike other ramen, the chefs stir fry the vegetables under high heat before adding the rest of the ingredients into the bowl. This releases the fragrance and flavour of the vegetables into the broth! The noodles are also some of the best I've had in Toronto - they were bouncy and had great texture.

The only gripe I have about Ramen Isshin is the tiny seating. We were seating in the middle of the restaurant, and it wasn't the most comfortable time putting away your coat and bag in such a small space."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite ramen in the city. I love everything about Ramen Isshin - the décor/atmosphere takes me back to Japan, the servers are quick and very friendly and the ramen tastes waaaaay better than it should. 

The menu here is quite extensive and can be difficult for indecisive diners (ie. me). However, there is a board of their top 5 (most popular) ramen to help narrow down the selection. I have my choices down pat: white sesame shio when I'm really craving something soupy and shoyu tsukemen all other times. For those not familiar with tsukemen aka \"dip ramen\", it's a dish of cold ramen noodles with toppings and a bowl of hot, dense soup on the side for dipping your noodles into. It can be the perfect meal for a hot day when you're craving ramen but not ready to chow down over a hot bowl of soup...but really it's a perfect meal for any day of the year :) Be careful though, as the portion is huge! No other joints does tsukemen better than Isshin. 

They're portions are quite generous but if you're feeling extra hungry, Isshin offers karage don or cha sui don on the side and a variety of appetizers like takoyaki (yum!) "}
{"text":"Noooooooo whyyy. I hate writing bad reviews especially for my pride and joy ramen noodles. I have reviewed so many ramen restaurants in NYC and was excited to see what Toronto had to offer. 

-----About the food-----
Noodle texture was very good, firm to my liking. Charshu was delicious, fall apart tender. Soft boiled egg was great and so was the marinate, not too salty. The reason why I gave this joint three stars is because the soup was extremely salty. The flavors were great initially. You can really taste the garlic flavor. But after the second bit the salt was way too much, I felt like I needed 15 glasses of water after eating that bowl. It came to the point where I had to just eat the noodles and left all the soup in the bowl after I finished. What a shame."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hard competitor for my top Ramen spots in TO. 

I'm not Japanese, nor a chef, and I haven't had the luck to visit that land yet. However, when I get to like something that I can eat while getting some kind of comfort, I become an aficionado.

I ordered the spicy veggie option with extra mushrooms.

There was a 10-15 min. waiting time for the magic potions to arrive, but it was worthed. The noodles have a solid recipe and quality. They must be very proud of them because they offer an option of some special ones... I need to try them!

Although my Ramen was vegetarian the broth didn't lack flavour at all. It was rich, delicate, aromatic, balanced, not overcompensated with salt or garlic. It was spicy, not oily, and I enjoyed every single spoon I had. 

My only complains aren't food wise, just some details they could handle to improve the customers' experience. The spoons are too tick and don't allow you to finish every single drop of that delicious soup without taking it straight from the bowl... And when you are seated on the last corner of the long counter, close to the prep kitchen, there is a really cold flow of air that attack the first guests."}
{"text":"Great ramen place - will definitely be back again. The broths we tried were not too salty tasting (a common issue I sometimes have with ramen places). The service was excellent and the portions plentiful. There are also multiple vegetarian options which is a great bonus! 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went Thursday evening to find it not pack but not empty either!  A good sign for a fairly new place.  I was intrigued as it is the only ramen restaurant that has a vegetarian option!!!    Good cause now my partner can come with me!  He liked it (had the red and one).  There's 2 you can select from.  It was rich from the white miso.  I think he was surprised by it's richness

I had the their ramen isshin...must be their speciality...the place is named after it!! I had the spicy version with the mortar and pestle to grind my own black sesame seeds.
It added a depth and dimension.  It had 2 slices of pork char sui and ground pork.  I would had preferred the pork belly.  I don't think the ground pork adds much to it.  no egg you have to add that in though scallions were included.

Pros:  vegetarian options, interesting appetizers, we had the takoyaki octopus.  They tasted ok they were not greasy but they weren't hot enough considering they are supposed to be deep fried.  So freshness was questionable to me.  They make their own mango dessert.  But we did opt out for black sesame ice cream which was very good.  Prices are reasonable.  Noodles mine were wavy and chewy with great texture and lots of them which I like.  

Cons:  I thought the soup and our takoyaki appetizer should had been hotter.  The soup could be eaten right away as the both was warm but not hot.

I know I'd go back especially since they have a veg option and I did like it.  And though the service was great.  I felt like I was in a fast food joint having pizza where they only heat up the pizza enough to take the cold off.  I constantly have to tell pizza joints to heat my pizza up hot..not lukewarm.  It was the same with the broth here and the takoyaki.  Soup is supposed to be hot!"}
{"text":"We'd gone a little ramen-crazy a couple of years ago, so haven't really been to a lot of new ones recently.

Have to say that Ramen Isshin might make us re-ignite that craze again.  Ramen is so straightforward, it's one of those things that's either good or not, and the stuff they churn out here is definitely good!

Options are plentiful, and broths are spot-on delicious.  A great place to come if you're looking for a nice warm bowl of comfort."}
{"text":"Officially my favourite ramen joint in Toronto! I had the Shoyu garlic and it was absolutely divine. They also have rice noodles which is great for gluten intolerant people. Great to dine alone or as a pair - groups will have to wait longer. The service was friendly and efficient and there was a constant flow of customers, even for an early dinner on a Wednesday night. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I got the tsukamen and accompanying close companion ordered the red dragon miso. Both were pretty good! However, I did feel that the broths were a little bit on the saltier side. The tsukamen came with a massive plate of thick wavy noodles, however I felt the pork slices were more on the thin side, but eggs were en pointe. 

The karaage on the other hand... is not worth, as you get four pieces for $6.80. It's pretty delicious with a very crispy exterior and juicy interior, but way too expensive for just four pieces. 

Overall, would come back to try other flavours - but maybe not the side dishes."}
{"text":"My favourite ramen spot in the city. There is normally a bit of a wait if you go with a group but it's worth it. Great vegan options and amazing, friendly service."}
{"text":"Very good ramen. I ordered the spicy veggie ramen which was perfectly cooked and the spice level was on point. Wait time is under 10 mins and you can tell locals love this place. We would definitely eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Favorite ramen spot in TO!

Good selection, generous hearty servings and fast, friendly service. Sides/appetizers are skimpily sized for the price. 

Always busy, especially during peak meal times."}
{"text":"ZOMGAD. MY 50TH REVIEW! :D

Anyway, I saw a friend check into Isshin Ramen on another competing local app that has points and badges and stuff and I thought \"why not try out Isshin Ramen\". So I did. Here's my review:

I am absolutely torn between each ramen joint that pops up. While the decor isn't quite as nice as say Kinton, Santouka or Raijin, I would say their ramen is among the best that Toronto has to offer. I mean outside of hopping on a plane and flying to Japan to get the most authentic experience, you'd be hard pressed to not be satisfied by the ramen and side plates that Isshin has to offer.

In terms of the dishes I've had - I had the takoyaki, which was absolutely scrumptious as an appetizer, the mentaiko don and the garlicky shoyu ramen which was a killer combination in terms of value for money.

They've really maintained the level of quality that you would expect from its predecessors (not by much).  If you're ever in the Little Italy area and having a hankering for slurping up some ramen to the last drop - Isshin Ramen is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Hi everyone, it's me back at it again with a high quality review. Sorry in advice for the lack of content cause Waterloo food sucks. Anyway I visited Isshin yesterday and wow, the ramen tasted the same as Kiu ramen. The place is pretty crowded so it is not a good place for anything serious. They have a lot of options but come on at the end of the day they all taste the same laugh out loud. Nothing special, a solid 3/5 tbh. If you want to experience what a 3/5 restaurant is like according to me, visit Ramen Isshin."}
{"text":"i am japanese.
the real delicious japanese ramen.
maybe it's delicious than japan has it.
i drank up soup."}
{"text":"Went to Ramen Isshin last week, with a party of six, who were seated in a cramped table meant for four. Not a problem, we just wanted to have a solid dinner together over some ramen, and have a good time.

I ordered a roasted garlic shoyu ramen, and it was alright. The small bowl came with a piece of nori floating in the middle, without much fanfare. It was a bit on the salty side, even though I love having really rich ramen broths, this lacked much of any other flavour other than salt. I asked to have corn added to my order, and would have asked if the thicker noodles were available instead of the thin ones that come default with the shoyu ramen, but given that the server didn't seem to understand my order for corn without my having to point at the photo of corn on the menu, decided not to push my luck.

I wish I tried anyway.

Never mind the lack of any substantial fixins (my pork belly was tiny and thin) or the poorly presented bowl of ramen.

However, the real kicker is, my friend had ordered an extra marinated egg to go with her ramen, and when her order came, received corn instead. She asked about where the egg was, and the server checked her order and said she'll get the egg and it was fine to keep the corn. We nodded at what we thought was a great gesture for having made the wrong order, only to never have the egg make an appearance. The server also managed to swing by with her order chit and show it to my friend, and explain that she'd be paying for corn instead of egg. Okay... that's fine, just wish she brought the egg as a gesture of good will anyway.

Whatever, we thought, let's just grab the bill and get moving, as we had all finished our ramen in short order. The bill came, and lo and behold, my friend was charged for both the egg and the corn. No problemo - we flagged down the server and explained that she was charging her for both instead of just the one she had received. 

What followed can only be described as a confused confrontation, as the server heard our story a few times, only to follow-up with \"But egg?\" in an accusatory tone. We asked for the manager, who stepped through the entire story, twice, and asked us repeatedly what we had done to that poor egg. After 20 minutes of sitting around watching several staff and managers converse about our situation, the manager had finally removed the item from the bill.

All of this, over a $1.50 marinated egg that never showed up.

You know what else isn't showing up? Me, to Ramen Isshin, from this day forward. 

The ramen is average at best, the service can be middling to poor, and the customer service is basically non-existent, as far as I am concerned. Giving you two stars for meh to decent food is the least I can do."}
{"text":"Me and some friends went here tonight. There was a 50 minute wait but we waited it out at the coffee place across the street... this restaurant was a bit crowded:) we all got the veggie miso ramen. (I'm a vegetarian and my two other friends don't like pork- which is in all their bowls). We all loved it! It was my friends' first time's eating ramen and I'm so glad this place was good so that they weren't turned off from the wonder of ramen forever! We were all amazed at the depth of flavors... especially for a vegetarian dish! This place fueled my love of ramen. :) awesome place"}
{"text":"Great lunch time deal! $11.75 for bowl of ramen, side and pop. You can choose between four different ramen (sesame, light shoyu, rich shoyu, or garlic oil). Sides are takoyaki, karaage, or dumplings. Definitely worth it!

I got the rich shoyu.. and boy, was it rich and tasty!! Really good portion. Came with half an egg and two big pieces of bbq pork. The broth was very creamy, rich and just the right amount of fat/oil. Very savoury but not too salty. The bamboo shoots helped balance the rich taste. Noodles had a good consistency. I am definitely going to reorder this!!!

My friend got the sesame ramen. It comes with sesame seeds in a mortar and pestle and you have to grind it up to release the oils. Her broth was lighter than mine but still very tasty. 

We both ordered karaage as our side. Nothing too memorable about the karaage. It came with two pieces. Not that crispy. 

The restaurant had a good amount of seating available. No line ups here when we came, which is a great plus. Service was friendly. 

Can't wait to come back. Will definitely recommend this place to all my ramen loving friends :)"}
{"text":"We were welcomed when we walked in (lots of yelling).  
There was a bit of a line up.  Waited about 15 minutes.  
The bathrooms were super clean which is nice to see. Even the toilet paper had the hotel like triangle folds.  Mouth wash is also supplied along with little cups.
The food was ok.  Noodles itself were tasty.  Seemed pretty fresh and a great texture (not overcooked).   The broth seemed thicker than other places (almost sauce like).  Distinct in it's flavours (example strong bamboo flavour). Must agree with C.F.'s comment, there isn't that much in terms of toppings, however, the menu does offer the ability to pay a bit more for extra items like egg, seaweed, corn etc...  
The downfall, I did feel a bit ill about 30 minutes after leaving the place.  So based on that, I doubt that I would come back.  
The staff were super nice (with big smiles) and helpful.  Very attentive and they ensured that water glasses were filled up.  The one waitress even rushed to open the door for us when we left.  Quite the nice touch.
Decor was nice but then again, it is a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is with this place. Over a hundred fifty reviews and 4.5 star average? I can see how this came to be if you 1. Like very, very little amount of meat and a whole lot of noodles or 2. You're an aspiring vegetarian. 

The taste isn't bad. I had the spicy miso ramen. The broth is good - a little on the oily side, but it is nowhere near spicy. In fact it was quite sweet. The noodles weren't bad. But after finishing the two paper-thin slices of chashu, there unfortunately isn't much else to look forward to in the ramen. 

Do yourself a favor and go to Kinton, Raijin or Santouka. For the same price you'll get a much better atmosphere and a bowl of ramen. 

Two stars for me here."}
{"text":"THE best miso ramen I've ever had!

I've never gone at a time of traffic, but I've seen the tables fill up while I'm there. The service is quick and very friendly. 
I usually get the regular miso ramen ($12.90) and I also add corn (~$2) to that. My partner gets the Red Dragon ramen ($15.90), which adds a bunch of chilies and spicy components too it. It isn't too spicy though. The miso broth is really flavourful and great while the corn adds a sweetness to it. They also add bits of fried pork, and a bunch of vegetables as well as the pork belly cha shu which makes the broth even more great!

I have had their white sesame ramen before and it was below par. Highly would recommend to always get their miso ramen!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night, 
it seemed calm for a Sunday night so service was much quicker. 
Ordered Spicy miso ramen and I ordered the garlic oil ramen with an extra egg.

I really enjoyed my ramen it had a delicious savoury taste to it, my BF enjoyed his too but he commented that he liked the garlic one more because it had a really nice roasted taste to it. We ordered Karage don on the side and of course it was really good. We're a big fan of the karage don and wished it came in a bigger size for when we didn't crave ramen. Glad that we didn't order two because we would not have been able to finish our ramen. Ramen was very filling and the service was much better since our first visit!

I suggest trying the Garlic oil ramen and the chicken karage don (so delicious)!"}
{"text":"Delicious ramen. Perfectly cooked noodles, great toppings. I had the ramen where you grind the black sesame, was delicious. Spoke with the owner and apparently the stock cooks for 20 hours. Great spot for a quick lunch/dinner. Excellent service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Personally, I was very disappointed by this place, but my partner LOVED it!! He couldn't get enough of the ramen that he ordered, but I just prefer plain ol' tonkotsu ramen. All of their ramen, though, was tonkotsu with miso in it, which I don't care for too much. We also got the Chashu Don and it was different but really good! My only complaint is someone on the staff had really bad body oder and everytime they walked by, which was quite a bit, I caught a whiff of it, which turned my stomach after a while and I didn't end up finishing my meal..."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was really nice. Good lighting. Seating arrangements was good. Washroom was clean. Staff are very friendly and greeted my friend and I as we walked in and walked out of the restaurant. 

Both my friend and I ordered the Red Dragon Ramen:
It's the Red Miso Ramen BUT on a whole other level folks:
Red Dragon Chilli sauce combines 15 different spices which isn't TOO spicy it gave me a good kick of delicious spiciness but I wasn't sweating, melt in your mouth pork belly cha shu, perfectly whole soft boiled savoury marinated egg and thick twisty noodles that absorbs the delicious broth. And omg there was peanuts as a garnish... it's weird but it was a nice topping! Gave the dish a crunch factor! 
And my friend order the karaage Don Buri bowl which I tried. It had bite sized karaage which was amazing! Easily in my top 3 favourite ramen bowls!!!!!! I will be back for more!!! 

P.S do not be afraid of the red dragon! It's amazing and I assure you it's not extremely spicy!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I haven't tried this place sooner, especially since it's so close to work. Ramen Isshin has been on my food radar since first trying related restaurant Kiu in Markham. It was also on my radar because it is one of a few ramen places in the GTA that serves tsukemen which I have been dreaming about since our trip to Japan earlier this year.

We were seated immediately when we walked in without reservation around 5pm on a Friday night. We ordered pork gyoza. Unlike most other places that serve pan fried gyoza (which I prefer), the pork gyoza here were deep fried. Being a dumpling fan, I still found the gyoza to be pretty flavourful. 

Hubby had miso ramen which had a surprisingly creamy and rich texture and flavour. The tsukemen was served boiling hot in a stone bowl which allowed me to enjoy hot soup even until my last bites of dipped noodles. The broth was rich and coated the thick chewy delicious noodles nicely. The broth for the most part wasn't overly salty (although became saltier towards the end of my meal for some reason). Both bowls of soup came with soft boiled halves of eggs and two pieces of lean pork. 

This place is pretty legit and I would say that their tsukemen is the closest to the flavour and texture of tsukemen I had in Japan. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Kiu ramen started here and that was the only reason I was ok with trekking all the way here.

When we went, place was packed. Ventilation was definitely stuffy and we got seated beside the kitchen. If I wasn't so hungry, I would have waited for another table

Menu was generally the same as Kiu but their garlic base was definitely stronger and better, which is why I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 3.

Service was eh. It's typical of a fast food place, which I assume all ramen places to be so I had no expectations. I would come here again if I were nearby.

Taste was a solid 4/5. Egg was amazing."}
{"text":"I was here for second time (I ordered Red Dragon for first time was ok) but today I ordered Garlic shio ramen was so great I ever had. I will be back again and again for sure, here is GEM  best ramen spot in downtown Toronto. Next time visit, I will try more different kinds of soup. 

Oishi !!"}
{"text":"????? !!!!

Damn, is this place ever good! This is one of the few ramen places that has actually lived up to the hype, and I'm all about it! Definitely came to check this place out after hearing from many people that they have vegan friendly options and yes indeed they did! More than one too. Oh god, I've missed ramen.

Service is really efficient and friendly; it's a small restaurant but they definitely utilize the space well because they fit a lot of tables and seating in there without it looking super packed. The turnover rate is also fast (I mean, how fast does it take you to finish a bowl of ramen) so even if there's a line, it's worth the wait.. can't say the same for sansotei... Also, it's not too loud so you can definitely have a good conversation while slurping up amazing ramen.

The spicy veggie miso ramen was HELLA DELICIOUS. It's a tad bit oily, but the spice level was just right and it was so creamy, you'd think they snuck some pork shiz in there. The soy-based topping also tasted like beef, which was surprising. It was so damn good, you would be surprised it was vegan. My dining partner had the spicy pork ramen?? I think?? & that looked super satisfying as well. It was both our first times there, and I was so happy he chose this place for us to try because it was just so. damn. delicious. & satisfied both an ominvore and a plant-based carbivore. (seriously, carbs can marry me right now.) 

I'll definitely be back to slurp up some delicious noodles! 
???????????"}
{"text":"Definitely my top ramen place in Toronto now 

I ordered the Miso Ramen and soft boiled egg and my friend ordered a Black Sesame Tan Tan Ramen. 

The Miso soup base got mixed reviews. I loved it but my friend said it is too sweet to his liking. He preferred his Tan Tan Ramen that was more on the savoury side. 

The egg was cooked perfectly. I will recommend you to put the egg on top of your ramen (don't drown it) for a while before you eat it if you don't like to eat cold eggs. 

Both of our ramen came with thick noodles, if you order the Shoyu ramen I think they comes with thin noodles. 

For me, I think just the noodles itself is worth another visit to Ramen Isshin. It had the right chewiness (& doesn't get soggy half-way eating) plus it tasted authentic. I can't tell you how many times I got disappointed by soft ramen"}
{"text":"This place is the same as it was when I went almost 3 years ago. I am glad to say they kept it consistent and still bring out quality ramen.

I went on a Friday afternoon and they were still busy, it only died down when I settled to eat which is around 3pm. The stay was very friendly and attentive, the tables were always kept tidy and cleaned right away whenever a customer leaves. The ramen station at the front greets you when u come in and come out. Like those izakayas. It can get loud so when u want to have a long dinner or lunch conversation,this ain't the place because it can get busy.

I ordered miso ramen because I wanted a less stronger broth than tonkatsu or shio. The noodles were not mushy, broth was miso-ey and the pork was tender. I also ordered an egg with it which is not that runny but it was nicely seasoned. I love their ramen menu and I would love to come back here whenever I'm around UofT area!!"}
{"text":"As a ramen newb, I jumped at the chance to try this place when a friend invited me (thanks Ray!).

I had only tried ramen once before in my life but wanted to know all about this noodle-y dish having watched Mind of a Chef on Netflix with David Chang recently.

We tried three different ramens, the newest being shoyu kotteri tsukemen, black tan tan, and spicy red miso.

All three ramen were delish. The Tsukemen ramen had a hot fish based broth with cold noodles and veggies on the side. I liked taking the noodles and dipping them into the broth - Yum! Spicy red miso was also yummy, I enjoyed the kick! My fave was the black tan tan ramen. They give you black sesame seeds to grind up and put into the broth - so so good!

Service here was very friendly and quick! I found eating ramen to be a bit messy (that's probably just a me thing lol) so next time I won't rock my white shirt ;)

I will be back to try other ramens soon!!"}
{"text":"My ABSOLUTE favourite place for Ramen in Toronto. Isshin just seems to do every type of ramen so right. There's a little line up when you go at peak time but its definitely worth the wait!

My personal favourites are their tsukemen, all of their miso, all of their shio, basically everything on the menu!! I have yet to get anything that I didn't like. Note that their miso is slightly sweet and a bit different to all the other ramen places, worth giving it a try once."}
{"text":"This place is super!! I really enjoyed the ramen here and definitely one of the better places in Toronto. I tried the black sesame tan tan noodles and the Red Dragon miso ramen. They were both really good although I was a little bit disappointed with the spicyness of the red dragon miso. I was expecting it to be super spicy and flavourful from the description and it was only mild. Could use some more kick to it!! The black sesame was interesting in that you can have grind the black sesame before mixing it in the dish. Overall, nice staff and good ramen!"}
{"text":"Walked by the newly opened Assembly on a Saturday afternoon for a bite to eat. So many choices to try! 

Being a cold winter day we immediately went for a warm bowl of Ramen from Isshin. We had the Black Sesame Tan Tan with a side of Gyoza. Soup base was delicious and just right in saltiness and heat. Noodles were firm and chewy. Gyoza was good too. All in all a nice meal. Will return for more."}
{"text":"I've been to most ramen shops in Toronto. For the first time, I went to Isshin tonight. We ordered red miso ramen with karaage don combo plus extra noodle to share. It came up to be around $18. Isshin has just tonight officially become my favourite ramen shop in town. It's the most comparable to the ones in Japan and even better. Will be coming back for sure. :)"}
{"text":"I arrived at Ramen Isshin on a cold friday night.  It seemed like a great night for hot noodles since it was cold outside, there was a bit of a line at the restaurant and I was hungry - a great combination for enjoying a hot bowl of ramen.  I entered Ramen Isshin with moderately high expectations, and left the restaurant bitterly disappointed. 

I'm looking for something positive to say about this place, but very little good stuff mind and a lot of bad stuff comes to mind as I write this piece.

The good: Presentation of Ramen was nice. The takoyaki side dish was good.

The bad: Seating was tight and cramped. Food was bad. Prices were expensive.  Portions were average, on the small-ish side. Service was bad. 

I ordered a shouyu ramen, the others in our group ordered one miso ramen and two sesame ramen.  We also added one side order of takoyaki.  The takoyaki was delicious and the presentation of the ramen was well done.  However, all of us agreed that the ramen was way too salty!  It was like they took the noodle broth and dumped a bucket of salt into it.  Eww.

On this occasion, we had a special request: one of my friends' phone was running out of battery and we noticed that they had a charger.  When we asked if we could charge the phone for a few minutes, they declined to help us out.  No going above and beyond here.

To add to the lousy service they forgot to ask us if we want to split our bill and added gratuity (15%) to our bill.  Since we were in a group and our bill came together, we split the bill ourselves and there were some coins at the end adding up to the total.  When the server came to collect our bill, she rudely counted every penny right in front of us. 

Bad food. Terrible service.  I do not recommend this place and don't plan to come back.

Rating: 1.1 / 5.0"}
{"text":"Been meaning to check out this spot for lunch but have always been daunted by the thought of long line ups during work week.  Finally had a chance to try it out on a Sunday off hours at 4pm.  No lines up Yay!  Staff very friendly and polite.  

Food:  Ordered Asari Light, Garlicky Shoyu Ramen, Kaarage Don and Tako Yaki.  Right away they give you ice water awesome need that with hot soup!  Didn't take long to get our tako yaki.  Piping hot be her careful!  Burnt my tongue but that's my fault for being too excited!  Then ramen.  The broth was amazing very rich and just the right amount of salt.  Then Kaarage.  This one probably could've used a little bit more flavour.  Overall experience was excellent.  So far best broth compared to other ramen houses like Kenzo, Kinton, Ajisen and Touhenboku.  

This must've left us with a great memory because I ended up craving it 4 days later and ordered delivery.. btw they deliver thru doordash.  Here's the topper, I asked for extra broth on the order option.  I called them as it wasn't an option on the extra.  I was willing to pay extra.  The staff on the phone didn't quite understand me I think.  It was fine.  However, when my delivery arrived to my surprise there's my extra container of broth!  Fyi, I ordered the same as last visit minus the Asari.  I'm a pretty tiny person but managed to finish everything else because it was so good.  Anyway, thank you for the experience.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Ramens I ever had, and I include the month I spent in Japan.
Always good, highly recommended."}
{"text":"My husband and I just arrived and were feeling a little jet lagged ...so good ramen sounded like the perfect thing to make our world better. 

Oh my goodness ramen Isshin hit the spot!! 

We tried the black sesame tantan men, and the spicy miso ramen (with extra egg because I looove eggs in my ramen.) They were both simply gorgeous, with flavourful broth and perfect al dente noodles. My husband thought the tantan men was the best ramen he's had outside of Japan! 

Thank you Canadian yelpers!! This was the first thing I ate in Toronto, and it has convinced me that you are spoiled for yummy food here. (^^)"}
{"text":"I have had the red spicy miso noodles. 
Was not as good as I was anticipating. 
But after all the service and environment As well as everything else was fairly neat!!
Definitely recommend!
Will try some more and see."}
{"text":"Got take-out ramen (given the long wait for a table) and was barely able to make it to a bench across the street before I had to sit down and devour it. It was AMAZING - the spicy vegetarian ramen had just the right amount of salt, spice, umami, and just all-round flavour. It was the kind of meal where you actually feel heartbroken that you're full because you would totally walk right back and get another of the same dish. Seriously, I can't express how good this place is for veggie ramen. I'll be coming back again and again (and maybe even sit at a table next time)"}
{"text":"Food was amazing...even though there were no shrimp option...service was great...cant wait t'il they obtain their liquor licence!"}
{"text":"I must admit that I have never had *authentic* ramen prior to my experience at Ramen Isshin. I was immensely impressed by the rich broth of the Veggie Shoyu Ramen. It was very hearty and filling. (My vegan dish is the one on the further side. My friend ordered ramen with beef and a hard-boiled egg on the side.) 

The prices are fantastic for the tremendous helpings you get with each order. My friend and I were impressed with the service especially in light of how busy the restaurant was. 

It was kind of a tight seating arrangement, we ended up sitting next to a couple instead of getting our own private seat. Our warm and content bellies made this \"con\" melt away from our thoughts."}
{"text":"Great great Ramen. Awesome atmosphere, good beer and fun times. Spicy Red Miso ramen was a great choice. Will be coming back to try more!"}
{"text":"I don't have refined taste in ramen. I think it all tastes the same. I had the red miso ramen here and did I enjoy it? Yes. Did I think there was anything that I got here that I couldn't have gotten at Kinton or Sansotei? I'm entirely not sure.

The reason for my five-star review was due to the absurd amount of friendliness we received from the staff at Isshin. The service was insanely good, with friendly (welcome) chatter from the servers and quick refills of tea/cold water.

All other ramen shops in Toronto - take note! Isshin has raised the bar for service in your field."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. I don't know why I don't prefer it to some other ramen places in the city. A bit too salty and I don't think the noodles are chewy enough I guess? Got the roasted garlic shoyu. Got the chili oil on the side but it was not spicy."}
{"text":"Depending on your preference, I say that this might be my last place to dine in provided if I didn't have any access to my usual ramen places. 

Staff is awesome for sure. I genuinely think the people who work here are more welcoming than any other place I went.  

Food wise? its okay...lacks a certain kick to it when it came to spicy ramen in my opinion. Menu isn't extensive unless they changed it as am writing this?

Overall, its a nice place to bring friends and family for a casual ramen time for sure. Mind you, it can get crowded at times."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here right as they opened on a weekday for lunch, but they were ready right away. 

We each ordered a ramen, a side dish, and a drink as part of their lunch combo. The ramen soup-base was a little saltier than I'd prefer, but the toppings were very nicely done, especially the egg! I did tell them to leave off the green onions, but they forgot that, which was a little disappointing, considering they had no other orders then. The Karaage fried chicken and takoyaki balls were delicious and really nice to split between friends actually. 

Price-wise, it was $11.75 for the combo, which is a little higher than most lunches at ramen joints, but they include a side dish and drink along with it, so I suppose it balances out a little more.

Overall, a good ramen restaurant, but there are others nearby that might be worth checking out first too."}
{"text":"I am a huge ramen fan and ramen isshin is now definitely one of my favourite ramen spots. Soupy noodles cravings creep up on the weekly. 
Came here on a Thursday night and only had to wait 10 mins.

The miso ramen was delicious. Noodle consistency was perfectly chewy, pork was tender and I liked that it came with lots of bean sprouts (makes my meal feel healthy with more veggies haha) The portions are larger than other ramen places but the broth was flavourful but too salty to drink and that's why isshin lost a star for me. 

Also, you're not cramped like sardines here. Personal space for the win isshin!"}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night around 6:30 for a table of 4 and there were a few tables available so we didn't have to wait. However, about 30 minutes later, a short line started to form. 

I ordered the Shoyu Kotteri Tsukemen and it was my first time trying a dipping ramen and it was really delicious! I got the warm noodles, which was recommended by the waiter. The noodles had the perfect chewiness to it and the broth came in a very hot stone bowl. The soup base was pretty salty, but I guess that's the point of dipping noodles - it's not meant to be fully ubmerged into the soup for every portion you dip in.

I would definitely come back to try their other ramen offerings!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch a few weeks back. Their red spicy miso ramen is a must order. That broth is absolutely out of this world!! Their gyoza and takoyaki were average. We also ordered the white sesame shio ramen. It was ok - soup was quite bland in comparison to the red spicy miso ramen. I will definitely be back to try the other ramens."}
{"text":"Came here mid-week expecting ultimately not much (friend suggested the place) as it is a bit outside of the way and from outside it doesn't look like much. However, once in, got treated to a very tasty ramen (as per Yelp tips, spicy red is the way to go, or the non-spicy version for non-spicy fans) and ultimately a pleasant decor (though really, the food was enough to make up for it)."}
{"text":"**~THE GOOD~**

Finally a Ramen Isshin closer to work! Located inside Assembly Chef's Hall, a go-to spot when you're craving ramen for lunch.  Plus no lineups if you go before noon and lots of seats available compared to the small & cramped Little Italy location.

**~THE BAD~**

Menu is limited and they don't offer the Red Miso Ramen here. During my visit I opted for the classic Kotteri Shoyu Ramen ($14+tax).  I was surprised by how small the serving was considering I paid $2 more than what they charge in the other location. I'm not a fast eater but I finished the soup in 5 mins.  There was more broth than noodles, the single egg although golden yellow was overcooked and the pork belly is smaller and thinner.  Maybe if I haven't eaten in their other location I wouldn't make these comparisons.  It just irks me when I pay for deceptively expensive food and get tiny portions.  Makes you think twice about returning here albeit close proximity to work."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I am from la and being Toronto during the winter was such an experience. Of course when it's that cold all you want is comfort food and this ramen spot was amazing!!! Really made my trip!"}
{"text":"There's less emphasis on interior design here than in other ramen eateries in the heart of Toronto. Ramen Isshin nonetheless draws a good punch and a crowd.

The red miso ramen recommended by many fellow yelpers, comes in regular ($11.80) and spicy ($12.80) choices. Either way, it is a smorgasbord of bloody hell well balanced flavours and textures that hits the friggin spot straight out of a big bowl. Don't deny it, for the tonkotsu (pork bone) based broth smacks you down with a mix of creaminess, sweetness and savoury goodness; the noodles are chewy, thick and curly as damn; the bean sprouts and other stuff bring a good package of crunch, fresh greens and protein. The spicy red miso could be a bit more hot (it's fine for those who want a bit of heat with their bowl), so either ask for extra spicy, or I guess try the Red Dragon ($14.80), which promises to turn up their spicy red miso to 11.

The sesame series are the ones that give you sesame seeds in a mortar and pestle set to crush on your own. But it's generally a good-ass idea to pay attention to the ingredients of whatever you're deciding on what to eat, as ramen purists will not appreciate some bowls not coming with nori (seaweed sheets) and/or an egg, items that can be included for around $1 extra per.

It was great, it was fun, it warms you up in a chilly-ass day. The staff were wonderful like you'd expect with a popular Japanese restaurant in Toronto, even if there's a habit of missing things with our order, which they are quick to recitfy, no fuss.

{"text":"This is my go to place for Ramen. Might have something to do with it being down the street from where I work but there are other places to choose from nearby as well, and I choose this place.

Staff is friendly, and nice. The food is tasty and vibe is good for group of friends or small company lunch."}
{"text":"this is probably one of the best ramen in Toronto. The lunch special is very cheap and good."}
{"text":"I'm a bit disappointed because I came in after reading several reviews and had high expectations. Though, even if I had no expectations, I think I still would've been disappointed.

Other reviewers had stated:
- service is fast and efficient (It wasn't. After submitting our order, it took 25 minutes to bring out our ramen. We also timed the table next to us to see how long their noodles took, also 25 minutes.

- soup base is the best (We found our soup base too salty)

- portions are generous and good value (we found it to be the opposite. Both our ramen portions were average size and the MEAT was just 2 thin and tiny slices per bowl. The meat portion was far below average compared to other ramen houses) - personally, this was the final blow.

- The karaage don add-on was decent, but the price was $4.80... I suppose the price of it went up from $3.9 over the past few months.

I'm not sure if Ramen Isshin wants to turn higher profits by charging more and skimping out on meat, but I feel like I've missed the bus on when this restaurant was of \"Exceptional value\"

Here are a few positive points:

- service was friendly
- decor was very nice
- some ramen orders come with seeds on the side for you to crush; a fun little gimmick. 
- it's at Bathurst & College, highly accessible"}
{"text":"This is the best ramen place in Toronto. Red miso!!! Aaah! The flavours. Also, I am not vegetarian, but they have quite a few veggie/vegan options. More selection than most places. Seriously though, this place is to die for. I just wish it had more seating."}
{"text":"Stopped by here based on a friend's suggestion and never looked back! The ramen was a stand out and loved the vibe of the restaurant. A must go."}
{"text":"We ordered the shiyo, spicy and red miso ramen. 

The shiyo ramen broth has a very nice aroma to it. Not too salty and very light. Wasn't a fan of the half egg because it tasted very bland. The yolk had the wrong texture. The fun part of this bowl was that we had a mortar and pestle to grind the sesame. 

The spicy black tan tan ramen wasn't spicy but had a good flavor to it. The ramen had a good texture and had a lot of flavor. The pork belly was a little dry and you only get two lean pieces. 

The red miso had a kick of rich pork flavor in it. It had a lot of ingredients in the soup that you can scoop up and eat. This ramen had a lot more than the shiyo and the black tan tan. 

If you're looking to get full, don't get the shiyo and black tan tan. Its really small. But if you're looking for a flavorful bowl of ramen, I'd pick any thing off the menu. The flavors are definitely there! Would come here again to try another ramen next time. Service was absolutely amazing as well! All smiles and welcomed."}
{"text":"I came here a year ago and I remember getting the white shio ramen but I did not like it much. I decided to give this joint another try and I'm glad I did. 

Service was great. There are plenty of servers and they are attentive.

This time I ordered the black tan tan and my friend got the spicy miso. The black tan tan broth was very different and I enjoyed it. It tastes really creamy and nutty. It's not your usual ramen broth! It is very unique. Adding the additional sesame makes the broth more bold. I tried my friends spicy miso and I loved that broth even more. It wasn't thick or oily. Very creamy and it had a bold flavor. I love the broth here. For the meat, I wished they more generous with it. I feel like the ramen lacks in toppings. 

Overall I'll definitely come back. Ramen Isshin serves some good ramen."}

{"text":"I was with my Dad downtown and decided to go eat some Japanese Ramen. The place wasn't big, and it had a nice lay out and design. We went during a less busy time which was great. My dad ordered Black Sesame tan tan noodle. I ordered Kotteri Rich Shoyu Ramen. We also ordered tako yaki and chicken karaage don. I was hooked on the tako yaki, they made it fresh because it was VERY HOT when I bite into it. The Ramen was better than most Ramen I have eaten before. It was very yummy and I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"OVERRATED. I have lived in Japan and there are some good ramen places in Toronto, but Ramen Isshin is def not one. I have been several times, but it has been always toooooo salty. I don't understand its high rating (4.5??? seriously???)."}
{"text":"I came here around 2pm on a Friday and surprisingly there were plenty of space unlike the other ramen restaurants like Kinton and Sansotei. The service was good and food arrived promptly. Tried the Red miso ramen and also tried asking if they could exchange onions, green onions, and chives for another topping but they weren't willing- acceptable; ended up asking them to remove it. Also tried the takoyaki which was really good though I wish it came in six pieces instead of five for sharing. The ramen broth and noodles were amazing though pricier than their other ramens because of the load of ingredients. It wasn't as spicy as I thought either (less than spicy tantan at Santosei). Unfortunately, it didn't come with an egg and I had one ordered but it was cold since it came on the side. Their black seasame ice cream was presented beautifully and very creamy."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place so finally decided to try it out. I came on a Friday night at around 7 pm and it was already packed. The space is quite small so not many tables. At first I was told it was going to be around a 30 mins wait but needs being closer to 50 minutes. I would suggest bringing a snack with you to survive the wait. 
The menu has quite a few options. I ordered their most popular menu item which was the spicy miso. The wait was longer than anticipated, the waiter explained they were making another batch of noodles. At this point, my friend and I were beyond hungry. The portions were decent and enough for one person but you could ask for more noodles for an extra $1.8. I liked the texture of the noodles and the broth wasn't too salty which I find to be common at other ramen places I've been to. It wasn't spicy so just a warning for any avid spice lovers out there. I may have inflated my rating slightly because I was so hungry but I would come back to try the tsukemen ramen or their more creamy broths. They do have vegan options where they use kale egg free noodles. My friend who ordered the veggie spicy miso said it was good. The price is on the higher end, averaging about $15+ for a bowl (more if you order toppings). 
Next time I'll be sure to come at a different time to avoid the long line ups."}
{"text":"After walking 23 minutes in the cold to eat at this place, my expectations were high. From the moment we walked in I think every single staff member greeted us. We were seated immediately and asked what we wanted to drink. I ordered the Japanese beer that stars with an A (forgot). It's a light beer and we both enjoyed it very much. The reason my partner & I came here to eat is because we are both vegetarians and they have the most veggie ramen options out of all the other places whose menu I looked at. My partner ordered the vegetarian miso ramen soup with vegan noodles & I ordered the spicy vegetarian miso ramen soup w/ thick noodles. Both of the soups were amazing. The noodles were fantastic and the flavors were amazing. My partner ordered a 2nd serving of the vegan noodles. For dessert we ordered green tea ice cream and it was fantastic as well. This place is full of flavors. The entire staff said goodbye. Amazing experience"}
{"text":"My friends and I came on a Friday evening at around 620 and we got seated at around 7. The servers were really nice and asked if we wanted any refreshments while waiting. 

We decided to order the seafood cake, spicy miso, regular miso and veggie shoyu. The miso has a very strong, sweet taste and I would recommend it to anyone who really likes miso. The noodles are nice and firm and the meat slices were thin and flavorful. The cake is REALLY good! It can easily be split with four people and the portion is big enough that your portions aren't meager.  

We also got the seasame and green tea mocha, which tasted great. The service was very attentive and constantly checked back to make sure we were doing OK. I really liked my visit here and I'm eager to try their infamous karaage next time!!"}
{"text":"Haven't tried their storefront location, but was with some friends at the Assembly Chef Hall and decided to try a bowl of their ramen (Kotteri Shoyu). The soup is fairly oily but the ramen itself, along with the toppings, were pretty tasty. Price-wise, it's a bit more on the expensive side of things, but I guess it kind of makes sense since they're in the financial district and inside a pretty upscale food court."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen, and four vegetarian options! Nice to have more than one veggie friendly choice! Service was friendly and attentive but not overly so. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of the better ramen places, and one of my faves. The broths here are a step above, very rich and savory, and I love their noodles - the texture is excellent, never over or under cooked, just right. Try the spicy miso ramen, and be advised - this place gets packed, there is almost always a lineup at prime times. It's a great spot for a late dinner, after the rush."}
{"text":"Ramen is delicious! The place is not packed as expected. No waiting line, which is good. Try to ask the waitresses for the differences between ramen if it's your first time. I got the Roasted Garlic Shoyu Ramen today and it didn't let me down. :)"}
{"text":"After trying almost all the ramen places in Toronto these years, Isshin Ramen in this location is not one of the best. 

Taste - 4/5
Service - No service , this is inside a fancy foodcourt
Portion - 3/5. The price is the same as any other ramen place, but with a smaller portion.
Wait time - 2/5. The lineup was long, and it moves slowly. Given that it's in a food court with many people rushing to get lunch, they should figure out a more efficient way to reduce the wait time.

I tried their white sesame shio ramen, it is tasty and not too salty. My friend tried the black sesame tan tan ramen, it adds a bit of spicy taste to the soup, and it does not come with eggs. 

Overall the experience was okay, may try it again next time when it was less crowded."}
{"text":"Fantastic place that can be easily missed when walking though college street. 

I had their Spicy Miso ramen this visit and it was fantastic. Had a nice kick of spice compared to other ramen locations which is great for me. The noodles were nice and firm. The toppings were pretty good, the cha siu being thin and tender and while nice, weren't the best I've had. There were a bit too much bean sprouts for my liking. I've tried their side dishes on other visits and they're incredible, maybe even better than the ramen itself! The karaage fried chicken was nice and crispy while also being super moist and juicy on the inside. Along with the mayo and lemon they provide, it was awesome. The takoyaki balls were pretty delicious as well. The gyoza though... oh man I think they were the best gyoza's I've had between Toronto's ramen locations. Nice and crispy while having a great filling packed with flavour. 

I had their Spicy Black Sesame Tan Tan Noodle ramen my first visit and it was pretty great as well, there's a reason they recommend it. They give you a mortar and pestle with it to grind your own sesame seeds which is pretty awesome.

Overall, one of my top ramen places in Toronto, if you're in the area and craving ramen, definitely go."}
{"text":"Have to update this review as I came back recently to try Ramen Isshin again seeing all the good reviews. I simply don't know why I had such a poor experience on my first time! The ramen I had today was amazing, salty rich soup with perfect noodles and super tender pork. I got the White Sesame Ramen which also comes with some white sesame seeds and a little grinder so you can grind them yourself. Neat idea. The gyoza dumplings were nicely fried and the chicken karage was pretty good as well. Definitely one of my favourite ramen places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Beautiful ramen.  The noodles were perfect, the best I've had.  The soup was rich and flavorful.  My only gripe is the way they dressed the toppings.  Everything was chopped into fine threads, which caused the taste of some of the toppings to get lost in the soup and other ingredients.  I loved the kaedama.  For $1.50, the portion of extra noodle is huge, probably more than what was there originally.  Loved it.  Plus the $5 Asahi (choose from dark or lager).

I feel like Toronto is reaching Peak Ramen.  If you can get such good ramen for $12 total, which is the same as the cost of ramen in Tokyo, I don't think there is much more room for improvement."}
{"text":"Best ramen in the entire world friendly staff. Long wait. But definitely worth it !! Try the vegetarian r d miso with the chilli oil ... life changing !"}
{"text":"Yum!! We LOVE this place! It's really the only shop in the city I've found with AMAZING Vegetarian ramen! The spicy red miso is delicious and all. Veg. You can also actually get the vegan noodles, which are egg free if you are vegan. The staff here as SO nice, funny, & attentive. Most recently we were there on Friday of Halloween weekend and it was decorated and all the staff were in costume. So fun! My husband loves everything they have and usually tried something new, he even enjoys their fried chicken and on that note a bit hard to please haha. A great spot for both veg & no veg alike! The prices are fair and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Garlicky delicious ramen on college street. The flavours are not as flavourful or deep as Santouka Hokkaido but the portions are bigger and in the college Bathurst area probably the best ramen around."}
{"text":"This ramen place is not bad , came on a early night weekday , service was on point . Everyone was really nice , and really enjoyed the jelly sake ! Karage was so good too !!! Ramen soup was too salty for me , still good tho . Wouldn't recommend it to thoose trying to cut down on salt tho ahhaha"}
{"text":"I went there on a icy Sunday at around 1 pm.  There was no line up.  I got the White sesame Shio ramen.  The ramen comes with a small bowl with white sesame seeds for grinding.  So you grid it yourself and put how much flavor you want.  The soup base was excellent neither too thick or thin.  The ramen has cha shu, half soft egg, wood fungus & bamboo shoots.  Excellent flavour.  

The restaurant is not that big.  Mostly authentic Japanese staff with good service.  Will come back again to try the other ramen.  One of my top ramen places in Toronto!

For desert, I had the black sesame ice cream. They put two blueberries on top.  If you like a burnt sesame taste this is for you."}
{"text":"By far the most plainly decorated ramen restaurant, but the food was good. 

Karaage - 3 large pieces of crispy, juicy chicken. I really liked this even without the mayo! Hint of spice & black sesame in the breading 

White Sesame Shio 
- grind your own sesame provides a bit of fun, a bit of flavor in the first bite but otherwise not much sesame flavor
- thin, firm noodles - good. to me, they taste the same as the thick ones in the Black Sesame Tan Tan 
- half a soft-boiled egg was okay, could be softer with more flavor 
- cha siu - thin and tender, good mix of fat
- broth was relatively light, creamy, smooth, like  a lighter version of tonkotsu. Despite it being sea salt, I didn't find it salty. 

Black Sesame Tan Tan - broth was bold in meat flavor, saltier, less toppings (no egg)

Green Tea $1 - did not have any taste..... 

Overall: Ramen was good,  relatively light broth, but sesame flavor was slightly underwhelming;. Karaage was my favorite!"}
{"text":"Ok, my last 3 reviews have been ramen reviews.  I'm really into this ramen thing lately lol.

Came here last night (a Tuesday) for early birthday celebrations! The place was poppin and there was a small line of patrons waiting for a table.  When we walked in someone immediately came over to us to put our name down.  She informed us the wait would be about 20 minutes.  Ok cool.  20 minutes is an eternity when you're hangry.  Luckily, she was pretty much on the ball.  The wait was about 15-20 mins.  We were seated at a corner table in the back, which is honestly the best seat in the house IMO.  

We ordered the chicken karaage to start, a spicy red miso and 2 roasted garlic shoyu's.  One of the garlic shoyu's was for me, cuz duh, I'm all over that garlic oil now.  Food came out fairly quick.  The chicken was piping hot and delicious and that mayo was the cherry on top.  You only get 4 pieces which is kinda stingy but *shrug.  The garlic shoyu was not bad at all.  Better than Kenzo but not as good as Sansotei.  Portions were just right.  I wasn't overly full or still hungry after.  I was pretty satisfied with the garlic flavour in the broth.  The pork was just whatever. What DID blow my mind, was the spicy red miso.  The broth was ammmazing.  It was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy.  Defs not overly spicy to the point where you can't enjoy your meal.  It was right on.  The noodles in the spicy red miso were a little on the thicker side.

Our server was very kind and sweet.  He made sure we were ok throughout the night and was very helpful when we asked him questions about the dishes.  Overall a great experience.  I would defs recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Could this be the best ramen I've ever had? That's what I said when I was dining here a few nights ago. I'm not the biggest ramen fan, but my coworker is. We went here one night and I was about to order the spicy miso ramen like I usually do at ramen joints. But the pric made me switch to a different type of ramen. I don't even know what it was called. But like I said, it was the best ramen of my life. The waitress said they all like this type as well.

Super cute place and super friendly staff. I'd go back in a heartbeat. Just talking about it is making me want some ramen, and I just finished a french toast for brunch!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I have pretty bad food allergies. The menu offered information about common allergens which was extremely helpful. I never had real Ramen before the because I was always nervous about the confusion of ingredients and possibly language barriers. The staff was very attentive and informative. At one point I was about to try some of what thought was soy sauce and the waitress noticed and ran over to my table and informed me that it had my allergen in it."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Toronto and we love the food choices here. Our favorite is Ramen Isshin! The Black Tan Tan Ramen was packed with flavor. The sesame seeds added great texture and flavor and the noodles were cooked perfectly. I loved the pork belly and other additions as well. But,  the star of the show is the broth. It is pork based, seasoned well,  and complements the Ramen perfectly. I will definitely be back when we return to thus cool city!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best ramen joint in Toronto!!! Their broths are incredibly flavourful, and often have both a fresh seafood and rich tonkotsu depth to it. As an avid noodle fanatic, its really the noodles that take the cake for me. If you're a fan of aldente chewy noodles, ask for the thick tseukemen noodles. My only complaint is that there is always a long wait around peak hours and  a few servers don't speak English very well, so we've had them misunderstand us before. The food however, is consistently outstanding. 

Favourite Ramens:

1. Red Dragon Miso Ramen - For those who love spicy food! Not overwhelmingly hot at all, but then again my spice tolerance is pretty great 
2. Shoyu Kotteri Tseukemen -  If you love a salty broth that packs a ton of flavour this is for you! Portions are BIG and noodles are extra thick and chewy (perfect for dipping)!"}
{"text":"This is actually not a restaurant.  This is only a stand in a fancy food court. The place is crowded,  a little noisy and cold, and the seats are not comfortable.  The soup was not that good, nothing exceptional,  a little greasy."}
{"text":"I've been trying out ramen places all over the city and this is among my favorites. The black tan tan noodles and the spicy red miso are both excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen. I had the garlic shoyu ramen and the broth was out of this world. The pork melted in my mouth and the noodles were cooked perfectly. I almost came back for dinner!

The only thing I found to be disappointing was that there was a lunchtime Yelp check-in offer (still shows) which the restaurant did not let me use which felt a little misleading.  I wish the server had checked with a manager before telling me I couldn't use the coupon. 

To anyone in the area, if you haven't been and you love ramen, I would recommend coming here when it first opens to avoid the potential long wait, but if you have to wait, it's worth it! I will be back next time I'm in Toronto, without a doubt."}
{"text":"This review is based on one visit, one bowl of ramen. It was good, with a rich tasting broth and some pork belly. All the ingredients played nicely together, well balanced.

It's a little pricey compared to other ramen places I've been to but on par for Assembly Chef's Hall. I may have to visit their main restaurant if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is one of the many stalls in the Chef's Assembly Hall food court. I would recommend coming with friends and holding down a table before exploring your options since it does get busy during meal hours.

Strangely, our whole table ended up getting different ramens from Isshin. They are efficient with filling orders and a fast 5 minute wait is rewarded with a hot steaming bowl of ramen. The noodles are perfectly cooked and the broth is creamy, hot and delicious. I had the black garlic flavor, so it came with two pieces of thin meat and a half of a golden yellow soft-boiled egg. The portion is on the small side, as I finished my bowl (drank most of the soup) but was still a little hungry afterwards. Unfortunately, I have to take a star off because my bowl had little pieces of hard black specks in it (from the black garlic?). I had to spit them out as I went along, which ruined an otherwise great meal."}
{"text":"The waiter mixed up our order, then took forever to figure out how to punch in the cost of our bill into the machine. It was a weird service situation, but we left a good tip and they gave us a happy goodbye cheer.

The noodles were great. It is refreshing from the other ramen places in the area because we love the small dishes-- the takoyaki is particularly delicious.

The seasame shio ramen is great."}
{"text":"Had the chance to try their vegetarian red miso ramen yesterday. 

It was pretty tasty, but it was room temperature by the time we took our first bite... I swear we only spent 2-3 minutes deciding on a spot to sit, so that was really disappointing.

Also, is ramen usually this expensive?! $16 before tax, yeesh."}
{"text":"Tasty and delicious and the service is prompt and good. The shoyu ramen is so yummy. This place only just opened and doesn't have a liquor licence yet, but they have applied for one. Just be prepared: S-A-L-T-Y. I needed three glasses of water after I came home."}
{"text":"I came to Ramen Isshin for the first time a few weeks ago after getting word that they offer trustworthy vegan/vegetarian ramen options sans pork or bone broth (such a rarity). I came on a Saturday night around 8pm and it was bustling so we had to wait about 10-15 minutes for a table.

I ordered the vegetarian red miso ramen and it was delicious. I'm not a vegan but appreciated that my server asked me whether or not I wanted vegan noodles (since the standard noodles contain egg). This really instilled confidence that they take these dietary requirements seriously, in addition to clear menu labelling. My other two friends ordered the black sesame tan tan noodles and loved them. I also had the chance to try the spicy red miso with cucumber. 

This place is obviously a neighborhood favorite. It is clean, good value for money and has a nice vibe with the right noise level when busy. The service was friendly and quick and they dealt with the line situation well. They even waved us off very sincerely when we left, which left me smiling at the adorableness of it all. Thank you Ramen Isshin...I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I decided to check out the Assembly tonight and was lucky enough to try the vegetarian ramen. Best ramen I have ever had."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a mean bowl of ramen - this place will do the trick.

Started off with the chicken karaage, which was not the best I've had, but still pretty tasty nevertheless. My friend was a ramen newbie and had no clue what to order so I recommended for her to get the red miso after reading the reviews about it. I went for the vegetarian shio.

I was pleasantly surprised and felt a wave of happiness when I tasted the broth. It was not too salty, which I really appreciated. It actually had sort of a musty sweet flavour to it (this is a good thing - well for me, anyways). I asked my friend how she was liking her dish, a little nervous to hear her reaction, but she absolutely loved it!

Just be warned, there is no air conditioning so if you're planning to go on a hot day, expect to sweat it out a little. Hey, just think of it as a 2 in 1 - good food and a sauna experience."}
{"text":"Loved this ramen joint! It absolutely lived up to the positive reviews, and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal here. I also loved that they had vegetarian ramen options, and actually had choices that strayed from pork-based broths.

We ordered a) Gyoza ($5.20), b) Chicken Karaage Don ($4.90), c) Spicy Red Miso Ramen ($13.90), and d) Black Sesame Tan Tan Noodles ($11.90 - they give you a bowl of sesame seeds to crush yourself, and disperse through your bowl). Overall, great variety to the menu and gives you a range of options to choose from. While the Black Sesame was good, the Spicy Red Miso Ramen was our favourite - it was so flavourful, full-bodied, rich, but not overly salty. The noodles were a great texture and the portions were pretty generous. The Chicken Karaage Don was decent, as was the Gyoza (not the best we've had, but it was still pretty good). 

Taken together, the experience, casual but intimate atmosphere, service, variety to the menu, and overall meal was wonderful, and we would definitely come back! However, be warned, it gets very busy, so keep that in mind if you visit during peak meal hours! Good for groups, families, and dates."}
{"text":"Overall, definitely worth a try, and I would like to go back and try the other flavour of ramen."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night and had to wait around 10 minutes for a table for 4. The servers were really nice and attentive the entire meal. They kept coming to clear the plates. We ordered 2 appetizers: the chicken karaage (very tasty but was a little expensive for 5 pieces) and pork gyoza (plain and wouldn't recommend). We each ordered different ramen bowls and I was able to try all the different soup bases. I had the Red Miso and the broth was quite sweet which I preferred over the typical salty broth. The Spicy Red Miso broth was not very spicy at all. The White Sesame Shio came with a little bowl of white sesame seeds that you grind up yourself and pour in. The broth tasted very clean and not too salty. We also had the  Garlic Shoyu which I really disliked. It had the burnt garlic taste which was very overpowering. Overall, quite happy and would come back again."}
{"text":"This is the best ramen I've had in Toronto far. And having recently returned from a trip to Japan, I'd have to say that this place is quite comparable to many ramen places there. I had the shoyu while my companion had the spicy red miso. Both were excellent. The broth is delicious and flavourful and the texture of the noodles was just right.

The karage and gyoza are both ok, but nothing special. Also had some mochi for dessert but personally, not really a fan of ice cream mochi, although the black sesame ice cream was nice. In other words, I think it's the ramen that really shines here, and I look forward to coming back and trying some of the other broths. Kudos also for having a number of vegetarian options, which is virtually unheard of in most ramen joints in the city.

Place doesn't seem busy during weekday lunches but not sure about other times. Restaurant was somewhat small so I can imagine there would be a line during peak periods. Portion sizes would be considered small by North American standards, but is pretty much what the average Japanese serving size looks like. If I was really hungry, I think I'd be able to down two of those awesome bowls. Service is friendly and efficient, and it seems that the servers here are quite proficient with English, which can be an issue at some of the other establishments. The downside is that the vibe of the Japanese hospitality here isn't as strong as places like Hokkaido."}
{"text":"Came here for the great reviews, left with half a bowl of noodles uneaten. 

The restaurant itself has a good environment, average service, and a very unique menu. It was our fault to not realize that this place doesn't serve authentic ramen but instead serves vegan and hipster fusion. 

TL;DR dont go here if you want authentic ramen; go here if you want VEGAN RAMEN (what?)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to visit. if you love Ramen.
Used to consider sansotei as the personal favorite but this restaurant can be a strong competitor.

I just ordered basic white sesami shio ramen and two of my friends had spicy miso and isshin red miso, accompanied by orders of okonomiyaki and takoyaki.

Result? we were all satisfied and walked out with happy faces.

Soups (Donkotsu based? )was not too salty, Noodle could be a little firmer but it's my personal preference. Chashu could be a bit thicker but they really mixed well in overall.

Will I recommend this place to others? Yes.
Will I visit here in a near future? Also Yes.

Can't wait to try their Donkotsu Kuro ramen.
Oh i wonder if it taste as good as greasy one that I had at kokute-i in kumamoto.
*"}
{"text":"Ramen is one of those food that I will never get tire of eating. In fact, I grew up eating the instant variety. I think most people had instant noodle at least once in their life, but nothing beats the real thing. 

Although there are plenty of ramen restaurants in Toronto and I've tried quite a few of those but Isshin is somewhat special. I can't really explain why, maybe because they have my favourite ramen dish, the \"Tsukemen\". It constantly reminds me of the tsukemen I had in Tokyo at Rokurinsha, this ramen restaurant is known for their tsukemen. The Isshin version is not exactly the same as the Rokurinsha tsukemen but special in its own way. It's the best tsukemen I can find so far in the GTA. 

Most other dishes on the menu are great too. I had tried the tsukemen of course, some of the rices dishes, cabbecha salad, okonomiyaki (seafood pancake), most the ramen flavours and appetizers. I haven't had anything bad at this place. Service was great too!

It's hard to find much bad to say about Ramen Isshin. If I have to nitpick, maybe the place is a bit busy and usually there's a line, but that's to be expected if you want a bowl of tasty ramen!

Taste *****
Price ****

{"text":"Returned this afternoon for lunch.  Two observations:  they have applied for a liquor license, and the menu, rather than a xerox sheet, is now a glossy several page booklet with photos.  I had the white sesame ramen , and was very pleased.  Light but very flavourful broth,  nice pork slices, thinly sliced tree ears, and a perfect soft boiled egg.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Karage chicken was just ok
Tan tan ramen was just ok, not as flavorful as expected. 

Ok food but there are much better ramen options in Toronto."}
{"text":"Extremely fast, kind service. Delicious, authentic ramen. Definitely would be a place we'd frequent if we lived around here! Mouthwash in the restrooms of a ramen place??? ...Canada is so clean and awesome!"}
{"text":"Good noodles and a wide variety of ramen. Don't get much topping and the soup is only okay. Don't like their execution of pork, the broth and the pork chasu both had the \"bad pork taste.\" Hope they figure it out soon!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, my friend and I decided to try this place for dinner. We arrived early around 6:30pm and it wasn't very busy. 

Servers were friendly but was not fluent in English so it was a bit difficult to communicate with her. 

Ordered the following: 
Garlic Shoyu Ramen - The soup base tasted average, nothing special to be fair. The \"garlic\" was almost nonexistent in the broth and it tasted a bit strange. It was not appealing. Noodles had similar texture to instant noodles - for the price and flavour, I might as well have had instant noodles which have tasted a lot better. 

Spicy Red Miso Ramen - The taste of the soup base is difficult to describe, initially thinking it would be spicy and full of flavour but it was the opposite. It lacked depth, flavour and appeal. 

In short, the food was disappointing. I rather go to Sansotei and eat authentic ramen! This restaurant lacked in quality and variety in the ramen. Not sure what everyone else seemed to be enjoying because I left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Ramen Isshin was recommended to me by a friend as her favorite ramen place in Toronto.

Dipping ramen...I was recently introduced to this concept in Japan, so I had that fresh on my mind. It's hard to compare against food in Japan, so I'll just say that this was really good. I'd come back here again for sure. I

I like the layout of the restaurant. It feels roomy.

Service was *a little* slow eventhough it was night and I felt like it wasn't overly crowded. The chicken karaage arrived (it arrived first), the wait was worthed it. So much so that we ordered more of it. That seemed smart, but then we had forgotten that we asked for extra noodle with our ramen. By the end of the meal, my friend and I walked away pretty happy. We had difficulty walking...but we were happy though =)"}
{"text":"we had a list of foods we needed to eat in Toronto and this place was not on it but after seeing great reviews and walking by a busy place more than once we decided to go. perfect food for a brisk night! we waited only around 10-15 minutes at prime dinner time on a Saturday night. If you don't want to sit at the counter make sure you tell them when you put in your name. the miso ramen had amazing flavor (broth not too sweet or salty) and the veggie spicy miso ramen broth had equal depth of flavor despite being vegetarian. We also had a pitcher of Sapporo for $14 which seems like a very reasonable price for Toronto. Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"I haven't had ramen this good in a very, very long time. Props to my friend Sara for recommending this place to me. As my friend said, Ramen Isshin tries very hard to promote the Tokyo street ramenya vibe, and all the staff there greet you with \"irasshaimase!\" as you enter. 

What really matters at the end though, is the food, and Ramen Isshin succeeds in every regard. The menu offers a wide variety of ramen options, including tsukemen and vegan ramen (important for my friends who are vegan), but I ultimately opted for the white sesame shio ramen. I remembered how much I loved shio ramen in NYC, so I decided I'd choose it here as well.

It was worth every penny I spent. The soup was very rich and the broth clearly took time and preparation. The ramen egg was perfect texture and consistency, just the slightest bit runny as I'd expect from ramen eggs. The char siu was fatty and soft. I also enjoyed how I got to ground up fresh white sesame and add it to my ramen. Kaedama is standard for ramenya and this place has that too (ordering extra noodles for $1). Ultimately, for me, what's most important for ramen for me are the broth and the noodle, and Ramen Isshin certainly delivers on both fronts and more.

If I am ever in Toronto again, I plan to come back and sample their other flavors. Good place to go if you're vegan and want to try top quality ramen!"}
{"text":"This is probably my 2nd favourite ramen place in town. The black sesame DIY grinder adds fun and fragrance to the whole experience. We asked for extra hot oil for our black tan tan ramen, but it's still not spicy enough. I never liked black sesame ice cream years back, but now I love it. The price is not bad here, a lot better than that new 1 Michelin star restaurant."}
{"text":"My favourite ramen spot! Always serving delicious ramen that isn't overly salty like at others. I have gone to several ramen spots including Sansotei, Kenzo, Hokkaido, Ajisen, Kinton and Raijin and i would recommend going to Ramen Isshin for delicious ramen thats a bang for your buck. 

I reccomend the Red Dragon (isnt that spicy so dont let it scare you), black tan tan and spicy miso! The chicken karaage appetizer is amazing!! I always get extra noodles and leave feeling full. The lunch deals are amazing, you get a choice of appetizer, ramen and drink for $15~!!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty picky about my ramen and I was very skeptical about this place because I had tried ramen at their sister restaurant (Kiu) in Markham and was not at all impressed.  I'm glad I went because this was a far cry from Kiu.  

Their broth was actually quite good and this time around, I ordered it without bamboo.  I've found that their bamboo shoots really overpower the flavour of the ramen and ruined it completely for me so this time, I decided forgo them.  Perhaps it was this change that made the difference but I am convinced that the broth here is better prepared.  They really should check in on their sister, Kiu because they're certainly not doing their ramen right there.  

Overall, I had a great experience and being so close to work, it's a great lunch spot to grab and go!"}
{"text":"Delicious Ramen and very friendly host. Some of the best Ramen I've ever had. If you are vacationing definitely don't miss this spot."}
{"text":"What??? 5 stars???

Yup, I think I found my new to-go ramen place. I can finally cut down on my Kinton visits, and will definitely not go to Sansotei or Santouka as much. Everything in this restaurant was simply excellent, agreed by all parties.

I ordered the Isshin red miso ramen, while my dad ordered the red dragon ramen, which was a limited time special. The ramen is actually the same one they use in Kinton, but it's cooked better here as it's softer but still chewy. The miso soup base was so great I almost drank the whole soup! The chashu was juicy with not a lot of fat, compared to Kinton where it's fat and a little on the dry side. My dad's red dragon ramen was just the right amount of spicyness, and agreed with me in terms of the ramen, chashu, and soup base.

We also ordered the chicken karrage, and although it was hot at first, once you let it cool down you can really feel the juiciness of the chicken, and that lemon juice to add to the chicken gives that extra kick which made it so good.

Service was excellent and we were well attended to the whole way. Perhaps it was because we arrived at 4pm, but I like the fact it is quieter (but not too quiet) and most importantly bigger than the big 3 (can we say big 4 now?)."}
{"text":"One of the better ramen restaurants in Toronto, came by on a Saturday for lunch and was able to get a table, we were lucky because not long after there was a long line!

I got the regular shoyu ramen, it had a pretty good soup base, very bouncy noodle texture. I saw the table next to us have okonomiyaki and that looked yummy too!"}
{"text":"For the popular ramen chains in Toronto, Ramen Isshin is definitely one of my favorites. The menu is diverse and unique, and there are always enough seats for everyone to eat at. I'm also a fan of the rather large appetizer menu and the lunch specials! The soup broth is very rich (though a bit salty), and the ramen arrives super quick and steaming hot. 

If you ever order the white sesame or black sesame, you have to crush the seeds with the little bowl on the side before sprinkling them into the soup. Some problems at this chain is the fact that they don't turn on the AC- it has been incredibly hot the last couple of times I've dined here. Another problem is that it's located in a sketchier area of town, and it's a bit frightening when you walk down the street in the dark. 

Although, since the location is kind of awkward, it means that there isn't much of a wait! Yay! For other chains, like Sansotei or Santouka, you have to wait around 10 minutes before you can actually sit down."}
{"text":"Small place , great Ramen! Try their originals. They don't have options in bowl size. Each one has its own size, most are quite big to finish by one person . Cost is very reasonable.

Ramen was yummy! And try their matcha ice cream to finish it off ."}
{"text":"It's a reasonable Ramen to go to. Standards seems to have dropped recently as they started to deep fry their gyoza and not pan-fry. Takoyaki is great."}
{"text":"This place is blowing up in Toronto, and for good reason. Their noodles are the bomb! They have an excellent menu, of which I've posted a few pics so you can check out the variety of offerings they've got. I chose the Red Dragon, since I prefer spicy noodles and broth. It didn't disappoint! The broth was subtly spicy, not overpowering. There was a whole red chili sticking up in the middle when it was served, too (hot!). The egg was cooked to perfection, too. 

I also ordered the Hiya Yakko, a wonderful dish of cold tofu smothered in chili oil, scallions, and bamboo. So tasty. Drink menu is small but works, and I didn't explore it much (got a big Asahi).

The staff were fantastic. Really pleasant, and the food came out fast. There were only two negatives for me. First, it is pretty cramped, and there is always a line. Know this before going! Better to stop in and get your name in the list - I had just arrived from the US, so just had to suffer while watching all the others consume THEIR tasty deliciousness. 

The bigger complaint was the hipsters. I was awash on a sea of man buns, suspenders, and pants that are too short the entire time. This is obviously their spot, and they were sort of a rude and unfriendly bunch, at least the night I visited. Beware, middle-aged people! Come for the ramen, stay for the beard oil."}
{"text":"Takoyaki is a must try for anyone visiting.  So many rich selections and styles of Ramen.  Traditional, Custom, spicy.  Garlic Shoyu Ramen was second only to that found in the best of Japan."}
{"text":"I tried the Spicy Red Miso ramen and spicy it was not unfortunately. Also, the soup was just kind of \"meh\", almost like soup from instant noodles. I suspect there is some MSG in the soup. The noodles were good enough, they were more eggy than other ramen places, and they tasted like glorified instant noodles (like Nongshim) which is fine. The toppings that came with the Spicy Red Miso ramen were sad. There were two pieces of thinly sliced pork (aka \"pork belly cha shu\") that were very reminiscent of PC bacon rounds and then the other toppings were just bits and pieces that mixed in the with the noodles, which I wasn't a fan of. I added a soft boiled marinated egg on the side and it was a cute little egg that was ordinary tasting. Overall, I have a ramen restaurant favourite and this didn't defeat it."}
{"text":"Where to start:
Service is great
Ramen selections are great
Noodle cook to perfection
Location, to be desire, but not judging it based on location
So you asked, why 2 star then.
Ramen is about the broth, and the noodle. Those combination make you humming and scream great ramen.
The broth here is lack of taste, way too salty and nothing else. Not water down but it just has no taste (other than sodium)"}
{"text":"We went there on a really frigid winter day, with temperature of -25. Ramen was the obvious choice for days such as that!
First, location of the restaurant is pretty convenient at College and Bathurst with street parking right in front of the restaurant. 
Immediately upon arriving at the restaurant, the staff was very welcoming and greeted us pleasant. 
As for the ramen, we tried the black sesame ten ten, the spicy red miso, and one of the rice bowl Dons. 
The noodles were perfectly cooked to al dente! And the roasted pork shoulder was very flavourful. 
The highlight of the meal was definitely the black sesame ten ten: a pestle and mortar are provided to grind the black roasted sesame seeds to add to your soup stock to your liking; the soup stock was very savoury balanced with the perfect amount of salt and left us wanting more! I also found that the ramen had just the right amount of green onions and vegetables mixed in. 

Overall, this is definitely the best Ramen I've had in Toronto so far! The black sesame ramen is a nice touch and something different than what you may have experienced before."}
{"text":"Great place. They have this amazing lunch special from Mondays to Thursdays until 4:00 pm. Sadly I missed it but I will be going back during that time. I ordered a sesame ramen. It was very neat because you could grind your own sesame. I also ordered the takoyaki. Also very good. No complaints. And for dessert I ordered green tea mochi ice cream. The mochi ice cream was a bit pricey but I NEED dessert. Overall, great place."}
{"text":"Came to Chef Assembly Hall for weekday lunch and decided to get Ramen Isshin. The line up is pretty long but it moved pretty quickly. I ordered the black sesame tan tan noodles which the staff said was most popular and it did not disappoint! It was flavourful and slightly spicy but was not too salty. I have tried other Isshin ramens before at their sister restaurant Kiu, and this one is definitely one of my favourite. Portion wise it's a bit small, but perfect for lunch! I will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"A bowl full of love! Best ever ramen.. tried the spicy miso bowl along with chicken karaage .. the thin wavy noodles are so fresh and melts in your mouth! A definite soul food prepared with so much love!"}
{"text":"OVERALL: very good ramen and literally the best chicken karaage I've had in my life. I am in love. 

This place made me regret not living in Toronto. Though maybe it's a good thing - if I came here every day, my wallet would probably suffer for it. Nonetheless, I will surely be coming here again if I ever go back to Toronto. 

When I first got to the restaurant, I noticed how cute everything was. It was very neat and the waiters were extremely nice. We had to wait 45 mins for a seat, but it was worth it.

I got the chicken karaage and the spicy miso ramen. The karaage arrived first. For those who have watched Shokugeki no Soma, rest assured, your wildest dreams of karaage shall be fulfilled at this restaurant. The flavor exploded in my mouth and allowed me to reach a new level of pleasure that I've never experienced from chicken before. Also, it comes with Japanese mayonnaise. For a person who normally hates mayonnaise, this was also the best mayonnaise I've ever tasted. Please, for the sake of me, order this the next time you go. 

The ramen itself was also very good. I usually don't like miso ramen, but it was good enough to make me consider getting more miso ramen in the future. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the meat almost melted in your mouth. There were also many vegetables in the ramen so you definitely feel healthy while eating it. 

According to a vegetarian friend of mine, they have very flavorful and viable options for vegetarians/vegans. An extra plus!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  I don't know much about how ramen is \"supposed\" to be served, so I can't speak necessarily to authenticity, but I have only ever had good experiences and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Best ramen spot in the city. I've never had a bad meal here, it only keeps getting better. 

Is it just me or is it getting more & more popular?

Great space, with lots of seating. I haven't had to wait very long to 1) be seated - even during the dinner rush, or 2) for the food itself. They also have a great lunch menu."}
{"text":"Pros:
Very well done ramen
Excellent service

Cons:
Portions could be better

Ramen Isshin is a solid ramen joint on the west end of downtown Toronto.  I was off on a Friday and decided to take my GF to lunch here.  If you've been to any downtown ramen locations on a work day, you know about the long wait times in the line.  Because of Ramen Isshin's location, this is less or a problem.  We came at 12:30pm and there were plenty of seat available.  It got busier as we were there, but there were always seats available and it never got crazy busy.  

Ramen Isshin offers a good variety of ramen to choose from.  They have your usual Miso, Shoyu and 4 veggie ramens.  That's easily one of the most veggie ramens I've seen.  They also have some \"original\" ramens that they make.  What I really love on the menu is they have a page specifically for allergy concerns.  If you have an allergy, this page is for you as it tells you what types of ramen to avoid.  I really liked that.  I ordered the white sesame and my GF had the black sesame.

The ramens were pretty well done.  The broth was really consistent and weren't very salty near the end as some ramen places can be.  The noodles were OK in my opinion.  My GF liked them a lot more than I did.  The portions could of been better though I am a big eater.  They give you the actual sesame seeds to grind and put in your ramen.  I don't know if this really adds to the taste, but it was different.  We got the combos which include a side and a pop/tea.  The sides are only a portion of what a regular order would of been which is understandable, but they were less than half the order honestly.  Samll gripe, but something to note.  Overall, still a great bowl of ramen.

Service here is what you come to expect from a Japanese run eatery.  I have never had a bad service experience at one of these places and Ramen Isshin keeps the trend going.  It was a pleasant overall experience here for me.

Ramen Isshin is a solid ramen joint.  It's not the best, but it holds its own.  It's a little farther away from the downtown core, but if you're in the area, it's a must try for any ramen owners."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with a group of 3 on a Tuesday evening. 
The reason we actually chose to come here is because they were rated pretty highly on a few Vegetarian Ramen lists. They even have a specific vegetarian section on their menu with 4 different types of Veggie Ramen. 

We arrived around 7pm and were told there was a wait of about 30-40 minutes, but to check back in 20min. We decided to take a walk and come back since it was so full inside. After about 20min we were seated right away.  

We ordered :

Ramune  - sweet carbonated drink with a pretty unique bottle lid. It was super sweet and reminded me of a summer cooler. 

Asahi Draft Beer  - This was a really light beer with a great taste, it definitely paired well with the Ramen. 

Chicken Karaage Don  - A little disappointing,  there was actually so little meat on top of a full bowl of rice. It was definitely more hype than anything. 

Spicy Red Miso Ramen - really tasty and filling

Spicy Vegetarian Red Miso Ramen  - also really tasty, and a great veggie option. 

The Ramen dishes tasted great! however, I actually didn't notice too much of a difference between the Spicy Vegetarian Red Miso Ramen and the Spicy Red Miso Ramen except for the Pork. I'm not the biggest fan of pork, so I might just get the vegetarian version next time. 

The restaurant itself if in pretty close quarters, and it can get pretty loud. Also if you have asthma or are sensitive to smoke, you might want to be careful since the kitchen is pretty much an open concept, the smoke alarm went off a couple of times during our time there. 

However, everything else about this restaurant is impressively highly efficient!  The servers here are very attentive and are definitely on top of everything.  It was definitely a great first Ramen Experience. 

Pro Tips: 

If you're having trouble deciding what to order, they have a chalkboard on the wall which lists all the Ramens in order of popularity. 

The Ramen dishes are a decent size, and one person can definitely finish it on their own, but if you feel like sharing, they are so chill about it and will gladly bring you an extra bowl"}
{"text":"Ramen Isshin really lives up to the title of \"Toronto's Best Ramen\"!!! This place is so authentic, with traditional decorations and Japanese waiters. The location is just off Bathurst and College and is quite small in terms of seating. 

I got the Miso Ramen and it had a larger portion than the other ramen! The broth was light and refreshing, and tasted absolutely amazing on the spot. But I got VERY thirsty afterwards. There were various toppings that added to the dish including chive, onion and little port crumbles. The pork chashu was also very thin and dissolved the flavour of the broth which was a nice touch. As well, the noodles were the perfect chewiness and weren't too thin or too thick. I added an egg on the side and OH MY GOODNESS!! It was the perfect gelatinous texture and melted in my mouth. Beware though, it is a $1.50 add on. 

This place is very expensive though, I paid a total of $19 after tax and tip for a single dish + egg. The service was great and the waitresses constantly came around to refill our water glasses. I already miss the noodles and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"It was freezing cold and we were hanging out across the street at Manic so I was able to convince my partner that ramen was the right thing for the morning, even though she is a bit skeptical about traditional style ramen.  We were able to get a seat without any waiting for lunch, which was nice.  Inside it was warm and not overly loud.  They cooks kind of talked to you as you came and went, instead of really shouting. 

We started with the Takoyaki which was advertised as fried octopus and scallion balls.  I have to admit I wasn't really sure what to expect when I got them but whatever it was, it wasn't what we got.  They were deep fried balls that were VERY hot and kind of squishy with a sweetish sauce on the top and fish flakes.  I wouldn't order them again, but mostly just because they aren't my thing.  

We ordered two kinds of ramen, the kotteri and the red miso.  I usually find miso ramen a bit too salty for me and so I avoid it (I didn't order it this time either) but i was definitely jealous.  No question that the red miso was the standout dish.  It was just a little bit sweet, not too salty and really delicious.  The kotteri was ok, but nothing to get me coming back.  

So overall there was one dish that we both loved, but it was excellent enough that I'd keep coming back for it alone, and it definitely has me curious to delve deeper."}
{"text":"Good service and food. Ordered Edamame and spicy miso ramen."}
{"text":"Ramen Isshin is located inside Assembly Chef's Hall (a food hall - similar to a food court but fancier?). I ordered the Kotteri Shoyu and paid around $16 for it after tax. There wasn't an option for thin/thick ramen, they just gave me the thin ones and I prefer the thick ones, but it was still chewy and good. The soft boiled egg was a little too overdone in my opinion, I wish the yolk was more runny. Another thing, they only gave me half an egg, where most ramen restaurants give 1 full egg so yeah... if I'm paying $16 for a bowl of ramen, you can give me 1 full egg lol. It came with 2 thin slices of cha siu (pork) which was flavourful, if only they cut it a little thicker. The pork bone broth was very rich and smooth, absolutely delicious. I drank all the soup haha. The only problem is it was way too salty, made me really thirsty while eating this, and it would've been better everything was a bit hotter since it felt like room temperature. It also came with bamboo shoots, green onions, and a piece of nori. Their customer service is good, staff are very friendly. They're really fast, but that may be because I went during an off-peak time. I feel like it's a little expensive for just a bowl of ramen but it is delicious, especially that pork bone broth mmmmm."}
{"text":"One of the more unique Ramen shops in the GTA. Their flavor is distinct and the thick noodles might have been the best I've had so far. Authentic Japanese Ramen."}
{"text":"This place is packed!!!!!!! Always busy!! Strict last call before the kitchen closes..

Food / Ramen - average quality in my opinion..

This business has evolved over the past year.. used to be empty.. but then they started pushing/paying Yelp and then the restaurant got busy.. then opened a new high-class location in Markham by the new VIP cinemas - which I gave a 2 star rating..

Soup base - has too much MSG in it.. but to be fair, the volume of business they have.. can't really do authentic ramen soup base.. just too much volume.... business for these guys is blooming tho - good for them!! Keep up he good work!

I would recommend the super spicy miso soup ramen.. and to recommend stay away from the tradition ton kat su ramen.."}
{"text":"Visiting from San Diego. I've lived in Japan and this place is one of the first ramen places that really remixed me of the great places I used to eat at in Tokyo and Sapporo."}
{"text":"I have been having ramen at Isshin for years since they opened their first location on college and was happy to see them in the Chef's Assembly Hall. Ramen Isshin has always served one of the more serious and flavourful ramens in town and this new location keeps up the tradition.

The broth and the chashu (pork meat) were flavourful, deep and satisfying. I had the shoyu flavour and was again impressed. It is even more impressive that they can whip up such a good broth, toppings and keep it deeply warm in their kiosk.

There are definitely kinks and faults to be had however. While their ramen is much better than inferior stuff Kinton, and some others, serves it is spiced with MSG. One can tell because of the nerve tinglings and thirst that follows. Secondly the prices are higher than average. It always amazes me that expensive Japan has ramen all over the country for $8-$9 and at such large portions and ramen has to be $15+ in Canada! Finally, this is a food court, which means disposable bowls and spoons. It is unfortunate.

At Isshin stick with the shoyu ramen and give a miss to the novelty of spicy this and spicy that. Also skippable are appetizers as they are nothing special. 

The atmosphere of the food hall is fun and there is much to choose from. It is accessible from The PATH, which is anther bonus.

The employees at this location were jovial and friendly and they had a large menu full of options, but no tsukemen!!! Back to the original location for that...By the way, Unlike Uncle Tetsu, Pablo and most fake sushi restaurants and izakayas in town here the employees are Japanese 9and obviously are doing a great job with their ramen)."}
{"text":"This my friends is what ramen looks like when you simply know what you're doing! A broth full of depths and freshly made noodles with perfect chew. If you get those two components right, it honestly doesn't matter what ingredients you throw on top. Heck, throw a shoe in there for all I care! 

Ramen Isshin sits on College in always lively Kessington. This is a traditional authentic ramen shop; traditional Japanese greeting included.  If the staff at your local ramen shop isn't yelling at you in Japanese as you walk in, it's probably not going to go well for you. 

As magical as the ramen is, somehow the chicken Karaage is just, or even more so satisfying. Crispy, tender, super juicy chunks of chicken fried to perfection. 

Given my recent spell of run ins with mediocre ramen, Ramen Isshin is a Godsend :-)"}
{"text":"Confession:  I'm NOT a big fan of ramen.  I think it's just o-kay/nothing special/don't get the hype.  

Aside from that, depending on what time you get here, there'll probably be a wait.  Luckily, I came at an off-hour today, so we were seated right away...near the front door.

The atmosphere here was not pleasant because there was NO HEAT on in the restaurant.  I actually kept turning to see if someone opened the front door 'cause there was a constant draught.  If it's cold out and the bodies inside aren't generating enough heat, please turn on the heater. 

In addition to the temperature, they were serving ICE WATER.  ICE WATER and it's -25, coldest day on record outdoors.  Why??!!  I couldn't help but think whether or not this was the result of the $14 minimum wage increase thing.

Food tasted fine, the usual ramen, pork based broth, wavy noodles, etc.  My friend shared another dish with her son and they threw up/feel queasy now.  So they got food poisoning from their Spicy Miso Ramen.

Since I'm not a ramen fan, I wouldn't voluntarily go back.  I certainly would NOT wait in a line!"}
{"text":"Best Ramen in the city.  We go back time and time again.  I always get the miso or spicy miso with added corn.  Gyoza are good as well, but the ramen is the clear star.

Best part - when you take it home they separate the broth which maintains its amazing-ness for the next day."}
{"text":"Here is a short list of why Isshin is perfect; 

1) Amazing variety on their menu and 4 vegetarian ramen options 
2) Perfect service! The waitress is fast and very helpful. We were even thanked with big smiles by the entire kitchen as we walked out!
3) The noodles are heaven. Slightly chewy and absolutely delicious
4) The red miso broth is savoury with a hot kick too it
5) The seating is clean and cosy

You've gotta check this place out!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best authentic japanese ramen restaurant in Toronto.  It is simply the best place that I have been to.   I went there at around 4pm and there was still a 30 minute wait to get seated.   I can't imagine what it would be like at dinner and lunch hours.

The place is very crowded and noisy.   I finally got a seat and sat down.   There is a wide selection of ramen but it is not cheap.  Expect to budget about $25 for one person.  

I went ahead and ordered the Red Dragon Ramen.  It looks spicy since the broth was really reddish topped with a red chili.  When it finally came, I took at quick taste of the broth and surprisingly, it wasn't spicy at all.   The ramen was amazingly good.   On the menu, it describes the intricacies of making their broth.   I love tonkotsu broth and I appreciate the delicacies and time that it takes to make it.

I hope to be able to get a bowl of ramen from here again.  It is a bit far from my home but hopefully, someday.

I highly recommend this place.  Amazing ramen.  Japan in Toronto."}
{"text":"*Opened by the same owners as Kingyo Izakaya. 
*The restaurant was decently sized with Asian inspired decorations, open kitchen by the front and a dragon mural along one side of the wall

-Deep fried pork gyoza - $5.2
These had a nice crispy skin while having a great filling packed with flavors.

-Takoyaki - $4.8
These takoyaki from ramen Isshin were undoubtedly the best takoyaki that I have had in Toronto so far. They were crispy on the outside, yet still soft and moist and not-fully-cooked on the inside. There were a big chunks of perfectly cooked and tender octopus tentacles inside each takoyaki as well! I also loved how prominent the flavor of the bonito flakes and mayonnaise were, while the takoyaki sauce was just sweet enough to balance out the flavors.

-Chicken Karaage - $4.9
Thought the chicken karaage were perfectly seasoned and tasty, they weren't the best I've had. I found the karaage to be too a bit too oily and the batter wasn't as crispy as the one I had at Gushi.

-White sesame shio ramen: $9.6
Friend ordered this which came with a pestle and mortar to grind your own seeds and put into the ramen yourself. To be honest, I thought the sesame seeds didn't have the rich aroma and flavor I expected, thus it really didn't add much to the ramen. It was also quite difficult to grind the seeds, but kudos on giving this experience to their customers.

-Red Dragon Ramen - $14.9
 The noodle came with a thick noodles that were bouncy and cooked in right texture. The broth had just the right amount of spiciness and it was more fatty compared to the shio or shoyu ramen. Actually, I found that the broth here had a more delicate flavor and they weren't as oily as other places - which is my personal preference when it comes to ramen broth. Their chasu is about 90% meat and 10% fat, and they tasted amazing! It was tender yet chewy at the same time. I also noticed how the bamboo shoots were pretty much the basic topping for all the ramen here.

The only complain I would have about my ramen was how salty it was, but not MSG salty! I actually had to ask the server for a bowl of plain soup to add into bowl, which should reduce the saltiness but even then, it was still too much for me to handle."}
{"text":"still haven't found a ramen shop that doesn't make me thirsty.  there's just so much salt in these toronto ramens.  i'd rank this place pretty good for toronto standards."}
{"text":"First review of 2015! (What took me so long?)

Love this place! Been here for a second time, so I figured it was long overdue for a review.  And if you've seen my history of reviews, a LOT of them are Ramen places.

So, Ramen Isshin.  I got to say, there are many, many things that I can compliment about the place.

1st off, the location, while it's small, I find that there is sufficient seating for people to come in and dine.  There isn't a ramen bar, since the cooking is done at the front of the house, but when you go in, the space opens up a bit with an acceptable amount of seating.  I came early so I beat the dinner rush, but slowly but surely on a Thursday evening, people began to trickle and people were waiting at the door.

Staff and the service is actually pretty good, they're attentive and appropriately staffed so that they don't look all that stressed out.  They're quick and regularly come by and fill up on water. 

What I ordered: Roasted Garlic Shoyu Ramen and Chicken Karaage (shred with friends).  Shoyu Ramen, despite how I'm not a fan of Shoyu, I actually thoroughly enjoyed the ramen.  Noodles were very well cooked and the soft boiled egg, was well cooked.  A soft runny yolk....so yummy.  Cha-shu meat was very delicious, and the broth while it was very good, thought it was a tad on the rich side (but that's personal taste and not something I can fault them for, but if I had to go back again, I think their light Shio is perhaps their best one.  Their brothes are pretty delicious, although I think I'm a guy who would rather stick with classics.  

All in all, it's a very solid place and I would give this place a 4.5 (despite it saying 4), I would say that besides the broth, which again is just preference...they represent the Ramen market quite well in Toronto."}
{"text":"Dropped by here for a second time as I was in the neighbourhood. Once again surprised that there was no lineups as there are usually lineups for downtown ramen place especially for lunch. Greeted by all the staff and was seated quickly. 

Ordered the red dragon with the katsu don side. Food arrived in a reasonable time and smelt extremely rich. Red dragon was advertised as spicy but upon further tasting found it to be quite mild. Noodles were delicious and the katsu don was decent. Staff was good as the cup of water was constantly refilled."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. The menu has a bunch of options; more than I'm used to seeing. And all of them sounded great. Service was excellent: quick, friendly, and not intrusive. I'm just a tourist, and I'm already looking for an excuse to come back."}
{"text":"Great service, tasty food, Ramen nodes were cooked perfectly.  Takoyaki always a must and it did not disappoint.  Ambiance simple and quiet."}
{"text":"The ramen spot I find myself going back to again and again. Red dragon, spicy miss, tan tan are all great. Lots of really solid apps too."}
{"text":"The greatest ramen place in Toronto and possibly the best one I've tried. An avid ramen lover, I've been to my fair share of ramen places. Most ramen broth is beef/pork/chicken based and you'll have a hard time finding a completely vegan version. Their vegan ramen is amazingly spicy and flavourful. You can also opt for the vegan noodles if you want. 

The waiters are staff are so nice and friendly and really helpful to any questions you may have. You might have to wait a bit for a table because this seems to be a local favourite. I will definitely be coming back because this may possibly be one the best ramen I've ever had."}
{"text":"Love the Tsukemen (dipping ramen), Black Sesame Tan Tan Noodle, and Hiya Yakko!

The Tsukemen comes with an extremely salty broth, but I like salt so I don't mind.  If you're sensitive to super salty foods, I would probably steer clear.  The Tan Tan noodle comes with a little bowl of black sesame that you can grind, which is cute, but it seems like it's purely for show/decoration.  I always start each meal with the Hiya Yakko (cold tofu appetizer) because I'm obsessed with their chilli oil!  The balance of bamboo, green onions, and cold tofu in chillies is just perfect for a starter.  I haven't tried the other ramen bowls yet, but I have tasted the Red Dragon broth and it's definitely much more sweet than spicy.  

On one occasion my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Karaage Don because he's not a big fan of ramen, and either the server didn't hear correctly that it was a separate entree order, or the portions are just super small - but the Karaage Don was the size of a small rice bowl with not a lot of chicken.  I would say pass on the Dons if you are considering something besides ramen here.

Definitely recommend for a great ramen spot in the city that won't disappoint.  Try to come during off-peak hours for better service and dining experience (if you don't like crowded restaurants)."}
{"text":"Wish had enough time to try all the ramen on the menu.  Looking forward to the next trip in to Toronto."}
{"text":"Not even sure why this place is rated so highly.
I went on Thursday evening 7pm. 
I had the roasted garlic shoyu ramen. That was fine. Wished the slices of pork was not paper thin. 

The karaage was absolutely horrible. It was hard, chewy and dry. I told the server that it was dry and hard. He just said okay and ignored me. I mean if they had good customer service they would say at least sorry, can we get a new plate for you or something. 

Would not recommend, there's plenty of other ramen places in Toronto that are way better."}
{"text":"Go to bowl here is the Kotteri Shoyu with extra meat, extra egg, mushrooms and Red dragon chili sauce. You're dead...

Awesome spot. Like the simple ambiance. Got the dipping ramen this time around. The presentation is amazing - it comes out with a boiling bowl for dipping all the ingredients. Curry sauce this time which I wasn't expecting but it was delicious. Very filling.

I've been back now a ton of times and tried all the ramens and the Gyoza. The place is unreal. I'm upping my rating to five star!"}
{"text":"Affamé et fatigué après une longue journée à flâner dans la ville,  le ramen d'été (froid) avec une pinte d'Asahi (ou deux- 5$ pendant l'été) a fait mon bonheur. Un endroit sympa et reposant."}
{"text":"A very solid ramen experience!  Busy place but lots of turnover so the wait is manageable (5min) and well worth the wait!  Spicy Ramen was amazing - perfect spice level and not over the top. Deep, rich, comforting broth for a winter's night with perfect noodles, pork belly and other Fixn's. Also had the garlic flavoured - again very nice. Deep, rich, woody flavour with perfect soft poached egg.  The other nice thing is the portion size - perfect!  Not too much, not too little. 

Attentive, friendly service and reasonable price ($$). 

We'll be back."}
{"text":"Ramen Isshin is one of the better ramen places in Downtown West. My favorite is Shoyu pork ramen - it has very rich flavor without being too salty like other ramen places.

Noodles are also very chewy and fresh - I wish the portion of noodle is just a tad bit larger but with the soup it still fill you up nicely. 

It's became my go-to lunch spot whenever it's cold and rainy - they get very crowded during lunch hours so be prepare to line up for few minutes if you're going there in a large group."}
{"text":"After seeing all the great reviews for this place I was willing to wait 30 minutes to try it and I must say I'm rather disappointed. I actually prefer Sansotei. 

Okay first is my review of the food - I got the spicy miso after seeing all the recommendations. It was okay, very salty and not too spicy. I paired it with the cucumber miso app, it wasn't what I was expecting and would've preferred for it to have a little more spice and less salt. My boyfriend got the garlic shoyu which is a bit smaller than the spicy miso but he found it was also really salty. One thing with both enjoyed was the pork slices, it was thin and very tasty. 

The place itself, very friendly and attentive staff. There's usually a line up which before dining here I thought it was because it was just that good but after experiencing it myself I see that people come here on dates and to socialize. I know I generally like to get in and out when dining out unless it's a special occasion so I'm probably quicker than the average guest however all 3 table around me were eating their meals before I was even seated and stayed longer than I did."}
{"text":"Long wait- but totally worth it. I'm vegetarian and the shoyu was amazing. Such a rich earthy broth and fresh noodles, would not change a thing :)"}
{"text":"Their ramen red dragon was awesome.   Very flavorful.  Their fried chicken was very juicy.  Great place."}
{"text":"Came with a friend around 5:30pm on a Wednesday. We were quickly greeted and seated. We ordered the Tako Yaki and Gyoza to start. Both came quickly. The Tako Yaki (5 pieces) had nice chunks of octopus and were very flavourful. The gyoza wraps were so light, not greasy and very tasty. Order also came with 5 pieces. I ordered the spicy vegetarian red miso ramen with extra noodles and an addition of bean sprouts. Definitely could have done without the extras as the serving was large but how can you say no to extra noodles for only $1.70?! I found the broth a tiny bit too salty for my liking but exceptionally flavourful. Serving portions were excellent for the price. The service was prompt and our waitress attentive. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"in terms of taste, ramen isshin is among the top 3 in toronto. their broth is outstanding and they aren't skimpy with the toppings. while i prefer the noodles at kinton just a bit more, the noodles at ramen isshin are still better than most. the chicken karage is perfect; you cannot find better in the city. 

the décor is simple, but clean. the servers are almost too nice and helpful! 

in terms of overall value, they're the best. my first choice for ramen."}
{"text":"Ramen Isshin lives up to the name. The Tan Tan Ramen is just out of this world. The broth is creamy, complex, and full of flavor. I've never had a ramen broth that was anything like it! Note though, as previous reviewers have mentioned - the ramen is not vegetarian OR halal friendly. The broth is pre-made as well, so they are unable to make changes to it. 

Food comes out quickly, and the community seating and atmosphere does not endorse a long stay in the restaurant. That could be a benefit though, as the 15 person line we experienced during the weekday lunch hour only resulted in a 15-20 minute wait."}
{"text":"Yes: as good as it gets.

I've had all options available to me here and am quite thankful for so many vegan options and even more thankful that the kitchen care so much to make sure the veg options have flavours just as robust and developed as the meater options. Thanks, yo.

Only complain - the noodle refill option allows me to overeat every. single. time. It hurts."}
{"text":"My fiancé, a couple of his family members, and I tried Ramen Isshin for the first time today since we were in the downtown Toronto area. My fiancé ordered the miso ramen, his sister ordered the black tan tan noodles, his mother ordered the assuri shoyu ramen, and I ordered the spicy miso ramen.

Ramen Isshin had quite a lot of variety in comparison to other ramen places I have been. Overall, the flavor was quite delicious, and I enjoyed having the wok-fried vegetables in the ramen - it was my first time having it in ramen but I would have to say I prefer it this way. I do wish the amount of pork chasu given was more generous, but it's not like I thought the chasu itself was that great anyways... I have definitely had much better in Southern California. Anyways, I would still have to say it's worth another visit to try out another dish!"}
{"text":"Very friendly waitress! Try shiyo ramen, it's awesome! ( tan tan ramen is not spicy at all, trust me)"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, though I do find their sign on Wellesley confusing - at 9am it says they are open, so I went to get a peak, and they actually are not - their \"grocery store\" is, which I found pretty pricey (better off going to the new Asian Mart on Yonge and Wellesley next to McDonalds. 

Anyway, in terms of dining in and take out, I was really pleased. The staff was attentive and happy to accommodate our ingredient swaps (chicken instead of pork, and no onions). The portions were good, the prices were reasonable, and the service was quick, efficient and friendly. The downsides: no spices or hot sauce! Yep! And you can't choose your noodle type. Only one type available. 

I also wanted to point out that they do a great job packaging takeout orders - one container for the broth and one container for the meat and veg - and well sealed."}
{"text":"Great ramen! This place is convenient and great for a quick lunch. I asked for less salt for my white sesame ramen and the broth was delicious. 

Service was friendly and efficient. At $14, it's pricier than some other places around the DT area but also one of the tastier ones.

I'll definitely be visiting Ramen Isshin's full restaurant another time."}
{"text":"Even though this place is in a food court setting, I would say it is one of the best ramen places in Toronto - better than Konjiki, Santouka, Sotei, and Kinton. All three bowls of their ramen offerings are delicious. The broth is rich, but what makes them great is their noodles! They are super chewy and the flavour of the broth sticks to them. Definitely a usual go to option when I am struggling to decide among the various options in Chef's Assembly hall for dinner. 

Tip: To take the ramen to the next level, pay the $6 for the extra pork slices. It is blessed when you eat a huge piece of meat with noodles with every bite!"}
{"text":"The staff were very friendly and although our order took a little longer than normal, they took the time to let us know they haven't forgotten about our order. The chicken karaage was good but the portion was definitely not enough, even for an appetizer. The ramen was definitely amazing. I'll be coming back for more."}
{"text":"If Michelin stars were given out in Canada, this place be the first to have them. The broth, the noodle, the cha shu, even the decor and restaurant itself deserves a 5 star review if not more. Not to mention even the servers and chefs are quick and very polite.
Try it out yourself and you won't be disappointed, take my word for it."}
{"text":"While in Toronto and in the Kensington area, I craved Ramen and found this place. Ordered the miso ramen and was kind of disappointed by the high ratings this place gets. While the customer service was good, the ramen was average. Broth was too salty and there was not enough grounded pork."}
{"text":"this is one of the few ramen shops in toronto that have vegetarian options. 

I started with the fried chicken app, I would definitely recommend it to fried chicken fans. Well seasoned and good crispiness. For the main course I had the pork shiyo ramen. The broth was just right, well seasoned and not too thick. The ramen itself had a good texture / bounce to it.

My wife had the vegetarian broth and she enjoyed it a lot. It had a lot of flavours and not just some vegetarian bouillon soup base."}
{"text":"Ramen restaurants seem to be young people hang out place - always crowded and noisy. I finally find a family friendly ramen restaurant! When my family walked in, there was another family with young children. After we ordered, the waitress give us some kid's utensils without us asking! What a service!

We had White Sesame Shio ramen, Spicy Tan Tan Ramen, Chasu Don, Karaage Don and Takoyaki. They are all good. The white sesame Shio ramen in Tonkotsu broth is light yet flavourful with strong pork bone taste which other ramen places won't offer. I know it uses real ingredients to make the broth not depends on MSG. The Spicy Tan Tan is full of flavour; there is hint of spiciness and not very hot. The ramen came with sesame and you can grind them to mix with the noodles to enhance the taste. 

They make the ramen in authentic way - cooking light broth with thin noodles and rich broth with thick noodles. Both thin and thick noodles are bouncy and cooked in right texture. 

The chasu is tender and juicy; the half boiled egg is great. Karaage chicken is juicy and flavourful; although it may not be the best in town, it is the best Karaage among all the ramen places. 

The price is right, $8.9 for Shoyu or Shio ramen. $3.5 extra for a bowl of rice when you order the noodle. 

I would say this place is competitive with other ramen restaurants in terms of food; the service is outstanding among all. Although there was only one server, she still came by to check if everything was okay. She even opened the door for us when we exited. 

Definitely will go back with my family."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 3/5 
This place is located on Bathurst St & College St. Sadly, there is no free parking in the direct vicinity.

[SERVICE] - 5/5
Servers and chefs immediately greeted us with the phrase \"Irasshaimase\" (which translates to\"welcome to the store\") when we walked into the place. Our server was also friendly, helpful, andsmiled a lot.

[DÉCOR] - 4/5
Very small ramen shop! There was a 20-minute wait for a table. We waited outside because thisplace was packed! I love these small, intimate, and busy restaurants because they have such
amazing food & this place also had very upbeat vibes!

[FOOD QUALITY] - 5/5
One of my favourite, and highest quality ramen I had in the GTA. I could also tell the chefs used a lot of time and created such rich and full-bodied broths.

[ORDER] - 5/5
- Spicy Miso Ramen: House-made chili oil and Isshin Red Miso blend added a kick, butmaintained natural flavours of the ramen. Pork belly cha shu melted in my mouth.Noodles were perfectly thick and al dente.

- Assari \"Light\" Shoyu Ramen: Shoyu broth was rich and also had a very pleasant seafoodflavour. Soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly with a runny yolk. Thin noodles easilyabsorbed the subtle flavours of the broth. Again, pork belly cha shu had the perfectamount of fat-content that melted in my mouth upon contact.

[OVERALL] - 5/5
Prices are higher than other average ramen shops in the GTA, but the high quality ingredients areworth the value. I would highly recommend Ramen Isshin to the ramen lovers out there!"}
{"text":"Fantastic ramen! Be ready for a slight wait especially on weekends and evenings - but the food and outstanding service totally makes up for it. The portions are huge and the prices are decent."}
{"text":"my favourite ramen place and in my opinion, the best spot downtown! i've been coming here for the past 2 years and i have been very pleased with each visit. the staff is friendly and the quality of the food is consistent.

i normally get the black sesame tan tan ramen for the spiciness and the affordability of it. last time, i decided to try the red dragon ramen and i'm so in love! the spiciness is on point and the taste was phenomenal from the pletora of toppings. i savoured each and every bite. on top of this, they don't skimp out on the quantity of the food - my ramen was filled to the brim with toppings and I was stuffed by the end of the meal. I normally like to order a side of cha sun don (bork rice bowl) for a dollar cheaper if ordered with ramen. even though the flavour is simple, the taste is extraordinary

would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"best ramen in toronto! (tied with ramen kyuoka near the beaches) i've tried konjiki, hoikkado, sensotei, and kinto ramen and hands down, this place exceeds the other places in flavours, uniqueness, and portion sizes

been coming here for the last year and i'm finally writing a review because i was not a yelpie before

i always get my ramen with a side order of their rice (a dollar cheaper than ordering separately). although the rice is very simple, their taste is anything but that. the rice has a hint of sweetness and the meat is so tender and juicy. and the nori + mayo toppings elevate the flsvour to the next level

i normally get their black tan tan noodles because i love spicy food and the price is good and it has never disappointed me. the last time, i decided to get red dragon ramen and i was so happy and satisfied! the bowl was a party central to all the flavours and texture. i finished everything and drank all tbe broth! there were tons of toppings and i liked the fact that they included a full size red chilli pepper in their bowl

highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"We love this place so much and are never disappointed. My favourite is the black tan tan and my husband usually gets the shoyu - our bellies are full and the price range is perfect. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Close to my top 3, this place gets pretty packed too. They've got a wider variety of flavors than the others, I usually stick to the traditional but others have raved about their spicy Ramen. All are good."}
{"text":"It's my first time here. Came here on a Wednesday night. Their special cheese curry ramen tsukemen really captured my attention so I decided to try it out and I wasn't disappointed ! The broth was thick and the noodles were cooked perfectly. Will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Stopped in many times since my last review! I love this place and service definitely improved. The ramen is still delicious and it's so nice that they serve vegetarian ramen. I've tried it and I've converted to just the veggie ramen, it's that good! I wish they had a smaller size for their ramen as the portions are a little too big, but that's just personal preference.

I have sent so many of my friends here and they all love it. The omnivores even try the veggie ramen and are converted :D"}
{"text":"Went there last week with my wife for lunch.

Red Dragon Ramen is the best ramen I've ever had!  Broth is super rich (not too salty, just about right) and the chasu is sooooooo tender. I opted to include bamboo shoots and I find it compliments the broth very well.

To be honest I find this place better than Hokkaido, the ramen over there is wayyyyyy too salty for my liking. 

Pork Gyoza came before the ramen. Fried it perfectly. Crispy on the outside and juicy filling inside. 

It's been about a week since I went there and I'm still thinking about it. If your craving for ramen this is the place to go. Trust me. You won't regret it. 

Food:  5/5

{"text":"Probably the best ramen I've had in my life. I had the spicy miso ramen and it was perfect. It had a great balance of flavours. The spice wasn't too overpowering. I can see why it's the most popular ramen at Isshin. The chicken Karaage appetizer was good too but a bit small in portion size. My girlfriend had the Miso ramen (non-spicy) version and it seemed really good too but definitely not as good as the spicy Miso. 

We came here on a Thursday night at 8 pm and had to wait around 40 minutes so plan accordingly. Just check Google's peak hours histogram and come during off peak hours (before 7 pm on weekdays). 

Service was great. Ambiance was good too. Overall, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ramen. Authentic. Delicious. 

It does not disappoint and i don't know if it gets better. Soft chewy noodles. Great broth. I tasted my friend's tofu and I would have bet my life it was meat. Amazing texture and flavor. Do it."}
{"text":"Kinton remains my top one (and raijin the second one) but this new ramen place really adds something different compared to all those other recently opened ones, most bland or overly bad.

On the side, they do a good okonomiyaki (small and only one kind of, but sooo much better and authentic than the disgusting ones you'd have at the okonomiyaki house)"}
{"text":"Such kind service and a very authentic Japanese feel. Started off with an order of takoyaki. Came out quickly, five balls that were crisp on the pout side and a nice creamy inside. For ramen I ordered the tsukeman ramen which was quite a unique ramen eating experience!!! The broth came out bubbling with a side plate with all my noodles and toppings. At first the broth smells super fishy to me, but the thick dashi taste actually goes to well with the fresh noodles, bamboo!! The chashu was super tender, the eggs were made perfectly. Good thick noodles that softened up nicely in the super hot broth, but should be eaten quite fat bc once it cools the noodles stay kind of al dente and won't become warm from dipping! Also, the broth had chunks of I think fish in it?? Overall, a very solid ramen dish and i would definitely come again"}
{"text":"One of the best ramen I've had in North America. We had Tan Tan noodle (spicy one) and it was amazing. The broth was great and noodles were cooked perfectly. Good thickness and bounciness, the way good noodle should be. Their Cabbecha (canbbage with charshu in chili oil) was great appetizer too. If you want some great Japanese ramen with no frills, come here."}
{"text":"I vaguely remember the first time I came here early 2014 with a friend to check this place out. The shop was modestly occupied with decent wait times. They were still serving this appetizer called the Japatine, their rendition of poutine with Japanese curry substituting the gravy; it was quite good. Fast forward to last weekend, I walk in during my lunch break to a bustling jampacked shop. Through the clamour of the open kitchen with the handling of the woks and timers going off, patrons conversing in between slurping their noodles, and the staff enthusiastically greeting customers, I was told by the front that minimum wait time would be half an hour or more---for a single seat! I switched to takeout and got myself their tsukemen and a red miso for my co-worker. This place is a well-oiled machine, with the crew pumping out 4 bowls of noodles at the pass within minutes of each other.

Waiting for my order, I encountered none other than Yamaguchi Shinji (Mr. Gushi) in the crowd. I jokingly complained to him, \"Why isn't your stall open?! I had to walk all the way up here to get my fix of Japanese food!\", \"I know---we're working on it. But this place is really good!\". There you have it. You know this place is legit when it has the endorsement of the man behind Toronto's best karaage.

Back to the food itself, my takeout order was packaged with care, with noodles packaged separately and saran wrap over the broth containers to minimize spillage/oiliness. The tsukemen was delicious, with perfect noodle texture and a delicious broth that clung on to the noodle on dipping. It really hit the spot for me, as someone running a 12-hour shift. But it didn't end there.

At the end of my shift, I returned for more. I thought at 9pm perhaps the crowd may have diminished---nope, just as busy. I was seated within 20 min and got myself the Red Dragon. A beautiful bowl of noodles with a crimson broth, a mound of scallions hiding a mound of chili paste, with a chili pepper sheathed in it as if it were the Sword in the Stone. I ravenously devoured it. The fragrance, the heat, the flavours---a deeply satisfying meal to end the day. The number of ramen shops in downtown Toronto that I haven't visited could probably be counted on one hand---I would say Isshin is easily one of my favourites."}
{"text":"So I've been here a couple times and so far, they haven't disappointed me. It seems to be pretty popular and there's always a small line-up. The staff are always courteous enough. So far, I've had the white sesame shio, spicy miso and black tantan ramen. I like how they let you grind your own sesame for your ramen- it's pretty fragrant and adds a nice touch. The mochi ice cream is also decent but pretty generic, just like mochi ice cream at any other place. I think this is in the running against Sansotei to become my favourite ramen spot (!).. though Ramen Isshin seems to be missing tonkotsu ramen, which has a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"Delicious. Just delicious. I'm going to go there right now for a bowl of heaven. 

I've tried three different ramens and so far the black sesame is my favourite. 

The service is pretty good overall, the staff all thank you on the way out the door and are very friendly.

I do wish that the portion sizes were larger, that's the only thing I can really complain about. 

Also, if you're looking to get spicy ramen, always double check with the server. Red broth in the picture doesn't always mean spicy broth."}
{"text":"I've been missing ramen (Windsor why so little?) so I just had to get more for dinner! This is the Red Dragon Ramen from It's made with 15 different spices, pork belly cha shu, soft boiled egg (I opted out), and thick, twisty noodles. I also added an order of bamboo shoots on the side because a fellow customer recommended it on Yelp.

The service was fantastic. She was great with water and answered my questions promptly while staying friendly.

Moving on.

I normally don't like pork belly but this was good and not too fatty. I was extremely disappointed that the ramen was not in the least bit spicy  They advertise that it's very spicy but maybe I'm just used to spicy food or they adjusted the spice level for other patrons to enjoy. The flavour was okay but the soup was a little oily and dense. I only drank water to get rid of the oily taste not because of the non-existant spice. The bamboo shoots taste better on their own than in this ramen. They load this ramen with veggies which is really nice!

Their pan fried pork gyoza and takoyaki were good.

Tip: Ask for the takoyaki to be served first because it'll get soggy later from the sauces on top.

I probably wouldn't go back unless I was nearby and craving ramen. 

It's 3.5 for the ramen but round to 4 for appetizers and service."}
{"text":"This was the little brother of ramen ishiin from Vancouver. I've had their red miso ramen with a chicken karaage rice combo. Their broth was very flavourful and I like how they added minced pork along with their bean sprout topping!  I'd definitely recommend people to try this place if they're in the area.

I went during a cold winter night and the downside was that the heating wasn't consistent.  BUT since it was ramen the warmth of the food and the soup make up for the slightly colder restaurant temperature.  I will come back in the summer!"}
{"text":"This place was really good. I had the spicy ramen and it was delicious. We also had fried chicken and my two year old daughter had rice, which seems to be one of the only things she eats rn. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Very good ramen place. Thanks, dudes!"}
{"text":"Very pricey for what it is. The bowl size is huge however taste was like instant ramen. There were only 2 slices of pork. We ended up paying like 55$ for two people (1 beer each) and left with a stomach full of liquid."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. The space was neat and well lit with a nice modern decor. I had the \"Spicy\" Black Tan Tan Ramen. It was served with a side of black sesame seeds, which you could crush with the pestle and mortar provided. The flavour of the Tan Tan ramen broth was incredible and the crushed sesame seeds made it even better. The takoyaki was also pretty good. I would definitely return for the Tan Tan ramen. I rate the taste of ramen made here  up there with the best but they don't have the same variety."}
{"text":"I always order their karage chicken rice snacker and the red bean miso ramen.
The noodles are perfect, the ingredients are good quality.
It's pricy for Ramen considering it is so close to Chinatown options, but I think it's definitely worth it.
The service is always great and the cooks and servers always seem to be in a great mood. I can't wait to come back and get my regular order."}
{"text":"I love trying out different ramen shops in Toronto. First time coming here with my partner. I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen $13.9. It was delicious, pork belly slices were tender and succulent. The broth was delicious - mild spicy, I probably would request it to be a little more spicy next time. A little sad that it doesn't come with an egg - I guess that is the norm with ramen shops these days. We also ordered the Chicken Karaage $5.2 - delicious as well. Nice and hot crispy exterior with juicy chicken inside. 

The service was good, it is busy during rush hour! Street parking outside. We would likely come here again to enjoy some delicious ramen!"}
{"text":"As someone who doesn't like to eat ramen, because I normally don't find the broth or noodles anything special to return to, this is my favourite place and I've been back 2 or 3 times already. The price is good and the noodles are made with the right amount of chewiness. Not to mention, the broth is really good. I've tried the Black Sesame Tan Tan (which was absolutely delicious and not overwhelmingly spicy) as well as the White Sesame Shio (good but the black sesame one was better, I also couldn't quite grasp the whole grind-your-own sesame gimmick). I've also had the chicken karaage don on the side as an add-on combo, which was good, but there's not much chicken there- perhaps maybe 4 pieces or so. 

The walk-in waiting times aren't too bad, although I was surprised to have a 30min wait on a regular Monday night. However, the food comes quickly once you order. I do enjoy the wall seatings, meant for individuals, but can also work for a party of 2. There's more than enough space for you to pivot yourself to slightly face your friend for conversing while still being able to eat."}
{"text":"Okay, so here's the deal. I embarrassingly couldn't mask my noodle craving following a viewing of David Chang's \"Noodle\" episode of PBS's \"Mind of a Chef.\" I immediately browsed through Yelp to find vegetarian ramen in the city. Ramen Isshin appeared to be the most popular spot for such a request.

I had lunch here today, and upon entering the store, my brother and I were greeted in an extremely friendly manner by the front staff and the chefs. We were seated immediately and I ordered the Spicy Vegetarian Red Miso Ramen. My brother got the Vegetarian Shoyu Ramen. Our food arrived in less than 10 minutes, and the speediness didn't bother me much, as I could see all the fresh cooking that was going on at the front of the store!

My ramen was presented beautifully! Vibrant, exciting colours filled the bowl- the red of the chill oil, the grassy green of the onions, and the contrasting earthy brown mushrooms and tofu. I tried the soup first and was blown away! It was incredibly seasoned, with hints of ginger, miso (of course), and a wonderful balance of spices. I'm no ramen expert, but this broth tasted incredible. Next, the tofu and mushrooms tasted extremely fresh and accompanied the broth perfectly. The noodles had a nice bite to them, and I slurped the entire contents of the bowl quite quickly. I was worried the ramen would be TOO spicy for me, but it really wasn't. Instead, it had just the right hints of heat, chill, and salt. My brother enjoyed his ramen as well.

I felt that the prices were reasonable, but the portion was wayyyyy too large for both my brother and I. We noticed others in the restaurant didn't appear to have problems downing their ramen, so it may just be our tiny stomachs and their incapabilities of eating a lot at once. I wish Ramen Isshin offered sizes, even if the prices were similar. I hate leaving a restaurant feeling bloated and almost unable to walk."}
{"text":"Pretty sure this is my favourite ramen in the city. I'm typically not very critical of ramen in general, but Isshin hits it home with their noodle (springy and just the right 'thin-ness') and their super flavourful broth (not too salty but packed with taste). Also love their variety of broths as well (spicy red miso yum!!). Their sesame shio ramen has a little mortar and pestle type thing that you grind the sesame in before you sprinkle it over your bowl (super cool). Lots of space usual, and comfortable seating (unlike other ramen joints in the city). Oh and for our vegetarians friends, there are vegetarian ramen options that are honestly just as good as their meat counterparts!"}
{"text":"So delicious! We ordered the okonomiyaki, white shio ramen, and the spicy miso ramen. The okonomiyaki was delicious and I highly recommend it. It's a slightly crispy pancake with a soft center filled with green onions and bits of octopus and bonito flakes on top and drizzled in sauce. The white shio ramen was a tad on the salty side but I really enjoyed having to grind up my own white sesame for my ramen! The spicy miso ramen was the best and had a slight kick. Service was excellent - our drinks were always full and we always were checked up on to see how we were doing and if everything tasted well. I loved how tender the chashu pork was and the ramen had the perfect chew to it! Super authentic ramen joint and I highly recommend. This place is super tiny so be prepared to wait for a table! If you're driving there's a public lot you can pay $8 at and walk less than 1 minute to get to the restaurant!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular. The vegetarian red spicy miso noodles is my favourite. They've always been very friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Checking out other Ramen spots in Toronto, Ramen Isshin hit our list as one of the better ones worth checking out. We decided to brave the frigid cold and walk over here from down town Toronto. After a 30 minute walk in cold weather, we made it and unfortunately ran into a long queue. Thankfully we didn't have to wait outside (like we did at Sansotei). 

We ended up getting a spicy miso ramen and achicken karaage don to share. My girlfriend really seemed to like the ramen but I don't share the same sentiment. I thought it was good and certainly better than most places in Philadelphia, but below average when compared to the typical ramen spot in LA. For $16 CAD, I felt as if there wasn't enough meat (two little slices!) and enough noodles. The broth itself lacked the depth I look for in a nice bowl of ramen and I found the items within the bowl itself to be quite lackluster in regards to flavor and texture. The karaage don at $6 CAD seemed to lack at value with one piece of chicken. The texture of the rice and flavor of the dish as a whole were on point though. 

Decent experience, not worth the wait IMO. Sansotei would be my go-to if I ever make it back to Toronto."}
{"text":"DAMN THIS PLACE IS GOOD! I don't eat ramen that often but now I think I might be obsessed.  We arrived here on a random Wednesday night and the wait was about 30 minutes for a table.  After finally getting seated at a shared table, I reviewed the menu and decided I was in the mood for something spicy.  I went for the Spicy Red Miso Ramen and my friend went for the Red Dragon Ramen (extra spicy).  For an app we shared the gyoza.  The gyoza came out very quickly and they were very delicious...it's rare to have bad gyoza IMO.  The ramen came out within 10 minutes and it was a large bowl full of delicious pork, noodles, chilli oil, onions, mushrooms, carrot, green onions and the most TASTY broth ever.  I was super impressed by the perfection in this bowl and can't wait to come back here to try the other ramen items.  From what I can tell, this place is always busy so be prepared to wait...totally worth it though!"}
{"text":"I have to visit this location one more time (and I'll update if anything changes), but the ramen was really good. I was actually pretty surprised how good it was considering the fact that I really didn't want ramen (I know, it happens), and my friend wanted some."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this place so I decided to try it. I tried their white sesame shio ramen! Was delicious. The line was fairly long but it was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"As many comment said,the ramen is good but not the best, the soup is too clear and lack of ramen smell. Taste like instant noodle soup. The ramen noodle itself is very good . 
The price is not bad 8.5-12$ for the ramen and you can add rice bowl for 3.5$ in the set. Special ramen cost about 14 $ . The portion of ramen is big and enough for 1 meal. This place also have Ramune \" a special Japanese pop, which is my favorite (3$ each) 
Good atmosphere and good service. The taste of ramen I give 2.5 stars , I don't feel like I want to comeback again for a ramen . Overall rate 3 star because the service , atmosphere and variety of the menu ."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. A little on the small side, but amazing ramen."}
{"text":"Authentic af. Jubilant atmosphere, but expect a long wait. The people working there actually speak Japanese and know the culture, so I guess they are nihon-jin.

The miso ramen was delicious. I had a sip of the black tan tan sesame broth and it was also something to write home about. 

We had takoyaki (octopus dumplings) for an app and the bonito flakes were the best I've had in Canada... there were five pieces for the two of us, so that was an awkward number. Even if there were three of us.

Sake shot in wooden box for over fill of liquid (pour it into the glass, dont drink from the wood box) and saying otototoo and everyone cheering: just do it. 

After feeling full and warm inside on a damp winter day, the burps that followed while walking around Kensington Market solidified the fact that the ramen was a good choice.

Arigato!"}
{"text":"I'm no ramen expert, but Isshin stands out against other ramen joints I've eaten at. I ordered the spicy miso plus chicken karaage. This place is BUS-Y. We waited about 40 minutes for a table, but once we were seated things rolled out quick."}
{"text":"I'm not really a ramen fan but I've tried quite a few in the area and this is probably one of the better places. The restaurant is pretty big imo unlike other ramen places lol pretty spacious. They have solo tables that face the wall, much like a lot of ramen places in Japan. 

I ordered the dipping ramen dish, where all the ingredients are separated from the soup. The soup is super condensed, Brothy and flavourful, so using a little bit can already be a bit overwhelming. Just dip your noodles for a bit for a huge splash of flavour! You can really taste the flavour of the broth, it's super rich. The egg was great, still runny and has a sweet flavour. 
The best part is the noodle though.. Omg so chewy and thick! Not a bad chewy but it has got a really really good bouncy texture, it tastes good even when it's cold and not in the soup lol. They give two pieces of meat like every other place, and unfortunately it's a really thin (like less than 1cm). 

We also ordered the edamame, they put some sort of miso soya sauce in place of salt which makes it have a really good aroma and taste. But it's extremely salty.. After the fifth one I can feel my tongue getting irritated from the high amount of sodium. 

The karaage was good but wasn't mjnd blowing, the batter is a little light but the seasoning was on point with mayo and lemon on the side. They give you four medium sized pieces for $4.9

For dessert we ordered the Mochi ice cream in green tea and black sesame. I never had Mochi ice cream and so when I had this I wasn't really blown awAy. It's literally Mochi texture wrapped around ice cream lol I don't know what I was expecting, it sounded amazing. It's fun to try and a pain to take split pieces apart."}
{"text":"I had the shio ramen, and it was everything tonkotsu ramen should be. The broth was rich and creamy, the noodles chewy but not undercooked, and the refill option was very generous (basically the same amount of noodles as the dish originally had). I also got the karaage don, which was very nice - chicken was juicy, perfect ratio of mayo, rice well-seasoned - and an absolute steal at $3.80.

Delicious food at unbeatable prices? I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Chicken Karaage and Spicy Red Miso Ramen .... yum!   Good service and a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ramen Isshin is a ramen establishment that opened in 2012 by the same people behind Cabbagetown's Kingyo. 

To start, we were introduced to this summer's special, the Isshin Summer Cold Ramen; a bowl of signature thin wavy noodles, wok fried ground red miso tofu mince, fresh sliced okra, kimchi, wood ear mushrooms, topped with sweet white onions, diced tofu, deep fried onions, green onions, and a slice of lime. There was also an option to add additional toppings like marinated egg (+$1.50) or make it non-vegetarian by adding cha shu (+$2.80). The ramen was super refreshing to eat, especially in this heatwave that we've been experiencing lately. It was also generously topped with loads of toppings, and the broth was pretty light. This bowl of ramen is only available until the end of August.

Age Tofu (Vegan) ($4.90) - Deep fried tofu drizzled in a home made chilli oil and sweet soy topped with green onions. Note that this appetizer is also vegan, so it would be a great alternative for those who have specific dietary restrictions. 

Lately, I have been craving Tako Yaki ($4.90) -  deep fried battered octopus formed into balls topped with bonito flakes, takoyaki sauce & kupe mayo, so of course I had to try the ones here. Each order came with 6 bountiful pieces of octopus balls that were generously topped with mayonnaise, and bonito flakes. The takoyaki was crispy on the outside, and the interior was filled with tender octopus pieces. The ones here from Ramen Isshin was one of the better takoyaki balls that I have tried. 

For my main choice of ramen, I opted for the Spicy Red Miso Ramen ($13.90) - house made chilli oil, Isshin Red Miso blend, wok fried pork, onions, bean sprouts, carrots, wood ear mushrooms, chives, green onions, pork belly cha shu & thick twisty noodles. I loved the chewy texture of the noodles, and the broth was perfect, as it was flavorful without being overly rich or oily. I prefer spicy broths, and the ramen definitely delivered. Don't forget to cool yourself off with their drinks selection including iced coffee with milk or a pitcher of Sapporo beer.

In my opinion, Ramen Isshin is a solid ramen joint, and you should definitely check it out. Don't forget to drop by to try their new summer ramen before it ends after August."}
{"text":"I always get nervous about trying a new ramen place in fear that it will be disappointing. We had the miso and the spicy miso, both were delicious and satisfied the craving! It was flavorful without being overly heavy/greasy. The thickness of the noodles were perfect.
I mostly enjoyed the vegetables on top and wished there were more. 
The service was fantastic. Our son had the okonomiyaki which was also quite good although perhaps a little heavy on the sauce. 
Could not give 5 stars bc the broth could have been more rich, it also does not come with any egg or menma."}
{"text":"This place is rAM(en)AZING (I know, I know, that was a stretch).

I've only ever had ramen here. And it's only ever been packed. I'm not from Japan but I've watched a lot of food programming on Netflix so that must make me qualified enough to say...this is authentically delicious stuff.

I tend to go for the tan tan black sesame ramen. Extra egg, because it's delicious and jammy and perfect.

Prices are reasonable, service is brisk, waits are to be expected.

Yelp note: like it extra spicy? You can get it extra spicy!"}
{"text":"Delicious! By far the best ramen I've had in Toronto. This place does it right - no fancy interior, just great food. Try the spicy miso ramen and the karage (fried chicken)."}
{"text":"This is literally the best vegetarian Ramen I've had. It was so flavorful and delicious. We also sampled the Age tofu and fried chicken appetizer and they were both absolutely mouth-watering. YOU MUST EAT HERE!!!  We will definitely be back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to at least 6 different Ramen places here, and this is by far my favourite.

Their strength is the broth. Noodles are fine, not amazingly good. Actually at my recent visit, the noodles came too soft, which is why I'm giving 4 stars.

I highly recommend their most popular Miso ramens. The regular Miso is rather sweet, so if you like savoury/more spicy, you can go for Spicy Miso or Red Dragon. Note that Spicy Miso actually is not spicy at all--but it does taste good. One day, I felt like trying something else and had their Black Sesame Tantan Noodle--although I love Tantan men a lot, this one wasn't satisfying.

Their karaage (comes with around 4 pieces, small-medium) with garlic mayo is another good side dish you can add!

Also, if you have a company who is vegetarian and still want to eat ramen, this place suites your need. They have a  good variety of vegetarian menu! My friend absolutely enjoyed her vege ramen."}
{"text":"They have two types of yummy vegan ramen! The service is quick and friendly, and they offer noodle refills. Great spot!"}
{"text":"I have been searching for ramen that is light but still flavorful, and here it is! The Asari Light Shoyu Ramen!!! I see myself coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"Love the black sesame broth, ramen is light yet flavourful."}
{"text":"Spicy vegetarian red miso ramen was outstanding.  Restaurant is simply setup.  Delicious ramen."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!

The ramens! Spicy Red Miso is popular! Kotteri Rich Shoyu is creamy! Black sesame tan tan noodle is unique! 

We tried Spicy Red Miso ramen and Kotteri Rich Shoyu ramen and both were full of flavor. Too bad it's only two slices of meat per bowl, but each bowl can definitely fill you up. 

Spicy Red Miso has more shredded meats and bean sprouts. It is on the spicy side, but it's not unbearably spicy. Good for cold winter days! Kotteri has half of an egg and seaweed too, and it's really creamy! If you like creamy soup bases, then you'll like the Kotteri ramen. 

We also ordered takoyaki which was nice too. Freshly fried to order and lots of octopus pieces in each ball. The dish is also topped with dried shavings of squid! 

LAST TIP?!

It's REALLY busy and too bad they don't take reservations. You can certainly put your name down and ask how long the wait is. I've seen people put down their name and come back awhile later after they find out how long the wait is and they don't lose their spot in the line! You might have to share a table with another pair of diners if you get a table for four and you're in a pair yourself. So get comfortable with that!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and the most friendly and good service, there's usually a line up but it is definitely worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome! We came for the 4 year anniversary. They kept refilling our Sapporo pints and gave free sake shots. Only suggestion is to keep the food nice and hot. The owners were so friendly. Looking forward to the other location."}
{"text":"BF enjoyed his spicy miso ramen. I got the garlic ramen--this was alright, had a burnt garlic flavor which I didn't care for, not sure if that's the profile they were going for or not. Service and ambiance is great. I'd come again next time and try something else. Overall, not the best ramen I've had but I enjoy the atmosphere and the prices are great."}
{"text":"Assembly Hall is spacious with a cool ambiance which boosts my review of Ramen Isshin to 5*.  I got the Kotteri Rich Shoyu Ramen.  The broth is thick and a bit oily and has a bold flavor, it's pretty fantastic.  Mixing in the dried seaweed from time to time made a boost in flavor.  The egg was cooked perfectly - gooey yolk but not runny and the portion was perfect for me.  
Try the Ramune drink if you've never had it before.  It's soda but has a crispness to it that makes it more refreshing."}
{"text":"Spicy miso veggie ramen is to die for. I say this as someone who gave his life for a bowl of noodles, writing you from the grave."}
{"text":"Had a craving for ramen today, so some friends and I ended up here and even though we had to wait an hour for a table (it was a really busy night) the service was really fast and the staff were really friendly. This is probably going to be my favourite restaurant to get ramen in town. I really do recommend the Red Dragon Ramen which albeit on the heavier side, was really delicious. Their soft boiled eggs are a thing of beauty!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place as it had the extra-hungry combo (ramen + donburi) and sesame crushed topping on the side. The prices where right: Tan Tan Black Sesame Ramen $10.90 + $3.50 don combo. 
I found the broth to be really salty. Came home thirsty as a camel. And I had drank a glass and a half of water at the restaurant. The ramen wasn't at all bad, but also wasn't the greatest. The cha shu was thinly sliced and a bit over-cooked. There are $8.90 ramen options, as well vegetarian options.  This is a good place to go if you're on a budget, good value for dollar."}
{"text":"Open by the same people of the popular Kingyo Izakaya, Isshin Ramen (@ramenisshin) sound promising. Ben being the ramen fanatic thathe is have been wanting to try them out even before it opens. So this past Saturday after a cold outdoor event, we decided to head there to warm up with a bowl of ramen.

 I have to say this is a rather good location , away from all the other ramen shops on Dandas. They do not have a sign up yet when we went and we basically parked right in front of it without noticing it.

There's not much to talk about decor wise, very basic with the open kitchen by the front and a dragon mural along one side of the wall.

At Isshin Ramen, they have a total of 8 ramen to choose from including 2 vegetarian options.

Japatine $5.20
~ Fresh cut fries topped with fresh mozzarella, Japanese curry gravy, seaweed & green onions
~ Love the name, the presentation and it look great on picture but it lack all the yummy sloppy goodness of a poutine. 
~ As you can see, it's rather dry with barely any gravy that I couldn't really taste the curry flavor. Also wish there was more cheese.

Tonkotsu Shio \"Sesame\" Ramen $8.95
~ Pure tonkotsu broth seasoned with a blend of natural salts, topped with sesame seed, bamboo shoots, black wood ear mushrooms, marinated soft boiled egg, slow braised pork belly cha-shu, green onions & thin wavy noodles.
~ I wouldn't say it was bad but there was nothing outstanding compare to the other ramen places. 
~ The noodle had a slight soapy taste while the broth was good, it was not amazing. 
~ Love the motar & pestle sesame which was definitely fun to grind up and it does change the flavor of the broth in a very subtle way, that's why we were encourage to add it half way through.

 Tonkotsu Shoyu \"Roasted Garlic\" Ramen $8.95
~ Isshin tonkotsu broth blended with Koji's homemade shoyu, roasted garlic oil, green onions, bamboo shoots, marinated soft boiled egg, pork belly cho-shu & thin wavy noodle
~ Ben somehow wanted this one which was a surprise since we normally avoid strng flavor topping when trying a ramen place for the first time so that we can taste the broth better. 
~ Wish we had a regular tonkotsu shoyu since I really would love to taste their homemade shoyu (soya) in it. 

The roasted garlic oil was definitely too much and way too overpowering here.

Verdict :
~ Good but nothing outstanding / amazing
~ I will probably stick with my old faves"}
{"text":"tldr: Authentic Japanese ramen for agreeable prices. Japanese-speaking staff. More than just ramen offered here. 

The girlfriend and I came here on a whim. It was the closest better-than 4 star ramen joint in the area. It did not disappoint. Cozy waiting area, spacious seating, Japanese-speaking staff, and punctual service. The food was amazing too: ramen broth (light) was just right. They offer kaedama (extra noodles) for less than a couple dollars. The appetizers are amazing. They also list the best selling items on the wall, if you need help deciding."}
{"text":"The best ramen in Toronto!!!! I can't believe the vegetarian ramen was so delicious!!"}
{"text":"I love Ramen Isshin, for its Service, Food, and Ambiance.

SERVICE - top-notch

1. The servers are always so friendly (as you'd expect from an authentic Japanese restaurant). 

2. They will accommodate your needs. I don't want to trouble them too much, but if you ask for \"less salty broth\" or \"package half of the okonomiyaki to go\", they will help accommodate. 


FOOD - unbeatable selection

1. Ramen: you have several broth to choose from. On top of the tradition 3 salt (shio), soy sauce (shoyu), and miso, it also has the Tan Tan (Chinese-Japanese hybrid with sesame and chili) version to choose from. 

* also note, you can ask for Kaedama for an extra round of noodles for when you have broth leftover.

2. Okonomiyaki: much better than Okonomi House. This item is in the menu, but since it doesn't have a picture, it's kind of hidden under the Appetizer section. I could be wrong, but I think this is the Osaka-style okonomiyaki.

3. Karaage: the deep fried chicken is the best I've had. It's very crispy, and has deeply soaked flavour. 

4. Mango Pudding: a little expensive at $3.80, but it's definitely worth it to get this freshly made daily dessert. The cool, sweet taste perfectly complements the hot, salty ramen you had earlier. 


AMBIANCE - comforting

The wooden interior, with ink calligraphy on the walls teleports you away from the Downtown rush. I especially love the wooden spoons for the ramen. So much better than silverware to keep you immersed.


In summary, Ramen Isshin keeps me going back to it again and again. Sometimes, I go back twice in one day..."}
{"text":"Nice ramen place at the west side. 

Broth is heavy in spices and salty. Pork is the right combination of fatty and lean, although the portion is small (only 2 thin pieces in my Black Tan Tan). 

Noodles are a bit curly (I wouldn't say they are instant noodles, but definitely not \"straight\" noodles), and there is no choice of thin or thick. 

Overall a good Raman experience and a cool place to eat with friends!"}
{"text":"The black sesame and white sesame ramen are terrific. Good service. Decently comfortable seating if you arrive early."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the years and it is always my go-to ramen spot. Returning earlier today, it has clearly gotten more popular over time as there was quite a wait at 3 PM. No matter. We had a beer at Sneaky Dee's and returned in time to be seated at the long bar against the back wall.

What impresses me most about Ramen Isshin compared to other places in the city is the variety of ramen on offer, all of high quality. There are several styles and flavourings and their vegetarian ramens are not merely an afterthought. The egg addition is a necessity and I usually request a second bowl of noodles mid-way through my meal as the broth is just too delicious to let go to waste."}
{"text":"Ok I am going to take some flack here, I came BECAUSE of the the ratings here and am a bit surprised. I love love love Ajisan Ramen, I was expecting this place which has a better rating and is claimed to be authentic would blow my socks off .....nope
Price is great , 
Service is wonderful 
But the garlic ramen was weak ( almost water) 
The spicy ramen was simply not 
And the appetizer ball things were really chewy 
Not for me ...... Back to AjiSan ramen"}
{"text":"Slowly becoming my go to ramen place over Sansotei. Never thought I'd say that but the garlic ramen and the tsukemen makes me keep coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"Holy moly, this place is good. I'm obsessed with tonkotsu ramen, and Isshin's Kotteri Rich Shoyu delivers. As more and more ramen joints have cropped up across the city, I've always found that I've preferred Sansotei but the broth at Isshin might - *gulp!* dare I say it? - be even better. It's just as richly porky but more complex. The toppings are basic but perfect - they don't need anything more. The pork is always thinly sliced and delicate, just like in Japan, whereas at Sansotei their quality control sometimes slips slightly in the form of thicker chashu. 

They use thinner noodles for this particular ramen, and I like it, but I wish they'd undercook it just a bit
more so that they can stay chewier longer. And there's more oil on the broth than I'd like, but it's not a dealbreaker. It's just that they seem to keep the temperature a bit on the crisp side in Assembly Chef Hall, so the fat on top starts to congeal in like 10 seconds if you don't touch certain parts of the bowl. 

I've also tried their black sesame tantanmen. It was good but I prefer the plain tonkotsu - I seem to prefer sesame in sweet applications, and I found that the sesame flavour kind of overpowered the glorious porky base. But it was good. 

I also really enjoy their house-made ginger ale. It's super delicious and refreshing - kind of like a cross between ginger ale and a citrus pop like Sprite - but with a gentle kick, a slight spiciness. Super delicious. 

I was originally a little dismayed to see that their prices here are higher than their restaurant at College but if you factor in the TTC fare required to go there (I can easily walk to the Assembly Chef Hall location), it all evens out. Actually, I might even save a buck or two by staying in the downtown core. So it's a non-issue. 

Highly recommended for ramen fans!"}
{"text":"I had the garlic roasted soyu soup based ramen with a side of mentaiko rice bow.  Overall, pretty decent taste.  The noodle was very good and chewy.  The soup was good but very salty - next time I will ask for half salt, if there is such optiom. The mentaiko was also quite salty but I am not taking it against the shop because it is supposed to be.  I am taking a star off because even though the place had three tables with customers, no one came back to refill my water, which I desperately needed to quench my thirst from good tasting but quite salty soup base."}
{"text":"I eat ramen all around the world. One of the first things I do when I get to a new city is eat ramen. So let me tell you, I have eaten a lot of ramen and this is goooooooooddd. I ordered the shio and it was delicious. I expected a clear broth but got a cloudy one instead. While it looks a bit weird, the flavour is a deep rich velvet - you can tell the broth has taken a while to make."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I were craving for ramen so I found this place on Yelp for us to try. It's so close to our work and accessible via the PATH. Ramen Isshin is located in the Assembly Hall which also has many other options as well. 

I ordered the Kotteri Rich Shoyu Ramen for lunch. It came out to $15 and change. My ramen was ready in under 5 minutes. Quickest ramen served ever! The broth was rich and delicious. The pork belly was nice and tender. There was nothing bad about the ramen to complain about. I will definitely be returning for ramen again!"}
{"text":"Flavorful ramen broth and delicious soft boiled egg.

The ramen came out piping hot and the presentation looked really appetizing. The noodles were similar to other ramen places and the pork cha shu was sliced extremely thin. The broth was really good, just wanted to slurp it all up. The best part was the soft boiled egg, it was done perfectly. Creamy sweet centre, soft shoyu exterior. Dessert presentation was simple and was packed full of mango.

Overall, the ramen was a bit too salty but would consider going back to try one with the \"grind your own sesame\"."}
{"text":"Friendly little restaurant.  I found the ramen on the salty side, but I find all ramen salty...the chicken karaage was great!  The moshi was still too frozen but edible. I would probably eat here again."}
{"text":"This is my favourite ramen joint in Toronto. Maybe North America (still exploring but yes, so far better than some places I've tried in San Francisco, Vancouver, Boston, etc). The dipping ramen (tsukemen) is life changing. Yes, it's salty at first but just dip your noodles for less time and it will taste heavenly. And no, don't drink the soup... 

So hearty and delicious. The Chicken karaage is also amazing."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while downtown and craving ramen. Love the atmosphere here very lively and great service. Ordered ramen and takoyaki. Everything was very delicious! Food came fast and hot! Exactly what I needed at the time. opened late. The prices very good and food was very good portion size :) will visit again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My first taste of non-instant ramen. From out of town and I'd gladly drive the 4 hours to Toronto just to have this ramen. The shoyu was fantastic."}
