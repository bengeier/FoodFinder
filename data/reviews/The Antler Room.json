{"text":"Tucked away under The Loose Moose, The Antler Room includes all the highlights of its big brother upstairs without the crowd.   THE GOOD: - TAR shares their menu with TLM, which is a collection of good, wholesome pub grub: sandwiches, poutine, quesadillas, nachos and more. There's also salads and bowls for folks looking for a healthier option. We went with the quesadillas and nachos with chicken (and of course we piled on that guac for an extra $2.25). Both were tasty and generously sized.  - Shoutout to our awesome server who gave us extra sour cream for free. Bonus points because she brought not one, but two tubs of extra sour cream - it's like she read our minds and knew we each needed our own.  - For my beer drinkers, TLM and TAR pride themselves on offering the most beers on tap in downtown Toronto.  - To put it simply, it's a great alternative when TLM is too packed. We visited this past Wednesday, and all we wanted was a place to grab a quick bite before the Raptors game. Jack Astor's @ University/Front was a 40-minute wait for a table and TLM was also full, so TAR was our saving grace.   THE BAD: - I'm docking one star (and in reality, 1-and-a-half stars) for food quality. I did enjoy my food, but it's definitely not the best pub fare you can find in Toronto.   Overall, I would give The Antler Room a solid 3.5/5 (rounded up to 4 on the Yelp scale). For those looking to unwind with some drinks and escape the hustle and bustle of The Loose Moose, look no further than this little oasis one floor below."}
{"text":"The back alley to get into the place gives it a sketchy feeling, and the junky storage when you come down the stairs doesn't make it much better. Once you actually get into the place it's pretty nice looking, but during my visit there was a cover band playing that was so loud my ears were ringing. You know... when you're at a concert that's so loud that you're pretty sure you're getting hearing damage (fuzzy ears), and you've forgotten your ear plugs? Yeah. It's a pretty small place for such serious volume. My BF and I stayed for a drink (which was expensive for the over-shaken foamy mess that it was), sat in the far corner to protect our ears and left quickly. It really is a shame because it has the potential to be a nice place."}
{"text":"After a few drinks at a sports bar, we wanted something a bit more exciting and kind of stumbled on this place by mistake. It was a great mistake though. They had live music, people were dancing and the crowd ages ranged from twenties to forties.  The beer list is pretty comprehensive (and includes my favorite Granville Island winter ale). No cover so no complaints here. Pretty varied crowd inside. The bartender said it varies depending on what event is on."}
{"text":"I went with a friend to have dinner quickly before the Leafs game. The wait staff were really rude, we had to get our own menus, and hail a waitress 3 times before anybody came by to take our orders. It was really frustrating but the food was actually really good.  I had the tandoori shrimp salad and it was excellent"}
{"text":"I am writing this today to voice my disgust for the outrageous, rude and disturbing behaviour put forth by the bar tender at the Antler room one Friday night 3 or 4 weeks before Christmas.     I came into your establishment with a group of friends (7 or 8) some of whom were from out of town and we were looking for a small bite to eat and drink and to generally catch up. I asked the door person when we entered if there was a kitchen that was open downstairs (Antler room) he said, \"everything was the same as up stairs\" so we went in and sat ourselves down at one of the tables near the stage. All of your tables were empty, we were the only ones except for the patrons at the wood of the bar itself. We waited several minutes then realized there was probably no table service so we ordered from the bar. I asked if the kitchen was open and the bartender gave me a menu. I quickly decided on 2lbs wings because he looked busy and I didn't want to take all day ordering. He gave us our beers and we sat down.      When the wings were ready rather then bring them to the table the inept bartender somehow thought it acceptable to shake the basket of wings at me from behind the bar as to say \"come get your wings\" I was recovering from a knee accident and was having some difficulty walking so I motioned for my cousin who had his back to the bar to grab them but it was a futile effort as the band was playing and could not hear above the music. Your bartender, then enraged, stormed over to my table and threw the wings on the table and immediately stormed off. No napkins! No plates! No cutlery! NOTHING! Everyone in my party was thrown back and proceeded to discuss this rude and offensive behaviour of this bartender. He did not come back to check up on us nor did anyone come to the table at any point during the evening (which was short lived) to offer drinks or even check in.      In my whole life I have never been treated with such disrespect, rudeness and aggression at a restaurant or bar. I have never felt the need to write a review or voice my dissatisfaction online. EVER.  But this was just way beyond anything I've ever experienced. When I went to the bar to pay my tab $64 or $74, I decided not to leave a tip and didn't think the bartender was going to expect one. The change from my bill was .25 I left the coin and walked away. And here is where it gets interesting... The bartender obviously offended thought it proper to come from behind the bar as I was putting my coat on and slam the quarter on the table in a confrontational manner and say something along the lines of \"you need this more then I do\" (he couldn't bring the wings to the table but had no trouble walking a quarter over) I then walked it back to the bar and said no it's actually for you. I went to speak with a manager and kindly declined the offer of a round of drinks on the house. Thanks but no thanks.      I sincerely hope that this individual is no longer employed at your company as this person has no place in the hospitality industry and is an extremely poor representation of your restaurant/ bar and ultimately your brand."}
{"text":"was looking for a place to grab a quick bite before the raps vs knicks game but it seemed like everywhere was pretty full. managed to get a table here.   i ordered the woody. burger was juicy and flavourful. didn't fall apart and get super messy on me like many burgers often do. and fries were standard pub fries (fillers). overall, it was a decent, burger. nothing that blew my mind but not terrible either so i'd say a 3 star is fair.  friend said his tandoori shrimp rice bowl was lacking in shrimp though."}
{"text":"I thought I was in the Loose Moose but I realize now I was actually in the Antler Room, which is the basement of the Loose Moose, as far as I can tell.  Came here after a Leafs game and saw a bunch of Leafs fans as well as a lot of Blue Jays fans queued up to get in.  I recalled some buddies of mine went to the Moose last year so decided to see what the fuss was about.  Went downstairs to the Antler Room and it was crowded but service was pretty good.  Beer was so-so.  A lot of mass market stuff but it was cheap so I stuck with Molson.  I figured I'd have a beer and split, just so I could tell my friends I was there.  However, they had a band and they were so great I ended up staying for three sets and several beers.    The band, Mumble, was amazing.  I really liked them a lot.  They put the crowd in a good mood and people were pretty friendly.  It was easy to get a beer, I was able to keep my spot at a little table by one of the big pillars and it was quite an enjoyable time.  Restrooms were fairly clean.  So, what you have is inexpensive beer, nice people, great venue, terrific band.  That's four stars in my book, baby."}
{"text":"Fast. Good food and a nice selection of beer.   Check it out for sure if you are downtown and want an alternative to the chair restaurants."}
