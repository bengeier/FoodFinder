{"text":"Angkor, I want to love you. I really do. You just make it so hard for me, sometimes.   I've been coming to Angkor off an on for several years now. I found them through Restaurant.com, a service that offers discounted dining certificates for partnered restaurants in the area. The first visit, I only went there because I could use the certificates, but over time I found myself enjoying the place more and more.  There are few restaurants more attractive than Angkor, especially located in a strip mall. When diners walk in, the first thing they probably notice are the carved, gilded walls. It's not a huge dining room, but the tables are spaced apart nicely and the decor is top notch. It's very, very attractive inside. I've been there a dozen times or more now and each time I walk through the door I'm struck by the beauty of the place.  The menu is decent, and the prices are not too extravagant. I think the problem lies in availability and service.   My boyfriend loves their haw mook, a shredded fish steamed with coconut milk and curry in a banana-leaf cup. We used to drive across the city sometimes just so he could have it, and more than once we showed up on a Friday or Saturday evening to find out they weren't serving it that night. I completely understand that weekends are incredibly busy and stressful in the restaurant business, but it's listed on the menu as a regular item. The last time we were there, two or three weeks ago, we were told the haw mook is made in advance and when they run out, it's gone for the night. Wouldn't it make sense to list this on the menu as subject to availability, the way seasonal items are listed as market price on other restaurant menus? A sidebar marking on the menu may be enough of a warning to convince people to call ahead before showing up, instead of assuming it is a constant like we did. After the first two \"sorry, we don't have that tonight,\" replies we finally asked about it and were told about the advance preparation.   We've also gone here with other couples several times, and have been disappointed by the service. I've made reservations (more than once) that were lost, and twice now we've ordered food that's taken upwards of an hour to receive, even when we were one of a handful of groups in the restaurant. If I have to go out for dinner during the weekend, I do so either very early or after a dinner rush, so I'm not making a nuisance of myself or stressing out the servers, and still we've gotten mediocre service at Angkor. Once, over the summer, all of our dishes were served except my boyfriend's, and he had already been turned down over the haw mook. After deciding on something else, his order was apparently lost. We had to eat before him while he waited for his meal to be made, and this was after waiting at least forty minutes (possibly more) for ours. All in all it took over two hours to order, eat and manage to pay our bill.   I love the food at Angkor. I've never been disappointed with anything I've chosen. The tilapia dishes are excellent (when they have them, as they've run completely out of it before, in addition to the premade haw mook), as are all of the noodle and curry options. Unfortunately, sometimes I've had to jump through hoops or exercise extreme patience in order to receive dinner.   We've found several places closer that serve haw mook on a regular basis and have never let us down, so we most likely won't be going out of our way to visit Angkor again. However, if I'm in the area I'll still stop in. The food's worth it, so long as the place isn't busy. If I lived closer to the city, I'd make a habit of coming here on the weekday evenings to avoid any issues, but that's not an option for me now. I'll be reserving Angkor for the occasional in the neighborhood treat from now on."}
{"text":"Great for vegetarians....   The veggie skewers were out of the world. All Vegetarian dishes we ordered were amazing. I would highly recommend this Cambodian Thai fusion cousine."}
{"text":"Stongly recommend if you stay in greentree nearby. Tasteful food, good service. You can choose favorite spicy level."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  I was embarrassed for the city that we were the only ones in the place.    This was the best Thai food I have had in years!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Thai food in pittsburgh so far. The korean short rib appetizer is a must...flavorful and portion is big for the price you pay. We also tried the red curry with chicken and braised short rib with some kind of pineapple coconut sauce...they were very creamy and not too sweet. Loved them. Will definitely make this place our regular dinning spot."}
{"text":"Wonderful treat if you like authentic Thai/Cambodian. It's tucked away in a mini-mall and has a casual environment but you'll be in for a treat. Drunken noodle dish, green curry,pad thai, panang, fresh spring rolls are all great. Visit this restaurant regularly, mostly take-out."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here Saturday night. The red curry noodles were delicious and you can pick a spicy scale from 1-10. The waiter was attentive and the food was homemade not out of a box or bag. Happy to have found this little gem and happy it is close to the house!"}
{"text":"This is utopia for your taste buds.. A carnival of culinary art.  Fantastic and friendly service. The Angkor Salad is a explosion of flavour that you wont soon forget.  The coconut lemongrass soup was easily 6/5 stars."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Cambodian I have ever eaten! Very authentic and VERY delicious! To bad we don't live in Pittsburgh, We would definitely be regulars!"}
{"text":"Got the order yesterday. Did not like some of my order i.e., Steamed Chicken Rice & Rice Noodles. Felt no salt & not spicy at all. And chicken smells a bit different and rubbery"}
{"text":"I recently made my maiden voyage to Angkor with my daughter, and neither one of us raved about the experience on our way home.       We stopped in for lunch on a hazy, warm Thursday afternoon, being the only ones in the restaurant until another diner walked in for his first time lunch too. The waiter was friendly, and upbeat, didn't mention his name, but was helpful when the other diner had questions about the menu.       For an appetizer, we ordered the deep fried tofu triangles, which my daughter really liked. I'm a tofu fan, but couldn't get passed the fried, oil heavy bites of tofu. Bland, and heavy with oil, it just didn't work for me.       I decided on the drunken noodles, with lemongrass soup, while my daughter opted for Pad Thai and the wonton soup, both which came with a fried spring roll. The presentation of the decor, and the dishes of food were both appealing to the eyes. The lemongrass soup was  tasty, fresh mushrooms and tomatoes in a beefy broth that was not sugary sweet, but sweet and sour at the same time. The fried spring roll seemed to be mass produced which I didn't mind, it was nicely fried, and tasted good. The drunken noodles was full of vegetables, bean sprouts, celery and the like. It was a bit salty for my taste, but good. My daughter enjoyed her food, which for a first trip to a new restaurant was played safe.  For almost $28.00 at lunch, we weren't disappointed, but not blown away either. We might plan another trip to Angkor to try something else, just not rushing to get there right now."}
{"text":"I rarely go to this neck of the woods, but a friend of mine likes Angkor, so once in a while I go. I'm usually unimpressed, but it's never bad. I just wish it was a little more special. I do love the decor in the place, and parking is a breeze."}
{"text":"I eat at Angkor once a week, religiously. I have only had food from the lunch menu, so my review is limited to that. I get either the Japanese eggplant with tofu or Panang curry with tofu. They do their tofu dishes really well. Service here is friendly and efficient. The tofu in the curries/stirfries are done well."}
{"text":"The food here is always fantastic. They are also very quick to get your takeout out the door. Their curries are some of the best that I've had, and they are good about any special requests one may have regarding their meals. The pad thai has also met the customary Thai food taste test of many of my friends I've taken here.   However, their service can sometimes be a little tough. The last time we went was a perfect example. We could never seem to flag our waiter down as he seemed to be the only one waiting tables on a busy-ish Friday night."}
{"text":"Fresh and good - will go back again. They describe the spice accurately - loved the green curry and loved the papaya salad. You know how sometimes the fish sauce can be a little overwhelming? not here."}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai/Cambodian food. The curries are especially Delicious. Saramann curry is one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. If you like Thai, this is the place."}
{"text":"I'm really torn about this place. We ordered to go on a Friday night and I'm glad we did.  When I got there to pick up the order, there were about 6 tables with an additional 3 walking in after I did. There was only 1 waitress taking care of the WHOLE place. In addition to her normal duties, she took phone orders, cashed out everybody including take out orders, cleaned her tables and sat new customers! I can see the aggravation on people's faces sitting there waiting for their turn. The food however was amazing. At least the ones we ordered were. There were some great flavors that were also rich. That is why I am torn about this place. I hope the cooking remains the same but management needs to act on service and hiring extra help. Great cooking without fast and courteous service is not enough to keep a place going these days so I hope they spend some money on improving that part of the business.  We will definitely try it again but only to order out and never to dine in until noticeable improvements are made on the dining in part."}
{"text":"I've had lunch here many times and have never had a bad meal.  The food is excellent.  The staff courteous. The restaurant is clean.  And the prices are reasonable.  If you are able to try Angkor I would highly recommend you give it a shot. I doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Heard great reviews about this restaurant and ventured out to try.  Nice setting in a little plaza.  Nice decor and ambiance.  Very polite service.  All the appetizers were terrific from the fish cake to the cold spring rolls to the shrimp wraps.  Phenomenal were the chicken green curry and the short ribs.  So so was the crepe which resembled Ban Xeo at some Vietnamese restaurants.  The cold clear noodle salad was light and refreshing - a perfect summer dish.   I will definitely return By the way, this is a BYOB so come prepared."}
{"text":"Angkor is Pittsburgh's best kept secret.  Those who know Angkor know that it is sad that Angkor is not better known, because we all know the fate of restaurants that don't attract a crowd.  The green curry is on my list of top-5 dishes from anywhere that I have dined.  My wife and I shared the green curry with a plate of Japanese eggplant with shrimp, and if Nicky can do it any better I cannot imagine.  The decor is authentic, the food even more so.  Go now!!"}
{"text":"Good food, clean place in a kinda sketchy looking strip mall. I had the basil garlic chicken with wonton soup, spring roll, and steamed rice. I would go there again."}
{"text":"After having lived in the area for a while, I tried Angkor for the first time and was mad I hadn't gone sooner.  For a Friday night, about half the tables were filled.  I started off with the Jasmine tea which came out hot instead of cold as I had ordered.  It was a bit bland but free refills on the cold teas was great.    I ordered the Cambodian curry noodles (mild) and it was delicious.  The portion was a huge bowl with yellow curry, noodles, eggplant, potatoes, carrots, onions, bamboo shoots and chicken (added).  The sauce was a little spicy but very filling.   The vegetables were very fresh.  The restaurant was very clean.  The decor was a little outdated and the bathrooms need updated.  Prices were very reasonable.  They were turning away customers about 45 minutes before closing time which was strange.  A nice touch was the cook/owner (a lady in her 70s or so) came out to ask how we liked the food.    I wanted to get dessert, but the entree was so filling I couldn't.   Overall, I am pretty picky about Thai food and wanted to try Cambodian - I was very pleased overall with Angkor."}
{"text":"Good prices, nice decor, tasteless food.  I only ate here once, traveling from California.  Got the fresh spring rolls and Moarn Chha Kyei (vegetables in a \"spicy\" ginger sauce).  The spring rolls were OK, but nothing to rave about.  The ginger dish was the blandest concoction I've ever had in a SE Asian restaurant.  I mean, there wasn't a hint of spice or heat, and there was only the faintest trace of ginger!  I am hesitant to hazard a guess as to how a well reviewed Cambodian/Thai restaurant can serve such bland fare; maybe folks around Pittsburgh don't \"do\" spice.  Maybe my palette has been spoiled in the Bay Area by real Thai cuisine.  Whatever the reason, I can't recommend this place based on the one meal I had there."}
{"text":"Okay. I ordered the basil chicken entree and was fine. I ordered a spice level 7 and it came out not spicy at all. If you can make it downtown or north side, try Nicky's Thai.  If you're stuck in west side, Angkor will do the trick. :) if you get a sweet tooth, don't ask for the delicious looking cake in the display case... It's just for show. And they do not have the real deal to serve embarrassingly."}
{"text":"Food is good but the lack of waiter staff ruins the ambiance... Personally have tried the thai fried rice, Penang  curry, and drunken noodles. All these classic dishes are great! Definitely a place worth trying but again would like the management to spend a little more and pay for a second waiter."}
{"text":"TL;DR - friendly staff with good vegetarian/vegan options and large portions.  We stopped here on a somewhat disastrous trip and this is probably the first place we've been in Pittsburgh so far where I've actually felt like I'm on vacation. Just entering, the decor was lovely and the music was soothing and not too loud (which worked well for me, as I was recovering from a migraine.) The AC was a little cold for my tastes, so you may want to bring sleeves if you're visiting in the summer and get cold easily, but it wasn't absurdly cold.  The service was friendly and attentive, and the menu was packed with vegetarian options. (I did ask and was told the red and green curries did NOT have fish sauce, but do be warned that they are SPICY.) The portions were HUGE (more than either of us could finish in a sitting), reasonably priced and delicious (I had the vegetable skewer and the red curry with tofu, and my mom had the butternut squash coconut soup and the crepe thing.) Definitely recommended for vegetarians/vegans in or visiting Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I've gotten lunch from this place tons of times, but only on weekdays. Always great food and service. I decided to go this weekend with my parents for lunch - their first Thai experience! We were excited.    I called ahead a few days before to double-check the opening times. I was told that it technically opened at 11, but it was safer to come \"on the later side.\"  \"Like 12?\" I asked. \"Yeah, 12 is good.\"   We showed up at 12 on Saturday and the place looked dead. After waiting around for a few minutes, we tried the door, and found it unlocked.  After standing inside for a couple of minutes, one of us ventured back toward the kitchen to call for anyone. Finally a man came out and said \"Oh, I'll be ready to open in about an hour,\" acting totally surprised and offended that we were inside.  Super annoying and frustrating experience. Is this typical for the weekends? I'm not sure, but it has completely soured me on the place."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Very fresh spring rolls. Friendly staff. Clean restrooms. Recommend C6 with shrimp and C12 with beef"}
{"text":"Worth a visit !  I'm not an Asian food aficionado so skip this review if looking for that!  Decor is better than expected with silk flowers, mirrors, wood carvings, glass tops on tables.  Service can be slow depending on phone calls and carry out and number of customers in restaurant, but waiter was very willing to help with my selections.  The four fresh spring rolls are healthy with a good balance of mint and basil.  The lemon grass soup was tasty and a '5' hotness so I ordered the same for my meal. The Khmer dish (posted pic) was as hot as I'd like as spices stayed in my mouth.  All vegetables were cooked well and the flavor subtle.  Very nice carrot \"flower \" garnish. My waiter was willing to get me another dish if the selected one wasn't to my liking- how many places can say that?  Glass glasses, matching plateware, clean.  A good value - I spent $23 (w/o tip) for this large dinner and I was full.  Several folks talked with owner and are regulars here..."}
{"text":"Very good lunch prices.  Two of us ate for $14.40 before tip.  Lunches come with either wonton or lemongrass soup and a spring roll.  The lemongrass soup was very spicy with chunks of tomato and mushroom.  I was expecting something more mild, like tom yum, but I really enjoyed the soup.  The spring rolls were just big enough for two bites.  I ordered the Moarn Chha Kroeung, a dish of mixed vegetables in a thick yellow lemongrass sauce.  It was delicious and I'm having a hard time thinking of a similar, comparable dish.  My roommate got the Moarn Chha Ktom, which he also liked.  Lunches come with your choice of veggies/tofu, chicken, beef, or shrimp and are priced with the veggies being the cheapest and shrimp being the most expensive (at $7.95 - hardly expensive).  Service was just ok - they didn't offer dessert and kind of walked away before we could place drink orders, but our food came out very quickly and water was refilled promptly.  I would definitely return if I'm in this part of town again.  If you go, order one of the Cambodian dishes and try something new."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, the three stars is for the service.  Unbelievably slow.  I get the whole family restaurant thing and love to support these establishment, however that is not an excuse.  It should not take 15min to get my water glass filled for the first time and 25min before we finally get attention from the server.  An unfortunate experience, I may revisit on my travels if I have ample time, prepared for a long dining experience.."}
{"text":"This was a great find near my hotel room! The fresh spring rolls with shrimp had a nice crispness with the lettuce and bean sprouts. The peanut sauce added just the right amount of sweetness. I had the shrimp Pad Tai. The food itself tasted good with a tiny bit of heat. There was a little to much parsley for decoration on my plate. It was sad to see only 3 other customers dinning in, but their phone did seem to be blowing up with to go orders. I think they need 2 people on the floor vs just one. I also think the peeling paint on the outside and the sad little table cloth on the front porch tables being changed would help spruce the place up a ton!"}
{"text":"I've went to this place twice. The first time I went I was Leary of it. I went back a second time and it was very good both times on consistently. I just wish the general tso was spicer. I went level 10 and I really like hot but it was still good even though it wasn't up to my standards. Portions are big and prices are right. The waitress was also very nice and pleasant. I'm sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service with nice atmosphere, handcarved woodwork on the walls. Very friendly staff. The red curry beef is to die for. Highly recommend. If you say anything bad about this place I will find you and kill you."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Angkor! The restaurant is very clean and beautifully decorated. Servers are so friendly and the food comes out quickly. The red curry was on point. Vegetables were perfectly cooked - not soggy like I've had elsewhere. Coconut lemongrass soup was fantastic, spicy and delicious. Green papaya salad my favorite I've had since I studied abroad in Thailand. Closest to authentic Thai I've experienced and I will definitely keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"Simple, unpretentious room, great service, slammin' good food!  We tried to stick to the Cambodian options, and everything we had was phenomenal.  We will definitely put this on our list of regulars."}
{"text":"Amazing!  The best green curry I've had and I have tried at least 12 other places across PA/NJ/NC/GA etc...  Prices are average but taste is superb!  We have tried many of their other dishes there as well and all have held the same great standard.  We now take friends and family there for any special occasion."}
{"text":"This place is great for everyone! We came here with a couple of friends, one of whom is vegan, and he had a lot of options to choose from that was vegan friendly. I had the chicken phad thai and it was delicious! My one friend had the general tso tofu which i tried.. the tofu was crisp on the outside and generously coated with sauce and the flavor was really good.  The portions for everyones dishes were large   The atmosphere was quiet and cozy. The server was very pleasant and attentive, she got our drink order in right away and gave us sufficient time to decide on our order, she did not make us feel rushed"}
{"text":"Came in on the Sunday before Labor Day and only one sole waiter was working the place with the help of one sole bus boy.  Although it took awhile for him to get our order and clear our plates, he did it all with a smile on his face and, most importantly, he brought the food out right when it was ready.    I had the cambodian fried rice, which was phenomenal.  BYOB."}
{"text":"Place was quiet, clean, and decorated very nice. Waiter was polite, great personality, and very professional.  Food was great! Ordered the butternut squash coconut soup and the Panang curry dish. Both which were amazing!  Great price and good food. The waiter even boxed up our left overs for us. Great service! Been there a few times and have never been disappointed. I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"One of the nicest Cambodian restaurants I've been to. And it doesn't try to hide behind a Thai image - this place is proudly Cambodian.   Get the amok fish curry, and the beef stew with cardamom and aniseed."}
{"text":"At first I was suspicious if all the yelp ratings were right since the place was empty but I went in anyway. I didn't regret my choice at all because already the appetizer I had was delicious. Plenty of parking. Friendly staff. All in all worth the trip."}
{"text":"It's interesting to see some of the really good reviews.  We went on a Thursday night and we did not have a great experience. The flowers on the table smelled awful and the water was moldy. The restaurant had bugs flying around. We killed a few throughout the evening. The food was decent but took a long time to come out. I don't think we would come back here unless we were in the area and wanted to grab take out possibly."}
{"text":"This is close to home and I never noticed it! Never had Cambodian food either. Got the Pad Thai and I was impressed. Can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"The environment is really nice and spiritual. The food is very authentic Thai especially papaya salad!"}
{"text":"Went there last weekend with a friend for dinner. Got the fresh spring rolls and the Cambodian specialty of fried rice cakes under a pork mixture (sorry forget the name). Had to get pad Thai and Penang for entrees. Everything was great; fresh, hot, well seasoned, good quality. Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"I wish we could rate half stars!  50-50 experience on this one.  Been wanting to try Angkor based on the Yelp reviews, so we finally decided to give it a try on a slow Saturday night.  Walking in, there was only one other party present at 7pm (a little concerning).  This place screams American Chinese restaurant with a little extra polished charm.  The staff were great.  We were greeted an sat immediately (then again, almost noone else was there), and we were offered some suggestions on what to order.  Decided to start with the spring rolls.  The rice paper could have been prepped a little better (a bit chewy), but overall, they were pleasing (crisp, fresh and minty).  We decided to go with the Cambodian Short Ribs (C16) and they quickly came out.  Slowly stewed short ribs with pineapple, mushrooms, tomatoes and a rich earthy sauce on steamed rice.  Definitely stick to your ribs comfort food that reminded me a lot of a cross between Korean short ribs and curry.  My lack of decision ultimately comes from my lack of confidence in the menu as a whole.  While our entree was good, the spring rolls left a decent amount to be desired.  Not sure we'd proactively make the hike out to Carnegie again for this place unless we were already in the area (though then again, the one other table drove the entire way from Greensburg to eat there...  so that's a promising sign)."}
{"text":"We have been to Angkor many times.  We are never disappointed.  I always try to have something new, the husband sticks to Pad Thai.  He loves it there.  We love the Angkor salad and the soups.  Wish we lived closer... but it's worth the 40 minute drive!"}
{"text":"I have been to Angkor more than 30 times, and I have never been dissapointed.  The food is unusual, delicious and very satisfying.  I particularly recommend the Cambodian dishes, that is Angkor's strength.  I like the wood carving, the orchids in the front window, I am very much charmed by the decor.  The service has always been excellent for me, it is very attentive, helpful, service.  I like that there is no corkage fee.  The lunch menu is more limited than the dinner menu, make sure you go there for dinner."}
{"text":"Food wasn't too bad. I've certainly had better Thai food. Service was awful."}
{"text":"Nice little gem!  Nice, clean, comfortable.  Authentic Thai flavors, generous portions, pleasant service. My first time here, but it was obvious the place was full of regulars. Not a place for a fancy, romantic dinner, but perfect for lunch!"}
{"text":"My son and I come here often. All of there food is great. We ask for recommendations and they never disappoint.  All the employees are very kind and attentive. There decor is spectacular. This is by far our favorite restaurant and we plan on tasting our way through the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I do mostly take out and have a hard time deciding what to order. Good food and great prices."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in the atmosphere is warm, welcoming. Beautiful decor. Now to the best part, the food! Tried the red curry with beef and I must say, it was above and beyond my expectations. Delicious and just the right level of spice. The service was just as delightful. I had the pleasure of meeting Holly who was by far the best waitress. If you're in the area, I highly recommend stopping in. Be sure the ask for Holly!"}
{"text":"Insanely good. Traditional, fresh, unique, stellar service.  Everything was truly wonderful and we consider ourselves Thai/Cambodian food fanatics.  Most highly recommended in the city."}
{"text":"A very good restaurant. I am very critical of Thai food but they have many great dishes. I come for business but always stop here. The fresh spring rolls are exceptional.  Peanut sauce is different than most places but good. The panang curry is my favorite dish"}
{"text":"Byob....you know I love it!!  One of my fav parts about the state liquor laws is there are so make fun family byob places. This is a great example.  The restaurant is a nice size with very friendly service.  Wish I could give half stars bc I liked the restaurant.  3.5 stars is more appropriate.  The food was nice.  I ordered the Pad Thai.  The order was a nice size.  The sauce was a little sweeter than I would have liked but had nice flavor.  I got a heat level 7 and it had a nice spice.  I could have got a 9 and still been comfortable.  My husband got a Penang chicken curry.  He also got a 7 and enjoyed the spice.  The curry was nice and a good serving amount. My husband also got the fried spring rolls which he said were fine.  Our bill was 25$...cheapest dinner date we have had in a while.   I would go back to try some other things from the menu."}
{"text":"I typically order to-go for lunch from Angkor. If it's busy, it can take awhile for your sit-down lunch as there's usually only one server. The spicy beef (Angkor Salad) and Larb Salad are amazing. I've also enjoyed the \"something-out-of-this-world\" Green Curry as well as the Panang, both huge #1 hits in my book. The lunch specials are super reasonable and include soup and an egg roll for about $8. One last note, get the Lemongrass soup, it will blow your mind, with a hint of heat and fresh veggies. Definitely, my favorite Asian dining in Crafton area."}
{"text":"Very good.  Fast, friendly and fresh.  Drunken noodles were delicious.  The fresh spring rolls yummy.  Ambience was great and clean and tidy.  Waiter was efficient and very nice."}
{"text":"Cute spot but definitely order ahead or be ready to sit for an hour. Summer rolls are good and the lunch special comes with soup or salad. Had the pad Thai with chicken which was good. I'll be back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"I'll never forget my first trip to Angkor.  It was the Wednesday after Easter.  I'd had my fill fresh ham, second day ham, and ham reprocessed into something they call a salad... I was all hammed out and yearning for something different; something from a differed place and perhaps time.  I wanted noodles, I wanted chicken, and oh yes, peanut sauce.... It had to be Pad Thai.  Nothing else would do.  I'd only been back in Pittsburgh for about a month, following a seven year stint in Dayton, Ohio.  Not knowing where go, I did what all lost and hungry people should do.  I turned to my fellow Yelpers for help.    Thank God, they did not disappoint.  They guided me towards Angkor, which is only a half mile from my apartment.  Being Wednesday it wasn't busy but it was everything I was looking for.  The décor was really nice.  The service was really good, and fast.  But most importantly, my to-go carton was filled with yummies straight from heaven.  The noodles were piping hot, the chicken was grilled to perfection, and the peanut sauce was all I could have asked for.  I knew from the moment they asked me what spice level I wanted that I had been delivered to a place that was going to make me happy man.  Thank you fellow Yelpers... and Angkor... I'll be back.  Oh yes, I WILL be back, with friends."}
{"text":"I have my loves and hates with this restaurant. The food is always good but the hours are always weird and it's sometimes tough to get someone on the phone for a takeout order. They never seem to get too many people dining in either. I wish they would start delivering and sign up for seamless or eat24!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a very empty Tuesday afternoon for lunch with a party of 8. It seemed very understaffed. The single waitress ignored us, then when asked about gluten-free options, responded with, \"Well if you have made a reservation, we could have tried to accommodate you.\" She was simply rude and unwilling to help. We promptly left and took our business and generous tips elsewhere."}
{"text":"Sounded really interesting and has some beautiful Khmer wood carving and silver on display, but they were short-staffed and service was very slow - took over 30 min. for our soup to come out. Soups were good, but the egg crepe was bland and arrived without the sauce and salad that were supposed to accompany it. The server was very enthusiastic and friendly - a bit too much so - it made it difficult for us to carry on our own conversation."}
{"text":"I can't wait to try more of the menu here. I had the drunken noodles and they were tasty and at the expected spice level (my go-to for entrees is 6). My friend had a spicy eggplant dish but thought it was a little on the sweet side (despite the 10 spice level). As with Thai food in general, very easy for vegetarians to find options. The main annoyance I have is that it's difficult to find a current and complete menu online, so that's hindered me from ordering takeout or delivery and eating here more often. Would also be awesome if they joined grub hub or had online ordering available, but I don't think they even have a website at the moment."}
{"text":"Great traditional dishes. This place is a great little tucked away gem. There is plenty of seating and surprisingly there aren't usually a lot of people in those seats.  Good sized portions, for fair prices.   The bacon wrapped scallops are the best small app around."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent! The shrimp appetizer was delicious as was each of our meals and the homemade dessert sampler. Reasonable prices and excellent service. A must go!"}
{"text":"Great food!  We ordered the green vegetable curry, spring rolls, and a salmon skewer - all delicious.  The only bummer was that they forgot the rice, so we had to go back and get some - so check your order before you head home."}
{"text":"Wow!  On a rainy cold Wednesday night we walked in on impulse, not expecting much.  After all, this is a restaurant in a bland strip mall.  The first thing you notice is the exquisite, elegant décor; beautiful teakwood carvings and an lovely place settings.  Be sure to try the soups.  I had a lemon-grass soup that had a fascinating back-taste.  Try the ginger tea, served in a beautiful cast-iron pot with rock-crystal sugar.  The food is different, well-prepared and well-presented.  The portions are huge.  We just discovered, by accident, a new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant was fantastic. The employees are very friendly and very personable. It was my first time here and they were very helpful with what to choose to eat.  The food came out promptly and it was delicious.  The best Tai food I've ever eaten in the surrounding area.  I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really wish you could do half-star ratings. I reserve 5 stars for over the top awesome place, but this place is so close to that!   I've been coming to Angkor for over 5 years and have never been disappointed with a meal. The veggie spring rolls are delicious--the perfect size and extra crispy. I'm a noodle fan and always get the noodle dishes. Noodles are great, veggies are fresh, chicken is a good complement. Never a wait for a table--this place must do a lot of takeout. It's been here for years and I've only seen more that 3 tables occupied one time. That was a bustling night!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai places in Pittsburgh. I love their red and green curry dishes with rice and rice noodles. The Thai fried rice is really good too! The lunch prices are very reasonable. The only downfall is their service! They are very slow. It seems like they only ever have 1 server and they get really busy during lunch."}
{"text":"i had recently moved to a new area and was looking for a new curry joint. came across this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. so i do what i always do when trying a new place..see if they have carry out at first before i do the whole resteraunt thing.  First off,       Do not use the menu they have online, none of the prices are accurate. Must be outdated because everything on the online menu is 2 dollars cheaper than it really is. Found out the hard way when i got my total lol  Second,     Curry was good. could of used more spice. i never got asked upon ordering if they could make it spicy or not. and it did not indicate whether i could or not on the online menu. either way it was good. I got the red curry with beef...very high in meat. Good veggie ratio overral good.  Third,      Got the crispy baby calamari..was not that impressed...kind of too much crisp. Kind of like going to kfc and getting there extra crispy or whatever that is lol. Too much breading, Not enough Cal.  i will say for the price quality of food ratio it was not that bad. i will def order again because i was impressed with the curry, maybe next time it will be in the resteraunt."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is wonderful. I'm completely addicted to their Vegetarian Lemongrass Soup. The atmosphere is quiet and welcoming. Great for eat in or take out. The only issue I ever had is that I ordered take out once and the person running the credit card machine gave themselves a much larger tip than I'd actually left. I didn't report it because I didn't have a copy of the receipt. So, if you're getting takeout, just make sure you get a copy of your receipt! That is the only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars."}
{"text":"Best sweet and sour chicken I could imagine. I highly recommend the beef skewer appetizer."}
{"text":"Oh my ...dont like the food here. Tried the Pad thai and the chicken fried rice ...the pad thai was disgusting and the fried rice was not enticing either ...wont be going back ...ugh"}
{"text":"Was in a hurry and stopped here for take out. Food came quickly. Panang,spicy lemon grass soup and fresh spring rolls were great. The quantity of soup was disappointing but tasted great.  I will use this for take out for work for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a bitterly cold Saturday night so was surprised to see a good crowd.  As with previous visits, food was excellent and nicely presented. Service was attentive. Definitely a good value."}
{"text":"Green curry with shrimp here is amazing! Very unique recipe. I order it way too often. Haha I love Nicky's Thai Kitchen as well but this is a completely different approach to the dish. The lemon grass soup is also very good. All my orders are always consistent and as anticipated. And the food is always ready unbelievably fast. I don't know how they do it!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets outside of Cambodia or Midtown Manhattan.  a gem for Pittsburgh.  These folks used to own Phnom Penh downtown.  I have yet to taste a better Pad Thai.    Their red and green curry is to die for.    This isn't your corner chinese place, folks, be very careful when ordering the spiciness.  I usually go for an eight at local places.  But this place is authentic, and has authentic cooks.  A seven in the curry made me sweat and tear up.  But oh, so good!  Take-out is prompt, and the place is busy at times, but after seven you have the place to yourself."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai / Cambodian restaurant in the entire City of Pittsburgh.  Located in a non-descript strip mall near Greentree/Crafton, don't let outside appearances scare you away.  Inside, it is very nicely decorated, and the food is excellent.  Two of my favorites here are the Green Curry Noodles, and the Crispy Tofu appetizer.  The service is always very friendly, and have never been disappointed in many visits to this location spanning back a number of years."}
{"text":"Not en-Thai-rely impressed!  When I saw the signs, and later the reviews, I truly believed that this was going to be THE zenith of Cambodian and Thai foods.  Instead, sadly, I met with great disappointment.  The first red flag, or ominous warning, was when I arrived at eleven this morning and they were not open.  The place was deserted, and when I called and asked if they were going to open, a man said that they will open at eleven thirty.  When I returned at the appointed time, there were already three tables seated, including one with four people.    My second red flag occurred whenever I tried to ask the server about a particular dish.  It contained Phnom Penh sauce And I was unfamiliar...so was he!  He claimed to have just started the prior week.  When, after other questions were posed that he could, it wouldn't, answer, he dashed off to a table of older folks who had numerous special requests and did not return to me for another ten minutes.  When he begrudgingly returned, he took my order of the Pad Ke Mao, or drunken noodles.    It took nearly a half hour to get my takeout.  Rather than a \"sorry about the wait\" or any civilities, the food was instead thrust into my hands.  He did ask me six times if I paid my bill...I definitely did.  Now, upon entering my car I found only disappointment.  The waiter had sloshed some of whatever that place considers Lemongrass soup through the bag.  The soup was in a tiny container and had exactly three chunks of mushroom and two of tomato, and overall minimal flavor.  I was not thrilled with the Drunken Noodles which were very sweet, mushy, devoid of all the vegetables which were allegedly supposed to be included in it.  Worse, I discovered that though I ordered tofu in it, I was given dry, stringy chicken.  I thought about complaining or asking for my $7.50 back, but I figured it wasn't worth the wait...just like the meal."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite location to get Thai/Cambodian food in the greater Pittsburgh area. The restaurant rarely gets crowded, so no need for reservations even with big groups (though they may appreciate the heads up in any case). It's BYOB, and there's a liquor store in the same shopping center.  When I still lived in the area I was certainly a regular. The staff has been consistently kind and attentive, and I have never had a bad meal. I don't even think they've ever gotten an order wrong before, and I was going every other Saturday (at least).   My favorite appetizer menu items are the fresh spring rolls (best with shrimp, but can be vegetarian/vegan as well) which have the best peanut sauce I've ever had with these rolls, the crispy/fried vegetable spring rolls (also come with an amazing thin, clear flavorful sauce that is good enough to drink on it's own), and the nai tangs which are puffed rice squares served with one of the most interesting toppings I've ever had (peanut and coconut flavors with pork, and I'm devastated there isn't a vegetarian option for this).  Every single entree is a winner. I love their tofu for the protein option. Even before being vegetarian I opted for it. Perfectly crisp and soaked with flavor.    You MUST get their hot jasmine tea with your meal. They serve it with sugar crystals that are so delicately sweet and perfect for tea (less harsh than granulated sugar).   You won't be disappointed. The price, portions, flavor, environment, and service is all on point."}
{"text":"This is my Mom's favorite place to dine, and definitely on my top 5 list of Pittsburgh restaurants!  It's a hidden jewel, inconspicuously situated in a strip mall in the West End.  Discovered one day post thrift store shopping, it's now a little tradition that we practice.    MMmmmm, the food's so yummy!  With a fairly diverse Thai/Chinese/Cambodian menu and daily specials that hit the spot, there's a lot to choose from.  I recommend the green curry!  Their masaman curry and pad thai aren't too shabby either.  And, if they ever have a salmon special, get it!  Their spring rolls are ok; I've had better.  But, the tom yum soup is fab!  And, their thai iced teas are delicious and made just right!  Best of all, there are options for every diet, palate, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Tuesday. Not busy at all. Seemed to be the lunch spot for a bunch of businessmen in the area. Super reasonable. I got the green curry and rice which came with a spring roll and soup. For $8. Lemongrass soup was the perfect amount of spicy. I enjoyed the green curry as well. Perfect amount to be satisfied but not too full. I would go here again."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.  You get a sizable entree, your choice of soup, and a spring roll all for $7 during their lunch special.  The Thai Fried Rice with chicken is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"This place does much better food than its sister joint Lemon Grass Cafe. The food here comes in large portions and is distinct from Thai food (it seems more Cambodian, which is a nice touch). The waiter was knowledgeable and made sure everything was completely vegan."}
{"text":"Visiting a new city for work means a steep learning curve for every need and amenity you have.  From finding out where to get your laundry done to finding what restaurants cater to vegetarians, it's a chore.  I got lucky in that this gem is 5 minutes form my hotel, and fantastic.  They have Cambodian dishes I've not seen before, and are faithfully spiced as opposed to suburbanite mild.  Everything is available in a tofu or vegetable option, and the sauces aren't greasy or loaded with MSG and thickener.   I highly recommend the garlicky eggplant or the tofu and chive flowers.  Their fresh spring rolls (elsewhere called summer rolls) are delicious and full of fresh basil.  Best of all, the owners sit in the dining area and make sure the customers are happy.  Wonderful people, delicious food, great art on the walls.  Overall, my favorite secret hidden gem in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"So as I mentioned before Thai is my most favorite cuisine but I have never tried Cambodian food before. So we are here in Pittsburgh meeting up my inlaws and they have never tried Thai/ also was very skeptic about trying as they think it'd be too spicy. But I managed to get them to try this with me and it was not as good as we expected it to be.  With exception of the Pannan beef curry the rest of the food was overly sweet and covered in excessive amount of generic tasting sauces. Coming from NYC I have tasted many different restaurants (Thai). And this food is not very good in comparison.  Many of the dishes tasted more like Panda Express Lol. (Japanese eggplant, sweet and sour chicken) the fried rice was decent and he steamed fish was okay but lacked depth of flavor and spice.   The service was excellent and on point. Our sever was the only one working there it seemed and the place got quite a few tables at once but she handled it rather well.   Recommendations:  The appetizers were good, we tried 4 and 2 of them were outstanding, try the na tang (it was rice crisp with an amazing dip) and shrimp blanket is amazing, the beef and chicken skewers were okay.  On the antree I tried their Cambodian fried rice with crab chicken and it was pretty good also recommend you guys pannan curries.   I think this restaurant is suffering from an identity crisis . They should just stick to their Cambodian/Thai cuisine and get rid of their Japanese and Chinese platters. Adding all those affects your chef as well as your food."}
{"text":"This was a delightful surprise. Nice decor and clean. Server couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating and the food was delicious. The vegetarian spring rolls and ginormous. We also had a beef dish that I can't remember the name, but I'd come back for it."}
{"text":"This is an excellent Thai/Cambodian restaurant. The first night they let me sample the green curry sauce and the Panang sauce. I ended up trying a Cambodian dish that was not as sweet as the Thai sauces. It was quite good and had extra crunch of water chestnuts. However the taste of the green curry haunted me and I came the next night to experience it completely. Fabulous! I ordered at hotness 3 of 10. Left me with a happy comfortable burn. Just what you would hope for.  Oh the price is very reasonable. Great meal for a Hamilton!"}
{"text":"A superbly delightful spot for unique and delicious food in the south hills of Pittsburgh. Delicious soups, tasty appetizers, classic Thai and Cambodian dishes. Con: staff is small, don't be in a rush."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and have been satisfied each occasion.  They've only been takeout experience so I can only judge strictly on quality and taste of the food.  First time we ordered Beef Saramann and Thai Fried Rice.  The Saramann was a curry dish and had lots of veggies and a good portion of meat.  The Thai Fried Rice (Chicken) was EXCELLENT.  I know, it's only fried rice, but there is definitely a hierarchical chain of superior taste amongst the Far East fried rice dishes...and this one ranks towards the top.    My second time eating there I ordered a chicken Pad Thai, Shrimp Pad Thai and a Chicken Thai Fried Rice.  Needless to say, they botched my order and I got home to open my cartons, after salivating on the 7 min drive home, to the wrong meats for each dish.  I called and they rectified the situation for a future order.  The Pad Thai was decent.  They got the spice right (I asked for 8 out of 10), but the seafood didn't seem that great.  It was average, to be honest.  But once again, the Thai Fried Rice made up for the mediocre noodle dish.    Uh, I lived in NYC and currently here in Pittsburgh for a short hiatus, so for now, Angkor will be my close to home goto Thai Restaurant."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try a new place in the Green Tree area when back visiting. We stopped by for dinner about 9:15 on Friday and were told by staff they were closed. This was a HUGE disappointment as their hours are listed online as open until 10:30. Please update the hours so customers don't go out of their way to patronize this business only to find the establishment closed! Rude!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Cambodian food. I ate the healthy soup and the traditional chicken dish. Loved the chicken dish!! Very delicious!!"}
{"text":"Really confused why so many folks like this place. Sure, service is good, but the food was simply inedible. Both the Pad Thai and Chiang Mai Curry were loaded with so much sugar that I could barely taste any other flavors. One expensive bowl of granulated sugar soup was all we had. This is so far from good Thai food. It's usually a sign when a menu is this large that the food won't blow me away. In this case I was wrong."}
{"text":"The East End's Silk Elephant has a worthy opponent in Angkor.  To think I first learned of fish cakes from a Conan The Barbarian comic book I read as a lad. No, I don't recall the issue number.   At Angkor, you get 5 to an order of this appetizing appetizer. The diminutive discs come with a medley of wonderfully sweet pickled onions and a cucumber sauce. The filler is minimal; the flavor is anything but.   Kay had the Ban Chhev (a large yellow crepe that looked like an omelete) for dinner (please write a review, baby doll).  I had the Shrimp Penang and found it to be favorably reminiscent of the Duck Curry I had at Silk Elephant (I'm assuming them to be the same dish aside from the choice of meat). A roll call of ingredients from the menu is in order: Thai basil, peas, green peppers, red peppers, dried red chili, lemon grass, shallots, garlic, galanga, kaffir lime leaves, and coconut milk. All of the components added up to the sum of their parts, making for a remarkably rich yet racy recipe of rapturous proportions that I barely finished.   Chalk it up to losing my sanity, but I detected a slight licorice flavor. As for the shrimp, they were plump and plentiful in number, but the Penang was so good, I might have been able to eat it sans any meat at all.   Angkor's extensive dessert menu sounded as intriguing as the tracklisting for an upcoming studio album from your all-time favorite band. Some of the names included Golden Threads, Jack Fruit Seeds, Golden Balls (don't. go. there...), Sang Khaya Khatt, Rainbow Cake, Banana Steamed Cake, Squash Custard, Black Sweet Rice, and Avocado Ice Cream.   Alas, Treats & Sweets nearby was calling us for a return visit, so partake we did not, but we will definitely return, if for no other reason than to see what Black Sweet Rice is all about.   P.S. I can honestly tell you that we had no problems whatsoever with the service at Angkor, something that reviewers here on Yelp and elsewhere allegedly had issues with."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! Everything we've had has been wonderful. It's our new go to place! Great value. Can be really spicy so be warned."}
{"text":"How do you celebrate Chinese New Year.  We get together with a group of friends and go out to a good restaurant with Chinese cuisine along with other cuisines.  Stopped in to Angkor and found a group of about 24 in a long table down the middle of the restaurant doing the same.    Our group split a couple of apps.  The Crispy Tofu Triangles that comes with a gingery soy sauce and grilled chicken skewer.  Both good but enjoyed the flavorful chicken more.   For the main course I had the Green Curry Noodles; nicely seasoned and spiced.   Plenty to take home for another meal.   Was able to taste some of the BAn Chhev; very good.    Service was good.   BYOB.  If you forget there is a State Store in the same little strip mall."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for a few years and I come back for the fresh spring rolls. There usually aren't that many people there and service is decently quick... take out isn't usually ready when you get there but it's always delicious!"}
{"text":"For was spot on. Shrimp cooked to perfection. Waitress was very pleasant and I was all buy myself except for a steady stream of take-out Orders. Wish it was closer to home but will be making the trip over again."}
{"text":"I ate way too much, but was very happy to have found this place close to my hotel in Greentree. If you are in the area I totally recommend it."}
{"text":"To be fair, we only visited this restaurant once. We went with friends, based on the reviews. That was the first mistake. Second mistake was getting excited over the \"authentic Thai food\". Not. The restaurant was empty when the eight of us arrived. Empty. We were the only table. Still, there was a hubbub about where we'd sit, with the shadow waitress annoyed that we wanted to sit in an alcove because it would be quieter. \"But that's a table for ten\" she protested. Yes, we would make it up with the tip, we promised. She made no bones about how disgruntled she was, though. A few points. If you have a brand new waiter with someone shadowing him to make sure he gets it right, the shadow should speak up now and then. Like when the brand new waiter has never heard of \"club  Also, train your waiters to WAIT. If someone is in the middle of a sentence, it's really irritating to have the wait person interrupt, not just once, but constantly. Even asking \"Is everything all right here?\" could have waited 30 seconds until the person speaking had finished their sentence. If you're going to serve dirty utensils, and a customer points it out and asks for replacements, apologize. And since they're all wrapped in a napkin together, take back all those utensils, not just the errant spoon. And for Pete's sake, teach your waiter the terms! Our waiter had never heard of nuoc cham. He wasn't sure what fish sauce was. Thai chili peppers were beyond his ken.  We really had been looking forward to this. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"Ive personally never been there but my family and i decided to stop there after a long day of shopping. We walked in the door an hour before the sign said was the closing time. Mind you there was not a tabke in the place. And the hostess said they are ready to close the cooks want to go home. So we turned around and never went back. Nor will i."}
{"text":"This is a nice mom and pop placed tucked away in a little strip mall.  When we went in on a Weds night, I was a little bit concerned as we were the only people there.  Thankfully, this was not an indication of the quality of their food (and I did notice a few people getting take out).  The owner was a cute little lady who told us the history of the restaurant, as well as her own journey to this country.  The food itself was very tasty and the flavors were distinctly different from your typical Chinese, Thai or Asian restaurant, and it really did have a homemade quality to it.  This restaurant lists itself as both Thai and Cambodian, but we ordered dishes that were all more Cambodian.  One thing to note - all of our dishes were somewhat sweet.  If this is something that bothers you, you might want to ask the owner before you order.  I would go back here again."}
{"text":"I had the most incredible and unforgettable curry dish here, the Sarraman beef. I live in Cleveland, but would make the trip to Pittsburgh just to visit Angkor again! Oh, and the beet flowers on the plate are so artistic and delightful! The decor is gorgeous, and our server was so sweet!"}
