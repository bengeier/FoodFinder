{"text":"If you grow up in Brampton McKay pizza is part of your life.   This small pizzeria is situated in the corner of a old plaza of Brampton they have extended hours all year round.  Offer delivery service which always comes as fast as a pick up order. My favorite is the McKay special which is loaded with fresh ingredients pepperoni mushrooms bacon green  peppers  tomato onions and generous tasty cheese. The pizza is always cooked to perfection with a nice crust and light tasty sauce. I also have had their Sicilian pizza which is a twice cooked deep dish style pie but not flooded with sauce or grease like other deep dish pizzas.  A small is more like a medium and the taste is mouthwatering soo good.  My daughter loves their stuffed patties which most Brampton kids learn to love.  They use a Jamaican style beef patty open it up and stuff with lettuce cheese and mayo a BIG hit among teenagers.  You can not and would not have pizza from anywhere else once you have had this awesome pizza!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Brampton at a reasonable price. Take out or prompt delivery. Look up the menu online before you call--sometimes the teenagers on the phone...well...you know THAT story.... But having said that, I've never had a wrong order so somehow it all works out.  BTW, they always say it'll be an hour to delivery but it never takes that long!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed this pizza for years.  Pizza here has the perfect crust, bottem is a tough with the rest soft and chewy,  cheese is gooey,  pepperoni is spicy.    This is not heart healthy stuff but it is good for the soul.  It's greasy, big and consistent.  This place has been around for more than 30 years.  They must be doing something right."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Pizza is spilling over the box.  None of this premade dough that is exactly 12\".  Lots of toppings on the pizza.  Patties are really good.  Try the Sicilian pizza after you get a regular pizza.  When you are handed the box use 2 hands or else you may have a broken wrist."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Mackay's pizza... Their thin crust is actually pretty thin! It does taste different than your average pizza chain, for the better, and I just think people aren't used to it. Their cheese and meat taste real and I have no problem eating the crust because its not like cardboard. Just remember, thin crust!"}
{"text":"Horrible and rude service the last few times ive gone there. Used to be my go to pizza place and the last few times i've been there they talk to you like they're doing you a favor by letting you order. Absolutely horrible and never again for me. I have been going there since high school and their service has gone to the gutters. Im sure one customer won't make a diference to them but i had to let my frustration be known."}
{"text":"The pizza definitely isn't the greatest, but still some of the better pizza you'll come across in the area.    However, its the Jamaican patties that are worth going for.  Sure, you can do it at home the same way without much trouble, but its just the fun of heading to MacKay and wanting it from there.  Its worth trying out, and very cheap to do so."}
{"text":"Awful experience!!!! Elastic band baked into the crust! Health Department call??? Way too chewy for me"}
{"text":"Now I don't give bad reviews out so easily. But it's simple why this happened. Not paying attention. I'm disappointed as I read reviews and heard this was a little gem and best food around etc etc. So we ordered take out Friday night .. 2 pizzas and some dips;  pretty easy.. where my problem comes in is when they don't listen to the customer and they still take your money. That is really frustrating. It's very simple what happened really.  We had ordered garlic dips, and we didn't get them. My pizza was a simple veggie and my fianc√© asked specifically for nothing spicy whatsoever on it. They even wrote no HP (hot pepper) on the receipt.. and that's exactly what they slapped all over my pizza!  I know what you're thinking why didn't he check the food before he left there (I did say that) but to be honest if they can't even get a simple order right of 2 pizzas and dip then they won't be having our services.   I don't turn food away very easily or like to waste it but it was that hot I just couldn't eat it  I'm hoping this was just a once off .."}
{"text":"Ordered whole pizzas for take out. Always amazing. Not sure about the slices but every time I have taken away, the pizza has been great. Not a whole lot of topping choices but the favorites are there"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza,subs and patties.  Fast service. Less marks for ambiance but they make up for that in good value."}
{"text":"I grew up around this area and ate from MacKay Pizza & Subs weekly. Its the best pizza you will ever have. I live 40 minutes away now but I still drive down for a slice and a patty. Also, years ago I came in while recovering from a cold and couldn't stop coughing. The man behind the counter gave me a drink and then wouldn't take my money for it! I thought that was incredibly sweet. Great staff, great food."}
{"text":"Ive been going to MacKay pizza for 30years now. Always great food. Its unfortunate that they now repeatedly take 1.5hrs to deliver a pizza to my home. This time they called 47min after ordering to confirm the toppings and then took another 55min to deliver. I love their food but cant have my kids waiting almost 2hrs for a pizza"}
{"text":"The service here is not inviting nor friendly. As soon as I walked in I had a negative vibe. For some reason all the workers are just chilling at the front glaring at you. From someone that's been working in restaurants that looks so bad to customers. While waiting for the pizza. The staff got into a little quarrel with some customers.  Saw some unsafe food practises. Their lettuce and cold items were sitting table top. Now let's go to the food. I ordered a vegetarian pizza and the Sicilian. First off I'm appalled they would charge such high prices for mediocre pizza. My dough was still a bit raw in some places. The cheese was cooked to my liking. Toppings were good. But was it worth the price. Nope!"}
{"text":"I have rated this place 5 stars due to a fact that this Establishment has faithful and honest employees. I had left my entire package containing my passport, visa, SIN, & my citizenship and forgotten that I have misplaced it. They handed the package over to the visa office next door to contact me. It was perfectly intact. Kudos to the team. Also its my goto place for stuffed patties and pizza slices. Open till late and quick with service. More people and organizations should be like them."}
{"text":"That one spot that is open late at night and is actually good for Pizza, Subs and Stuffed Patties. You must have the stuffed patty. Its delicious. Every time i visit here, i order that along with a pizza which is good compare to a lot others. Its a regular hotspot for hungry cops. So make sure you aren't drunk or something when you decide to go their, you might just get caught."}
{"text":"I went here around 2pm to eat a slice. It was really greasy and crunchy. I agree with the previous review."}
{"text":"So let start by saying that if you live in Brampton and have not heard of MacKay then you have been living under a rock lmao.  MacKay is a Brampton icon.  Not so much for their pizza but for the MacKay patties.  I have to say that although there are many places around that make the stuffed patty, MacKay was and is the originator.  Weather you are craving a late night snack or a full meal Mackay is the place to be.  Its kind of hard to not give this place 5 stars but their pizza is not as amazing as the patties.  Its not horrible to say the least.  The subs are pretty good as well.  If I could I would give this a 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Amazing service very fast nice people I've been going there for years they have amazing food patties,subs and pizza I love this place and the people there"}
{"text":"Famous amongst the natives for their Jamaican patties which come with cheese, lettuce and mayo.  Sounds bizarre but kinda works."}
{"text":"Home of the stuffed patties..  pizza is alright but the Jamaican patty stuffed with lettuce, cheese, mayo with the addition of hot peppers is simply to doe for.    This pizza joint has been here a long time and clearly serves the locals in the area and those that travel like myself to have them whenever I'm in Brampton.    There's always a line up but they are pretty fast and efficient in serving everyone.    Small area for seating as well, this place is a gem."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  A wonderful chewy and crispy crust topped with a flavourful and not overly acidic sauce and just enough cheese and pepperoni to satisfy your craving for great pizza.   The line up was long at lunch but moved fast and at under 6.50 for two slices and a pop you can't go wrong. Highly recommended. Oh and the staff was friendly and efficient too."}
{"text":"The thing I love about this place is that their slices of pizza are absolutely HUGE! I underdtand that when you go to a regular pizza place you'll get a 12 inch or 14 inch pizza but not here! I ordered a pizza not too long ago that surpassed my needs for the last few days because the slices were really big! It was one of the best hawaiian pizzas I've had in a while!  And if you're a fan of stuffed patties, you're definitely going to want to try one of theirs! I'm already drooling thinking about hetting another one!"}
{"text":"Good local spot to visit for quick fast food.  The MacKay Patty looked to be by far their most popular item - simply a Jamaican patty stuffed with lettuce, cheese, and tomato. Since it's a pizza place, I'm sure you could add whatever you want, but it was pretty stuffed as-is.  The place occupies two units of the plaza with the walls torn down in between - and it's evident. The cashier area (one side of the place) and the dining area (other side) look completely different. This isn't a big deal at all, considering how casual the place is. Bottom line, it gets the job done. It was lunchtime and there seemed to be plenty of happy customers."}
{"text":"Very good pizza but a perhaps unusual favourite is the loaded patty! What it is is a Jamaican meat patty sliced open and lettuce and cheese added. It's really amazing!"}
{"text":"Same quality as the other location which is to say it's very good. It might look like it's closed if driving by but that's just poor lighting. Try the patty with cheese!"}
{"text":"Don't forget to try the pizza and McKay patties mayonnaise lettuce and cheese and don't forget onions"}
{"text":"Ordered a Mackay Special,was told no more mushrooms . Asked about a substitute ingredient and was told sorry no substitute? Was still charged the whole price? Not a good first impression. Will come back though ."}
{"text":"In a word. Authentic.  Real people making good food. Subs are most satisfactory. Slices very good.  Looking forward to a full multi ingredient pizza. Been coming here for subs alone for two years"}
{"text":"Somehow this place achieves the incredible feat of never having fresh slices when you arrive, but instead old, rock hard slices with congealed cheese and soggy pepperoni's..   Note to the people running it: STOP COOKING SO MANY SLICES AT A TIME. Cooking 3 pizzas in the morning and letting it sit around all day waiting for people to buy them is not good.  Instead cook smaller pizzas and more often."}
{"text":"I mean, if you live in Brampton and you've never been to Mackay, like where are you really living?  Mackay is a Brampton staple.  I have been going here for yeaars.  I do prefer the original North Park location compared to the Gillingham location.  It's really a no frills place.  It's quick, it's delicious, it fulfills your hunger.  My go tos are the stuffed patty WITH tomatoes and or a simple pepperoni pizza.  I have ordered party size pizzas here and they do a great Canadian.  Only my favourite kind of pizza, duh!  My recent order was for a small pepperoni pizza through delivery.  The girl told me it would be about 45 mins to an hour.  The guy came a few minutes before the 45 minute mark.  Perfecto!  Pizza was hot and the cheese was melty.  Yum!  I was so surprised how cheap it was and how huge the slices were.  It's been awhile since I got delivery but I was super impressed! $9.61 with tax and delivery!  The crust is a little tough but it's nothing that really bothered me.  I don't even eat the end crust pieces.  Their sauce, like others have mentioned is simple and not too acidic and they defs do not chince out on cheese!  Just see my pic.  The slices are huge, it could've been a 10 slice pizza really lol.  I've uploaded pics of the patty to the gillingham location, but those are absolutely perfection.  Their patties are soft and they load it all up with cheese, lettuce and mayo.  I add a tomato to add a little something refreshing to each bite. It's the prefect little meal for me.  Everyone's gotta try a 'brampton patty' once in their life.  Oh ya and their pizzas by the slices are also ginormous."}
{"text":"Open Late. Fantastic for the Beef Patty stuffed with Lettuce and Mayo. If possible with Sweet onions and tomatoes. That's legit all I go for! I've tried their subs and pizza nothin great. But the patties are somethin I make a little detour for!"}
{"text":"The good: - The stuffed patties are yum! - The pizza is good (or just ok depending on the time), but still worth it to fulfill your pizza craving. - Great location (right beside the passport office and Rona) - The value/prices - The friendly staff  The bad: - The interior decor needs freshening up and possibly some renovations.  It's a big spacious location, but it only had like 2 or 3 small dirty tables.  They should paint the place a bright colour and add some nice furniture in the large seating area to make the place look a bit more welcoming and where people can actually sit and eat. Currently it's more of a take out place, but it doesn't make sense for the size of the place. I want them to do well cuz it's a great local joint. :-)"}
{"text":"This is a famous pizza spot in Brampton. It's been here for years. Lots of people have told me the pizza was great. So after living in Brampton for more then 25 years I decided to try it tonite. Well...I can say that I'm disappointed in both the toppings & the lazy tastelessness of the crust. I ordered the meat lovers pizza with onions. The crust was soggy & some of the meat looked like bologna?? Is that possible. I'm going back to Dominos for my pizza."}
{"text":"Geeeze Louiiiiiseeeee......for the longest time I have always thought MacKay Pizza had only pizza but man was I ever wrong. Growing up I loved eating beef patties. At MacKay's, they have beef patties and they fill it up with lettuce, cheese and lettuce. Absolutely tasty, cheap and hits the spot.  Best hidden place in Brampton for sure hands down."}
{"text":"Pattys are soo good! Stuffed with cheese lettuce mayo is the way to go! Pizza is good when well done and have toppings on top of cheese!"}
{"text":"My husband only orders their Sicilian Pizza.  Its a deep dish with loaded with toppings.  I order thin crusts veggies.  They are lomited with their veggies.  Otherwise, an ok local pizza joint.    Service could be better.  At times, it feels chaotic and not well organized.  Other times, I am in and out... no issues.  They also sell beef patties and subs... never had either."}
{"text":"I live around the area and am surprised I haven't written  a review.  When ordering slices you got the regular pepperoni,  Hawaiian,  cheese, and vegetarian (haven't been there in a while so not sure about veg). In terms of taste conpared to other places, it is great! You also get a big filling slice! My only  gripe about it is their crust: it is very hard to chew!   I have ordered their version of a deep dish. Now it is no Chicago deep dish but in their own way it is tasteful. Made a custom order for my sisters house party and everyone loved it. Some slices were taken home to be shared with family and my sister was called because they wanted to know where it came from and what toppings were picked.  Their patties are delicious! It comes standard with lettuce and tomato (other toppings are extra). Very tasty! Their sub sandwiches, however, are disappointing.  It's is very skinny and honestly not worth the price as you could've spent it on something else that is better"}
{"text":"First time here. Stopped in for a quick slice. Got the pepperoni which they said was fresh but was cold. Taste was bland but was eatable. Overall I was underwhelmed. Would go back to give the subs a try."}
{"text":"Pretty much the tastiest patties we have had in a long time! We were told to check out Mckays from some friend who raved about their patties. We were definitely not disappointed!  They split the patties in half and put lettuce, tomatoes and Mayo. Who knew that such a simple combination on a patty would be so yummmmmm!! Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"No idea how it stays in business. The food is greasy and burnt. Seriously the paper bag that covered my stale half warmed up pizza slice was drenched in grease. The store is dirty and scuzzy looking at best. No idea how the health department passes them"}
{"text":"A coworker brought us a pizza from Mackey a couple of months ago not knowing where it's from, a couple months later (yesterday) had a buddy telling me he had Mackey Pizza and it's the best pizza... so I had a slice and remembered the receipt, looked very familiar. The slice was nice had hot peppers and bacon. Delicious!!  So I decided to go to the pizza joint not being there before and asked \"what's good to get?\" She recommends the pizza and the beef patty. She says \"I heard we have the best beef patties\" so I say \"lemme try the best beef patty\" got the patty and ate it in my car before I drove home. Amazing! Loved it. Would I come back? Yes! Would I drive 30mins to get a beef patty? Planning to do that today.   Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza. I'm not a huge pizza lover but man this is my favorite pizza usually get a super supreme kinda pizza here with extra sauce so amazing"}
{"text":"I seriously don't understand the hype about this place. The pizza tastes bizzare and the subs are crazy dry."}
{"text":"Not sure why someone said the pizza wasn't great, because it is the best thing there. I only order pizza from there because it's so good. Unfortunately they don't have wings or it would be my only ordering spot."}
{"text":"Amazing stuffed patties. Too much cheese. Yes, there is such a thing. The pizza is bland and full of greasy oil. The customer service sucks and if it was better i would have given it a 4 stars. They made fun of me for saying perfect thank you have a good day. I took one step after my farewell and they were mocking me by saying perfect over and over and laughing. It was the asian ladies."}
{"text":"I've lived in this area for most of my life and MacKay has always been a staple for a quick lunch. The pizza slices are always filling, albeit a bit greasy. However I prefer the stuffed patties - getting it with only lettuce and mayo saves 50 cents! I usually buy two or three at a time and I'm good   Staff are friendly enough, the actual restaurant hasn't changed too much in its decades or operation, but it adds character I guess?"}
{"text":"Very dirty place. Washroom is horrible. High Chance to meet a cockroaches. Clerks are rude and impolite... Style is not part of this place. Most of the time they run out with pizza and those few sliced left over inside the warmer glass box are old like my grand father... Pizza is nothing special at all. Very hard to digest. Patties are ok, but not the best around here... People talk good about this place because they always go in starving and when you are hungry... everything taste good! I went couple time because it's in my neighbour.  But I won't go back anymore wasting my time..."}
{"text":"best pizza in the GTA  the meat lovers party size is amazing"}
