{"text":"I don't use yelp often, but I had to review this restaurant. I randomly walked in to grab a quick meal and was amazed at the service. The food was amazing, I had pho ga and garlic noodles. The server was great. She was so sweet and attentive. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for awhile and love the pho.  Kids love it too, and one is a very selective eater.  I like it because there is actually a vegetarian option.  Their signature drinks are all very good.  Service is sometimes a bit spotty, but food is great.  Miss the one on 7th St, but hoping it reopens eventually."}
{"text":"Only came for beers because it's a good location, but they were flat. Smelled like a dirty mop inside and sound kept cutting out."}
{"text":"Wish we could have enjoyed a meal here but they stopped serving food when we walked in at 9p.  Had to pay $5 to park only to find out we were out of luck."}
{"text":"Food was decent. I ordered a small bowl of shrimp pho and it was good, and the serving was more than enough (I took some to go!), but the limes were dry and so I asked for more and some of them were dry too...
I also order a Spider Spring Roll, that was pretty good, but a lot of lettuce and only like two pieces of shrimp... Might as well had ordered a lettuce wrap.
Total for two things and a fountain drink was about $23... Seems pretty pricey for it, but I guess it's okay.
The server was nice, but not once did she stop to ask how everything was, if I needed anything else... The servers were also being very loud, which wouldn't have been a problem, but when they're yelling at each other (and throwing around a few curse words here and there) across the restaurant, it's a bit obnoxious and uncalled for.

TL;DR: 
would come back for the pho, but the service makes me iffy on coming back."}
{"text":"People are very nice - I ordered the Pho with filet mignon - a little tough - but the Pho really lacked for flavor - the crispy spring roles were good and better than the Pho - but just average - being from the OC I am spoiled - maybe they are too worried about being spicy, but they need to kick it up a notch or two.  Started thinking about the pork sandwich and went Pho - wrong move - but a lot of people were eating it - maybe my tastebuds were off - place was full at lunch - Probably wouldn't go back though."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time i've eaten at this restaurant and been served sour meat with my soup. Pho Thanh at 17th and Camelback is more than worth the drive. Though it kind of sucks that we don't have a good vietnamese place downtown."}
{"text":"We live downtown and had a Viet sub craving....Rice Paper to the rescue!  Sammies were tasty and fries were awesome.  It's also nice to sit on the street just caddy cornered from the Ghost Buster's building (if you don't know, then you need to go)."}
{"text":"Very delicious food, nice environment, and perfect location.   Try the garlic noodles with the fire cracker shrimp!!! OMG so freak'n delicious. Thou I would never eat garlicy food, but these noodles are heavenly good."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant! My family and I went there around 11:30 last night and they still offered great service. Their wraps are delicious and they soups are very good. I would recommend this place to anyone who is starving and wants a good place to eat! (:"}
{"text":"We ordered normal portion of the food (five courses for three) and it took more than 50 minutes for the server to have all the food present, and made us miss our meeting session! The server was impolite: no greetings, no thank you, and even no smile. While the food was fine, the service was very disappointing, which made the meal totally unenjoyable at the end! We once looked forward to this restaurant based on Yelp's comments, but unfortunately, it was not that good!"}
{"text":"You know, the food hits the spot, the drinks dont make my wallet cry and the servers are trying their best and still have a smile to greet me. 
They recently just switched over the music and every time I come in I can see more and more improvements. 
I can say this for living and constantly being in downtown, Rice paper is for sure a place to at least try out. 
Thank you Servers and management if you see this, you guys are awesome."}
{"text":"The vegetarian options are awesome.  Firecracker sauce on tofu with the garlic noodles is an act of god.  

Also the bartenders are the bees knees.

And rp is defiantly my favorite happy hour."}
{"text":"This is not authentic Vietnamese food.  This is food made for American taste.  Even the name of the food in Vietnamese had wrong spellings all over the menu.  
I don't think this restaurant is owned by a Vietnamese person.  

The sandwich is way too expensive.  There's no such things as $9 for a sandwich meal.  Go to Lee's sandwiches and have better Vietnamese sandwich there.  

Pho did not taste good at all."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to nibble on a little bit of everything. The rice paper rolls are delicious and cheap! Happy hour prices here are one of best around."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! Pho was great, shaking beef was very tasty! Next time I'm in Phx, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Always packed at lunchtime so get there early if u want a seat. The Pho, the Bo luc lak, and the spring rolls r amazing!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wilted basil and cilantro.  Limes were dry.  Pho came out warm rather than hot and the noodles had already absorbed most of the broth.  I suspect they have ready made plates of pho lying around.  
Two stars for the atmosphere.  Located next to the lobby of the Sam Carlos hotel in Phoenix.  Hipster crowd.  That's your give away that this was more of place to be seen then enjoy good Vietnamese cuisine.  
I recommend the other more authentic Vietnamese restaurants in the city rather than Rice Paper."}
{"text":"Just another trend of poor customer service at this place. Stood, waited, seated ourself, waited, and after 15 mins with no menu or greetings we just left. Probably did us a favor considering of the other yelpers review of the pho and food here."}
{"text":"Had shaking beef there tonight.  Was not bad, a little pricey for the amount of food offered.  Service a bit slow. 

Good environment, you can choose either sit outside or inside the bar."}
{"text":"Waited for 10 minutes to be seated, 20 minutes for a glass of wine.
Hire more people jeez.
Ok review edit...Dominick just comped me a free beer for the wait , well done."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places downtown! Amazing happy hour specials for food and drink. All of the servers and bartenders do a fantastic job and really seem like they enjoy working here. Food is fresh and delicious. Try the lychee infused vodka!"}
{"text":"Great place, best happy hour in Phoenix. The bartenders Victoria and Tika will show you the up most respect, and make any visit feel better than the last. Great music and good crowd."}
{"text":"I love the downtown location but they close at 9p, I wish they stayed open just a little bit longer for the weekend! The other location seems to always be packed. Some of the food is a bit more pricey than what it should be which does prevent me from eating there as much as I would otherwise, but the wait staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Great fun place. The Veggie Pho was fragrant and yummy. Friendly service - be careful sitting outside people smoke like crazy here so lots"}
{"text":"I am reviewing this place as someone that has been here on multiple occasions for lunch and dinner.  At this point, I am so-so on recommending.  As a DT phoenix place, I want to see them succeed, but they need work:   

If you read the less than great reviews of this place, a common theme about the serving staff comes up.  These are correct, service is not the best, but I am here to defend them to a degree.  Put simply, they are overworked and never seem caught up.   My first thoughts are always \"they need more help.\"  They always seem stressed out, and still try to be friendly and personable..so good on them.  But please, hire 1 more staff member, and most of these complaints would disappear.   Because the food is decent - not bad by any means IMO.

Where I can't defend this place at all and has become a total turn off at this point, is the identify crisis they seem to be having between wanting to be a nice place to eat, or part of the DT bar scene.  

They have a very nice bar and happy hour specials, but with it the constant blasting of music that requires you to talk loudly to the person across the table.  Whether lunch or dinner, this obnoxious music is present.  And we aren't talking just loud in volume, but think Eminem and Lincoln park.   Angry, stress inducing songs, that even a younger audience would find off putting for a dinner with friends.  I love Eminem, but this is only suitable for a grungy college bar.   Seriously, youtube \"somewhere i belong\" by Lincoln park to understand what you may be subjected to here.  

TLDR: Hire more staff, focus on the food, change the station, and reduce by 40 decibels."}
{"text":"Excellent service! I still prefer and miss some of the older dishes but a great option to have in the area."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem of the Vietnamese eatery! Glad I found this from one of my college friends, which he learned from his coworker!!

The food is superb and meets each and every of my expectations! I ordered the pho and it reminded me of the one I had at home, in Hawai'i. It's really nice to find a similar Vietnamese eatery--at reasonable price--as the ones I frequent in my home state.

As for drinks, they have many to offer, ranging from soft drinks to alcoholic cocktails. They're GOOD! I ordered a drink with a word of \"Asian\" (because I was told by a waiter that it was good so I thought why not) and it was very delicious!

Now I know, whenever I come back and visit in Phoenix, this is the Vietnamese eatery that I will go if I ever need a Vietnamese food fix!"}
{"text":"I've only been here a handful of times because others insist \"it's the best.\"  Well, if that's all Downtown has to offer..meh. I just went quickly on my lunch break and ordered a sandwich to go. Staff seemed distracted and more concerned with socializing with kitchen staff than keeping up with customers. I waited 20 minutes for my food without even a \"hey, sorry about the wait, food will be right out.\"  As I was leaving the same staff member had gone outside and grabbed a couple of glasses (not overloaded arms or anything) but as I was leaving she rushed on by, didn't bother letting me out first, or even an \"excuse me.\"  Just not much for customer service at all. I used to work in the restaurant business and can appreciate busy times and trying to get things done, but there is (or should be) a sense of customer service in the forefront of it all.  Also, I ordered no jalepenos and, well, I bit into one and now my mouth is on fire.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Milk Jugs made for a great experience. We enjoyed he good and had a nice place to talk and eat. Will be back"}
{"text":"I'm sad to say that after the move from uptown, Rice Paper moved downhill in terms of ambiance, service and pleasantness.  

What was a respite from the hustle and bustle by way of offering  great food in a zen like atmosphere, Rice Paper devolved into a loud cacophony of sounds, televisions, and loud music.  

The previous servers were enjoyable, kind, and thoughtful.  Our last experience was of spasmodic and curt wait staff.  Our condiments were taken from us, our orders were taken in a manner that left us sorry for asking, and the bill which was previously delivered on a board was unceremoniously dropped at our table much like litter.  

The food is still great but the service and atmosphere seems to have gone down proportionally to the increase in rent by moving to downtown. 

We'll miss you Rice Paper.   Hopefully we'll meet again.   

:(."}
{"text":"This place is good if you're looking for a light lunch. I ordered the garlic noodles (side) as an entree and it filled me up. I would recommend getting those as an entree. I had to add a little more soy sauce into it but that might just be my own taste preference for saltier foods. As for the pho, the portions were big (my friends ordered that) but the price was a little bit more expensive (especially the egg rolls) than we expected but maybe that's because we're from the east coast were it might be cheaper. Our waiter was nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I am hard pressed to give a 5 star ratting and looked for reasons tongi with a 4 but found none. From the start amazing service, helpful, encouraged to ask questions which I did later. Nice drink selection--I chose cilantro lime press, fabulous. Ordered a tuna rice roll and small pho chay (because prices were so cheap I was sure I wouldn't get enough food). Way more than I Could eat. Asked waiter for tips on eating pho and he's sat down and explained, ever so helpful. 

Very fresh food, great flavor. Nice atmosphere, contemporary, open clean. I wanted a place to disappear from coworkers and conference attendees and I found it. Would also be great for a date or small groups."}
{"text":"Waste of money, went there to use a groupon. We love Pho and have been wanting to try this place, we ordered our food to go. Ordered a Salmon Salad with extra avocado, got home and the salad was nothing but Romaine lettuce and slimy salmon with the skin still on it, was super disappointed :-(.   My friend ordered Pho and the noodles were falling apart, no garnishes for the Pho super bland. Crispy Spring rolls were BURNT! Not going back."}
{"text":"Nothing special - not a lot of flavor or quality ingredients. The service was slow. Underwhelming."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the food was quite good. I would recommend this bar to anyone."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the meal I had here the other night! I recommend the tofu curry dish and the calamari tempura."}
{"text":"Great Pho, great drinks and great service. Definitely a place to check out when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Even the staff can't tell me for sure if this was the same owners as the place that used to be on 7th. Regardless, went there for the 1st time (Central location) for my birthday and did not disappoint. The Veggie Pho was just as good as the old location and actually closer for me : )"}
{"text":"The pork hot pot was lackluster and the pork even tasted a bit old.  Almost like it was cooked with dishwater.
I'll try this place again, but will have another dish.  If it's better, I'll come back with  better review.
This was take-out food."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see Bonjour Vietnam had been replaced, but I was pleased that it had been replaced with Rice Paper.  I had heard good things about the other location on 7th Street and have been wanting to try it out.  Rice Paper lived up to expectations.  I'm not an expert on Vietnamese cuisine, but what I had was very good - the Saigon salad with grilled chicken.  My lunch mate had the Enlighten Me roll with a side salad and enjoyed it as well.  Delivery of the food took just slightly longer than I would have expected, but it wasn't a big deal.  It was nice out.  If you had been to Bonjour Vietnam previously, the decor and seating are basically the same at Rice Paper.  We sat outside on the Monroe side.  I was in the sun and would have been a little warm were it not for a pleasant breeze."}
{"text":"Looks like a popular spot. The interior deco is quite hip - I like the Vietnamese hats on the ceiling. Pho was ok - nothing special/impressive, the broth was not very thick/savory. Spring rolls were quite good."}
{"text":"Simple .. I got a fly in my soup :( tasteless not good as i remember .. plus extra protein (fly in my soup).. love when they where at the other location .. sorry guys.. but not good move."}
{"text":"2 Stars only because it was severely understaffed at lunch time.  I sat at the bar to make a to go order, and have a beer while I waited.  10 minutes went by before I was even acknowledged, and handed a menu.  I ordered a water and beer, got the beer only.  Ordered a sandwich, roll and pho to take back to my office (across the street, so I could be a regular customer.)  20 minutes later, got my order - which I was fine with because I knew they were busy, and left a more than generous tip knowing the staff was working hard.  Get to my office, and there was no pho.  I can get a chicken sandwich anywhere, but I really wanted the pho.  IF I go back, I will check to see if it's understaffed and if it is, I will walk out."}
{"text":"Awesome Pho and Spring Rolls, wide variety.   Service was great.  If in Phoenix definitely make your way to the Rice Paper."}
{"text":"First of all we had a certificate from Restaurants.com that we wanted to use for $25 and couldn't so that put us off right then and there since the certificate says spend $50 get $25 off - my first impression when I looked at the menu: OVERPRICED! Wilted basil and cilantro.  Limes were dry.  Pho came out warm rather than hot and the noodles had already absorbed most of the broth.  I suspect they have ready made plates of pho lying around.  The food itself was atrocious. Worst pho I've ever tasted. Service was extremely poor as the servers had no clue how to wait on patrons and we had to repeat ourselves before they got the order right.
Two stars for the atmosphere because although they have a very nice bar and happy hour specials, but the constant blasting of music that requires you to talk loudly to the person across the table. Located next to the lobby of the Sam Carlos hotel in Phoenix.  Hipster/Yuppies type of crowd.  That's your give away that this was more of place to be seen then enjoy good Vietnamese cuisine.  The place could use an intervention by any show on @thefoodnetwork  to give this damn place a restaurant rescue. Where's #GordonRamsay when you need him? Oh I didn''t mention the flies buzzing around either.
I recommend the other more authentic Vietnamese restaurants in the city rather than Rice Paper."}
{"text":"Literally the worst pho I've ever had. Sounds harsh but it's true. I come from California and I worked at a Vietnamese restaurant so I was extremely disappointed when I had their steak and shrimp pho. The broth was flavorless. The greens were brownish looking. Maybe it's just Arizona but I can't wait to visit home and have some good pho"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant quite a few times and the food is really good. I wouldn't say that it's amazing, but it is really good. The service is hit or miss, but they are always very nice! It's just that at times, they can forget to come around to refill drinks, bring hot sauce, etc during their \"rush-hour\" times. I've experienced this more than once. Overall, they get a good rating because I like the food and the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Good tasting food, better to eat there. Called in a pick up order. Was ready when I picked up. Everything was there including sauces. Got the pork bahmi it was good, not to much mayo. Bread was soft on the inside crispy on outside. Will go again."}
{"text":"Arrived at 11:35am.  Ordered two rolls, crispy chicken and a fresh spring roll called the spider roll.   3 other members of the party also ordered.   40 mins later we finally get our orders.  I only received the crispy roll.   The waiter stands there looking at us so I mention I am still waiting on another roll.   He says \"Spider roll, right?\"   He heads off.   10 mins later he comes back and tells me it was taken to another table and they are going to remake it.   My lunch hour is over so I tell him I can't wait.  No apology from the waiter whatsoever.  Brings me a bill for the one roll I did receive.  $5.96.   Again no apology.   I put a $5 & $1 on the bill.  He asks me if I need change.   No thanks.  $0.04 tip was $6.00 too much.   Avoid this place.  No idea what service should be, and a complete waste of my time.   I work across the street and I will be sure EVERYONE knows the awful service I received.   Going to Tom Yum from now on."}
{"text":"I work in the industry, so I hardly ever give bad reviews but this one is warranted. I love going to the Rice Paper located on 7th st, but last night they had some equipment malfunction so my friend and I ventured to the location on central. The server was new, she didn't have tell us though, she knew nothing about the menu or drinks. Service was horrible. It took over 30 minutes to get a cocktail, even longer for food. By the time we finally got our order in they came back to us about 20 minutes later to say they didn't have enough bread for my friend's sandwich, they were also out of her other choices so she finally settled on a third pick. Being that this delayed her order, my food was brought out way before hers, I had long finished by the time she received her food, about an hour after we first attempted to place an order and more than 30 minutes after mine came to the table. The food was nothing to talk about. The fresh rolls were awesome, as good as the ones from 7th st, but my banh mi was soggy, and her curry was disgusting. The bill was dropped with the undelivered sandwich still on it. I realize that there are a lot of factors that play into service, aside from the server. Not every experience can be perfect every time, and maybe they dealt with some unexpected volume due to the other location being closed; however, communication is important. Tell me if you have just been sat and need some time, just acknowledge me, tell me that your kitchen is slow tonight, that's fine. I have served tables for almost a decade, so I am pretty understanding but communicate ahead of time instead of apologizing later. I will say that the gentleman working was much better, but I think he had a lot to deal with since the girl was so new and he was also bartending. Anyway, ill definitely still visit the other location regularly, not so sure ill go back to this one."}
{"text":"Oh man, Rice Paper is seriously so delicious. Thinking about the food is making me want to go back there again. If you like pho, try this place! It's kind of small but it has huge flavor!"}
{"text":"i had a traditional spring roll and the pho (meatlovers).. Very good phó and it had the traditional fresh veggies and the three sauces that you look for.. so if your craving that fresh basil taste and traditional viet food, with a cool little bar and modern decor... This is the place"}
{"text":"I had a major pho craving after a long day of work in the hot Arizona sun. Yeah, even though it was 95 degrees, eating a hot bowl of pho just sounded so satisfying.

We walked over here from our hotel as we didn't feel like taking a Lyft. It's a small restaurant with a bar and an outside patio. Since it was hot AF, we took a corner spot inside and proceeded to order. The bartender took our order and he was way friendlier than the other guy who came and brought us our utensils. 

We ordered shrimp spring rolls, pho tai, garlic noodles and pork banh mi. 

Shrimp spring rolls - tiny order for $5.75. It comes with ONE roll cut into two pieces. Pass on this.

Pho tai - I got a large for around $15 and on a scale of 1-5, it comes in around a 2.75. The broth had no flavor and the beef was quite chewy. 

Garlic noodles- these were pretty good, and I would have eaten more had I not ordered the big bowl of pho.

Pork banh mi- my colleague said he liked it and it was huge. The salad that came was it was disappointing as it was basically the lettuce in the sandwich. 

All of this cost $45 and some change. It's definitely on the pricey side, but if you're in town and want pho, it's not a terrible place."}
{"text":"Stopped into this small restaurant while in Phoenix on business.  Waited a few minutes to be seated and then almost an hour until we were served our starters.  All in all, we spent 2 1/2 hours for a couple of spring rolls and 2 bahn mi sandwiches (nothing else to do on a lazy Saturday afternoon).
The restaurant was clearly understaffed. The hostess seemed only partially concerned about the wait times, while the lone server was running non-stop, clearly overwhelmed.  A busboy wandered about, seemingly oblivious to the plates and glasses piling up on vacated tables and the small bar.  In addition, the kitchen staff was taking hours to turn out relatively simple orders.
Now for the positive. The \"traditional\" spring roll, really a summer roll, was a nice combination of pork, shrimp and fresh, crisp lettuce and vegetables wrapped in the eponymous skin. Served with a peanut sauce, it was a great starter. Crispy, chicken spring rolls were split lengthwise and served with a sweet and spicy chili sauce, also good, but served only slightly warmer than room temperature.
We chose braised pork bahn mi sandwiches for our lunch entree, which contained an ample portion of tender pork and fresh vegetables on the traditional soft baguette. They were excellent.
The pho seemed to be very popular, although we didn't try it. 
The very positive; although we never complained about the wait times, or maybe because we never complained, the server took it upon herself to discount our bill. The prices were already very reasonable, so this was a pleasant surprise.
All in all, this was a nice meal. I would try again, but if the wait was similar, I might look for a different choice."}
{"text":"Tuna spring tool was good but a little light on the tuna. The braised pork was great. The small soup was oversized and very flavorful"}
{"text":"I was in town from Los Angeles for a business meeting.  This place was close to my hotel and I had a urge for Vietnamese. Coming from Los Angeles where we have high standards for Vietnamese food this place was pretty good.  A little pricey by LA standards for Vietnamese food but it's located downtown by all the hotels so I'm sure everything's a little more expensive in this area.  Nonetheless really happy I found this place. I had the pho tai and the spring rolls. They have a really interesting wide selection of rolls.  Did not get a chance to try their main entrées which did seem to look pretty good looking over at other people dining.  
They apparently have some really good happy hour specials which I missed because I came for a late dinner.  The happy hour ends at 6:30 PM.  
Would definitely come back to this place again if back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I work in downtown Phoenix and love having Rice Paper nearby. Best happy hour downtown. Highly recommend combining the firecracker shrimp and garlic noodles, great service too!"}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese restaurant in downtown Phoenix! It was a cold January afternoon and I was in need of hot noodle soup to help me warm up. This came up on Yelp search and was pleased to see a review from a familiar face and she is #1 on check in here. My expectations grew as I know she loves to eat good food.

I couldn't decide which pho to order so I asked a friendly server to help me pick. He suggested to order Pho Dac Biet but substitute meatball for filet mignons cube. I like variety of meat but at that same time I was intrigued by cubed filet mignons, and his suggestion was a perfect solution. I throughly enjoyed every bite of my meal, soup was just right, meat was tasty (I dipped them in spicy hoisin sauce). 

Service was great! He was funny and attentive, kept coming back to refill water with copper water pitcher. I kept looking at the water pitcher while I ate and finally couldn't help myself but to order Moscow Mule after my lunch. They had a happy hour with good price, if I have a reason to be in downtown often, I thought this could become my regular hangout."}
{"text":"Coming from San Francisco, CA which is surrounded by all different kind of food especially where the Vietnamese food is very cheap, my first impression when I looked at the menu: OVERPRICED! 
We ordered SMALL beef, tripe, meatballs Phos which cost $9 and they tasted very salty. The pork spring rolls don't taste great either.

The location of this restaurant is great which is inside the Hotel San Carlos in downtown Phoenix surrounded by hotels and bars. If you want to go to the restroom, it is located inside of the hotel so you have to walk out from the restaurant and find the restroom, which is not too far.
Even though it is small but the atmosphere is cool, they had a TV with big screen that you can watch while eating/drinking.

However.. I won't recommend this place for the Pho and Spring Rolls! :)"}
{"text":"I am incredibly disappointed with this restaurant. I was a frequently returning customer at the 7th avenue location until they closed. This was my first time coming to the downtown location and I have never been served food this gross. I ordered 2 spring rolls to-go. When I got home I opened up the box to see that nothing was intact. The rice paper rolls were completely ripped. I started to eat but I realized that the lettuce was brown but even more gross the mint was completely brown and some pieces were rotten. I called and told the manager and he offered me two free rolls on my next visit but I don't think I'll be going back any way."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is a very negative review. I have in all my life never dealt with such unprofessionalism.  After traveling for ten hours I was pretty hungry. It was 830 pm and I hit Yelp looking for some pho. Rice paper came up and wasn't too far. I arrive at 840 and spend 10 minutes looking for parking. They have NO parking here. Finally pay for parking in a garage. Walk into rice paper at 850. Manager tells me kitchen is closed. Posted hours are 9, he says they always close the kitchen at 845. Well if that's the case you guys should post your hours accordingly. I ask to speak to the owner. He points to a woman sitting at the bar eating. I being respectful didn't want to interrupt her meal. I leave and call the restaurant back. The manager I spoke with answered. I asked to speak to the owner. He says she's not there. I reply \"really, well I was just there 2 min ago and she was eating at the bar\". He says \"oh it's you, well she doesn't want to talk to you\".  I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Needless to say I will never be coming here again."}
{"text":"Myself and 8 coworkers decided to try something new for lunch. We arrived when there was no more than 7 other people in the restaurant.  It took 40 mins before we received our food. I was perplexed as to why it took so long when the restaurant was not even half full. Once our food arrived I was very pleased to find that everything was delicious. I ordered the ever popular \"lunch box\" with chicken. Rice Paper has a modern feel and ouside seating. It was way too hot outside to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"DANG!  This place has spectacular food.  The atmosphere is very modern, which is not necessarily my thing, but it was cozy enough.  The wait staff was super nice and helpful, but what really stood out was the food.  The lemongrass chicken with garlic noodles were just amazing!  Those noodles made me wanna go to Phoenix every weekend.  Just wow."}
{"text":"Tiny little place, but so cute!!! Huge selection of amazing fresh spring rolls! We got the grilled chicken and the tuna. Our waitress was very sweet and fast!"}
{"text":"I had never been to this restaurant and we had a friend come into town for her birthday and this is where we chose. The spring rolls are enormous and absolutely delicious! All the food was absolutely delicious and I will definitely be back. I do like how you can sit inside and outside as well."}
{"text":"The food is good, the restaurant is clean. What is distracting, though, is the hip hop coming from the speakers - so loud that you can't have a conversation. This also is the reason why the waitresses have to yell at you and each other. Not a great atmosphere. Change the music and turn down the volume and this is a great place."}
{"text":"The Pho is good. and the bento box is alotta food!!. the drinks are tasty and at a great HH price. the bartenders are cool. the owner is cool. look. JUST TRY IT!!"}
{"text":"Great Pho. Great atmosphere. Fresh ingredients. Downtown needs more places like this. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Robert had chicken pho & I had pho with meatballs.  So fresh and seasoned perfectly! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"For a \"modern\" vietnamese restaurant, I expected higher quality of meat.   My meatballs were sour and tasted weird.  I feel sick after eating there.  Would not recommended..."}
{"text":"I miss the old Rice Paper.  This is right in the heart of downtown so obviously parking will be difficult. 
The space is really small. 
I came and got an order for myself and a to go order. 
I decided to start with the crispy chicken roll.  Good flavor but took well over 15 minutes just to get that.  Since I was on a meter for parking I decided to ask them for my Pho to go as well.  Took another 30-40 minutes to get my Pho to go and came AFTER my initial to go order.  I feel like the dine in meal should come out first but I digress. 

I will come back just for the garlic noodles (which they were out of when I came ) but I dont recommend dinning in. Call ahead for togo only if you are going to do it. 

Pretty bummed because I loved the old Rice Paper :("}
{"text":"This restaurant has a really cool location so we would love to like this place which is why we have given it several chances.  But we have been disappointed time and time again.  First, the prices are high for a Pho joint ($75 dinner for two people after drinks), but I don't mind paying because I understand they need to afford their rent, but the food is subpar and the service is TERRIBLE.  We had to repeat our order several times to the waiter who couldn't seem to remember anything and never checked on us; he also did not have the excuse of being busy because the restaurant was fairly empty.  Our appetizers came after one entree; meanwhile the second entree came way later.  So I ended up starting my meal after my boyfriend was long finished with his meal.  My pho was also cold after I had waited about an hour for it.  They definitely had difficulties organizing and phasing orders in the kitchen- there were also only 4 tables of people in the restaurant.  Another thing:  the two tables next to us were also airing their grievances about the horrible service- very clearly disappointing to everyone around.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Just moved next door to this place and had to try it out. Great food, atmosphere and food. Very chill and just great overall experience. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Rice Paper is a great stop for lunch (or Happy Hour) in your central downtown Phx area. They used to be Bonjour Vietnam, but have changed for some reason. 

The venue itself isn't too huge, but is decorated in contemporary design and has add'l tables/seating on patio area.

Service has always been very friendly and helpful. I haven't tried too many items on menu but do recommend the Ahi Tuna (raw) salad. Yum! I had the Filet Mignon Pho for lunch and it was delicious, however, I wish the meat was on the more medium to rare side. NOTE: Cilantro sprigs aren't served by default; if you need this to add to your soup, just ask! :)

Spring Rolls (I was eye-balling with envy) looked tasty too. Next time."}
{"text":"Hoping my experience was a fluke. I was so excited to come here and order to-go so that I could have dinner later. I came in around 2-2:15pm and there was only two other people in the place. Easy to find as someone mentioned it's within the San Carlos hotel. I ordered the Buddha spring roll (fresh) which has jicama, avocado, mushroom and tofu. I also ordered the garlic noodles and firecracker shrimp per the suggestion of some Yelp reviews. Everything was packed accordingly and I took it with me to work. When I heated my shrimp and noodles later, they didn't taste so good. It was a good portion size, more than I'd eat in one sitting but I finished it. I felt sick that night and wasn't sure if it was from the food or eating so much. 

The spring roll had a strong odor to it and it seemed like it came from the mushrooms. I didn't bother to eat it and took it home. Maybe some foods just don't keep well after being refrigerated and are better eaten fresh. I'd still like to come back and try their vegetarian pho but I'm in no hurry."}
{"text":"Not that impressed so far. Server seems like she doesn't want to be here. I asked to substitute a fresh spring roll for the crispy spring roll and was told they can't do substitutions. The fresh spring roll is even a dollar cheaper, really???"}
{"text":"I was craving vietnamese but didn't have high expectations when I visited this place. I was pleasantly surprised! While they didn't have my go-to meal (bun), the pho with steak was delicious and the spring roll options were plentiful. AND can't beat the happy hour beer prices. I'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"We ate here Friday evening.  Food was excellent.  Firecracker Shrimp is probably the best shrimp I have ever had.  I almost wanted to get 2 more orders and make it a meal in itself.  We also had Tom Pho Soup which was also excellent.  3rd item was Braised Pork which was perfectly cooked and we even added some to the soup.  There was no disappointment at all.  It was also happy hour and cant remember the drinks we ordered but they were on the Signature .menu for $6 and not only were they extremely tasty, they don't skimp on the alcohol.  How can you beat that?  Am I going to eat here again?  Just try to stop me!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Vietnamese cuisine. Had their bento box and was very disappointed. I asked to replace a fried roll for a fresh one and they agreed. Little do they tell you of an up charge. On top of it the rice paper was hard and dried out and vegetables were wilted and old. I ordered the chicken for protein which was also very dry. Very disappointed with my lunch and won't be returning."}
{"text":"This  is a tiny place downtown but very quaint. Nice atmosphere as well. My friend and  I came here for lunch as we were craving pho and thought we would try this place out. 
Waiter was nice and had a great smile. We got the menu and it was pretty small but it seemed to have enough on the menu. lots of spring roll options. Too many too remember. However after looking at the prices for just one, my friend and I decided to pass as we would have been looking at $20 for lunch, which sucks. lol
The Pho was GREAT. It had good flavor  and after a little siracha etc., it was even better!  Again it was a little costly...$11!  I did like the place but will try to find somewhere near for better  priced lunch specials. I will come back though."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Vietnamese restaurant in town. Service was extremely poor as the servers had no clue how to wait on patrons. 

We waited about 15 minutes just to get water and a single coffee order for the table. A manager had to come over and let the server know that we hadn't yet received any drinks. To make matters worse no one handed us a menu after being seated. Finally when we got menus: All three of us who dined had to repeat our order at least 3 times before the server got our order right. 

The food itself was atrocious. Worst pho I've ever tasted. My sister got a chicken sandwich that wasn't even edible. Literally the chicken tasted rancid. As if you were eating tendon and bone rather than real meat. Thankfully the waitress compensated us for the awful sandwich. 

Would not recommend it. Wouldn't go again. Ownership needs to make improvements ASAP. Cause this place is a catastrophe."}
{"text":"I ate there three times during the Spr '17 MRS meeting. The first time I visited there was during the peak hours in noon. This place is small so it was filled with people eating and I hardly find a seat to sit down. I ordered the lunch box (but actually served with a plate. Execuse me???) and added with vege salad (+$2). It turned out that the box itself was good enough. The box contains a portion of rice with stir-fried beef chunks, baby mazes, green peans and onions. The egg roll accompanied was also good. The only point that I would complain is the slow service speed during the peak hours (may be due to limited number of server). I waited for 30 min to get my meal delivered and was late for my after meeting session."}
{"text":"This is the second time we come to this place. Sadly we had a very bad experience today. We decided to enjoy our Saturday here since it happened to be a rainy cold day in phoenix which anyone who's ever visited or lived in phoenix knows a day like this is rare! So we went today with a big crowd of friends a total of 10 of us. When we are seating down a cockroach starts walking on the wall behind one of my friends. We freaked out a little bit and a girl named Sarah which later on we found out it happened to be the manager said \"is an old building guys\" VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. Is almost like she said \"suck it up is not a big deal\" like we're her kids. We decided to stay because it was such a nice day we didn't want his to ruin it which happened to be a bad idea because 10 min after another cockroach starts walking on the wall again. So we decided to complain and the manager again just said \"is an old building & we can't just shut down for a day to take care of this\" SO EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL I totally do not want to recommend this place! I hope she gets fired for being sooooo rude and soooo unprofessional. The least she could have done is apologize instead of excusing herself! I hope this helps someone else to decide NOT to come here unless you appreciate and enjoy cockroaches as your friend and a rude manager giving you attitude"}
{"text":"What!!! I'm so disappointed. This was my first time at this location, and the service was top 3 worst I've ever had in my life. Only gave 2 starts not 1 because the pho was still consistently good( in line with the other location). Our drinks took about 10 min, which the waitress apologized for. I had to eye her down for everything- drinks, food, more food, the bill. Our \"appetizer\" of a spring roll came halfway after we had eaten our pho. What!? She left our many plates in front of us for the whole rest of our time there, and I actually had to ask her if she could take them away. There was never more than 4 or 5 individuals in the whole restaurant, I have no idea why the food or drinks took so long and why she was so inattentive. I found some weird non-food string in my pho, and was given 1 and 1/2 tofu steaks, the 1/2 looked like someone had bit off it. The whole place just felt dirty. It was surprising because the place on 7th street is soooo good and clean and has great service! Anyways, I will definitely not come back here. I felt embarrassed that I invited my friend here."}
{"text":"Let's start by talking about this location. It's stationed within the San Carlos Hotel, nooked on the corner between the hotel and an Irish bar. It's small, yet efficient. This location is my favorite amidst the others. Although I believe the 7th st location closed. The prices are a little higher than competing Pho Restaurants but they do offer a wide array of spring rolls. Something a little outside the box. 

This trip we went with the Saigon Rolls which are asparagus and tempura shrimp loaded. I went with the Filet Pho and she went with the Tofu Pho. Both were your average pho. Look, to me, it's pho, unless there is something I'm missing, it's typically a pretty consistent taste whether it be Noodle Ranch, Pho Thang and etc. I'll be back, I did want to try their lemon chicken which looked good however 16.00 seemed a bit pricey for chicken."}
{"text":"This location is located in the San Carlos hotel in the heart of downtown Phoenix. You don't have a lot of Vietnamese only restaurants here in downtown so stop by here! They also have a location on 7th street which is more small and condensed. The menu consists of traditional dishes like spring rolls, crispy rolls (egg rolls) as some people may know them as, traditional and also modernized with a twist! Rice paper also has pho, 2 sizes depending on your appetite! Vegetarians and some vegan options are also a choice here! Menu is simple, they also have a great HH reverse HH, and awesome drink menu! I stopped by, went into the hotel entrance got greeted right away, I also got attended with a drink which I chose the green tea which is delightful! Free refills for anybody wondering if they do that! They also have a good delicious traditional Vietnamese iced coffee which is very heavenly I might add! I had many suggestions to get the firecracker shrimp, which is a starter didn't know it was huge pieces of shrimp so delicious I combined it with the garlic noodles, I recommend it on the same plate which they'll be happy to do! I wanted to order more but once I started eating my plate I was so full! Such a good meal! Definitely coming back for more! Also want to thank James my server for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, a great happy hour, and the perfect downtown atmosphere. The gentlemen who work there are also super friendly! Last Sunday they even discounted the price for our champagne. I definitely recommend this little restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is great and the staff is friendly. One of downtown's great little restaurants."}
{"text":"Bad service.. Food is good if you have time to wait for the staff to realize you have been waiting. Poor  service overall."}
{"text":"First impressions: nice down town feel, clean on the inside, Wasn't greeted when I walked in, maybe a bad day for the host. Modern vibe. Prices were a bit high compared to other places a bit i chalked it to the location being in downtown.

Food: pho dac biet large

Verdict: overall I was quite surprised! The broth was very flavorful, well balanced with spices and the beef broth was very well done. My Unami pallet was well triggered. One criticism though it might have been a bit too much on the salty side. For a large the price was high ($11) as I said but they didn't skimp out on putting lots of meat, tripe and brisket. Kudos. I've been eating pho my entire life so props to the care and time taken. Food took awhile to come out and the service could have been more friendly but they are doing pho justice here."}
{"text":"I was staying in downtown Phoenix and was craving some Asian food. Thanks to Yelp, I found this place just a few steps from my hotel! I went around 4pm to pick up a grilled pork banh mi. 

Although it wasn't the best banh mi that I've ever had (and a bit pricey for the amount of food), it was solid and definitely satisfied my craving. The bread wasn't as crusty as I would have liked, but it was stuffed with delicious pork. I would have liked a bit more pickled cucumbers and carrots, but luckily I had chosen a salad for my side and added the veggies to my sandwich.

The interior is clean, well decorated. The servers were attentive and fast (although there weren't many other people there at the time)."}
{"text":"I loved trying this place. You can order two rolls per person and share. The food is fresh and different.  

We sat outside and were approached by two people asking for money. It isn't the fault of the restaurant, but it did make us uncomfortable. But once the weather gets really hot you'd be inside anyway."}
{"text":"I wanted to give 2 1/2 stars. I had 2 people recommended this place to me in a span of 1 week. The food is very good, great serving size and style. Love the spicy flavor in the broth of the pho. Although the chicken tasted somewhat freezer burned or old.. The reason I didn't give 5 stars, because the waitress... I don't know her name but she was VERY rude.. the place was empty, yet she sat me in the farthest corner possible. Then she seemed irritated that I didn't know what I wanted when I had never been there before.. she didn't take any time to explain anything to me, and left me sitting for 30 mins before finally taking my order. She never checked if I needed more water or anything.. it wasn't until the check came that she started acting and talking sweetly to me. I was not about to give her a tip. So I gave her cash, asked for change and, she only brought the bills back, and not the change... will never eat in again. Definitely going to get take out tho, but probably something vegetarian."}
{"text":"I read the previous reviews here, and I hoped it was a fluke. Sad to say it wasn't. After being to many pho restaurants around town, Rice paper is by far the worst.

It's quasi pho. Semi pho. The Diet Coke of pho. Just one calorie, not pho enough.

Seriously though. The food isn't that good. What normally costs $6.85 or $7.25 for a small bowl at other places is $14 here for a large.

The broth is terrible. It tastes to be made out of bullion .. salty and flavorless. 

The spring rolls are 1 (ONE) for $6.00. And it's half lettuce.

I came. I tried. I was disappointed. I want my money back ."}
{"text":"Nice setting soft music lunch time is nice.
Try the lunch box. With my wife Shirley Minter Phoenix Az. Down town. Nic was awesome we can't wait to return. Thanks Nic."}
{"text":"Had really good pho tai here. It's a great location with a nice view of the inter city. Check it out and you won't regret it"}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch several times now and each time the food was delicious.

The Pho Ga is very flavorful and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The crispy rolls are average but the fresh rolls are amazing."}
{"text":"The food was good, and they had a large variety of spring rolls. But everything was extremely over priced, this is why my rating is low.  The cheapest small bowl of pho was $8. Other than that, our waiter was polite and everything came out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"This is where you go, when you first go to that new ramen place down the street for lunch, only to find out they've run out of food.  They've run... out of food...  Didja catch that?

You know what I liked about this place?  It's in like a hotel lobby, so if you want to use the restroom, you have to walk into the lobby, past the front desk, around the corner and down the narrow hall... as opposed to the foodless ramen place, which has a restroom icons above a hallway, but when I pushed through the door, I ended up in the kitchen.  The look the workers gave me was like \"hey buddy, you're not peeing in here.  You're not peeing anywhere\"

You know what else I like?  The fillet meat in the pho was chunk meat, not thin slices.  And it was good.  Did you happen to see my photo?  That was a good photo, huh?  I had help"}
{"text":"I came to Arizona for vacation with friends and we went here one night because we were all craving pho. Considering the location, this place is great! My pho dish that I got was only about $9 and there were sauces on the table for us to put in our pho. Some of my friends got their banh mi to go with fries and it tasted awesome! I would definitely come back to this place again if I'm here for another visit."}
{"text":"I am so excited to have found pho near my workplace. I've come here a few times and the pho is great. Service is awesome.

My favorite is Pho Tai (beef pho) and my coworker always orders the Pho Ga. Everything is piping hot and fresh. This place will definitely meet all your expectations!!"}
{"text":"So I been coming here since they were located on 7th street until they moved locations to downtown. One of my favorite pho places to go. I always get the filet mignon small pho. The two options small or large is great depending on how much you want to eat. Other places don't have this sizing option. I usually start a their fresh spring rolls. They pretty big and each comes w two rolls. My favorites are the Saigon which has tempura shrimp, asparagus served w miso ginger sauce and the Buddha which has tofu, shiitake mushrooms, avocado, jicama serves w peanut hoisin sauce. And the fire cracker shrimp appetizer is to die for!! Who doesn't like tempura shrimp tossed in spicy garlic aioli?? My husband usually gets the shaking beef entree which is cubed filet mignon seated w soy sauce, garlic and onions served on a sizzling platter but instead of the steamed rice, he gets the garlic noodles. So good!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix for business and looking for a fresh meal and drink. Rice paper was the perfect stop! I tried the tuna spring roll and edamame; very tasty! Try the lychee infused vodka if you are feeling adventurous! Fun spring rolls and friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch and the food is pretty good. The pho was very flavorful, but the shrimp a little overcooked. I love the huge selection of spring rolls! Our service was great!"}
{"text":"I love this place from the pho to the rolls. Delicious and perfect everytime. Whenever I'm working downtown this is a must"}
{"text":"Delicious pho, good tofu rice paper wraps, and helpful servers who help you decide what to order! Loved the outdoor patio seating as well."}
{"text":"I adore Rice Paper. I used to frequent this restaurant when it was on 7th St in Cen Pho but hadn't been for almost two years. Last weekend I was looking for a place convenient to downtown Phoenix when I came across Rice Paper on Yelp, I was hoping it was the same place and it was! It's simply moved to Central Ave- yay!

This is a cute by tiny place much like the location on 7th Street was. We were able to find a metered parking spot right across the street luckily but being downtown, parking is likely to be a pain point here. 

My date and I started off with cocktails and the shrimp spring roll. Cocktails were strong and the spring roll was fresh and tasty. The peanut sauce was BOMB.COM.

For the entrees, my date ordered the Lemongrass Chicken- Chicken breast and shitake mushrooms sauteed in a lemongrass reduction served with garlic noodles. He loved it!

I had the Carmelized Salmon- Salmon filet caramelized with onions, garlic, black pepper, and filet sauce served in a hot clay pot with steamed rice. This was sooo good! Really some of the best salmon I've ever tasted and they give you two HUGE (or as Donald Trump would say, \"Yuge\") salmon filets so it's definitely worth the $20 price tag. 

The onions were perfect, the rice was perfect, the sauce was perfect. Yum!

Because the serving was so large I took half of it home for lunch the next day. Well, all those flavorful juices marinated into the salmon, onions and rice overnight and honestly it tasted even better as leftovers! 

I'm so happy Rice Paper didn't permanently close- it's one of the best Asian places in town and I'll always come back!"}
{"text":"Finally, I was craving for Vietnamese food again. Despite how horrible I felt about their services, I finally broke down and came here again. Apparently, service improves drastically since that one young lady was gone and replace her with someone else. Now the food is great, service is great and I enjoy coming here for their lunches. Keep up with the good work and i'll see u guys every week!"}
{"text":"Great appetizers, unique little restaurant, friendly and attentive staff, great pho and sandwiches and spring rolls. GET TOUR EAT ON HERE!!"}
