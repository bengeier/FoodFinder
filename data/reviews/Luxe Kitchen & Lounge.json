{"text":"Delicious cocktails and everyone in our party loved all the shareable dishes on the menu.  The ricotta gnocchi and buttermilk artichokes were my favorites.  Really fun environment and artsy decor.  Service was on point as well."}
{"text":"Luxe's cool atmosphere and hip crowd have certainly helped to build it up in the hearts and minds of the Cleveland in-crowd. Skinny jeans, thick glasses, and weighty discussions about Animal Collective's new album and its role in the establishment of an indie rock middle class abound (seriously, I had to listen to some idiots at another table talking about this once). There's also a DJ in the lounge on the weekends, so it can be pretty loud.

For me, Luxe does happy hour right -- martinis, drafts and wine are two for one and the pizzas are half off. There's also a pretty decent selection of happy hour appetizers/bar food available for 6 bucks -- including the excellent Guinness burger. Not included in the happy hour deals are the starter plates that are designed for sharing tapas-style. These can be fun with a big group but they can also be pretty pricey, and the quality of the dishes does vary.

The rest of the menu is a mix of modern bar food and nouveau Italian. (Nouveau Italian? Thanks a lot, Yelp, now I'm starting to talk like you!) I stick to the pizzas during happy hour only, as they're for the most part pretty good but they're a lot better half-off (aka I'm real cheap). The Kobe corn dog and sausage sandwich are both great! However, I've been really underwhelmed by some of the pasta dishes I've had.

If it were summer at the time of this writing, I'd easily bump Luxe up to 4 stars on the strength of its patio. Seriously, it's one of the better ones around. But overall Luxe is a pretty solid place in the Gordon Square neighborhood."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give Luxe more than 3 stars, but for me, it's not just there yet.  We called ahead of time trying to get reservations for 4, but were told that they only did reservations for groups of 6 or more.  Fair enough.  We showed up and were seated at some bar stools and promptly asked for drink orders while we waited for our table.  Right away, I liked the atmosphere and the relatively quiet and laid-back vibe going on.  When the hostess finally did come get us for the table, she informed us that we'd have to be out of there by 8 so they can seat one of their reservations.  It was 6:50 at this point.  We weren't really planning to stay all evening long, and I have no doubt that front of house folks in many restaurants have to perform a little mental jiu jitsu to make sure they have tables for everyone, but dang, keep it to yourself, ok?  We sat down feeling like we had to race to make decision or else risk getting swept off the stage by some clown in the corner.

  And then in came one of the best waiters I've ever had, a dude named Benjamin.  Any apprehension we might've felt melted away.  Our table split a couple plates, first of which was the goat cheese fondue.  I enjoy goat cheese, but wasn't sure how a fondue of it would turn out, but it was great.  Not too rich like I imagined it would be.  One of us got a margherita pizza, which was the highlight of the food selections.  Somehow the crust had the flavor of a Chicago deep dish pizza while being only slightly thicker than a cracker.  Nice!  Unfortunately, the calamari was soggy like it had been sitting in the window too long, and the mussels were 'meh' at best.  Almost ordered the fries with truffle mayo, but another guy in the party got a burger with fries and I was able to try his.  They were thick-cut steak fries that also tasted soggy like they had been made quite a while earlier.

  If we had had an indifferent waiter, I don't think I'd consider hoofing it over to Detroit Ave. again for dinner, but this guy was great and convinced me to give Luxe another chance.  I've never had the waitstaff shake my hand at the end of the dinner, and I found it oddly satisfying.  Looking forward to adding a star or two to this review on my next trip!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Luxe for a early holiday dinner  this Sunday. Upon entering you see the upscale bar area that is a pleasant mix of many styles. The cowhide booths especially caught my eye. Brandon, our server took us to our seats in the dining area and quickly served us our drinks. The attention to detail here is down to everything including the ornate menu, which was more of a piece of art, as Brandon's knowledge of the menu far surpassed What one might expect. I took his advice in ordering the gnocchi with kale, wild mushrooms, and braised short ribs. Needless to say it was excellent. As many know, gnocchi is easily ruined by being a bit heavy, but this was not the case. The menu was surprisingly affordable considering the quality of the ingredients. I would definitely like to return on a Saturday night and enjoy their wide variety of cocktails. Luxe is a \"must\" in Lakewood."}
{"text":"Place seriously has the worst service in town. Bad beer slection too. I can't even remember how the food was as I was too pissed off at the lack of service and overall bad attitute of bar tender and server. 

Cheap plastic furniture compounded by brain dead service = place sucks."}
{"text":"The biggest problem with fido friendly eateries is that while there, a couple's dog pooped, and the smell was awful."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!  Had the braciole with papardelli pasta tonight.  Best I've ever had.  Never disappointed at Vacarro's!  We'llkeep coming back forever!"}
{"text":"Initial visit 2 years ago was a disaster. Had a horrible dinner with friends we hadn't seen in ages and chose not to spoil our evening by complaining about bad food and worse service. I vowed not to ever try Luxe again, could forgive the poor food but not the rudeness.
Our boss chose Luxe for our studio holiday party dinner this year, December 19th, 2011
My expectations were low, obviously, but hopeful.
What a delightful surprise!
Our server was terrific, the owner stopped by to say hello and check in, and the food was wonderful.
We  really did have the most sensational Food, (not easy to please such a large, diverse and finicky group) Service and Atmosphere anyone could possibly hope for. The room was beautifully lit,  and artfully decorated for the holidays. Snow and holiday lights on Detroit made the room even more charming. Now we can't wait to return.
Thanks Luxe for such a magnificent evening!"}
{"text":"A definite Cleveland hot spot! The food was great,seafood was cooked perfect,same with the pizza.Service was exceptional! I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Get the potato gnocchi. You won't be disappointed. 

I came home to Cleveland and took my family to Luxe for a birthday dinner. We had a group of 8 and started off with the angry eggs, pan fried bread with chorizo and the grilled brussels sprouts. All were excellent.

The potato gnocchi was served with braised short rib, spinach and a bleu cheese sauce. The sauce was mild and much lighter than I expected. The mix of flavors was awesome. The rest of my family had mushroom ravioli, fettuccine and the pulled pork. Everyone was happy with their meals.

The service was good, not great. The reservation process was fast and easy, especially to accommodate a large group on a Saturday night. Our server seemed disappointed when we didn't order any of the pricier specials and only a few in our party were drinking.

Overall, a great experience and I would definitely go back the next time I'm visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"My friends and I  dined here on a recent Wednesday and we were a bit let down considering all the good things we have heard about Luxe. 
The first disappointment was that happy hour specials were only for those seated in the lounge area which we did not know until we were seated. Our server apologized for the inconvenience and she was very gracious but it would have been nice for the hostess to mention that fact. I had one of the daily specials, Steelhead trout with fingerling potatoes and a beer. Service was good but the dish was a little bland. The eggplant fries that our table ordered were great though. Crisp on the outside, rich and gooey inside, they could be my new addiction. All in all, I would give this a 3.5 out of 5"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in the area. I like them so much, I had them cater my wedding."}
{"text":"Love their Sunday brunch! The peach fold over and potato hash is heavenly. Last time I went, service was disappointing, but if you haven't been, definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Incredible happy hour!
Wine, beer and a list of unique cocktails are 2 for 1. 
Small plates are filling, cheap, delicious and unique! 

Try the barbeque pulled pork sliders if you get the chance. 

Oh...and the corndogs - much more dog than corn, but that's how they roll. 

Next time I am bringing a bigger purse to steal one of the incredible lighting fixtures for my house!"}
{"text":"Went to sunday brunch.  Luxe has really raised their game.  Had the folded pancake with peaches and whipped ricotta and goat cheese.  It was off the hook. You gotta try this."}
{"text":"We wanted to like this place better than we did, but a couple things made it hard to give Luxe better than just an average rating.

Our party of 4 chose the family-style dinner and gave the chef free rein to cook whatever he pleased.  To begin, we got a salad of mixed greens with feta and pine nuts which was excellent.  The main entree was walleye with hoisin sauce (good), asparagus (excellent) and roasted potatoes  (overcooked and a little soggy). Unfortunately, before everyone in our party had finished with the entree, our waitress began collecting our plates, reaching across family members who were still eating.  

Most disappointing of all was the dessert course.  The waiter brought a tray containing 4 pieces of \"ho-hos\" and two desserts in ice cream sundae glasses.  One glass contained vanilla ice cream with caramel sauce and pineapple, and the other held some sort of chocolate cream dessert.  We found this very odd: seriously,  a single glass of ice cream for a party of 4 to split it 4 ways?  Ditto for the chocolate cream dessert, which tasted like the ho-ho only worse.  If dessert is supposed to end the evening on a high note, the effect of this dessert was just the opposite.

Still, the restaurant has potential.  The decor is hip and fun and some of the meal was very good.  But if the desserts are always this cheesy, maybe the family style menu is not the way to go; forget the desserts and order a good appetizer/salad and entree a la carte"}
{"text":"Perfect perfect perfect Valentine's Day Brunch. Thank you,  Dallas, for the beautiful presentation and delicious food-- so much more than we could have imagined! Our server was Adam,  he was very attentive and really funny.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great location, great patio, great food, great service! What else could you want?!

Luxe is 'refined relaxed'. The brunch menu is fantastic. Colleen, my bartender, recommended the short rib hash, which did not disappoint! 

I asked for a Bellini to accompany my brunch dish and was offered my choice of purée- pear, apricot, mango or white peach. I couldn't help but try the pear, which was light and refreshing.

This was the perfect place for a laid back Sunday afternoon. Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"I love Luxe but this past time was awful. I come for brunch because I usually go out on the weekends to w. 9th or w. 25th but I came in with a friend on Wednesday and the male bartender was wasted. Food was great but service was awful due to his inebriated state. As I was trying to get his attention he was taking shots with who seemed to be his coworkers might of been his friends I usually love it but I just felt like he did not care at all about us being there. I want to give more stars because the food is amazing but the experience was so bad that I have to take more away. I will go there again but never sit at the bar during the evening again."}
{"text":"I was salivating over Luxe's online menu all yesterday afternoon.  We got there for happy hour and sat in the lounge.  I was a little disappointed to see the online menu didn't match up with the actual menu (less varieties of pizza- there was a pork belly one online that I'd been eyeing).  The bartenders waited on us although we sat at a table.  I liked the ambiance, especially loved the big crystal chandelier.  

Maybe I built this up too much in my head, but I was kind of disappointed with the food- except for the bacon wrapped dates.  They were really amazing.  The Belgian fries came out cold- I can only assume that they were ready first but because we ordered 4 appetizers and they wanted to bring them all out together.  (But the bacon jam on the Belgian fries was awesome!)  The chicken meatballs were so-so.  And the goat cheese stuffed piquillo peppers were blah.  Very small plates too, so we ended up getting entrees.  

I got the gnocchi & braised short ribs- which wasn't the gloriousness I was expecting, but it was okay.  I was expecting more blue cheese flavor to come through.  I tried a cocktail on their happy hour menu (the one with cherry puree and bourbon) and it was pretty good.  I just wasn't blown away.  And it was petite.  But it was a happy hour special so that's fine.  

I've been told the pizza is really good-  maybe I'll just have to get that next time.  Overall loved how the place was decorated and the menu was interesting.  Execution wasn't completely there."}
{"text":"Like Luxe. Love Marlin.  We had a wonderful pizza, a really tasty steak and garlic mashed potatoes, refreshing vodka/lemonade, some great vegetable sides. I would recommend not going on weekends until the crowds of sightseers subside. We went on a Wednesday a few weeks after they opened at 5:30, and got one of the last tables in the big side room. The noise is deafening when the place is full. My ears were ringing by the time we left, and the servers were a little overwhelmed, but gracious. Overall, we had a very positive experience, Marlin really cares, the ingredients were top quality, the menu was simple yet inventive and accessible, and the atmosphere is fun. Did I mention the reasonable prices?  At this point one can park in the Pioneer Savings lot after 4 PM and on Sundays. Stay tuned! Good, good food. Reservations for six or more only.


Update: a month later. We went on Sunday night (though it was early, 5ish) There were not crazy crowds, and the scene was much more relaxed. This time we sat in the bar area at a high table next to the window. Our server, Amy, was cute, witty and capable, and she made our evening quite enjoyable. We had Harissa-dusted wings, veal-stuffed hot pepper appetizer, and gnocchi with a basil cream sauce. The pepper was the most successful dish of the three this time. We weren't really starving, so didn't order more. I had a Rumbellini (peach juice, champagne, infused rum) which came in a champagne flute like a regular Bellini. We parked in the Pioneer Savings parking lot. It wasn't loud, since the place wasn't as packed. The ladies' room was clean and pleasant. This is important! We had a great view of the bar, which is beautiful and simple Art Deco wood, glass, and low-key neon. Marlin told us some great stories about where he had gotten the bar, the light fixtures, metal work and so on. It was a nice evening. They have an outdoor patio in the back now. Stay aware of your surroundings on the street. The street scene is great to watch from behind a window, but keep your hands in your pockets if that's where your wallet is."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and was totally ignored by hostess while she looked at us and decided to serve coffee and then answer phone. Was not that busy at 11:00 with only a few tables filled in main dining area. The hostess walked us into the dining area toward a table for four and then stopped abruptly and said since there was only two of us we could sit by the kitchen or take a high table in the other room with the bar. We took the high table and then watched her seat two younger ladies at the table for four we \"couldn't have\". She then sat two more women at another open table for four in the room with the bar. Our server was very cordial and friendly and took our order. She brought our mimosas quickly as well as my husband's coffee. After waiting for a while another server brought my husband's home fries but neither of our main dishes. We waited another 15 minutes before our food came and by then the potatoes were cold. No offers of refill on coffee. We finally grabbed our server and asked for bill. After finally getting check, we waited another 15 minutes when my husband took check to bar. Bartender refused to take it and said server would take care of us. Waited another 5 minutes. SERViCE is terrible not worth the good food. We will go back to Stone Mad. Not returning!"}
{"text":"Had my first Luxe experience a few weeks ago.  A friend and I had planned on getting together for dinner to catch up and he suggested this fab little place.  I had never heard of Luxe so it was agreed on that this would be the place to meet.  We sat out on the patio and that night they had a small jazz band playing, which was super fun.  We started with drinks for the table (they have some pretty tasty looking specialty cocktails) and then ordered from their plentiful list of a menu.  

This night I wasn't super hungry, so I stuck with the angry (deviled) eggs and a specialty salad they had that night - both AWESOMELY good.  My boyfriend and friend both had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich, which I obviously had to take a bite of, and it too was delicious.  

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone - the food and drink are fab and the patio is quaint and cozy.  I will absolutely be heading back to Luxe again."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place for Happy Hour (we had plans to hit Sweet Moses for dessert and find somewhere for dinner first). Because it was a gorgeous evening and Luxe was promoting a happy hour and a *Patio* we chose to give it a try. We had a great time. The server was friendly, helpful, and generally pleasant. I had two draft beers for 6 dollars. Happy Hour ended at 7 but it wasn't a problem that I hadn't finished the first beer before quarter after. My friend had some sort of girly cocktail that she enjoyed. We both had the Guinness Burger and we were very happy with it. The patio is lovely. I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner on a Monday night. They gave us a large table in their second dining room so we could freely be celebratory (i.e. loud and obnoxious). Extra stars! 
However, I was there for dinner and I didn't really think this place should be called a tapas. The menu (at least for dinner) was pretty traditional in terms of personal sized portions. Maybe lunch is different? 

The interior is very rustic/industrial chic as is popular in cleveland. Service was great. I ordered the salmon and the braised short rib gnocci. I felt both were done well with good clean flavors! A friend ordered the lobster mac, which didn't have much Lobster in it and was on the bland side. The bruschetta starters were definitely a fun way to start the meal. 

I'd be interested in trying their brunch next time!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent...the staffs are friendly. The bartenders, John and Colleen, is the best. Thanks guys, I'll definitely come back the next time I'm in Cleveland. Keep up the go work."}
{"text":"I went to Luxe on a Sunday afternoon to meet a group of friends. We were seated right by the front door and the seating wasn't very comfortable. The music was so loud as if we were in a nightclub so it made it difficult to hear each other talk. The food was so-so, not bad or anything to write home about. I wouldn't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Food was average, and I expected more based on the menu/location/atmosphere. Menu said burger came with \"house made pickle,\" and it did not. When asked about it, the server brought me some sliced pickles, which didn't taste very \"house made.\" Beet salad was rather bland.

Server was a bit aggressive and rather rude.  Also, it was quite a while after our food was brought before he checked back with us. I would have ordered another glass of wine, but by the time he came back, my meal was practically gone.

Also, they won't bring you bread until after you've ordered your food? We were waiting on a few more people to join our party, and when asked if we could get some bread to go with the oil that was on our table, already poured, we were told we'd have to wait."}
{"text":"First - the good:  beer cheese fondue with homemade pretzels was incredible ....highly recommend.   As well as the gnocchi, the pear martini (cutesy name that I dont recall) and the bread.

The Not-So-Good:   The service ranges from condescending to absent-minded.  One of the hostesses ( thinner one) is an absolute snot and needs to remember that she is in a customer service business.  Her snarl upon our arrival that it would be a 30 minute wait was unnecessary.  Our server was passable, but quite pretentious.  Lighten up.   Food-wise, The bread puding was \"meh.\"

Food trumps the service, so Im sure Ill go again, but, Luxe servers, you'll get better tips if you shape up."}
{"text":"We attended a private dinner here for a friend's birthday (thank you Fay!), and had a great time and a very good meal. First of all, we loved the decor, fun, funky, comfortable.  The service was excellent.  We both had the salmon, which was delicious!  All the ingredients went together so well, we'd definitely get it again.  For dessert, we had the Boston Cream Pie in a martini glass.  Yum!  
Wish we lived near here, we would definitely support this locally owned business!"}
{"text":"Fried Brussels sprouts are a home run. 
The Zeus cocktail is out of this world. It's whiskey with lemon juice honey and ginger beer. Really good. 
Had the blackened ahi tuna which was delicious. Great decor and ambience. Very good service. 
Oh yeah, the pumpkin brûlée, fugeddaboutit. Unbelievable.  
Will definitely recommend and be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down my current favorite Cleveland restaurant. Our server/bartender Joe was fantastic and incredibly knowledgable; Suggested some great charcuterie and cheese to begin with. Braised short rib with ricotta gnocchi in a cambozolo cream sauce was unbelievably good. Was utterly disappointed to see the traditional arancini risotto balls were off the menu, but the butternut squash arancini with sausage and a smoked pimento aioli was beyond delicious. Only bad part was that I didn't have room for the pomegranate braised duck. Love love love this place. Even better when their fantastic patio is open."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I aren't particularly picky people, but it's rare that we go to a place and say, \"We can't wait to go back!\" Well, Luxe is one of those rare places!
We walked from Lakewood to go there (don't ask why, apparently we wanted a challenge), and even in our slightly scraggly state, we weren't out of place at all. The atmosphere is really relaxed, which is something I always appreciate. I hate stuffy places!
The menu is so great that we went back to look at it again after we ordered to check out what we would want next time, because we knew right away there would be a next time. We started with a couple drinks, my fiancé sticking with beer and me getting their Bloom cocktail. At $7, the price was fair, and the cocktail was delicious! I wish I had gotten another!
My fiancé ordered the Bianco pizza, and said it was one of the best pizzas he has ever had. It was $14, and he brought over half of it home. It's definitely shareable! I got the clams and shrimp, which normally comes with angel hair pasta, but the gluten free pasta was fusilli, which I actually liked way more. At $24, I thought the dish could've been slightly bigger, but I left totally full and not at all overstuffed. And the dish was amazing! The sauce is listed as a white wine butter sauce, but it was SO MUCH MORE than that!! It was honestly so incredible, I could've eaten it with a spoon. My fiancé kept ripping off pieces of pizza crust just to dip into the sauce. 
Going off of other reviews, some people say the service is rude. No, it's not a place where the servers are going to kiss your butt, but I prefer my servers to be at an arm's length so I can enjoy my meal. I found my server to be perfectly pleasant and attentive. We can't wait to go back! New favorite place!"}
{"text":"Visited in the summer for Sunday brunch. Drinks are fabulous! Fresh squeezed OJ makes for a nice fresh mimosa! Drink specials from 11-1! Sat out in the patio and had brunch with my dog! They even have a cute little doggie menu, which is awesome. The even have homemade dog biscuits :) The staff was super friendly and very knowledgable. I ordered eggs Benedict which was just ok. I will defiantly be back to check out their pizzas which look yummy!"}
{"text":"My gnocchi was ok, my drinks were great, service was above average. Ambiance not that great. Woman at the table behind me was literally sitting on top of me.  Didn't have to wait behind anyone else for a table but did have to wait 5 minutes for the hostess to come back from her cigarette or whatever break to be seated. 

I want to come for brunch, which I hear is great, but dinner was just ok.  Probably will not return for that."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was horrible!!! Waited over 20 min to get a drink and there are only 4 tables in bar area..."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my mom's birthday. I think the overall theme for the food ordered was that it was generally ok, but just slightly missed the mark. I ordered the carbonara pasta and it was much too rich (understanding that the dish is already rich to begin with). The base sauce was delicious, but adding in the fried egg (which was overcooked) took it over the top. I think normal carbonara sauce requires the egg yolk and Luxe might want to take that into account going forward. I also thought the Lemonade was way too tart - I had to water it down a lot to make it drinkable. My husband ordered the porkchop and said it was still a little tough to chew, but the sides were delicious. My brother thought his burger was just ok and the fries needed salt. Ah well, at least my mom enjoyed her meal (I think)."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Luxe.  The server was very attentive.  Our food was very  good.  I had the pork loin and my wife had the shrimp.  We also had the brussel sprouts and sweet potato wedges.  The chocolate marshmallow cake was incredible.  We had gone there a year ago and were terribly disappointed with the service, not the food.  The service was night and day compared to a year ago.  Worth the trip."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Patio is fantastic in the summer. Food is always excellent as is the service. We go their often and have had conversations with the owner and staff. Great staff, inspiring leader = success!!!  We recommend this place to anyone. We take our friends there and we recommend to anyone visiting the area. See you at Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Started with an amazing cocktail that had basil infused vodka and citrus. It was the perfect combination of tart and sweet. Then I got a stuffed acorn. Holy hell my life will never be the same. It had creamy risotto with wild mushrooms and onion and then a dolop of marscapone cheese on top. It was the perfect comfort food. My one problem was the close quarters with other diners."}
{"text":"The reviews and praise of this place are true! We went there last week for a birthday party and we were not disappointed. Great service, fun drinks, and of course delicious food. We all ordered something different off the menu, salmon tacos, pizza, bison burger, pasta carbonara, etc and they all left us more than satisfied. The outdoor patio is great to enjoy the weather when it's nice and close to the bar. My only complaint is we all got charged a \"cake cut\" fee even though we bought the cake and brought our own utensils to cut it. I highly recommend this restaurant and looking forward to go back."}
{"text":"I've been here about 6 times. The staff is great! They have a good beer selection and the food is unique and good. I am so happy we have such a great place to drink and dine in detroit shoreway! Gorden square was not around when i moved to the neighborhood. The interior is one of my favorites in Cleveland. Upscale. Modern. Yet respects the antiquity of the original building. Honestly it's feels like I'm in Chicago, DC or NYC. Great job!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd and last time at Luxe. I ate there a couple years ago and had a very bad meal. A strip steak that was not eatable and had to be returned. Decided to give them a second shot as so many people seem to like this place. I ordered the flat iron steak sandwich. The meat was raw and so fatty and chewy I had to spit it out. Sent it back and waited 20 minutes for a burger that was just ok. I'm really not a picky eater and love eating out. There are way too many great restaurants in Ohio City, Gordon Square and Tremont to ever consider giving this place another shot. Too bad as great patio and both times had good waiters."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious. The portion was decent, larger than we had anticipated. We had our dog with us and sat on the patio. The place was packed with people and the place has great ambience. The service was a bit slow due to the crowd."}
{"text":"so, i'm going to go back at some point because this was pretty fast and furious and i didn't really do any of the ordering but..

happy hour is 2 for 1 drafts (breckenridge vanilla porter ! win !) and half off pizzas. so we had several beers and a delicious pizza (i wanted to eat all of the crust like a creep !!) i am pretty sure it was the portobello, but my friend hates mushrooms so we had chicken on it instead. either way, it was awesome - love swiss chard forever. the bill was next to nothing for 3 beers apiece and a large pizza. bless you happy hour.  

also had the olives (good good) and bread (i love bread, so i was more than happy to eat this, it was delicious and fresh.) 

not too crowdy, but i honestly paid very little attention to anything but the matter at hand - beer & pizza. i will be back !"}
{"text":"How long will it take for you to get service at this place? Apparently 20+ minutes between being seated and semi-acknowledged. 

We arrived at the restaurant around 1PM last Saturday to a semi-empty restaurant. Was seated in the back, outside. The hostess gave us our menus and left. As we waited for someone to take our orders, another employee (looks like a manager) started setting up a table for other customers. For 10 minutes, we watched her move tables, grab plates and utensils, water, etc. She did not even glance in our direction. We were the only ones sitting in that area. Another waitress joined her to help set up and start serving the customers at that table. We continued to stare at them (me with a dirty look). No acknowledgement still.

Eventually the hostess came by to seat other customers. I told her that no one has taken our orders, so she asked the other waitress to take our orders. I also told her we needed plates, utensils and water - basic necessities when eating at restaurants. We eventually got our food. It was mediocre. Nothing to rave about. I've had better. 

Anyways, if my friend had only agreed, I would have given them a piece of my mind and left. The whole situation was ridiculous. Did they think we were there to just hang out?"}
{"text":"This place had a very professional demeanor. My girlfriend ordered a pizza and she liked to have some ranch dip with the pizza. The staff said they didn't have ranch but would see if they could make some from scratch. They ended up make excellent ranch at no extra charge and I found the dinning environment pleasurable. A small menu for my tastes but they seem to be very reasonable on modifications."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in about a year but I recall the atmosphere, food, and service being above average.
 I used to rave that this was my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. 
NOT ANYMORE.

Perhaps my tastes have changed, maybe I have higher expectations for service...or this place has both bland and  poorly executed food, with bad/slow service to boot.

To start, I arrived with my significant other (who is a chef) at around 7 last night. There wasn't a hostess to greet us at the door. After waiting about 3-5 minutes someone came over to greet us while carrying a load of dirty dishes, walked passed us with them and set them down on the table behind us. Mind you I understand she was helping out, but there were less than 7 tables in the place and she could have set the dishes down first away from the host stand. But she sounded friendly enough, and took us to a table inside, in a room with only one large party placed in the middle (all other tables were empty). And sat us directly next to the party, next to the loudest section of that party, where we couldn't hear ourselves think let alone hear each other. I asked to move, and the hostess moved us only one table away but still DIRECTLY next to this loud party. I then asked to be moved further and she chose one more table away from that but STILL directly next to the party. Then I complained for the third time and the guy watering our table let us finally move across the room despite ALL of the empty tables in the place. 

So I try to start again fresh focusing on the menu. My guest orders bruschetta to start for the both of us. It arrives rather quickly. The bread is about the same as what was already on the table except instead it has a thin slice of Smoked tomato and a few pieces of ricotta cheese and is really hard being overly toasted. The taste was bland because there literally wasn't anything to the bruschetta besides a slice of tomato and ricotta cheese...NO Olive Oil (which it desperately needed because it was dry), and NO salt/cracked pepper (considering it was BLAND). the only saving grace was the slice of tomato and still we would have been better off with the free bread on the table because at least that came with butter so it wasn't completely dry and a value.

Next we received our entrees. My boyfriend ordered the Eggplant Parmesan, which was pretty decent. I ordered the Braised Short Rib Gnocci dish which I have had at least 3 times.  But this time it was bland. It was supposed to have a Gorgonzola sauce. I could barely taste the cheese, there may have been a tiny hint of it according to my boyfriend (who didn't like it) and it needed salt. However, the short rib was cooked perfectly and there were plenty of the tasty mushrooms but I wished I had something with more flavor.

As for the service, it was slow and awkward. To start I had to request 3 times to be moved. Between the \"appetizer\" and Main Course my server took my B&B plate out of my hand while I was moving it closer to me and said \"thank you\" like I was handing it to her. She obviously misunderstood me, leaving me confused and stuck holding my silverware in my hands as I had nothing to set it on until I reached over and grabbed another small plate off the table next to us.  It was incredibly uncomfortable. The server also disappeared for a long time after we were finished with our meal. My boyfriend wanted to order dessert but decided against it due to the slow service, and chose to have dessert at Sweet Moses instead.

So at the end, all I enjoyed was the Blackberry and Mint cocktail, the decor and music. And my Boyfriend, the chef, said the only thing he enjoyed about dinner was dessert at Sweet Moses. They gave us excellent service, the coffee and sundaes we ordered were perfectly delicious, coffee was fresh, we liked it so much we even ordered a slice of apple pie and tipped out the staff enough that they weren't sure if it was a mistake or not.

All in all, if you are looking to have an exceptional meal while out on the town, I would pass on Luxe. But if you want Cocktails and atmosphere and maybe to share a few dishes (so you're not committed to just one in case it's bland) this could be the place for you."}
{"text":"Wow, completely, and totally underwhelmed by my food experience here.  The harissa wings were so over the top hot, that 1 wing was enough.  Served alongside was a yogurt/honey sauce ???? I really wanted to enjoy, but couldn't.  The roasted squash salad was kinda, sorta interesting, but all in all the only item to even remotely hold my attention were the lamb sliders.  
Cocktails were okay, but not enough to offset the mediocre food."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I do not get out much like I did before 3 children! My wife and I received a gift certificate to this restaurant from my sister for Christmas. My sister asked how I liked my Christmas present and I thought she was kidding, I never received any certificate!! Maybe this should have been first warning of lack of care for an establishment. I finally did receive it one week after Christmas after my sister called on status.

I will mention I have never written a review for a restaurant before and it is something I would only truly like to do to share how much I loved everything!   We walked in and were greeted nicely, told us 20 minuets, no problem? Took my cell phone number and everything, Saturday night at 8:15 .. So by 9 :00 pm we noticed numerous people leaving , people walking in and not giving their name as if they were called or notified but # in party and being seated. I spoke up finally to host whom was 2 ft from me because we were at bar and he says ok follow me.  We enter dining room and 6 tables are open and it is 9:00 pm. They seat us at a table that is positioned in an aisle way. WE WERE LITERALLY SHARING TABLE WITH PARTY BESIDE US but that was even ok we also were directly behind a table to our right. Both people and waiters has to WALK SIDEWAYS To walk between us. I had to move my shoulder numerous times. 

I was not sure why at 9:00 pm we could not be sat at a 4 top which could of been at least more than literally 2 feet from someone else.,  I will also mention that when one thing is missed which was people being seated before us without any notice tables were open doesn't matter how good food can be.. EXPERIENCE IS SHOT!! 

My wife chipped her tooth on  a peppercorn ?? It was small and black ..in her fries , my mussels and salmon were both very good. 
I am sorry for writing all of these negative things but the little time you have as a parent of 3 very young children to go out you want it to be memorable and nice. I will only remember that it was a night my wife was very upset and disappointed and in turn ruined my night. Luckily once she ate a donut at Brewnuts she smiled for the first time all evening. 

If I could give the owner of this restaurant some advice, instead of trying to provide the cool music from a dj or Posh feel as if anyone walking in door is getting status checked focus on making people happy, it's not by squeezing them in to a dining room so you can have the business, keeping 4 top tables available but seating 2 people in an aisle way. Have your host go back and forth or some communication that if tables are open seat the person especially before seating people who just walked in the door. I believe this happens very very often here and I will never go back nor recommend it to anyone. Awful experience."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Luxe and I have had many great meals there, unfortunately this was not one of them. 

I was not too impressed with their new menu.  The pizza's are still there, but nothing jumped out and grabbed me and only one meat dish is available. Luckily they did have a steak special. 

I love seafood so I ordered the crab appetizer with an asparagus purée. The crab came out just lukewarm, the purée had the texture of applesauce and did not have much of an asparagus flavor. Overall the appetizer was just okay. 

I ordered the steak special, which was not great  The steak had a large piece of fat on the side which added flavor but it also made the meat greasy. The grease from the steak also mixed with the roasted vegetables and made them slightly greasy.  I would have expected some type of starch in addition to vegetables.  The vegetables were roasted which was surprising considering it was July (tail end of the heat wave!)
 
Overall it was a very heavy, unimaginative and very unsatisfying meal. Luxe I'm very disappointed, you could do a lot better!"}
{"text":"My $16 dollar duck confit pizza tasted like $15 of profit. What a terrible disappointment. No flavor. All bread with little to no toppings. Luxe will get 1 more chance"}
{"text":"We took our dog there for Sunday Bow Wow brunch.  He ate the K9 casserole and absolutely loved it. I had the bourbon peach pancake fold over. Fantastic!  Our server was pleasant and attentive she even paid attention to my dog.  We'll be going back again soon."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue; I ate here in early September. After Chocolate Bar Cleveland had the audacity to cancel my reservation 3 hours before my birthday dinner, Luxe Kitchen and Lounge was gracious enough to come to the rescue. I made the reservation and they quickly accommodated my party for dinner that very night. The atmosphere was nice - youthful and laid back. The food was amazing - of the 12 people that dined with me, every single person raved about his or her dish! I had the Luxe Burger with bacon jam and it was phenomenal! The drinks though not unique, were pretty good. Most importantly, the service was great and left nothing to be desired! Great food, great prices, a great atmosphere and service - Bravo Luxe Kitchen & Lounge, Bravo!"}
{"text":"After my most recent return trip to Luxe (two weeks ago), I have to upgrade this rating to 5 stars. The service was stellar. I love just about everything about the place. The bread is plentiful (yes, I'm one of those losers who needs bread at the start of a meal and who never refuses more if asked).

I also think it's a great sign when I really can't decide what to get because everything sounds so good. It's like the menu was designed with me in mind: pizzas, pastas, plentiful salads, and a few great specials. And some really unhealthy appetizers. Hehe.

Luxe has quickly turned into one of my favorite spots in CLE."}
{"text":"I have such a hard time with this place. I am always so torn because I love the food and happy hour but the service when I sit at a table for a meal it always seems to end up badly. I've had great experiences sitting at the bar but no matter how many times I eat sitting at a table the server seems to start out strong and end my experience with a bad taste in my mouth. 

My most recent visit was for brunch and there were 4 of us at the table. Our waitress was friendly and told us about the brunch happy hour and brought us our drinks quickly and took our orders. The food was delicious! No one had any complaints. As we finished up our waitress brought us our check and never came back. We hadn't even paid and she didn't come back. After waiting 20 minutes or so we had to ask the person pouring us water if they could find her for us. 

I can't recommend coming here with a group of friends and dining in unless you sit at the bar- which is a shame because I really like the food here."}
{"text":"The service here is great (though the hostess was nowhere to be found when we walked in) and the drinks are delicious. The atmosphere is pleasant and funky at the same time. I really do like it a lot. The only thing that didn't knock my socks off was the food. Perhaps it was because I only had a kale salad and some of the brussels sprouts, but I wasn't as thrilled by it as I wanted to be. The kale salad was delicious, don't get me wrong, but the price wasn't really justifiable for what it was. The brussels sprouts were delicious, though, and I could have had 3 more bowls of them. My boyfriend got a burger and he said it was good; no complaints as far as that goes. 

i'm not complaining, I'm just anxious to try more here. I know that when we got there, some pizzas were being packed into to-go boxes and they looked and smelled delicious, so perhaps we'll come try some pizza soon. Don't worry, Luxe, you've snagged me, but just not completely hooked me. I'll be sure to hit those happy hour deals next time, so I can't squirm about the prices, too."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this a 3 star rating is because the food and drinks are amazing. The service however is terrible. The last 3 visits our server was non personable and the food took FOREVER."}
{"text":"Went to Lux last weekend with a group of people and had an incredible dinner. The food was truly fantastic. The reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the host (a young man) was very rude to us. Wasn't a good first impression of the restaurant but thankfully our waitress was great."}
{"text":"Ahhh...Luxe...what can I say.  I have been here many times for both brunch and dinner and cannot remember a single bad meal.  They always seem to be updating / changing their menu making for a fresh experience nearly every visit.

The bar here does a superb job with their drinks...from Belini's to beers and everything in between.  We started off with an arancini appetizer that was perfect in size and flavor.  Then it was on to the main event!  On this night I decided to go Southern and sample their version of Shrimp & Grits, which also had Italian sausage cooked in it.  The flavors melded together nicely and the dish was hearty and filling.  Washed it down with a Left Hand Milk Stout and you have the makings of a pretty nice dinner.

Make sure to give this place a try if you are in the Gordon Square district."}
{"text":"Went here recently for the second time - I am an out of towner but come to the CLE a few times a year.

Last time I was here, I got some seriously shady treatment from a rude host, but this time was much better. The food is really great, and they were playing some great beats. 

Really loved the carbonara and a lot of the small plate/appetizers, especially the deviled eggs."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Luxe was for my boyfriends birthday over the summer. I had the most phenomenal experience. The food was outstanding and the service matched.  Their patio is an oasis and happy hour specials are avaliable their outdoor bar.

We tried several different types of bruschetta and my favorite was their white bean tapenade. The presentation was beautiful and the flavor even better. My boyfriend and I both got one of their dinner special were fantastic. Their dinner specials were rivaled by their seasonal drink specials. Each one was even more tasty and refreshing then the previous.

Ever since my first visit I have been dying to get back. Several friends and I went for dinner on New Years Eve and they did not disappoint.  Our waitress was outstanding and made us feel absolutely welcomed. Her bubbly personality and attentiveness were off the charts! The specials were spectacular as always. I had the filet which just melted in my mouth which came with delicious a prosciutto wrapped twice baked potato. I don't think I can look at a potato the same way again!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the super positive:  the decor and the patio.  Both are awesome.

Now let's talk food...I ordered the Luxe burger.  Advertised as having fontina, grilled onions and bacon jam, I was ALL IN based on the menu description.   Well, can I tell you I have never been more disappointed in a burger?  There was barely an ounce of cheese and maybe 3 strings of onions.  I asked for it medium and it came out well done.  Aside from the improper temperature, it is NOT a quality burger.  Sad to say I have gotten getter burgers from chain restaurants.  The Luxe burger was flat, pre-feb tasteless, dry, and just ICK patty.

Come on, Luxe.  Can't you make a handcrafted grass-fed burger?  There is so much attention to detail with everything else on your menu.  It is time to focus on making a better burger.  Go to Tremont Tap House, Flip Side or Bar Cento and take a few lessons from their burgers."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Sunday and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be. The interior is trendy and the atmosphere was casual. I had the eggs Benedict and cheesy potato hash. Both were delicious!! The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because my poached eggs were over cooked and the portions were small for the price, but the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Went to Luxe with a group to celebrate a friend's birthday. Definitely make reservations ahead of time if you go on a Saturday evening to avoid the wait - it gets very crowded inside. Our server was very friendly, accommodating and very quick with getting our drinks and our food. I think that overall the restaurant's great atmosphere and service (5 stars) outshines its food (3 stars).  I ordered the Roasted beets and beans burger, which came with fries and a pickle. It was a unique entree but I thought the challah bun was a bit dry and the fries were over salted. I think that slices of tomatoes or a side of fresh vegetables may help to balance out the flavor for this dish. There's a variety of other options to choose from on the menu so I look forward to trying out a different entree next time that I come back to Luxe."}
{"text":"I asked siri for directions to the nearest topless bar and it took me here.

Me and my crew would usually kick in the door waving the four-four, but we were hungry - and I felt like the only MC in town that had't tried tapas yet. So we gave Luxe a shot. And now I LOVE it when you call me big tapa.

On a Friday night at 7 without reservations, me and the posse didn't have to wait at all for a table. The quality of the food was without a doubt worth what we paid for it. And believe me sweetie I got enough to feed the needy. Thought I'd be disappointed. But I was dead wrong.

The only thing was parking - we found a pretty gangsta spot about a block away behind the lgbt center for the escalade, but you might want to give yoself some extra time to find a place to park your wheels.

And if ya don't know, now ya know."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon. It was me and one other person with their dog. (if you take a dog just walk around to the back patio and they'll help you there) we got seated right away and they brought out some dog treats and water which kept the dog happy. The food was awesome and the waiter was pretty cool. The guy was really helpful and he suggested the grilled peaches (which were really good) the beer selection was great as well!"}
{"text":"I wanted to LOVE this place but...the decor is great, service fine but food meh. We ordered the short rib hash, cheesy herb potato hash side, brown sugar bourbon and apple pancake fold and mushroom and bacon omelet. The pancake was room temperature and lacked any real powerful taste. It was yummy sweet though. The omelet a bit dry and short rib hash lacking spice. Toast and jam was good. And drinks - we ordered bloody Maria and mimosa - were ok. I'm sure this is more of a meet for drinks place. I'm not sure I'd come back for the food but would sit at the bar, order a drink and admire the fixtures and furnishings."}
{"text":"This is a local spot I keep returning to. They have a great patio, decent service, and consistently good food. 

You must eat the calamari with the toasted cashews. The short ribs I had late last year still hold up as a \"top 5\" meal of all time. It's a little pricey, but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome happy hour, and absolutely delicious food. I love how they are constantly changing their seasonal menu. Any pasta you get here is bound to be amazing - the ricotta gnocchi was delicious, so is the Gouda mac and cheese. Cocktails are delicious. If you get here by 6 during the weekend, you shouldn't really have much of a wait (if any). Probably one of my favorite restaurants and cleveland with a perfect mix of traditional, Italian and vegetarian dishes (even if you hate veggies, have the Brussels sprouts... they'll change your life)!"}
{"text":"Met my friends for an after-wedding brunch (joined also by the bride and groom!) in BEAUTIFUL Cleveland. The vibe is very hipster/ trendy, with a creative menu of new Americano cuisine. 

The food was great- I got the Lemon Ricotta pancakes with a side of home fries- while the rest of the table dined on burgers and breakfast burritos. The lack definitely came from the service. Our waitress was visibly busy, and gave an undertone of sarcasm when first serving our table, but got significantly more cheery as the experience progressed. It takes ok a while to get all of our table situated, and the orders of drinks and food were delayed. I would have loved it if Management had been able to give her more help/ relief with her large tables. 

I could see us having great experience at another visit. This place is quaint and worth a retry on my next trip to Cle."}
{"text":"Had the benefit of going here for a work function which meant the ability to try a lot of different apps. My favorite was the fried artichokes. It came with kalamata olives and feta chunks which was the perfect combo. 

For dinner I had the Gorgonzola short rib gnocchi. My friend had told me it was his and his wife's favorite dish even though there wasn't a ton of meat in it. But when it came out I definitely thought it had plenty and it melted in my mouth. Everyone in our group was happy with what they ordered. Bonus was the happy hour specials - $10 pizza and $6 app specials!!"}
{"text":"Brunch here with my sisters to celebrate their birthday was a great experience.

Luxe is located in a cute neighborhood and they have a great vibe. Staff is friendly, attentive, and willing to answer any questions you have.

For brunch, I opted for the crispy portobello. These (I think) were a mixture of portobello and potato in a pancake style, somewhat like latkes, battered and deep fried. Those pancakes are then covered in a poached egg and hollandaise, YUM! I also got a side of cornbread (because I'm a sucker for cornbread honestly) and it was pretty good.The brunch entrees are filling and reasonably priced in my opinion; my little brother got a HUGE breakfast pizza for $15!


I think this would be a five star if it weren't for a few setbacks. The biggest one is that their online menu IS NOT the same as the menu they are serving. Maybe this isn't a big deal to some, but I am the type of person that looks over menus before going places to make sure there's something there I would enjoy. I had my heart set on a dish I saw on their online brunch menu and when I came in it was completely different on their in-restaurant menu. 

The second strange thing that's not that big of a deal but was kind of weird was that they didn't start serving brunch cocktail specials until 11. We got there for brunch around 10:30 so we weren't able to order and drink our cocktails until halfway through our brunch meal, which is just kind of strange. 

All in all, the food was yummy, the staff was friendly, the decor was cozy, and I probably would return here if I were in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. We ordered so much food and everything was delicious. For starters, we ordered the mussels that were in a tomato sauce, then for the entree me and my friend both ordered the brisket with dumplings, and for dessert we ordered the caramelized bananas with ice cream (heaven on earth). I've been to Luxe before for happy hour so I knew how good it was but when I brought my friend there she was astounded on how good everything was. The decor inside is very unique and modern with cow material chairs and hanging ropes but it only adds to the interesting atmosphere the place gives off. Our waitress was very kind. I hear they have an amazing outdoor setting that I would check out in the summer!"}
{"text":"Last night we visited Luxe Kitchen and Lounge. We have been there before and always very much enjoyed the evening in all respects. The staff who serve us there are apparently free to express their wonderful, varied, friendly, helpful and incredibly interesting personalities! I would describe the decor as \"improbable\" in the way it mixes and matches many different themes. It only makes the atmosphere even more stimulating than it would otherwise be.

As creative as the decor is the food. It has been absolutely high-quality and delicious without exception and I have never had a dish there prepared in a way I have previously experienced. I have to say that each dinner has been a delightful and wonderful surprise. For a superb meal in a creative, refreshing, informal and friendly atmosphere surrounded by wonderful, friendly and interesting people, you cannot do any better than Luxe Kitchen and Lounge."}
{"text":"Went to Luxe on New Years Eve. A friend called and made a reservation for our group a week or so in advance. They couldn't fit us all at one table but got us reservations half an hour apart, one at 6:30pm and one at 7pm. Unfortunately the group at 7 didn't get sat until 7:30 and our friends at the 6:30 table were asked to leave before we even finished our meals. We ordered a few beers to be sent over to them which weren't delivered until they stood up to leave, so they decided to hang in the bar area and wait for us. We felt very rushed out while finishing our entrees, even though we had been there for maybe 45 minutes of our allotted 2 hours. Upon reviewing our checks we found that we had been charged more than advertised for the two bottles of prosecco that we ordered and split between four ladies but at that point we felt like they just wanted us out from our table and we didn't want to deal with it. We planned on staying in the lounge area with the dj until the ball dropped but kept getting pushed out of the bar area. It was impossible to get a drink! This place is too small to host a party in the \"lounge\", especially on NYE. Someone had fallen asleep in the bathroom, so none of us could use it, and finally we got fed up and just left.

On a more positive note, I ordered the fra diavolo from the NYE menu and it was actually really good. Our table ordered from the regular menu as well and we all loved our food. I would hope on a regular night you would get better service because the chefs do a nice job."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Sunday evening with two friends.  The patio was empty, which is fine but the setup is lame.  Tall wood fence and a mixture of plastic and metal chairs.  The inside seemed better but I wasn't able to take a prolonged inventory.

We tried the specialty drink sampler: three cordial glasses with different fresh juices and alcohol-pretty good.

We also shared four items from their menu: a chicken sandwich (unremarkable), a quail with spinach (OK), rock shrimp (really good) and a Baked Calzetta w/ Potatoes, Goat Cheese & Greens (decent).

Overall, everything was just, OK.  The food preparation/creativity of the menu simply came across as a rather pedestrian effort.  Perhaps I just had higher expectations.  They did have some good music playing, however."}
{"text":"I read online that luxe was dog friendly. So I brought my 2 lb dog this evening. Obviously I knew I had to sit on the patio, which I preferred anyway because it was 73 degrees. The hostess was extremely unwelcoming and gave me awkward and mean remarks about having my dog inside- never been there before so I didn't know there was a back entrance that pet owners have to use. Not only was the hostess rude, but the waitress and busser were too. I felt unwelcomed and uncomfortable the entire time. So, the service was terrible but of course the food was extremely below average as well. The menu online wasn't the same as the one in the restaurant which just added to my frustration. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"Consistently good but not the best in the neighborhood (food-wise). Food/vibe combo does make it the best option."}
{"text":"my husband and i received a voucher  as a gift for luxe and as we had never been were a little skeptical....... wow were we surprised. the decor is fantastic as are the staff, nothing cliché and nothing superficial. we went on valentine's day and while i sampled the 'holiday' menu my husband went off the daily menu...... he had the guinness burger, and while too big to eat with his hands he enjoyed it immensely, i had a filet mignon and yum. if they ever do another chef's special menu,,, i. am. there. 

from the happy hour menu (2 for 1 martinis and $3.50 for 2-pbr's) down to the food it was a trip well worth it. did we say thank you to the gift voucher giver? we need to."}
{"text":"Love the patio.  The picture is only 1/2 the patio.  The food was amazing.  The special spicy pork dish is very good.  The octopus and nochi appetizers were great too.  Pizza looks fun but the main dishes are the way to go.  Looking forward to the beignet dessert."}
{"text":"Stopped in earlier this morning for an earlier brunch. Loved how there was a good sized crowds but not jam packed to the point of discomfort. Got a bloody mary to start. Considering it was a happy hour, I can't really complain about the price. I will say, I've had better toppings and there could have been a bit more spice to it. For entree, I ordered the spicy sausage omelet that came with a side of toast. Good omelet. Egg was well cooked and a good texture. There was a good helping of sausage, but I didn't appreciate much spice to it. The scallion, tomato, onion, and sweet pepper mixture on top really made the dish though. It gave a crunch and added texture to the dish. There was a sweetness from the peppers that wasn't overwhelming. I'd come back here in the future when I visit Cleveland again."}
{"text":"I took my Mom to the patio a month ago for her birthday dinner and the decor is one the best and most quaint in the city for it to be Cleveland with apartment buildings around it and still keep the space unique!   We had some appetizers cause it was her first time there and we both loved the Grilled Peaches!  Simply amazing.   The pizzas there are always on the money and the pasta is definitely going to fill you up in an amazing way!  I love the menu  cause there are a good amount of things to choose from or try and the beer/wine selection is decent as well.   I'll be back....prolly for my birthday."}
{"text":"couple  friends and i went to Luxe saturday night for dinner. i had short ribs and ricotta, it was decent tasting, however the food was extremely small (other way, it was way over priced). All of our food were extremely small, if i pay $21-23/dish, i would expect to eat a decent portion. The taste was not that great to compensate for the portion.  I felt like i just had quick a snack (it is that small). I am not even a big portion eater. i got ripped off and i won't return."}
{"text":"If you are looking for delicious food and great service, this is the place to go.  Even though they were very busy with happy hour, we got seated quickly in the dining room this past Tuesday evening (which I preferred because I was having dinner with friends I had not seen in many months, and we needed a quiet area so we could hear each other talk).   The grilled acorn squash small plate was to DIE FOR!!!  My main entree, the butternut squash ravioli, was also incredibly delicious.    Our waitress was wonderful and checked in on us frequently but not so much that it was intrusive.  We had a wonderful evening with fantastic food and warm ambiance.  I highly recommend dining here--well worth your time and money."}
{"text":"Get the bean burgers under small plates! The gnocchi was good but very rich. I had a taste of someone fries and they were awesome!"}
{"text":"Luxe has one of my favorite Happy Hours. 1/2 pizza, 2 for 1 select drafts & cocktails, and $6 menu items,  from 5-7. I dream about the eggplant parmesan pizza. It's fresh basil, mozzarella, with breaded eggplant. So very good. Great for meeting up after work..and you don't break the bank but feel swank. 

I've been here for dinner twice. The first time was a little lackluster, the food was okay. However, they were super accommodating for my picky vegetarianness. The kitchen whipped me a up a vegetarian pasta dish when I didn't see anything veg I liked on the men.  The second time I went was a year or two later and much has improved about the dining experience. All the ladies in my group loved their dishes. I got two appetizers for my meal.  

I adore the decor - moody, grey sweeping fabric, warm lighting, chandeliers, repurposed wood.

The staff is always friendly and helpful. They will explain a dish to you or help you find the perfect drink. They were  patient when a group of ladies can't stop chatting to make a decision about food.  

Luxe is great  for a date, friends night out, or a meet up before a movie at the Capital Theatre. xo"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a wonderful place for a special event or private party, I highly recommend Luxe! I had my bridal shower here this past weekend and from start to finish, Melissa and her staff at Luxe were wonderful to work with. The setting is funky and stylish, and they were so accommodating. The service was impeccable and they kept the event moving at a great pace. Adam made sure everyone was taken care of and that everything was just right. 

Moreover, the food was amazing! We had a selection of salmon, steak or chicken salad, and all received rave reviews from our guests. I can't wait to go back to enjoy other items from the full menu and enjoy the patio that looks just idyllic. 

Thanks, Luxe. We had a fabulous time."}
{"text":"Update: My husband and I ate here tonight and it was one of the worst dining experiences we've had in a while. Our server started off very attentive and friendly. We ordered the dips and spreads as a starter, and the roasted fig salad and the special fish as mains.

The dips and spreads came out and were great. Heathy and tasty hummus and feta with olives. 

Then, they forgot about us completely. After waiting 15 minutes or so, we watched the two other remaining tables around us get served and then another 20 minutes went by. Nothing. No one let us know what was going on. No one stopped by. When another server finally made eye contact, we motioned that we were ready to leave and to cancel our order. A manager came out right away and asked us what was up. We let him know and he said he food would be right out. We waited another ten minutes before anything showed up and we weren't even hungry anymore. They messed up our salad which they then had to take back and the fish was average.

Then came the bill. Nothing was comped, no dessert offered and no apology given. I used to work in restaurants and understand a busy night. That wasn't the case. We were one of three tables in the dining room. No offer to make it up was ever made.

I usually love luxe, but lately it seems to be declining with service and food. 


One of my absolute Cleveland faves! Well balanced and delicious cocktails, fabulous food that is both creative and nutritious... And the service is spot on... Check it out! Patio is a must!

Food is still creative but we're not as crazy about it as we used to be. We still love the service and the patio, but the brunch wasn't our favorite."}
{"text":"Had brunch at Luxe with a large group. The food was pretty good, but our waitress was SOOOO rude. Granted, we did have a large group of about 12 people, but we did call ahead. 

Her attitude and tone was so awful that I almost called her out. Never experienced such a grumpy waitress in my entire life. Like seriously - wow. 

I will go back because my other experiences have been great. But man, that was pretty bad."}
{"text":"Made reservations for 2 people at 6:30 on Valentines Day Saturday.  Got there 10 minutes early and wasnt seated until 7pm, plus they somehow thought we were 4 people after waiting for 30 minutes which also slowed things down.  Hostess are unfortunately forced to work without a computer system, which I sympathize with, but really?  40 minutes?!  

Got seated over an air vent I had to put my napkin over to stop the windiness and waited another 10 just for water. Thankfully the waitress was a sweetheart.  

Drinks were too strong.  Cosmo was straight pink vodka and the lime was clearly sitting out for hours because when I squeezed it, it practically turned to powder.  But I wont judge the place on a bad lime, it's just worth mentioning.  

They had great options and almost all the food had come highly recommended from friends.  We got the civeche (shrimp and arugula) and the crab cakes.  On the small side but yummy.  

My main dish was the Gnocchi with a tomato based sauce, sauteed spinach topped with two reasonably sized and amazingly delicious braised short ribs.  Perfect amount for me too.  Boy got the lamb chop which was huge, pounded out and beaded over a lemon and capered risotto.  He liked it but the guy next to us on a date shared with us that he was not happy about the breading.  OK guy!  They were also pounding tequila shots and squirted lemon on me by accident, thats how close we were to them.  

Dessert menu was looking good but I was full.  I do plan on going back and trying some other stuff."}
{"text":"A friend and I ate here two weeks ago and really enjoyed the food and ambiance. We had cocktails(Joy and Bloom), the Olive bowl, Roasted peaches with goat cheese, and Bruschetta to start. For main courses, we had the mussels and salmon. For dessert, we shared the brownie with ice cream. That sounds like a lot of food, but the two of us thin ladies cleaned our plates! It was pretty pricy, our bill was about $100. 

The patio seating was pleasant and the food was superb. I would definitely return but maybe eat something beforehand. 
;)"}
{"text":"I met a friend here last week for a Groupon he needed to use up as it expired that day.  I had 2 of their mixed drinks they had on their Happy Hour menu and they were super sweet - too sweet for my taste buds.  I definitely got the wrong drinks, so I figured I would bomb my dinner decision, too, because that's how I roll when I go out to eat.  We split the bacon wrapped dates for a starter and then shared the shrimp and grits for our entree.  Both were great (even though I am not a huge fan of dates) and they were large portions, easily shared.  It was very worth the Groupon.  Also, I think it was Young Professional night, so if you are a young professional and want to meet other young professionals - THE NIGHT FOR YOU IS THURSDAY!"}
{"text":"My server was extremely nice.  The food was extremely slow.  For the price point you do not get the quality of food you should.  Too pricy for what they are offering"}
{"text":"One of my friends has pretty much raved to me about Luxe since I moved to Cleveland last July.  My boyfriend and I had tickets for a movie at Capitol Theatre across the street so we decided to give Luxe a go.  We were glad we did.

The decor is really fun.  The environment is quite casual for a restaurant of this caliber, which is nice.  Sometimes you just don't want to dress up in order to get a nice meal.  The staff are very friendly and attentive.  Some of the best I've experienced.  I sweat, our glasses were consistently full, as was our bread basket.  Impressive.

The BF and I like to experiment with food, and we like to be able to trust chefs.  So at Luxe, we opted for the family-style dinner.  For $22 the chef creates a 3-course meal for the table on his own whim.  You get to choose if your want your main entree to be fish or meat, and you can also specify if there are any foods you don't like and they won't use them.  We opted for the fish, with no other specifications.

Course one was a delicious salad of mixed greens, bleu cheese, strawberries, walnuts, and a light vinaigrette.  Very light and tasty.  Enough for us each to have a full plate and then some.

Course two was pan-seared salmon with a lemon aioli, asparagus and these itty-bitty roasted potatoes.  The asparagus was out of this world good.  I wasn't as impressed by the salmon, but I'm also not a huge fan of salmon.  My boyfriend said it's some of the best he's had.  The potatoes were cooked to perfection in terms of texture, but could have used a bit more seasoning.  The portion size for us was perfect.  We didn't overeat and yet there were only about 5 of those tiny potatoes left on the plate when the busboy took it away from the table.  To me, portion sizes are really important, and I love a when chefs manage to get it just right.

Dessert.  Oh, dessert.  We were given a sampler-platter of sorts.  Two warm fudgy brownies, two pieces of flourless chocolate cake, and two pieces of chocolate mocha cheesecake.  This is the only course that I felt was too big.  We could have easily split one of each dessert.  They weren't huge, but there were three of them.  Each one was fabulous, but the brownie was our favorite.

Luxe provides great food and great service for an amazing value.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I went here after being hungover for most of the day, so I was super hungry and had a hankering for some delicious food. In terms of the food, Luxe did not disappoint. The arancini was delicious. Perfectly crispy balls of risotto with mozzarella cheese inside, topped with a delectable tomato sauce.

For entrees, we got their veggie burgers with a fried egg. The burgers were good, but slightly on the bland side. It was a three been burger, with black beans, kidney beans, and one other type. I bit into a few kidney beans that were still a bit raw, so that wasn't very pleasant. The fries that came with the burger were good. Everyone at the table enjoyed their entrees. Their pizzas looked delicious! Definitely getting those next time. They had a good dessert selection, but we decided to skip on them this time and instead head across the street to Sweet Moses for some ice cream and root beer floats.

One thing though is the price. Luxe is a little on the expensive side ($10 for three arancini balls?!). Next time I'll make sure to hit it up during happy hour to get some better deals. Luxe also puts these weird towels as table runners on each table. While its a nifty idea instead of a tablecloth, the towels were all course, stained, and had holes in them. Made me feel like I was eating at a diner instead of at a decent restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has a really cool, low-key ambiance.  We sat on the patio, which is so quiet and comfortable.  The food was delicious, the specials were especially remarkable, and the service was great.  It seems like they have a pretty awesome happy hour too."}
{"text":"Went here last night for our anniversary...with our baby and dog (really want to celebrate our life of 3 years). Now it's our new favorite patio in town! Awesome atmosphere, dog-friendly, live music on Wednesdays, delicious food and cocktails, and great service! With it being in the heart of Gordon Square, there's also plenty to see in the area. We will be back, maybe for the Happy Hour next time."}
{"text":"Our first time for dinner, been there for drinks. Sat at bar and had a great attentive bartender: especially impressive for a Friday. Food was  fabulous. One thing I loved was they have pads in the ladies room. I don't need those anymore but as a feminist I was very happy to see that."}
{"text":"Bravo Luxe, you *really* impressed me upon my last visit. Saffron Risotto served in a roasted half of acorn squash? LOVED it. Deliciously tender kale salad? Excellent. Love the seasonal influence. My friends and I were seated in the dining room although I may come back to take part in what seemed to be a very happy hour at the bar."}
{"text":"My mom and I joined some friends for a late brunch. The menu selction had a lot to be desired. I thought they were very overpriced initially reviewing the menu and when I actually was served my meal, then I realized yep totally overpriced. My mom ordered a salad which was priced over 9 dollars and the portions were awful. She sent the food back. It took us forever to have our order taken. It seemed like the waitor and waitresses did not have much support as they are running around aimlessly. 

The food as far as taste and quality failed. I have had better food at Denny's and that is no joke.

The only thing I can say is that the waitor was extremly nice and I liked the art. Save your money and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"awesome place.....cool patio...cool people
Awesome eclectic menu
Great date night place inside or out!"}
{"text":"We came here tonight because we wanted to see Old City Libations and Fount from Cleveland Hustles. I have to say we were NOT disappointed. I have nothing bad to say about this place except that they were a little slow. My short ribs were delicious and my husbands carbonara was out of this world. The Brussels sprouts appetizer was one of the best ever, but when aren't Sprouts a good idea??!!! My margarita with a splash of elderflower liquor was a little sweet but refreshing. We will most definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"After leaving the opera at what I like to call \"half-time\", due to a dreadful performance and weak cast (save Rosina, who although quite talented, could not carry the weight of the show by herself.) my date and I opted for a drink at Luxe.  

I had previously expressed my desire to check it out, but had low expectations going in.  I don't know why, there's just something about all the text on the front windows that screams pretentious and I figured a lack of follow-through. 

We walked in and obtained a table in the front window.  The hostess and server were very pleasant.  The place was hoppin' full of people eating, drinking, and enjoying themselves.  The music was cranking.  

Having just attended the opera, and on the same night of the Rock Hall induction, I was looking spectacular, as was my date.  I might attribute my extra-glam look to the special attention I received from the owner, who came to take my drink order and to inquire if I had just come from the Rock Hall.   I think he was disappointed to find it was the mere l'opera I had just abandoned for his fancy-pants restaurant.  However, he did stop by a few times to check in and make mild conversation, something I noticed he only did with our table and that of the one next to us.

The drink was good.  I opted for a nice Spanish champagne (have I mentioned that I love a good, dry champagne?).  My date went for a beer.  I might add that they have two of my fav's on tap!  Hello for a place that serves Left Hand Milk Stout AND Rouge Dead Guy Ale on tap!  

Perusing the menu was enjoyable.  I found the prices to be reasonable and certain dishes intriguing.  After discussion with my date we both agreed we would be back for more.

It was a surprising and pleasant end to a rocky start... (Oh, Opera Cleveland, when will you step it up?)

Stay tuned for an update.

Luxe, to be continued..."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here and it's a classic bar that has been updated for the hip crowd. Keep in mind, with a hip crowd, you're going to get hipster menu with items you can't pronounce. Not banging on the food, but beware - this isn't a place with pub food. Service and drinks were good, but I wouldn't recommend the potato pizza for brunch. Other than that - all went well."}
{"text":"We had a couple hours before heading to the airport.  After a few days in the NE Ohio wine country, we wanted to see something from the city.  Very cool area of Cleveland, you can tell the area has gone thru a recent gentrification.  Beautiful older buildings restored to a charming yet edgy feel. 

Joe was our bartenders and was awesome. Very friendly and accommodating.  Bloody Mary's were superb.   He was also extremely knowledgeable about the area.  We made notes for our next visit, but will surely revisit here.  Tanja had a Kale Salad made like a traditional Caesar salad.  She said it was awesome."}
{"text":"Luxe was a great time!  Cute date spot that offers your typical 'new American' cuisine. Decided to dine in as was my first experience,  but will certainly return to check out patio. Our server was also the bartender & he was so accommodating! Luxe's kitchen closes earlier on Sunday, & we were JUST able to place our order in time. -which was thanks to our great server as he forwarned us & paced our courses. Though we were the late diners, my date & I never once felt rushed. Thoroughly enjoyed apps, entrees,  AND desserts (though I feel there's more selection for first course). Overall, a really wonderful experience that I will recommend!"}
{"text":"Host asked if we wanted dining room or lounge but didn't inform us that happy hour prices are only good if you sit in the lounge (bizarre). So we had to move tables. The food was good, but portions were small (especially the tiny dessert) and the prices way too high."}
{"text":"I'd actually give it 3.5 stars but I'll bump it up to 4 because it's definitely better than 3. We came here for brunch and sat on the patio which is really really cool. Luxe is also in a cool neighborhood. Points for serving brunch until 3 on Sundays. The service was really attentive. I ordered orange juice and the crab eggs benedict. The orange juice was really good (fresh squeezed) and the eggs benedict was good too except the crab meat was just alright. Overall, I'll definitely be back! I would like to come for dinner and sit inside because the decor was cool."}
{"text":"This place looked promising on arrival but the food did not really deliver for me.  Arancini was cold and had an off-putting sauce with it. Ribs were cooked well but were drenched in an uninspiring sauce. The mushroom egg roll/turnover thing was probably the best item I had for dinner. We also had trout and brussel sprouts, which were decent but otherwise unremarkable. So I guess overall, the food was not bad...just no wow or return factor for me."}
{"text":"I came here on my 27th birthday with my boyfriend and two friends of ours.  It was a good birthday dinner. Alot better than last years...... When you first walk in you think \"Wow, this is kinda a small place.....\" You are pretty much in the bar area and there are a few tables around. The bartender/host? greeted us. He was pretty friendly. He asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar area or the dining room.  I thought there is a dining room? How awesome.

We then proceeded to walk through the bar area through a door into a smallish dining room. It had a pretty nice setup. There is a window into the kitchen with a small table by it so you can sit there and watch the kitchen if you want too. We got seated in the back of the dining room by a huge window looking onto the street. 

Our waiter came over he seemed kinda new and kinda hinted at it also. He was pretty helpful. As helpful as he could be for being new.  He went and asked other people if he didn't know the answer himself. I wanted a drink, something different so I ordered the Joy which is Honey-Vanilla infused whiskey with cherry puree mixed in and some other liquor which adds a smokey flavor to it. The waiter told me that it was a lighter flavored whiskey. I like whiskey but sometimes it can be a little overpowering. Well this tasted good but it was very very strong. I couldn't finish it. So the waiter was nice enough to void it off the check. 

I didn't really like how they have drop cloths full of paint for window coverings and stained dishtowels for table runners and napkins but that is a small annoyance that can be easily overlooked. The food was really good. That alone over shadowed the kind of tacky like decor.  

Our friends ordered a pizza with half pepperoni and banana peppers and half cheese. The server/chef messed up and put the banana peppers on the whole pizza which the waiter blamed on the chef. I think it was his fault but who knows. They offered to fix it but our friends said it was ok and just picked them off the one side.  They also ordered corn dogs and fries. They were good but nothing special. We ordered the three course chefs choice meal.  Which was an awesome choice. A little high priced but worth it.  We got plates that we split and we still had leftovers for the both of us.  We got an interesting salad that had oranges, goat cheese, and garden greens with a cherry vinaigrette I believe. Then we had the pork loin with cherry glaze, brussels sprouts and fried gnocchi. Then for dessert we had two different kinds of cheesecake with ice cream. All in all it was an awesome meal.

I recommend anyone to go here. The experience was fun and it is an awesome place worth experiencing even just one time if you don't like it."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place in Gordon Square.  The food is amazing and the staff is awesome!  If you haven't tried Luxe, you're missing out."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a believer in second chances and I'm glad we tried this restaurant again. The service was incredibly friendly (I think the trick is to sit at a table, not at the bar). We started with the lobster bisque and they also provided fresh bread and butter. The lobster bisque was creamy and had wonderful chunks of lobster in it, not the fake shreds that most places use. We also got the ricotta gnocchi and the roasted beets salad. Both dishes were flavorful and satisfying. Highly recommend the gnocchi! Overall, we're glad we came back and will return for the delicious food and drinks."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere... I completely agree with Jason C.  Beer selection is okay, and the cocktails are a bit fruity.  I had the beef pit sandwich, goat cheese fondue and French Onion Soup gratinee.  All of which was quite decent.

Price point is median for the area, and the space allows for a decent buzz in conversation without getting too boisterous.

Decor is classic bar with a hipster sort of twist.  Fun.

I'm willing to give another try, as this place was 3.5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Gordon Square. I love their salads, especially the one with the Ohio greens, so buttery soft and fresh. I haven't had their carbonara in a while. Whatever they had before was great, but then they changed the recipe a few months ago and there were additions and the taste was sweeter, so I haven't ordered it since. So the new fav is the chicken and mac n cheese. You usually can't go wrong ordering mac n cheese anywhere, but it's really good here. The pizza is good too, but it's a lot for one person. One star off because sometimes the service is lacking and slow (one lunch I came in by myself and I thought the waitress forgot about me. I only ordered a salad, but it just took a while to get the bread I requested which ended up coming after only food arrived, and then forever for the bill), but other times it's great."}
{"text":"3.5-4 stars for my first visit to Luxe. We came on a Sunday night. Luxe is one of the few places open on Sunday nights! It was pretty full in the first room (loved the ambiance), and less so in the second room. 

Came here with a party of 5, ready to share some tapas! 
We shared:

- The bruschetta tasting 
- Bacon wrapped medjool dates
- Poutine 
- Kale veggie side 
- Braised beef with gnocchi 
- Complimentary bread

I also had an entree - pumpkin risotto, which I enjoyed! I think it was pretty good for the price. The flavor was good, though the consistency was a little on the creamy + thick side. The hubs got a special pasta dish with mussels - pretty tasty, though nothing too outstanding. 

My favorites were the poutine (fried potatoes and gravy, yum), the bruschetta tasting, and the gnocchi (soft, good with the cream). No comment on the braised beef or bacon wrapped dates since I didn't have any.

The decor is pretty cool - they have the exposed brick walls that are very Gordon Square / Detroit Ave and some rustic holiday decor. We found the service to be a bit odd - our server didn't collect our menus, went missing at odd times, but he was nice and chatted with us, and took pictures for us. He was likable but maybe not the most attentive.

Anyway, we would be back with friends for a casual dinner to share plates."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the food, 5 stars for the ambiance. Our group came here for a bachelorette party. We had reservations and were seated on the patio. What a great spot! Wish we had more places like that in LA where we could use them 12 months out of the year..... 

I started with a cocktail off the summer menu, Heat: tequila, thyme simple syrup, blood orange puree, habanero essence. I substituted mezcal for whatever tequila it was originally made with and it was great. 

There wasn't a ton of sharing going on, so I can't speak to a ton of the food. 

I ordered the short rib which came with creamy horseradish smashed potatoes and cabernet mushroom gravy. There could have been a touch more seasoning on the meat and I wish it came with a veggie, but overall the flavor was pretty good. LOVED the potatoes, but as I've probably mentioned before, potatoes are my favorite carb, so it's hard for me to do anything but love them in a dish. 

I had a bite of my friend's pizza, and the crust was great. My friend who comes here a lot recommended the pizza's and based off my few bites, I would recommend them as well. Not that the short ribs were bad, but the pizza seemed like a better flavor and value. 

Our waitress was on point refilling drinks, but got a little confused with our ordering. We were a big group though, and everyone eventually got what we ordered, so nothing to complain about. 

We took a Lyft, so I don't know much about parking, but the streets didn't look too full when we arrived. 

We had a good time, and I would come back eventually although probably just for a quick pizza or to enjoy a drink on the patio."}
{"text":"Brunch review. 

Excellent baked French toast, a must-have. Perfectly cooked eggs.  Room temperature potatoes. Strong dark-and-stormy. Very friendly staff.  Decent number of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here a few days ago for dinner because they have a nice patio. I would have given this place three stars, because we weren't overly enamored with it, but I hesitate to give anything less than four stars unless I didn't like the place. 

The service was sub-par. The host was not very personable. Our server, however, was very nice, but there was a lot of longer than usual pauses in between getting our drinks, appetizer, and food orders in, and getting our check after we were finished eating. Also, the server took away our plates too soon before my boyfriend finished a little bit of a side that was left on his dish and I wanted to take the bread with me at the end of my meal before it was quickly rushed off our table, but we're like, \"Eh, we're full. Whatevz. It's cool.\" Needless to say, the service wasn't terrible, yet it wasn't as efficient or professional as I would've liked to see having been a server myself for over 10 years. 

The food was pretty decent. Although if I go back to lux, I would not get any of the dishes we got again because it wasn't memorable. The carbonara's sauce was not executed properly. It was more oily/cheesy rather than creamy. The presentation was really lovely, however. It included a perfectly fried egg right on top. Our appetizer was the honey glazed ribs with a side of this horseradishy, mustardy, creamy apple slaw on the side that my boyfriend and I were totally enjoying. The honey glaze was wonderful and sweet, different than the typical barbeque you'd find on ribs all the time. The ribs were very fatty and not very tender at all, we both agreed on this. My boyfriend got a chicken chipotle sandwich and it looked pretty good, but he just wasn't totally enamored by it.We both got the lavender lemonade with blueberry coulis, which was wonderful! There drink menu is very interesting and creative. We were too full to try any dessert, but my eye caught the lava cake desert that they serve, so I WILL be coming back to try that for sure! 

The price points for the items we got were pretty steep, in my opinion. Our check came to roughly $60 bucks without tip for one alcoholic beverage, one non-alcoholic beverage, a rib appetizer, pasta dish, and a chicken sandwich. Perhaps I'll go during a happy hour or brunch next time I visit."}
{"text":"Delicious food and outstanding service. Don't really understand why the host and hostess are always so rude and snooty. If you can just get past the door, you'll have a wonderful meal and a great time. Highly recommended for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"I recently visited Luxe for a birthday party and I must say Luxe is one of Cleveland's top 20 restaurants in my opinion.

Pros:
- Food (Pizza is Amazing)
- Drinks (The Bloom)
- Decor (Chairs, dishes, etc)
- Lighting (Charming and cozy)

Cons:
- Tight seating
- Inconsistent staff attitudes
- Corny Hipsters (Gentrifiers and Cleveland level socialites)

Overall the food is great and it is what Cleveland needs in developing as a viable city in the U.S.. However, the service needs a slight improvement."}
{"text":"This is a quaint and super hipster restaurant with amazing happy hour deals! My friend and I originally came here for their restaurant week menu, but we were persuaded by their happy hour menu! On their HH menu, most of the appetizers are $6, with $5 off pizzas, and a ton of great deals on alcohol. We decided to order 3 appetizers and 1 restaurant week deal to share. For the appetizers, we obviously picked the three most expensive ones on the menu because they're all $6 each! We got the short ribs (yes, this was an appetizer!!), mushroom eggrolls, and some fried cheesy bites with sriracha sauce (sorry I'm butchering the names here). The short ribs dish was probably the most worthwhile of the three! It had three pieces of BBQ ribs with very thinly cut and crispy fries. It was large enough to be considered an entree, so I definitely recommend getting this if you're here for HH! The mushroom eggrolls were delicious too! I loved the crispy outer shell and the sweet sauce! I don't recommend the cheesy bites though--totally not worth $6! 

From the restaurant week menu, we ordered the brussel sprouts, rainbow trout, and blueberry cheesecake. Brussel sprouts were okay--the bacon bits could use more crispiness! Rainbow trout was not very impressive, unfortunately. It was well cooked, but it lacked flavor so I wouldn't order this again! The cheesecake was probably my favorite of these three. It's different from your usual cheesecake. Less cheesy and more creamy :) 

I want to come back for their HH again and try their pizzas!"}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour!  The cocktails are delicious and are quite strong. We got their $10 pizza during happy hour which was quite good.  It's thin crust and I much prefer the red pizza's over the white.  Be sure to check out their Siracha Honey Chicken Wings!"}
{"text":"I was referred to this spot and so happy we checked it out. The area is a little rough but you turn the corner and the street comes to life with Resturant's and little shops. The place is nice, two separate large rooms with plenty of seating. The ambiance is urban and the place is loud, a lot going on and people enjoying themselves. We started with the grilled octopus, crab cakes and Brussel sprouts. The Brussel sprouts stole the appetizer show, roasted to perfection and packed with flavor. The meals ordered at the table included the Carbonara, gnocchi with spare rib meat, salmon with scallops and mushroom feta pasta. I got a bite of each and the Carbonara was my personal favorite and was topped a perfectly cooked egg, loaded with sauce, bacon and loaded with smooth creamy flavor. The pasta was tender and held the sauce nicely. Very excited to go back and try a few more things. We got lucky and got a table, no reservations available unless it's 6 or more. TIP: make reservation for 6 and accidentally have two people no show"}
{"text":"There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said.  Luxe has to be one the best happy hour spots around.  Cheap drinks, cheap delicious food and a great patio.  The quirky decor is a big hit too.  Favorite dishes include the portabello pizza (way superior to the pepperoni), the mushroom ravioli and any drink with whiskey.  Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"All of my cousins and I went out to dinner for an adults only night out to take a break from the kiddies. We were all immediately drawn to the cocktail menu. I got a Pomona, a whiskey based drink, which was really good. I ended up drinking two of those throughout the night. Everyone else enjoyed their drinks - Margarita, the Zeus, Spiced Rum Cider.

For apps, we got vegetarian friendly apps since 3 of our party were non-carnivores. We decided on the beer cheese fondue and the triple frite threat. The cheese fondue was amazing. It came with beef jerky, soft pretzel sticks, and apples. One of my cousins liked it so much that she stopped the waitress from taking it away, so she can eat it with her main course. LOL The triple frite threat was great also. The fries were traditional, eggplant, and sweet potato fries.  All were quite addicting and it came with dipping sauces - spicy ketchup, rosemary and garlic ailois. 

For dinner, I ended up getting the potato gnocchi. It came with braised short ribs, blue cheese cream, wild mushrooms, and spinach. I swear that these were the biggest gnocchi I ever had and the braised short ribs on top of the gnocchi were fantastic . It's a combination I never had before and I was so full that I couldn't finish it. Definitely a filling meal. Three of us ended up getting the gnocchi dish. Everyone else enjoyed their meals - 2 sandwiches (eggplant parmesan and grilled Tuscan chicken), a salad with the risotto cheese balls, and the wild mushroom ravioli. 

We didn't get dessert because we headed down the street to Sweet Moses but the options looked quite good.

Overall a great meal. This place is definitely a hip and happening place. More so later at night. Definitely wouldn't mind come back here again."}
{"text":"This vibe is awesome! Great date spot. In general- Wonderful little place in Gordon square.... especially if you want some olives. But really- their $8 olives are unreal. Spicy, herby and they come with tasty accompaniments. We got the Luxe burger which I'm convinced is the best deal on the menu. Huge burger with delicious bacon and melty cheese... and fries of course. The Mac and cheese was delicious and had a touch of smoke from Gouda..... mmmm goood-ah! Would highly recommend. If you're feeling a little more tame, the kale Cesar is Devine! Oh and if you like ginger beer and smoke, try out the Zeus cocktail- Smokey (liquid smoke?) spicy (ginger) subtle sweetness and citrus; it was a drink worthy of all seasons."}
{"text":"My fiance took me here for a celebration dinner. Even though the restaurant was super busy they found us a table for 2 on the far side of the restaurant. The better place to be in my opinion. Tucked away near the windows. 

The menu is interesting. A bit southern, a bit modern. We ordered the deviled eggs which were quite tasty, if only there were more than 3 on the plate. I had a fried quail. She had some sort of fish entree I believe. I was also told they do Sunday family-style dinner, chef's choice and that we should come in to try it. Definitely looking forward to that. 

Interesting story: Our waiter was a character. Well, more like an anarchist than anything. I can't remember exactly how many people he wanted to kill. But I do seem to remember we had checked a good portion of the people at the restaurant on his list. Charming ... but weird to say the least. We'll go back. You should too."}
{"text":"This past weekend we were celebrating a friends birthday and wanted a place that had a patio and would take a reservation.  A lot of us haven't been here so Luxe one. 

First of all they were extremely accommodating to our patio reservation request and we ended up having a different number of guests than the reservation was for and they did not have an issue with rearranging us! The ambiance was beautiful as well, I suggest everyone hitting their patio before the summer is over! 

I really do not think I have a single complaint about anything I drank or ate.  I got the cocktail Picnic Day and it was delicious, not too sweet, not to bitter just a great combination of alcohol and mixers, I ended up drinking two they were so good. As appetizers we got the calamari and brussels sprouts and both were delicious.  The calamari had deep fried shrimp in with it and the sauce it was served with was delicious! The sprouts were cooked perfectly with the crisper chips that I love! 

For dinner a few of us ordered the pizzas and a few ordered some of the specials and then the birthday girl ordered the gnocchi and each of the meals kept everyone quite.  I got the prosciutto pizza and it was really good, a friend got the spicy one and I think I may have likes his better though! The dough is thin and crispy with a nice big crust (my favorite way!).  The size was large as well, each had 8 slices in it and not small slices either.  The gnocchi with short ribs was delicious! I don't think I would of been able to each an entire bowl of it because of the truffle oil and how rich it was but everything was cooked so perfectly, I ended up having more than just one bite of it! 

We didn't order any desserts but I have heard really good things.  In addition the restaurant was able to also do an over the phone order for some friends that couldn't attend the party who ordered a round of drinks for everyone which was really accommodating! 

I will definitely be back! Their happy hour looked really good and went until 7, so that will probably be my next stop!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here a few weeks ago and had the toughest time deciding what to order because so many things on the menu looked good. Everything was delicious and we realized that we could have gotten anything and probably been happy. We will definitely be back to try more.

Also, this is one of the few places that is dog friendly so that was great too as we like to take our pooch out with us when we can. A tip about this, though, the dog/patio entrance is around back by the parking lot."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with a few friends. We had a fantastic time.

Just to comment on the overall feel of the restaurant, Luxe is a styish yet casual place. Ok for jeans, but I could imagine dressing up a bit more to come out here. The servers and staff were all excellent.

We started our brunch with the beignets and the chocolate-filled churros. Both were excellent. The chocolate-filled churros won out a little bit; the molten chocolate inside was a perfect marriage with the pastry. The beignets were also excellent and came with three dipping sauces, but just were not quite as great as the churros.

After this, I tried the crispy crawfish/shrimp fritter cakes with a banana quinoa pancake on the side. The fritter cakes were very good, but were slightly dry. The pancake was fantastic.

I would recommend Luxe to anyone searching out a great brunch spot wholeheartedly. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The food here is always amazing. My only complaints are that the service is usually not that great. We went yesterday and no one came to our table for at LEAST 15 minutes. My other complaint is the dogs! I get that they're dog friendly and that's cool, but on the patio the dogs barking obnoxiously and growling at each other was just so annoying and really disruptive. It's cool that they allow dogs, it would just be nice if they had stricter rules about the ones that bark the whole time."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with a few friends of mine after reading some good reviews from my fellow yelpers. I'm not sure what I was missing out but there wasn't anything special about this place except maybe their decor and drinks. Pretty much chic and rustic interior, which I like.  

Drinks - Venus & Simplicity - they were perfect for a hot summer day. Venus was on the fruity side with the lychee juice, Simplicity was simply simple, lmao. They do have a good beer selection as well for those beer lovers out there. 

Food - We decided to try their shared plates thinking there would be plenty to share but we were wrong. We got to try their fried cheese, tuna crudo $14, scallops, and angry devil eggs. The fried cheese tasted a bit salty for me plus not really a shared plate with just 5 small fried cheese log. I'm going to guess an inch long. Kind of disappointed. Tuna crudo with mango and kiwi salsa, came with 3 slices of tuna. It tasted fresh and light but i was hoping there would be a little more so I can share it with my friends. Scallops came with 2 and according to my friend Teri W., it tasted moist and yummy! Deviled eggs - angry indeed because it had a bacon hint + spicy goodness. 

Both of my friend and I ordered their gnocchi and I was disappointed. The beef was dry and their wasn't enough sauce to dress it with. The gnocchi itself was salty and a bit overcooked. There were like 2 or 3 asparagus strands which was ehh. I like vegetables and this plate was just a bite to eat. I left the place hungry...and I think the food is overpriced. 

I'd come back for drinks sure but do hear they have awesome brunch so I might go back to try that."}
{"text":"Came with a work colleague for dinner around 6pm and sat out on the patio. FYI there's no happy hour at the patio tables, only the patio bar. We sat down just as live music (singer/songwriter/acoustic guitar stuff) was starting. The entertainment was really nice! I was surprised we could sit on the patio with it being nearly October, but the waitstaff was AWESOME, lighting heat lamps and passing out Mexican blankets. A+ there, guys!

Our server was great and was happy to make recommendations. We got the salad special (which she offered to have split into two plates in the kitchen for us, since we were sharing) - an arugula, goat cheese and grilled peach salad. Delicious! We also ordered the trout dish (also awesome) and the margharita pizza. The pizza was bland and kind of disappointing, but improved with the addition of marinara sauce. Not an item I'd order again.

Overall, great vibe, some good eats and phenomenal waitstaff."}
{"text":"Imaginative cocktails. So delicious I had to try a few of them. The dinner out on the patio was comfortable, and delicious. Don't ask me to share my gnocchi, because it was so good. If I wasn't with new friends, I would have licked the plate."}
{"text":"We had my daughters high school celebration dinner here. What a great venue for a group of 18. The manager Jeff was so accommodating by setting up our table 45 minutes early allowing us to setup. 

The food was spectacular, from the appetizers (the Brie being the tables favorite) to all the unique great dinners.

Highly recommend for groups or just the 2 of you."}
{"text":"We had just seen a movie at The Capitol, my brother picked this place based on yelp reviews.  The light is sparse and low, even during the day, which isn't a problem but coupled with the dark, heavy electronic music pumping in the background, it gives the restaurant an oppressive feel.  The decor is cold, but interesting.  The service is strange.  Our waiter was attentive and helpful while he was at our table but three times we asked him or another staff member a question and they just walked away brusquely.  The food was mediocre but the prices were high.  I don't mind paying more for food if the taste delivers, but here the cost wasn't justified by my taste buds.  I should add that I'm more of a blue collar guy, I am definitely not the target clientele here, but everything about the restaurant came off as trying too hard to me."}
{"text":"We got into Luxe on a Saturday night around 7:30 without having to wait for a table. They don't take reservations unless it is for 6 or more people. I was nervous we would have to wait, but nope! The place wasn't dead, either. Nice crowd- not too busy but still lively. They have valet in the front but also complimentary parking behind the bank next door. 

I loved their food. Love is actually an understatement. We had the deviled eggs and they blew me away. At first I thought $8 for 3 eggs, really? But they stuffed the $h!t out of them!!!  Definitely not those skimpy or filled-with-junk deviled eggs. In fact, they may have been the best deviled eggs I ever tasted and I order deviled eggs whenever I see them on a menu. The smoked salmon gave it the perfect hint of smokey flavor. I could have ordered 2 more orders and eaten that as my meal!

Everyone else I was with ordered the bone in ribs and didn't have a complaint. I couldn't resist ordering the short rib gnocchi after seeing the photos and reading the reviews on the dish and boy am I glad I did. They were heavenly. I think someone described them as soft, flavorful pillows somewhere in another review and that is spot on. The dish was so good that it is almost indescribable!!! The braised beef was delicious ( could have been a little more tender but still..) and the gnocchi was bursting with flavor from the gorgonzola, without being too potent. I could only eat a handful of them after polishing off the beef, as they are rather rich. The sauce is perfection with the perfect amount of creaminess. They didn't slather it in sauce either, which is important to me. All around the dish was just perfect. Order it!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Simply put, my favorite restaurant in Cleveland by far. Thank goodness we live within walking distance! The staff is always personable and friendly. The food and drinks are top quality, for a reasonable price. Live entertainment never disappoints and the decor is fun and sophisticated at the same time. Bravo, Luxe!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal. Delicious apps and side dishes. We didn't even get to the entrees because of how good the small plates were. Shrimp and grits along with corn dogs and fries were enough to feed two. Attentive wait staff and nice decor. Not exactly a nice neighborhood tho. Travel in a group."}
{"text":"I really would like to give this place 3.5 stars. While the food is pretty decent. I think cocktails are just OK. I do love their outdoor patio. Feels like you are hanging out in someone's backyard and the inside decor is cozy and comfortable as well. I only like this place not love it enough to make it as a part of my regular rotation but definitely worth checking out especially for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Brunch at Luxe was very disappointing. Even though the waitstaff was very friendly, the waitress forgot the only drink order of the table. The portions are tiny (5-6 bites for the croquettes) compared to the prices and compared to brunch sized portions at many restaurants across Cleveland. The wild mushroom omelette tasted fine - nothing exceptional, and the portobella croquettes sounded good, but really had no flavor beyond deep fried batter.
I've been to Luxe for dinner before and really enjoyed that experience, so I'm surprised that brunch would be so different."}
{"text":"I was taken to Luxe last night for a little date night. And everything was perfect. The atmosphere was just what we were looking for. Intimate , just dark enough and balanced by an up beat playlist. Our sever, Robin, was wonder. She was very personable and we didnt want for anything....yet she wasn't overbearing. We started with their house Cabernet and the cheese platter. Both were fantastic. Then i had the fettuccine with bacon and egg. It was definitely a heavy meal, but its cream sauce. So thats what i expected. I wouldnt have changed a thing. My date had the steak special and he was happy with it. Cooked just how he ordered it and it was served with some damn good fries. 

My experience was awesome. I hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"Went here with friends later in the evening and throughly enjoyed myself. Lots of great appetizers  (I highly recommend the Crispy gnocchi and sweet potato wedges), friendly consistent service despite being busy, and a really good DJ! The only reason I didn't give this place five stars is because they were out of half the entrees by the time we ordered. I will say we got there around ten and left at midnight on Saturday so if we had shown up at a normal dining hour, perhaps that wouldn't have been a problem.  We'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Happy hour prices and 'rules' are ambiguous and confusing. No reservations accepted for parties smaller than 6--bad idea. Cramped bordering on chaotic. Food was very good but not great--not compared to my past Marlin experiences at Marlin and One Walnut. A bit inconsistent in the quality of preparation. Will give it another chance, but they need to work to tighten up their operations and quality control a bit."}
{"text":"Everything was great, except for the Veggie Burger.  I recently had dinner and drinks at Luxe for the first time on a Saturday.  Service and atmosphere were top notch.  My salad and small plate meal of Coriander Seared Ahi Tuna were excellent.  My basil and pineapple vodka cocktail was sublime.  One dining companion loved her Fettuccine Alfredo.  My boyfriend (a vegetarian) ordered the Grilled Veggie Burger with goat feta artichoke spread and tomato on challah bread.  While the feta artichoke spread was delicious the veggie patties were clearly Morningstar brand patties sold in grocery stores.  Why not make a handcrafted veggie burger, LUXE?  So many wonderful Cleveland restaurants offer a signature, house made, original veggie patty.  Not offering a vegetarian the same superb cuisine as other diners = only 3 stars.  :("}
{"text":"Don't try to pigeonhole this place because they won't have it. Is it a super-cool lounge that boasts a house DJ and a look and feel so hip that even wannabe geeks like me feel a part of the action? Yes. Is it an urban eatery with a menu packed with creative and fresh dishes so good that you'll want to stuff yourself silly with everything the first time you visit? Hell yes. But what bout some serious mixology that'll have you wondering how the hell you ever managed to stomach the swill at your local watering hole for so long? Yeah, they've got that, too. Like I said, Luxe is just about everything.

This was our first visit. It had been on our bookmarks list for about a year so it was just a matter of time. Tuesday, sometime around 6pm, practically empty. This is my perfect dining situation. As soon as we walked in we were greeted with smiles. The weather was perfect so tonight it was to be al fresco. Wandering through the bar, cowhide banquette, blown glass pendant lights, jeweled chandelier, straight-lined art deco bar. Everything works. Up some stairs and through the back door.

The patio at Luxe, as many others have mentioned, is brilliant and one of the best I've ever seen in the Cleveland area. The use of reclaimed industrial bits and pieces, the artfully arranged plants, even the cozy bar. It all forms an oasis that feels miles from the din of the city and the job you don't really like. A metal bistro table, two chairs and a server that's clearly been schooled in how it's done right. Thanks for the professionalism, Brandon. 

The beer list is short but sweet. The Dragon Fly IPA for me, thank you. The wife went cocktail tonight. The Simplicity - wonderfully clean and fresh with the basil playing well with the pineapple. A second, the Joy, was a bourbon punch in the face followed by a gentle sour cherry backhand. Both works of art.

Like I said before, it's hard to decide on the food. Just don't even try. Let yourself go a little wild with this place, you won't regret it. Besides, what's the worst thing that could happen? You get some leftovers for tomorrow's dinner? Now on with the show...

A trio of bruschetta to start things off. You get to choose three for $5. We went with the gorgonzola & aged balsamic, ricotta & local honey, and mushrooms & goat cheese. Fresh bread, a bite for each of us and flavor pairings that shouldn't work but do. A perfect way to get things rolling.

And before I go any further, what the hell is it with restaurants charging outrageous amounts for small plates of salad? A prepared dish, sure, I get it, but a plate with mixed greens, some almond slivers, a few sliced strawberries and a smattering of goat cheese crumbles for $9?! If this place weren't so damn good I'd feel like I just got the short end of a prison relationship. Had to get that out.

Mixed Greens Salad - Want some details about this one? Read my rant above. It was tasty and I really dug the honey vinaigrette.

Baby Kale - Baby kale leaves dressed up Caesar salad style with lots of anchovy pepper vinaigrette and some brioche croutons. The wife loved it. I still can't seem to find the love for kale. That's one harsh green, man.

Braised Beef Short Rib Ricotta Gnocchi - Holy shit. Can food actually be this good? This dish was so good I wanted to smack my mom. That short rib was braised perfectly, seared crispy outside and pullapart tender. And those gnocchi, damn. Perfect potato pillows caramelized and dressed in a rich mushroom cream sauce. Get. This. Dish. Now.

Luxe Burger - I had a craving for some red meat and this just about satisfied it. I'm a pain in the ass with it comes to meat temperature and they overcooked it here. Other than that, it was tasty. The burger was well seasoned and I'd love an IV drip of that bacon jam. I also loved the soft brioche bun and fontina cheese and the fries were greasy good. Oh, and the pickle was great between bites. A good offering but at $12.50 I wanted to be wowed. Perhaps if I had gotten the fried egg...

Strawberry Shortcake - We made it to dessert. Being summer we had to go here. Fresh berries, gently sweetened whipped cream and a split biscuit shortbread flavored with caraway and lavender. We expected macerated berries but these were simply sliced. Not enough cream so it tended toward dry. It didn't stop us from slamming it down in a matter of minutes, though.

I wasn't really sure what to expect with this place. It seemed poshy in a haughty kinda way. It seemed avant garde in its culinary leanings. It would probably end up being another overhyped letdown, right? Not quite. What it did end up being was a comfortably upscale place to grab some outrageously tasty food in a relaxed bistro atmosphere. I don't do the night thing anymore so I probably won't ever experience the lounge in all its DJ'd glory. I will, however, go out of my way to spend some more dinnertimes sitting at their tables."}
{"text":"OK, I'm a food geek, as is my wife.  Having lived in both San Francisco and New York, we've both become a tad spoiled.

But I returned to Cleveland this past Summer and ate at this gem...4 times already.  It's most definitely one of my new favorite restaurants.  They just did everything right.

Food was exquisite, 5-star to me and their cocktail menu is something to brag about as well.  What I most like, however is the atmosphere.  It's very industrial/chic.  Oodles of recycled materials have turned this space into a sustainable work of art, comfort and pleasure for all the senses.

Add to that the welcoming, open air patio which offers live music and is...get this - dog friendly!  What could be better?

Reasonably priced, it is without a doubt an eatery we plan on revisiting each time we return."}
{"text":"Get your butt into Luxe NOW!  Do not pass 'go', and damn that  $200, just get there. I don't know how long the halibut will be on the menu, so hurry before it's gone. Also get the frigging AMAZING panko crusted brie in apricot jam with pistachios and pancetta. Don't miss out on either of these."}
{"text":"Great service on a Sunday noon. Very busy but great waitress....spent time with us and answered our (many) questions.  Vodka with balsamic vinegar and spices...?
Steel cut w/ eggplant and sausage was substantial but a bit bland...memo to chef: jazz it up a bit. Crazy industrial brush decor in men's room just so you know.

Definitely will return soon. Want to delve deeper."}
{"text":"I always have the braised beef short rib. Normally a sizable portion of beef is placed atop a bountiful mass of gnocchi but on this occasion there were 3 thinly sliced portions delivered to my table. Even with the subtle change to the beef it was still ever so tender. I savor this dish each and every time.

I also had the Bison burger. The egg, Lord have mercy the egg was cooked to perfection. I close my eyes and I can see it now! The burger was succulent, juicy and everything you'd ever want when ordering a burger & fries.

My dirty martini on the other hand was subpar. A shaken martini is suppose to be radiant with a profound flavor complimentary of a crisp vodka and tangy blue cheese olives. A courtship rather, between the ingredients and my excited tastebuds. This was not the case. I was disappointed because my cocktail arrived with a layer of ice floating atop my usually smooth beverage. Ice is not suppose to be a part of the this particular cocktail.

I love the decor, I always have a blast with the ever so stylish wait staff, laughing and enjoying the playful atmosphere time and time again. I look forward to returning for the specialty brunch were patrons can bring their dogs!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. It's definitely a true Cleveland  treasure. Their specials is what keeps the customers coming back. The chef does an excellent of variety of choices of unique food choices."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but it feels like their menu has changed recently ... With higher prices and lower quality food. 

I ordered a seafood pasta dish and it was terrible. For $28 I got some plain white pasta  served with marinara sauce and a couple pieces of baby shrimp. It tasted like a TV dinner that was common in the early 90s.

I also feel like this restaurant caters to a suburban crowd that is visiting the neighborhood's many theaters versus a regular local clientele. The vibe tries to be a bit more hip, but it tends to fall flat. 

The good: they make great cocktails! I'd recommend just going straight to the bar!"}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch, lunch, dinner, and just drinks. You can never go wrong. Great atmosphere, great staff, amazing food, and know how to make a good drink. They are accommodating for large groups. The service is always top notch whether I am with one person or 10. The patio is super inviting and a must visit in the warmer months."}
{"text":"What a great find in a sort of edgy neighborhood.  Excellent food, interesting menu,  people who cared about what they were doing.  We had such a lovely unrushed but attentive afternoon here for brunch.  All  was good!!  Highly recommended.  Wish we had something more like this in Fairfield County CT!!"}
{"text":"I think they have an EXCELLENT happy hour.  1/2 prize za!!!  I love the lively atmosphere and the service is GREAT!!  This is a gem within Gordon Park!!!!"}
{"text":"Some tips:

Try to get a space in the first room.  The ill-conceived industrial metal ceiling and way too close tables in the second room make hearing difficult.  (Good luck:  the first room tables are sometimes occupied by off duty staff)

Brace yourself to pay for substitutions - even for similar (potato to potato) 

Brace yourself for items being sold out because \"it's the end of the week\" (huh? Mashed potatoes?)  Then watch your bill to make sure you are not billed for *that* substituted item.  

Plan ahead:  Don't count on the restaurant being open as it sometimes is closed for private events.  

The concept of this restaurant is good, but the execution is sometimes lacking.  This little place attempts to be fine dining, but ends up delivering something between that and a neighborhood diner - which isn't a bad place - if the product and policies match."}
{"text":"Good but I doubt Id go back.

Went tonight with my girlfriend while in town visiting. Read the reviews and was excited to sit on the patio and enjoy ourselves. When we first arrived we were met with total silence standing next to the hostess-less station. The three patrons at the otherwise empty bar glared at us and the bartender silently went about some task without acknowledging us. Only after two minutes of incredible awkwardness did we finally get seated by a begrudging hostess. The indoor decor was alright, the scent of incense was odd. Walking to the patio we immediately walked past a table of what appeared to be employees smoking in essentially what was the doorway; however, they never moved from the spot the entire time we were there. Then limboed under some poorly placed patio plants to our table. Our paper menus were stained and one stuck together almost completely no doubt by the last patrons meal. For what a meal cost there you'd think they'd replace some of the more tattered menus.

Our waitress was one of the better points of the night, very friendly and welcoming. It helped make up for the overly inebriated customers behind us the whole night. We ordered some drinks and a few appetizers as a meal. The cocktails were tasty and strong enough. The appetizers were good but $14 for a small basket of calamari and a few ship felt a bit much. The goat cheese date fritters were practically all date and no goat cheese which was sad. The dish I expected the least from, Crispy Green Bean Sliders, turned out to be quite good. 

The ambience of the patio was enhanced by the wonderful weather today but began to fade as you look around and notice the scraps and general disarray of litter intermixed with some pine trees in plastic barrels. The hipster vibe came across snobbish and unwelcoming."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and was definitely impressed! The food and mimosas were top notch, and the only downfall was that we didn't order more entrees, especially after seeing what the table next to us ordered. I will definitely be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Based on experiencing the Saturday night crowd, I believe Luxe is probably the busiest place in the Gordon Square District--and for great reason. 

We walked in on a Saturday night without a reservation for a late, pre-movie dinner. This place was packed, like really packed. This place isn't huge, but they literally utilize every bit of space they have with a tables and chairs. There is zero room to stand at the bar while waiting for a table, which is a major bummer. Honestly, there really isn't anywhere to stand while waiting. This really is the only negative I see in this place. I'd get rid of the two impossibly small tables directly in front of the bar so that people can get a drink. As of now, you can sit at the bar but there is no room for anyone behind that first seated row. 

Now onto the food and drinks. I started with the Plush cocktail, make with muddled grapes, vodka and Cava. It was a little too sweet for my taste, but I can see how the ladies would love this cocktail. There were plenty of other signature drinks to choose from, but afterwards I moved onto a very dirty vodka martini with blue cheese olives. This was made perfectly, no complaints. 

We were finally seating at a smallish table, right in front of the semi-open kitchen. It was pretty cool to be able to watch the magic happen, but the atmosphere still seemed a little cramped. We started with the cheese plate for two. I was a little sad they had no option to get a mix of cheese and meat, but whatever, the cheeses were good. I would have liked to see more cows milk cheeses, not just goat. The hardest cheese on the plate was the best and the real showstopper was the bacon jelly--oh yes. 

For our entrees I ordered the scallops and my boyfriend ordered the rainbow trout. Everything was fresh and delicious. My scallops were perfectly seared and simply prepared. It would have been nice to have just one more punch of flavor, but the dish was still delicious... again, just simply-made. The same goes for the rainbow trout. It came out simply grilled, minimally seasoned over a bed of greens. The dish was extremely fresh, but it was missing an extra layer of flavor. Either way, we left full and happy. 

Service was good, bordering on great. Overall, Luxe is a great dinning option that I don't think about often enough. Can't wait to come back soon for another great meal."}
{"text":"The best meal I have had in a long time!!! Everything we ate was expertly crafted and delicious! We got the fig and goat cheese fritters - divine, the grilled peaches - sweet and savory, kale salad - hearty, chicken wings - spicy, tangy, and cooked perfectly, and the sausage pizza - cheesy with excellent sauce. Each item was better than the last and we finished every single bite! The cocktails were delicious, too; I got the margarita - and their beer list is extensive. The servers were kind, funny, helpful, and incredibly passionate about their work! Amazing and beautiful place that I will definitely go back to!"}
{"text":"So, this place was recommended by a friend and I was skeptically optimistic. The bartender helping me was 3 days old, the place was a little dead...honestly, I wasn't feeling it. I got through the first round of drink and then took the leap. They lead me in the direction of happy vibes and ended up with a Zeus (amazing drink) and the Carbonara (Spice bacon and a fried egg on top...heaven). This place definitely took it to another level on round 2 and knocked me out. Highly recommend going here...let them order for you!!!"}
{"text":"One of the most tranquil and beautiful outdoor patios I've been to in Cleveland! We sat outside for happy hour in the summer and enjoyed a few cocktails, small plates and a pizza. Prices on happy hour were very reasonable and the food was YUMMY!! They had some very creating and delicious drinks (some a little too sweet for my taste but definitely had a good amount of alcohol in it). 
The ambiance was the real winner though. Beautiful big palm trees, hanging planters with succulents, and small garden sculptures made this place feel like an oasis. Even the bathroom was nicely outfitted and clean. We had a great time here and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We got the mussels (I asked for no bacon in the sauce but I'm pretty sure there was still bacon in it). Also got the mushroom pizza which was really good and heat up well the next day.  During happy hour the pizzas are only $10 which you can't beat.  My boyfriend got the calms which he said were good.  I also love any place that brings you good bread.  Their happy hours has some great deals and worth stopping by."}
{"text":"It's really not easy to chose where to eat in Gordon Square, we can thank \"Cleveland Hustles\" for that. There are so many new, creative eateries popping up along Detroit Ave. But Luxe is not a contender to be overlooked, even though they have been around for a while. 
I had been to Luxe a few times before but I didn't remember much about the experience. My husband and I were taking a Friday afternoon bike ride through the area and decided to stop for happy hour. There was convienent bike parking right out front and we decided to sit on the patio. There was no wait and we were seated immediately.
It was a hot day and we were sweaty from our ride,  but it wasn't a problem at all. The patio had a good breeze moving through, thanks to an industrial sized fan. We sat at the patio bar, which was really adorable. I couldn't help but snap photos of the abundant succulents and the quirky up-cycled decor. Our bartender was very attentive, talkative and helpful. We were seated with the happy hour menu facing up and although everything on the menu looked incredible, we couldn't pass up the happy hour deals. They offer $10 pizzas, $6 shared plates, discount wine, cocktails and one choice of craft beer.
My husband had their happy hour cocktail \"Bloom\" which was a berry lemonade with lavender and vodka. He loved it so I also tried a sip. It tasted like a delicious refreshing lemonade, I didnt even notice the vodka. I had the happy hour chardonnay option, which was super cold and crisp. The bartender also made sure our water glasses were perpetually full, which was appreciated. 
We decided to split the Bianco pizza, which was actually our second choice. We initally wanted the grilled chicken pesto pizza but the pesto is made with walnuts and my husband has an allergy. I was thankful that our bartender was knowledgeable of the allergin information. The pizza was really delicious. It was super thin crust, crispy on the outside, soft where the toppings were. The perfect combo of creamy, salty and a little bit spicy. I could have ordered more food but I had to bike back home!
Lastly we split the Bananas Foster ice cream because I can never pass up Bananas Foster. The desert was served on a block, with three scoops of vanilla in a bowl and a ramekin on the side with the boozy caramel banana sauce. If I'm being honest, it's not the absolute best Bananas Foster I've ever had, but as a desert it was pretty good! The ice cream was really cold and so it melted at the perfect rate & I wasn't stuck with ice cream soup at the end. 
I will certainly be back to Luxe again soon. The patio was so charming, the service was impeccable and the food was top notch."}
{"text":"Had wonderful time with my family here. We had Mahi Mahi and the beef ribs yesterday dinner served by Chris who are very sweet and nice. Great food, great drink, great service, great place to hang out with friends and family. P/s: thank you again Chris. We had fun and great dinner."}
{"text":"Holy Amazing Brunch!!!!!
I just got done doing the Cleveland Tri.....so I was hungry.  And thirsty!  This place got the job done with flying colors!  
We made a reservation for 6, which was a good idea on a Sunday at 11.  Very popular place.  The server was super friendly and the food came pretty quickly.  
11-1 on Sunday they had a happy hour so I got a yummy Bloody Mary on special.  It was cold and filled with horse radish, which I like.   The coffee was excellent as well!  (Yes, I needed caffeine and alcohol after the race!) 
They have a nice selection of items for bunch.  It wasnt too overwhelming, which I appreciate!  I ordered the artichoke omelette and it rocked my world!  Big chunks of artichoke with a smear of goat cheese and sauteed onions and garlic!  YES please!  It was delicious!   My hubby got the short rib hash and talked about it the whole ride back to Pittsburgh!  We had no left overs!  
Wish this place was in Pitt so we can go for brunch more often!!"}
{"text":"Luxe - you've done it again! We threw a birthday party for 2 friends there last week, and it was a WONDERFUL experience; Delicious food and amazing service! 

New tip - their Eggplant fries, and sweet potato fries are a must! Don't get the sampler of three (oddly small portion) - get a side of eggplant, and a side of sweet potato. They come with truffle mayo - unreal."}
{"text":"great vibe. open kitchen. very nice people. food was good, not great - but in their defense the place was packed solid - busy all around. all in all a pleasant experience but not running back..."}
{"text":"There seems to be a recurring trend when it comes to my visits to Luxe, as I tend to go to celebrate the Birthdays of friends and family.

Actually, I hope this trend continues because Luxe has proven to be the absolute perfect place for groups.  Not only is the Mediterranean meets Americana menu varied and balanced enough to have a nearly universal appeal, but is designed to share and spend as much (or little!) as you please.  I have witnessed my pickiest family member discover a new love of goat cheese fondue she mustered up the courage to try and later devour the grilled duck burger w/ brie and sweet potato fries she skeptically ordered.

If you don't have any upcoming Birthdays to celebrate, definitely make a reservation for Luxe's Sunday Brunch. Even better, if it's during Cleveland's warmer months - be sure to request a table on Luxe's lovely courtyard-esque patio."}
{"text":"Ate here recently, and it appeared some sort of street festival in taking place.  Luckily, we must have arrived after the rush.

Service: started off poorly.  My wife and a friend were dropped off to secure a table, which they were able to do quickly.  However, they were moved three times (for some unknown reason), and we did not have a serve come to our table until my wife decided to take matters into her own hands.  The good news is that the person she snagged - Adam - apparently knows what he is doing.  He came over to our table within a couple minutes, and not only got our drink order, but told us our first round would be on the house.  For the rest of the evening, Adam showed himself to be helpful and a little playful with a good sense of humor.

Drinks: interesting Greek mythology-themed drinks, and the drink I ordered was pretty good.  They are a tad pricey, however.  Good microbrew beers on draft (except for the quickly getting old PBR), and my wife enjoyed a couple glasses of the Spanish cava.

Food: I would give it six stars if possible.  We ordered three apps to share amongst our table.  The triple frite threat was severely overpriced for what it was (the only bad experience food-wise), the beer cheese fondue was very tasty (just a bit cool), and the duck spring rolls were fantastic.  My wife and I decided to split a couple items for the menu for our meals.  The hard salami pizza was amazing, and the fried egg on top was the coolest.  Continuing with that theme, we also split the fettucini carbonara (again with fried egg on top), which was so good my wife was sopping up the sauce with some bread.

We are looking forward to returning and trying some of the other items on the menu, although it will be tempting to repeat our experience."}
{"text":"It took awhile... but I finally made it to Luxe!

After a wonderful yelp elite event which got us to Gordon Square we found ourselves at this self proclaimed Mediterranean- Italian Bistro located in the heart of Gordon Square. Being a weekday we had no trouble being seated promptly. 

The restaurant has a nice swanky-quirky vibe to it. With ropes used as decor and low red lights, the interiors were very much to my liking. 

A lot of the menu appealed to me and my dinner partner making for a really hard meal decision. We finally settled for the tuna tartar, Italian meatball and cioppino to share between the both of us. 

The food was sensational!! My favorite by a long shot was the cioppino which is essentially a seafood pasta... the octopus in it was yum... flavors spot on. The spice triggered my senses alright! The tuna tartar came at second spot. The meatball had way too much chunky tomato sauce which overpowered the dish completely. Did not like that one one particularly too much. 

After a fairly successful meal, for dessert we decided to try the beignets... what a let down! They were served to us raw! We could see the raw dough on all of them so I do not know how a chef or a line cook could have missed it. They did take it back to give us new ones but unfortunately all they ended up doing was likely putting the same beignets in the fryer again... so round two beignets were overcooked and very chewy. No apologies or compensation offers were made which was disappointing. Our server almost made it feel like she was doing us a favor taking back the raw beignets for new ones. 

Overall: while I will likely come back to try more of their meal options, I will definitely give their dessert a pass and probably head to Sweet Moses for a sweet bite instead!"}
{"text":"Just came for a drink and dessert. Molten Lava cake aka souffle was yummy. Has a cool vibe to it. Was thinking to come back some day to check out the dinner."}
{"text":"There's nothing really terribly awful about Luxe, but it's not likely I'll go back again. I had a mostly enjoyable dinner, and actually had pretty awesome service from our server, but... there's just something... 

I think a co-worker said it best - Luxe really isn't doing anything different from 10 other places on the west side of Cleveland, though they seem to think they are, as their prices are higher than most of the other joints with the same approach.

Everything I've tasted here has been solidly good. My first visit was a few years ago, as part of a large party that someone else was paying for. So... I was perfectly happy with everything I had. My latest visit was on my own dime... and that's where it hit me a different way. 

The salmon I had might actually be some of the tastiest salmon - especially considering there was no sauce or excessive seasoning - that I've ever had. But $20 got me a piece of salmon about an inch and a half wide - served on top of roasted \"root vegetables\" (there were about 4 fingerling potatoes in all, a couple of chunks of carrot, and I think  a piece of turnip), and about 6 leaves of spinach perched on top that seemed to have been freeze dried. Or something that made it bland and crispy. 

(To be fair, the salmon really was *that* tasty, and it's from a company that has the whole wild salmon, responsibly sourced, etc. etc. thing going on. I know that stuff gets pricey. Still, you could at least make up the difference by giving me some more real vegetables to go with, so I at least feel like I'm getting my money's worth...) 

The $15 \"antipasto board\" was good, but same sort of complaint. About 6 very thin slices of a chorizo and 5 very thin slices of an unidentified cured meat, 3 cheeses (one of which was just Tillamook cheddar), 4 olives, some wheat crackers, a smear of a fruit butter of some sort, and some honey. The promise of pickled vegetables I think was supposed to be fulfilled by a little smattering of what might have been cabbage on the side of the board... sadly, it didn't really have any flavor, much less pickled. 

It wasn't really bad, per se, just underwhelming, and seemed a little stingy to me. 

The boyfriend had a burger. It was a decent burger, but - yeah, it's a theme - nothing out of the ordinary really. The roasted veggies he asked for in lieu of fries ended up being pretty dang good -- roasted cauliflower and green beans and carrots. (Mind you, roasting veggies is pretty dang easy too.) 

Our server was SUPER fantastic - and really she's why they're getting 3 stars instead of two I think. She went above and beyond, and was all smiles the whole time. 

The only true complaint I have is an old fogey kind of complaint - so take this as you will - but the music was just too loud for the space and the crowd for a 6:30 - 7:30 dinner time. Again -- I'll acknowledge I'm old and totally uncool - but conversation was really a challenge during dinner. It was actually GOOD music, so I'll give them points for that... just wish it had been a bit more in the background than it was. (I get that they have this whole lounge thing going on, and a DJ later and such, but I really wasn't expecting that so early.) 

So it was good... just a bit too loud, a bit too pricey, and there are just too many other places that offer the same kinds of stuff for a better price and a better dining atmosphere."}
{"text":"Incredible food and service. Have visited multiple times. Excellent place for brunch or dinner and highly recommend"}
{"text":"Luxe is hands down my favorite place to eat in Cleveland. You can't go wrong stopping in for brunch or for dinner. I'm tried something different each visit and I've never been disappointed!!! Brunch happy hour includes $3 mimosas (with a few different juice choices)!! I recommend the carbonara for dinner or the Quinoa Banana pancakes for brunch... and you have to try the beignets."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this restaurant, and I think I would have if the customer service would have been better. I went there with my family for my birthday, and one member of my family has celiac disease. She told them immediately upon sitting down about this, and we were told they could accommodate her. She ordered gluten free pasta, but when her meal came out, there was wheat pasta mixed in with the gluten free. We told the waitress and after she took it back to the kitchen, she came out and said there wasn't wheat pasta mixed in. Everybody at the table saw it clear as day; it wasn't even the same shape as the gluten free pasta. Then when the manager came out, she said all she could do was call EMS. For anybody with celiac or anybody who knows somebody with celiac, you know this is not an emergency situation, but it is a situation that should be addressed and dealt with. We had other problems with the meal as well, mainly that we didn't get some of the food we ordered at all and our appetizer came out with the meal. When we tried to address this with the manager, she said she'd comp our bill and walked away. A manager who cared about their restaurant would have listened to our experience in order to learn from the mistakes that were made. We didn't expect or want a comp. Overall the food was good, but the attention to detail and customer service could have been better."}
{"text":"To start off this review, I should say that there are so many great things about this restaurant. The atmosphere is great. It's cozy, modern and trendy. The patio is also quite nice. Cocktails are creative, fresh and delicious. Service is never less than impeccable. All this being said...why only 3 stars? A restaurant's main purpose is food, right? This restaurant falls very short of delivering on that front. Some things are excellent, but 85-90% of the menu simply does not live up to its potential. I got cassoulet with house made sausage - absolutely tasteless! Several of the entrees reach a B+/A- but overall, this place needs to kick up the flavor. I would definitely recommend it for drinks and apps, but not necessarily dinner."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that I have been wanting to check out for a while so I am very glad I got the chance to go. I went on a Friday night for an early dinner/ Happy Hour. My friend and I grabbed a seat at the bar which I was surprised wasn't more crowded. We were immediately greeted by 2 super friendly and helpful bartenders. 

It was a warm night in Cleveland in February so I went with the Bloom cocktail that had homemade lemonade in it. It was AMAZING!! My friend got the Simplicity and that sounded and looked great as well. My friend and I split the crab and salmon cake appetizer. It comes with 2 of the cakes so it's perfect to split with somebody. Crab and salmon are my 2 favorite seafoods so this was perfect. I wasn't that hungry so I ordered the romaine wedge salad with chicken. They didn't have just plain grilled chicken so it came parmasean crusted and this actually made it even better. Not as healthy as I was hoping, but way more delicious. The wedge salad came with prischuitto (which I overlooked) so it would have been great without the chicken. The menu had so many great options on it so I was sad to stick with just a salad, but I'm glad I got to try the chicken. 

The restaurant itself is small, quaint and has a vintage feel to it. There's a patio in back that I did not see so I guess that means I will have to come back again. This is a great spot in Gordon Square which is popping with all of the great new restaurants and bars."}
{"text":"Great place, great burgers. Can't complain! I wish the service was a bit faster but it was the dinner rush and the patio was crowded. Really really great burgers! Would definitely recommend swinging by!"}
{"text":"Well we thought we would try Luxe for brunch on this Fathers Day. Main reason was that the restaurant is dog friendly and we invited out Maltese Shitzu to join us. But starting out we ordered drinks. I ordered a mimosa. The waitress brought my wife's drink out but had to go back inside for mine. In the meantime my wife struggled with what to order. Waitress back and ordered my eggs dish and a Luxe Benedict. Guess what? Out of that! Oh well my wife changed the order. Our meals came rather timely. My wife enjoyed her breakfast crescent, but scrambled eggs weren't completely scrambled and a little runny.But that was my fault I should have ordered well cooked. The sausage was outstanding. we ate it all! 
Waiting for waitress and for my water glass to be refilled. When she came asked her type of sausage she didn't know. 
So overall a fair meal and service slightly below average. Would we come back? Probably"}
{"text":"If it's a nice day out, trust me, make sure you sit out at the patio at Luxe. But, you better not be allergic to pets! Luxe Kitchen is a pet friendly restaurant that allows you to bring your dogs to their patio and order food for them! When I came here with my friend, it just had such a nice vibe to it. 

I came here for Brunch so if you want to know about their brunch food, read on!

A table next to me ordered the egg sammie (yes, i went up and asked the name of it) and i was immediately jealous that I hadn't ordered it. So, I would say.. when in doubt, get the egg sammie! But, here are the dishes I tried:

Breakfast Bake (3.5): I loved the fontina cream that came with it and I loved the bacon (who doesn't) thrown in there with the perfectly made potatoes. What I wasn't sure I liked was the egg. Given that i'm not a huge fan of raw egg, I thought the egg didn't look very....fresh? It was just a bit disturbing. But all in all, the breakfast bake was pretty delish!

Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict (4.5): YUM YUM YUM! Love it! Salmon was fresh, muffin was good, side potatoes were perfect, and the eggs were cook well.

Overall, I'd say their sandwich (which I didn't taste) looked really good and seemed to be what most tables were ordering so go with that if you're hesitating on what to order. Oh, a mimosa with it might not be a bad idea while you enjoy a patio full of dogs!"}
{"text":"Pizzas here were good.  We tried four kinds.  The mushroom was my favorite.  The squash my least favorite.  The crispy gnocchi was the showstopper of the meal.  I liked this place and the hipster decor was fun.  If i'm in lakewood this is good dinner option but living on the east site I would probably just go to Vero Pizza which is much closer.  I thought it was a fun way to spend an evening dining here and then walking over to Sweet Moses.  Parking is not that easy to find as the public lots were full when I dined here but there was closeby bank lot just next door as well street parking though several blocks way still available."}
{"text":"I have been there five times. I have no particular experience to write about rather I just thought a general overview would be OK. Every time I have been there I have went with the Gnocchi with a spare rib on top. It really is top of the line stuff. My friend's have tried the burgers and a fish special that I can remember and they were all thrilled with what they had. Really, with all the hoopla around Michael Symon and other great chefs in this town I still think this may be consistently my favorite dining experience. Meaning if I had an awesome big date and I felt I had to come up with something different in the clutch based on my experiences I would go to Luxe."}
{"text":"I tried Luxe with my family over Christmas break.  It was 7pm on a Wednesday night and the place was at half capacity.  We made reservations for 6 and were seated in the 2nd dining room at a table right by the windows.  It was cold. Very cold.  I was wearing layers consisting of a T-shirt, button down shirt, and a knitted sweater but was still freezing.  I asked to move before we ordered anything but the waitress only offered to cover the vents with napkins.  That helped a little but it was still not warm enough and I think they could have made room for us elsewhere as our group wasn't that big and the restaurant wasn't that full.

The complimentary warm french bread with butter was very good but wasn't refilled after we quickly devoured it.  We ordered the fried calamari as an app and the batter coating was crisp and not overly greasy.  It came with aioli pre-applied (no marinara) and garnished with olives and pickled banana peppers which was an excellent addition.  

The Luxe Burger had a good beefy flavor but I wanted it to be juicier and it needed more cheese.  

Braised beef shortrib with gnocchi and gorgonzola cream sauce - I had high expectations for this dish but was let down by thick, dense gnocchi.  The sauce was rich and creamy and you can definitely taste the gorgonzola.  The shortrib was very tender but I felt like it needed a red wine glaze.  

I tried a bite of my sister-in-law's chorizo risotto and it didn't disappoint.  The rice was properly cooked and the chorizo wasn't overpowering. 

Tips:  There's a parking lot behind Luxe near the bank.  Don't sit by the windows in the winter time.

Cons:  They added automatic gratuity for our party of 6."}
{"text":"I recently had the pleasure of ordering some delicious food from Marlin Kaplan's Luxe.

One of the most recent additions to the Detroit Shoreway area Luxe is worth every moment. The interior is finely crafted metals and vintage mixed with Cleveland history. Everything has a story like the glass-fronted open kitchen (those brass doorways were salvaged from a Tower City Remodel.) I had the pleasure of meeting the craftsman behind the metals and he was so passionate about the work everyone put into the creation of the space, I was only that much more eager to eat!

We ate a late afternoon there and loved it! My husband's roasted portobello mushroom sandwich was juicy and seasoned so creatively. It had delicious bread that was freshly baked. The onion and garlic was divine! I had the cheese plate with the jam and tapenade...it may seem simple but the cheeses were so fricking good and again, the great bread. Additionally the jam and tapenade was such a nice touch to the selection, I wanted more and more.

You really need to try this place. It has Cleveland history and charm and a happenin' happy hour and bar! All the cool people are doin' it!!!"}
{"text":"Dear Luxe,

I heard good things. I didn't experience such goodness.

First, our table was ready half an hour after our reservation. Thanks.

We ordered an appetizer that came out half an hour after we ordered it, but five minutes before our main courses.  That drives a hungry kid bonkers.  There were about 5 of us that shared food, and we got the Margharita, the pizza with olives and such, the braised beef gnocchi, and some veggie lasagna. I thought everything was tasty, but it was pretty pricey for what we got.  It was $240 for 5 of us after 2 appetizers, 5 meals and 2 bottles of wine. 

The atmosphere is very tasteful; it appears to be an old bank building. However, the owners appear to be trying to milk the space for every square foot.  Tables are crammed in and it makes it tough to maneuver in an out of your table.  The bar area encroaches on some tables as well - it looked like it bothered the people at the tables to have bar patrons hovering over them.

The food was good.  But that doesn't navigate an obstacle course of condensed tables, steep prices and sub-par service."}
{"text":"I loved the food here. Giving it a three because the portions are small and outrageously high-priced. Also, the mixed drinks we got were not very well made. We had to ask for them to be improved with additions."}
{"text":"Always a fan of Luxe -- though right now I'm really missing their currently-off-the-menu charcuterie plate. My boyfriend the Paleo-dieter had a spectacular steak special and I fell off the Paleo/GF wagon into Luxe's arugula pizza. Oh arugula pizza, I love you so. 

Still: the thing that keeps me coming back is their cocktails. The Bloom kept me company this night, but I've had most of the cocktail menu at one time or another and they're always superb.

The creme brûlée trio is beyond amazing, my only complaint is that I wish it could be bigger! (Which would defeat the 'sampler' purpose, but still...)"}
{"text":"Pros: Great burger, atmosphere, back patio area, happy hour deals. Delicious mixed drinks.

Cons: Service ranging from odd to rude. The hostess we dealt with was particularly grouchy and unwelcoming. Additionally, we were told about the happy hour out back on the patio, but only after being seated at a table out there and ordering our food and drinks were we told the happy hour pricing only applied if you were sitting at the bar. Why were we not sat there then when we were told about the happy hour and said we were interested? We would have ordered differently, felt we got a bit misled there into a much pricier dinner.

And the food here IS pricey - but I don't think the quality of most justifies it, especially with their flatbreads. Which were just ok - the BBQ flatbread was disappointingly bland with minimal toppings. And you'll be even more unhappy about the cost when you find out you're not getting the happy hour deals you thought you were ordering.

I probably wouldn't return here to eat, however could enjoy meeting friends for drinks out on the back patio for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. I definitely was not expecting this! The place is definitely good for a date night, as it appeared most all the parties were couples. I had the mushroom and goat cheese pizza which was very tasty. The short rib gnocchi and risotto special dishes were also very good.  I liked the atmosphere; it was sophisticated but not stuffy and is well decorated."}
{"text":"New favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Words can barely describe how good this place is. Do yourself a favor and go check it out. 

The decor is trendy/artsy. Good place to meet friends to celebrate birthdays or special occasions. The menu is small plates & pizza. 

We had the cauliflower gratin, which had rich shaved Parmesan cheese and a smokey bacon flavor. It was so good we wanted to lick the bowl. 

The sriracha wings were fresh and spicy! The honey-lemon dipping sauce was the perfect pair and a combination I have not seen at any other establishment. 

The pizza was garlicky and cheesy and amazing. 10/10 would recommend it. 

There is a happy hour menu! We will be back very soon"}
{"text":"Food and ambiance get 5 stars. I got the simplicity drink and if you like something that's light and refreshing, you'll love this. We got the charcuterie board as an appetizer, which held us over before our main course. Now, between mine and my friend's dish, I'm not sure what was better. I got the short rib and potato gnocchi which was to-die-for. She got the chicken carbonara pasta which I tried a bite of and it was heaven. I'm pretty much thinking you can't go wrong food-wise here.
The only reason I didn't give the entire review 5 stars is because their servers could use an improvement. After being seated, we waited awhile before someone came to our table to take our drink order. We had to ask what the specials were instead of being told. Overall, they just seemed very disinterested in serving us and making it the best experience we could have had."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now and this is quickly becoming my new favorite place!

I have to say that while driving by, it can go unnoticed.  
It sort of blends in with the building and nothing jumps out at u.  It's located next to a bank, and after a certain time (4 I think), u can park in the back of bank.  

I love the patio out back.  

They have some unique drink concoctions with pressed/puréed berries in the summer....love

Servers/bartenders = all nice 

The food... OH THE FOOD!!!!
1st- I love the bread/butter they give in the beginning.
I've had/tried a special of stuffed trout- oh mah gawd! That's all I have to say about that one.  Then off the menu i had the ricotta gnocchi w/beef short ribs- I thought I died and went to heaven. Seriously folks, it's that good!  I tried a steak special with fingerling potatoes and carrots- it sounds simple, but packed with flavor-delicious (we added blue cheese crumbles on top). I want to eat here everyday now and keep trying new things!   But, I shall pace myself. 

Until next time...."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast after going to church in the area. 

First of all our server was fantastic. She was personable, friendly and attentive. It probably helped that we were the only ones there at around 11 but even so, great service. We were seen to immediately and our waters and coffees were constantly topped off without us having to ask.

This was my first time at Luxe and I was excited to try their menu. I ordered the Seared Cornbread which I thought was interesting but the cornbread was surprisingly sweet. It paired decently with the meat and egg but I wish I'd known it was going to be THAT sweet. If I wanted something that sweet I would've ordered the pancakes. I will say it was fairly large so I ended up taking half of it home. One of my friends ordered the Short Rib Hash which she really liked. The other friend ordered the Crispy Portabello and, though she liked it, she wished it had been a bit bigger - that was definitely the smallest of the dishes. We then split an order of beignets. They came out hot with three types of dips. I thought they were pretty good, not the best I'd ever had but decent.

The decor of the place and the vibe is fairly modern and interesting. I can't attest to how popular it is or how crowds are handled because again, we were definitely the only ones there for the majority of our time there. 

Overall it was a good experience but I'm not sure I loved the food enough to come back."}
{"text":"Frequent luxe pretty regularly but was disappointed on Saturday May 5. Website stated open till midnight however when we got there a little before 11:30 to have a quick drink the doors were locked. People were sitting at bar inside yet we could not get in. We ubered there and the Uber left before we could get back in. Really wanted to take friends there for one drink who were in from out of town."}
{"text":"I've run the gamut of experiences at Luxe - date night, large group party, brunch, drinks and dessert. For me, this place is underrated -- it is among my top five in Cleveland for dinner and drinks but doesn't seem to get a lot of love. Their patio is great and while I agree that some of the tables inside are a little awkward (fortunately I've never had to sit at those high-tops in the bar area), I love the vibe. The decor is a rustic, shaggy kind of cool, but not clichéd or over-the-top.  Their cocktail menu is one of the more inspired and inventive in Cleveland -- and I love that they have rotating specials as well as classics you can keep coming back for (try the Joy). My very first meal here I had the gnocchi, which is absolutely luscious -- so far only Cibreo has topped it in terms of pillowy goodness. The beignets are another favorite. I recently discovered Luxe offers Sunday brunch, so this past Sunday we gave it a try. During Happy hour (from 11-1) bellinis/mimosas/bloody marys are half off -- a great value. I had the mango bellini, and although it seemed like mostly champagne, I'm completely ok with that! My husband's peach pancakes were just decadent - I highly recommend them if you can handle that much sugar in the morning. I had the poached eggs with fried crab corn cakes and tomato, and admittedly was disappointed. The eggs were cooked perfectly (nice & runny!) but the hollandaise sauce, which was supposed to be spicy, was absolutely bland. The tomatoes weren't the ripest, and overall the dish just lacked flavor and seasoning. My favorite part was the toast, which they get from Blackbird Baking in Lakewood. Not the strongest showing, but I've had so many other wonderful experiences here, I know I will be back (just not for the eggs!)."}
{"text":"Every time I've been here, no matter how busy, we've always managed to score a table. The service has always been excellent, and the food always great.

They have a great selection of regional and seasonal beers (and PBR, if you like that sort of thing). I am told the cocktails are spectacular as well. The pizzas and burgers are particularly good, and the menu changes regularly with season dishes and daily specials. I really just wish they had steak as a regular menu item, since they do it really well.

As a bonus, when my wife and I got married just before Christmas last year, they were able to take us in with a party of seven on a busy Friday night at short notice. I will always appreciate that."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. The servers and everyone in the restaurant were very accommodating. With large crowds sometimes it can be difficult pleasing everyone, but the servers here were so attentive and patient. There were 12 people in our party, so I must give the staff there an applause for satisfying all our needs so well. They were even kind enough to warn us when the birthday girl arrived so we could give her a proper surprise greeting! 

Food:

Snacks= Vegetable frito- This is a great starter especially if you have some friends that are vegetarian. I love my veggies, so this was a good light start to the meal. 
Bacon-wrapped medjool dates- I was a little disappointed with this dish. It tasted wonderful, but I expected it to be bigger. This is not the first time I've had dates wrapped with bacon, and most of the other restaurants I've been to usually served them using the bigger dates. If you've never tried this dish, you should definitely order it. It's a taste bud pleaser! 

Meat=
Braised beef short-rib ricotta gnocchi- The beef was amazing! It was so tender and juicy  that I was almost reluctant to share it with my friends! The sauce around the gnocchi was delicious and creamy with lots of mushrooms. I wasn't a big fan of the gnocchi itself. I guess it was a little too dry for my taste. But overall, the dish was good!

Pappardelle- This was a friend's dish, and I regret not taking more from her :p. The pasta was great and the mixture of pork shoulder, mushroom, onions and the marsala jus was wonderful! I will probably order this the next time I come back to Luxe."}
{"text":"Just not good enough to earn 3 stars from me.

For a few days last week I stayed in Cleveland with a friend.  Friend and I wanted to meet up with my brother and his fiancée for dinner while I was in town, and I selected Luxe from a short list of suggested restaurants.  The main reason I chose Luxe was because the place has a tapas thing going on.

The food?  Hits and misses.
* The gnocchi dish with \"braised short ribs, Gorgonzola Dolce cream sauce, wild mushrooms, spinach\" was tasty and satisfying, but there's no denying that the super-chewy gnocchi wasn't executed properly.  The short ribs, while flavorful, were far from fall-apart tender.  Just 3 nights earlier I'd enjoyed incredible short ribs in San Diego, and Luxe's short ribs just didn't do the cow justice.
* The side of Blue Cheese Gnocchi came with mushrooms and spinach like the $15.50 gnocchi dish.  Very good, but, again, the gnocchi was chewy.
* The Eggplant Fries were insanely over-seasoned, greasy, and nearly reduced to mush.

The service?  Disgraceful.
* The very young-looking mumbling hostess appeared miserable--a bad first impression of Luxe within 15 seconds of walking through the door.
* Servers had been running around frantically all evening, dropping things everywhere.  Near the end of our meal a server rushed by our table and, barely stopping, refilled my brother's water glass.  When she pulled the pitcher away from the glass, still holding the pitcher at a tilt, a good half cup of water and ice splashed onto my foot...and, amazingly, the employee didn't even notice!
* Some members of our group ordered entrees and others ordered multiple small plates, but our waiter tried to persuade each of us to order courses, saying things like \"Don't you want a salad to go with that?\"  I found his shameless attempts to up-sell incredibly rude being that Luxe is a tapas restaurant.  
* When my brother's soft-spoken fiancée communicated her menu selection, the waiter found it appropriate to bark \"I CAN'T HEAR YOU!\" versus something to the extent of \"I'm sorry, what was that?\" or \"Excuse me?\"
* Our waiter bent from the waist across our entire table to set down our food, had his armpit in my face, and bumped into me.  No apology.  I even felt my hair brush against one of the dishes in his hands.  

The décor and ambiance?  There's some interesting wall art to admire, but Luxe is trying too hard to obtain the trendy-rustic look.  Both the dining room scene and post-Happy Hour crowd on the back patio--we checked out the packed patio after dinner but didn't stay--were rowdier than I expected.

Would I give Luxe another try?  Probably, but to say the service here needs some major work is an understatement."}
{"text":"Alright. I'm yelping as we sit here. 
First they forgot one appetizer completely. never said sorry, never acknowledged the absence. Nothing. 
Second they forgot an entree completely. It came fifteen minutes late. No apology? Awesome. 
Third they just threw down random desserts for my friends birthday without singing, without acknowledgement. Nada. 
NEVER AGAIN. 
Food leaves something to be desired. Garnish much????? Gross. I had chicken risotto and it was honestly half kale."}
{"text":"Highlight-  cool atmosphere, hip crowd 

Attentive service for the most part minus the strange male host who walks around with his own coffee in hand....

Lowlight- bland ahi tuna
overly sweet dark and stormy"}
{"text":"A great bar in a cool neighborhood, but with much-better-than-bar food at reasonable prices. What's not to like? 

From their gem of a patio that uses old R&D machining equipment for tables and tree pots to create and urban garden feel, to the delicious house cocktails (I think I got the Bloom which was awesome), the awesome pizza (get the candied jalepeno's, not too hot or too sweet, just so good), amazing 1/2 off happy hour prices, reasonable normal prices, amazing Sunday brunch, dog friendly patio, and attractive, professional, friendly staff you can't go wrong.  Not to mention the Gourmet Deserts to top it all off!

A+ will go again."}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour with a coworker and am looking forward to going back. We ordered the prosciutto, asparagus and arugula pizza, which was AMAZING and the Brussels sprouts which were out of this world! I seriously dream of them at night and wake up to drool on my pillow. 

The ambiance was laid back and welcoming. The bartender (we chose to sit at the bar and eat) was extremely friendly and answered all of our questions about the menu. Great happy hour pricing-$6 select appetizers and $10 pizzas!"}
{"text":"From Cincinnati on a short vacation. Went here on the way home. Wings & calimari small plates were yummy. Crazy small red peppers in the calamari were so good!! Wild mushroom & Brie wood fired pizza & creamy mushroom soup were excellent.  They made a pizza with specific toppings for my picky son, no problem. I topped off my dinner with a Witches of Atlas cocktail - cinnamon goodness. Friendly wait staff. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Luxe is my happy place.

The staff and owner are always friendly, the drinks are fantastic (Simplicity is my fave), and the food is always on point.

Tonight we had the fried artichokes with an amazing sauce, mussels, and the Bianca pizza. The crust was doughy, yet crisp and the basil garnish made it feel like a light dish. 

Everything is always delish and the vibe (music and decor) is always laid back, yet very cool. 

Did I mention their awesome happy hour? I believe it ends at 7pm. $10 pizzas, $6 snacks, and discounted drinks

Go"}
{"text":"Service here is great! Very friendly and attentive. I wanted to really like the food but some things were a little off. The portabella croquettes were too much filling than mushroom but the sauce it came with was great. The seafood Mac and cheese had potential but I found the shrimp to be extremely gooey. Almost like it was cooked properly. No, I did not get sick but it raised a red flag. A lot of potential here just little things caught me off guard. Nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here during their anniversary weekend. Free sparkling wine to start off definitely helped. The marinated olives were awesome - if you're a fan of olives, you'll love these. My friends opted for their 3 course family meal - for $22/person they told the waitress they wanted a seafood main course, then the chefs just came up with whatever. In this case it was a seafood stew, which they loved. I went for the woodlands pizza. It was delicious - spinach, goat cheese, provolone.

Although the food was great, the service was lacking. We had the spaciest waitress ever. She must have come back and forth 3 times asking us what we wanted, and when my friends asked if they could have a specific seafood dish when ordering (rather than a melange of seafood) she was like \"Maybe\". And just stood there... 
 -\"Can you find out?\" 
- \"Oh... yes...\""}
{"text":"A bit underwhelmed, with the unbalanced food flavoring. The vibe is wonderful, and decor beautiful. I do admit, I was quite confused what they're trying to portray with the record, but it was pleasing to the eye. The food and service however, was particularly on top of it. Service was a big lagging, with more waitstaff than customers. Main courses were plentiful, but flavors were not balanced. Either too much of this or too little of that. Ordered beignets, which personally were a bit too hard (over fried) and seasoned in too much cinnamon sugar. Overall, okay, just not something of my fancy."}
{"text":"I think I'm drooling as I write this review...

Luxe is my absolute favorite spot in CLE. Whether for happy hour or a dinner full of small plates, this is the place to be. The decor is hip and vibrant - making their incredible menu that much more enjoyable.

My absolute favorite dish is the Sriracha wings with a yummy lemon yogurt dipping sauce. Sweet, tart and savory - these crunchy bunches of chicken deliciousness will keep you coming back for more. And don't let me forget the pizza. I've tried many of their concoctions and not a single one has let me down. The thin, melt-in-your-mouth crust is loaded with fresh ingredients that make this pizza feel (almost) guilt free.

Whether you're a neighborhood resident or driving through for a Cavs game, don't miss out on this CLE hotspot."}
{"text":"Hosted a birthday dinner here, based on other reviews.  The patio is killer, the service was outstanding and the food was excellent!  We loved the fries (eggplant, sweet potato and regular), the goat cheese fondue, the dinner specials and the spinach salad.  Our waiter Michael was attentive and fun without hovering around, just perfect.

Loved the decor inside the restaurant as well.  Will be back often to hang out on the patio/bar outside!"}
{"text":"OMG! The BEST burger I've ever eaten in my life! The Luxe Burger is a must. Manchego, bacon jam, and grilled onions...soo delicious. The atmosphere was nice and I love the stylish decor. All the staff were very friendly & helpful. We sat outside on their nice patio, I would like to sit inside sometime. I would go back here anytime!

Not to mention...I love the name :)"}
{"text":"Great space...
nice staff...
amazing patio...
order the family meal....
have fun"}
{"text":"i love this place, and especially love their brunch on sundays on the patio.  I'm here nearly every sunday, but today the service was really, really slow, the iced tea was cloudy and bitter, and i usually sub some salad for the potatoes - this time they charged $5 for the substitution. None of these will stop me from coming back, but i hope the management sees this and fixes the iced tea, trains the staff on substitutions and increases their attentiveness."}
{"text":"I was craving gnocchi and came here with a friend. They had a lovely menu that offered a variety of options for both of us. 

We were seated right away in a quiet spot. It was pouring rain and we were happy to have a place to seek shelter from the storm. I ordered a lavender lemonade and my friend had a glass of wine. The lavender lemonade came with red puree. When I asked the server why it was red, he simply responded that was the puree they used. There were hints of lavender but the lemonade was overpowering and definitely the star of the show. The server also brought 3 pieces of bread (for 2 of us) and some butter. We had to fight over that last piece. :-(

The ricotta gnocchi comes with braised beef short ribs, wild mushrooms, spinach, and gorgonzola cream sauce. The beef short ribs were cooked and seasoned perfectly. It was tender and fell apart when I touched it with my fork. The wild mushrooms were a nice blend and offered good balance to the dish. The cream sauce wasn't too strong and the spinach offered a bit of color and different flavor. The gnocchi was the most disappointing part of this dish. Ricotta is often added to gnocchi to lighten them up. I'm accustomed to gnocchi that are light, scored on the sides with a fork, and melt in your mouth. These were heavy, dense, doughy rocks. 

My friend and I shared an order of beignets. It was a large portion for $7 and a good value. However, these were not beignets. I would describe them as drop donuts. They were in approximate circular-ish shapes. After being fried, they were covered in cinnamon and sugar. Powdered sugar was only sparingly sprinkled on the top few donuts. They came with a caramel, chocolate, and berry coulis sauce.

My friend had the salmon burger and it tasted good. Her portion of fries was rather large but they were seasoned well, warm, and an overall good side dish. 

The space is very warm and inviting. During warmer months, there's plenty of opportunities to sit outside. It looks like a great gathering place for groups. The food leaves a bit to be desired."}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours on the Westside! $5 cocktails, all made with great infused alcohol and awesome portions, and cheap snacks. Try the Luxe, with some marinated olives and flat bread spread on the side. The regular meals are fair, but I think you get the best deal when you pop over after work. Just get there early--the place fills up fast!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Chris, our server, was fabulous in more ways than one. The only complaint I can come up with is that they were out a few menu items.. Chris was prompt, helpful, ad FUN! Loved the food and alcohol choices."}
{"text":"Oh my. The food is the best I've had in a long time. Our server is great! It's a little loud but perfect for our party!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Luxe for the first time last night. This place came highly recommended both for its food and overall atmosphere. 

We sat outside and had our dinner + drinks at the bar. Great atmosphere for sure and the menu has a good variety of dishes. My friend and I split the peppercorn crusted tuna and the mediterranean aglio olio. Tuna was excellent but the pasta dish was average. 

Luxe has a good beer selection as well as some cocktails. I ordered the Zeus (whiskey based cocktail) and was a little disappointed with my drink. 

Overall, a cool spot for dinner with good quality food. I will definitely go back to try different things on the menu but will most likely be ordering a beer next time."}
{"text":"I was here after the Third Fridays at 78th St Studios with a few girlfriends and WE LOVED IT! I know the menu rotates often, but I'll leave a few suggestions in the event these items are available when you're there. 

I started with the quinoa & kale salad- very tasty and filling. It is a Big Salad (as Elaine from Seinfeld would say). For my entree I enjoyed very much the acorn squash dish that was stuffed with squash risotto- two thumbs up! That would've been plenty, but I couldn't pass up the chance to try to cauliflower au gratin-- another two thumbs up! My only disappointment is that I didn't leave room for dessert ;-) 

We had great service, the drinks were fun and the ambiance was perfect. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Luxe has wonderful food, drinks and service - every time I've visited!! The wait staff is friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. Five of us went to dinner last eve and everyone from the vegan to the carnivore, the wine drinker to the beer aficionado all found something they liked!
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Like any restaurant designed for candlelit rendezvous, Luxe seems to hold many secrets. Beside the old Wells Fargo vault, with its gears on soft-lit display, and under the golden ceiling tiles, you'll wonder just what it might be hiding. You'll be served Italian bread with mounds of butter on mismatched Parisian dessert plates. You'll indulge in flirtatious gin drinks served in delicate glasses--ghostly yellow and lemony-sweet but with a shaving of peppercorn suspended in them for texture. You'll peer into the busy kitchen with its stark white walls. You'll munch hot, breaded artichoke hearts dipped in silken pesto. How are the flavors so rich and clean, you'll wonder. Is there a clue in the server's knowing smile? Some magic in here. Somewhere just beyond your ken. Soon you'll feast on salads with bleu cheese and shaved beets candied until translucent, and then cauliflower risotto so warm and rich it might just knock you off balance. The music, you'll note, is both insistently bassy and old world beguiling. The aesthetic of Luxe is, you'll learn, that of the charmer's gambit, the sensualist's habitual imposition. Wouldn't be a stretch to see Wilde here, or Byron, that club-footed cad, fork poised to dive into something dangerously savory. Good luck figuring out the essence. Like any nighttime mystery, it's better to simply marvel at it."}
{"text":"The 2013 incarnation of Luxe is what I was hoping for when it first opened. My initial visit way back when was underwhelming, to say the least, and I didn't return until now. Last night's visit left me looking forward to our next one. There were a lot of appealing dishes, but we settled on the grilled sourdough, goat cheese piquillo peppers, pomegranate duck, and cauliflower gratin and just split everything. The sourdough starter was a perfect combination of flavors, with earthy mushrooms, peppery arugula, and fatty egg. It set the stage nicely for the rest of the dishes, the best of which was the braised duck with house-made pappardelle. It was lightly sweet and fork-tender. I was too stuffed for dessert (which all sounded great), but a nip of Fernet Branca rounded everything out nicely. Service was terrific; I love sitting at the bar because it's more interactive, and everyone who came by was interested in how our food was."}
{"text":"Planned an event here for my husband's HS reunion. Spoke with the private event coordinator plently of times and she had \"marked us down\" for the reservation. So imagine my surprise when we showed up and there was no reservation for our party of 20ish. They were able to fit us in the lounge, but it wasn't a private event like we had discussed. 

Regardless, they made it work so we let it go. The beer and cocktails are pretty expensive. Their food leaves a lot to be desired. Everything sounds like its going to be good, but nothing really blew us out of the water. It gets super loud in there. They do have an adorable looking patio, but it was raining on the evening we were there. 

Personally, we would NEVER come back here and would not recommend this place for private events!"}
{"text":"ambitious menu
solid food on Detroit road  
does not disappoint

I was in a bind on a Saturday night prime time.  Planned to go to Ginza for sushi, but I forgot there was a Cav's game and parking would be a nightmare.  After calling numerous spots in O.C. and no chance for a table, we ventured down Detroit Rd, thinking maybe Minh Ahn or the like, and Luxe came to mind.  They managed to squeeze us in on the fly at the only open table in the house.  The place was humming.  Great crowd, and we were seated right by the kitchen.  That right there is a well oiled machine.  They were cranking out food at a tremendous pace.  

Of course, we were in a bit off a hurry, and starving.  We put our order in all at once, the food came out quickly.  Very impressive. Very.  Service was friendly and efficient.
Solid and well priced wine list.  A few interesting cocktails as well, that I intend to try next time.  And next time will be soon, as the food was well prepared, good sized portions, and nice flavor balance.  I will definitely explore this menu more soon.

We only had a few appetizers and 1 entree.  Roasted brussel sprouts - tasty and so very slightly undercooked.  Some may quibble that they could have been cooked a it more, but still very acceptable.  The meatball small plate was a win as well.  My short rib tartine was fine.  Also had was a roasted squash salad, that was surprisingly rich in flavor.  Off the charts greatness came in the form of begneits for dessert.  Wow.  Three ramekins of dips for them - a light caramel, dark chocolate, and blueberry.  These little pillows of fried dough goodness were flawless. 

Great vibe in the place.  Young, high energy service, rockin' kitchen, No complaints, and worth a spot as one of your \"go-to\" restaurants in Cleveland!

Carry on..."}
{"text":"When in Gordon Square this is a must. Unique menus consisting of many dishes prepared with locally grown vegetables or raised meats. The staff is exceptional."}
{"text":"My third visit here was on my birthday - a Friday, so Luxe was busy.  I love the vibe and the fact that almost any attire seems to go well with the surroundings.  Our waiter (excuse me, server) was Jared, and his enthusiasm for the place rubbed off on us.  My friend and I had been here before and really loved it, but the third in our party had not, and he was delighted from the start.  The music is awesome when you can hear it.  I think my biggest complaint is that it can get very very noisy at times, and conversation either has to be stopped or signed or yelled.  Ah, the food.  Well, on a previous visit, my friend and I had shared the scallops - an appetizer of some sort the specifics of which I don't remember.  These scallops are made the way ALL scallops should be made - they're browned and flavorful and tender and buttery.  Had a nice polenta to complement.  Was a little disappointed in our entrees simply because we decided to go the \"family\" route - a chef's selection of appetizer, entree, and dessert.  There's nothing left to the diner, and although the salad and dessert were wonderful, I was very disappointed in the main course - a strip steak in a sauce I wasn't sure about with vegetables that no one like but me.  Next time, I will be sure to order my own selection.  Simple.  And, we heard from our server that many come in and order only the family dinner.  It's all a matter of taste.  The employees seem all to be enjoying themselves and the vibe is contagious.  Fun place.  Just order what YOU want."}
{"text":"Luxe has an amazing happy hour. You just have to get a seat at the bar! I have been here a few times, and the food has been great everytime. For the portion size, it can be a little on the pricy side. However, during happy hour, the prices can't be beat! They also have a great patio in the summer months.

One thing I have noticed is the service is hit or miss. When I go to Luxe, I try not to be in a hurry, because I know I could be there a while."}
{"text":"Ugh, I was so torn on this one. Broken down:
AWESOME: The atmosphere (so charming, so unique, so stylish and sexy), the waitress (super sweet and helpful), my first impression of the menu (so many things sounded good that we ordered like 5 tapas).
NOT SO AWESOME: The food. =( It all sounds so good in theory, but I felt like the execution fell disappointingly short. We ordered a mushroom, sweet potato fries, squash....all of which wasn't something I would try again. Also, of no fault of the restaurant, there was a full table of extremely rowdy middle-aged adults that made my meal insanely noisy. The back room must be very echoey, and again I know it's not the restaurant's fault that they were having a heck of a good time (at the expense of the other patron's enjoyment).

I wanted to like this place so badly I still might go back anyways and try a fresh round of newly listed menu items."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Tried it for the first time with my cousin not too long ago when they first started their new menu! Met the owner and she was super nice and let me and my cousin try the bacon wrapped dates :P delish. The fries are so yummy too! Who would have though of bacon jam!?! And literally everything we tried was killer (6 small plates) enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"Really liked the area Gordon Square and this restaurant. Good variety of beef, seafood, pasta and pizza. Lounge area and restaurant area with go d selection of beer, wine and cocktails. Service was great too."}
{"text":"Always good! The food is wondrous.  Try the lavender lemonade with a shot of bourbon."}
{"text":"Start to finish, my experience at Luxe was one of (if not the best) I've had in cleveland. I've been meaning to go for forever now and decided it would be a perfect birthday date spot- I was right, dude!
Immediately the decor wraps you in. Whomever did the interior design for that place is a genius! It's comfortable, hip, and swanky. The patio is a whole world of its own. Best patio in the area hands down!
Okay, so after seeing the cowskin booths, I didn't this place could be any cooler. After conversing with the staff, I realized how wrong I was. Timely, friendly, attentive, and really relaxed service (also birthday shots? Awesome sauce). Adam was our server and he was hella cool. Genuinely happy to be there.

Drink time! I got the \"joy\" and my bud got the \"bloom\". Both were excellent! Just strong enough and insanely tasty. You can always tell when drinks are homemade and fresh- these cocktails are second to none people!

So food. We were totally overwhelmed with the amount of things on the menu that sounded good. We had to decide between everything! Took us like 15 minutes of intense studying before we could narrow it down. We decided on the bacon wrapped dates and the blanco pizza for our entree and the flatbread plate as an app. Holy moly my taste buds went on a vacation! Every topping for the flat bread was outstanding. The olive tapenade and herbed goat cheese were my favorites. Carrot hummus and peppers were delicious too. The pizza? Flawless. That crust is to die for- crispy and flaky on the bottom while still chewy and soft. The dates are in a class of their own. Seriously, you have to get them! My mouth is watering right now thinking of them. Best part of our meal. Because we licked our plates clean (not literally though it was considered) there unfortunately was no room for dessert. However, beccas menu sounded/looked unbelievable. Don't make our mistake! Save room! That girls sweets are where it's at.
5 stars all the way. Perfect evening. So insanely impressed with this place."}
{"text":"Luxe is always top notch! The food and service here can't be beat. Their daily specials are always something unique, and extremely fresh. Their patio is a great place to spend a warm spring/fall or summer night. The bartenders are friendly, and always willing to steer you in the right direction."}
{"text":"We went for a quick dinner before a movie around the corner. I should mention that we sat down at 6:50 and mentioned to the waitress that we were headed to a 730 movie - she was very nice and we got all the food and drink we ordered quickly and in time to make the show!

We had the empanadas as an appetizer which were very crunchy and delicious. I never thought I would be reviewing Caesar salad or cauliflower, but oh my goodness they were soooo good!! The salad was perfectly dressed - not too much or too little dressing - and the dressing itself was incredible. We had the au gratin cauliflower with bacon ... My mouth is still watering. I will never need au gratin potatoes again.

I definitely recommend this place for it's great food and very accommodating service!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  I love the way they approach everything.  The patio is top notch, the decor simple chic, and the food well prepared.  They offer a variety of cocktails to suit any taste.  Everything I have eaten here is loaded with flavor and well presented.  The service is ALWAYS exceptional!  I highly recommend it-even for larger groups."}
{"text":"So for a group of 9, 7 really enjoyed their meal. 2 of us ordered a salmon...which first was late. Then when it finally came to our table was pink and uncooked. The waitress asked us if it was too undercooked, as if it were steak. So we said it wasn't cooked... Instead of sending back a newly cooked piece...we received the same piece back. Still undercooked and all broken apart.  They made no offers to fix the matter until everyone else was already done eating and we left without eating any dinner. 
But everyone else's food was delicious."}
{"text":"A group of 14 of us had dinner on the patio last night. The weather was perfect and the outside area was very nice and relaxing. The service was excellent and spot on which is hard to pull off for most places when faced with a group as bag as ours was. Our drinks stayed refilled without having to ask. Our server was polite and professional and the food came out pretty quick. 

I didn't hear anybody complain about their meal. I ordered the Luxe Burger. I requested it to be prepared to a medium temperature. It was more of a well done but the first bite was so good I didn't feel the need to send it back or complain. The toppings on the burger were so flavorful that the burger meat itself acted as more of a compliment of texture and didn't need the juiciness of medium temperature burger to provide flavor. 

The food and the service were great. I just wish they offered more non-seafood options and more available parking. Other than that, no complaints. I would go back!"}
{"text":"Favorite place in town. Always amazing food and service. The Specials are always top notch, and the bartenders make phenomenal drinks. Everyone puts great time and effort into what they do."}
{"text":"My girl and I were visiting the Cleveland zoo for her birthday Wednesday. We chose Luxe based on some reviews, served Italian cuisine, and that they had a happy hour on their outdoor patio. We really loved the artistically decorated atmosphere and menu was exciting with many wonderful options. Our server was very attentive, and  specialty cocktails came out quickly. Delicious! We ordered a pizza and the carbonara. Both were amazing. They has a few live acts performing original songs on the patio, which was something new to us, but very enjoyable. We even stayed to here a few more songs with the second act even though we were finished with our meal and drinks. We don't have a dog, but we noticed they allow dogs on the patio, which was very nice for some of the guests. I would highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"I came to luxe on a Sunday evening with a party of six, and we had a great time, and lots of great food!

We shared some appetizers- the ceviche and the mushroom strudel were both excellent; the cheese/ charcuterie plate was good/ not great.
I had the carbonara, which comes with a sunny side egg on top- a welcome twist on a classic dish. My pasta was perfectly cooked and very tasty. I tasted the hen, which comes with roasted root vegetables cooked in a sweet broth- the hen was beautiful and golden and crispy and delicious. Our whole group was pleased with their entrees. We shared beignets, which were light and not too sweet; the dipping sauces were tasty. 

We had a great experience. Our server was goofy, but very attentive. She made us nervous by not writing down our orders (all six!), but she got it all right, and the service was great.

The atmosphere was nice-- exposed brick walls, and crystal chandeliers, and the rope window treatment is fun to look at. It wasn't too loud in the dining room, though it wasn't full.

Entrees ranged in price from $15-25 and I felt like you got plenty of food and really good quality for what you paid. 

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I like this place but wish they had a better beer selection.  The gnocci was so good that when I brought my dad and brother in from out of town I wouldn't let them order anything else.  The other food options are all pretty good."}
{"text":"Great meal: bay scallops shrimp mussels linguine, Cabernet braised short ribs, warm apple crumble pie"}
{"text":"Had an amazing birthday meal
Here! Excellent food, creative delicious drinks, and Adam is the best server! Had the crispy gnocchi app and smoked duck sausage, and the carbonara and mixed seafood. All great!"}
{"text":"Oh Luxe.  I wanted to like you.  You came so highly recommended by the local foodies I know in Cleveland.  Unfortunately, you're trying too hard and that's your downfall.  I understand you're in an 'up-and-coming' (i.e. gentrified) neighborhood and you're hoping to lure the Cleveland foodies over to make you the next big thing.  And, yes, you did get a few great reviews in the local papers.  And, yes, those reviews did help draw attention to you and make you very busy.  But, you're all flash and no substance.  

Your wait staff definitely knows how to dress the part of 'young-urban-waiting-tables-until-my-big-break-comes' typically seen on either coasts with the all-black outfit, hip hair-do and funky eyeglasses.  But, they have a horrible habit of keeping their eyes on the ground the entire night and doing their best to not get noticed by their tables.  You might want to let them in on the fact that they're not ostriches and just because they can't see us - doesn't mean we can't see them.  You might also want to let your wait staff know that after a table in his section is seated - he shouldn't make them wait for 20 minutes before he comes over to take their drink order.  

Your menu.  Seriously - you're only going to offer us appetizers, sandwiches, pasta and pizza?  Since you don't boast yourself as a vegetarian restaurant, you shouldn't neglect your carnivorous clientele.  Yes, you had 1 steak dish on your 'specials' menu.  One.  One meat dish for me to choose from.  Not cool, man.

And since I don't want to kick you while you're down, I won't even get into the noise volume.  (FYI:  concrete floors + brick walls = I can't hear the person sitting across from me).  Although I will point out this:  when your speakers blow, you should turn them off.  Not keep them on for 1 hour.  No one wants to hear loud fuzzy noise for that long.

But, I will give you 3 stars because your food wasn't terrible.  And while I was not a fan of my pasta dish, my fiance really enjoyed his dish."}
{"text":"what a great spot!  we had such a nice time here.  the food was excellent and we had spectacular service.  our server went out of his way to prepare me iced coffee with simple syrup.  very nice.  my dish, our server's recommendation, was an egg bake - potatos and cheese and eggs and a cream sauce.  it was absolutely delicious.  

the actual restaurant design is very cool as well.  lots of love and attention went into the decor and it shows.

would like to come back here for dinner sometime!"}
{"text":"Had a great dining experience at Luxe. Great food (quality ingredients well prepared and paired interestingly) and reasonable prices. Can't wait to return!

My wife and I sat at a tiny, two-seat chef's table right next to a window wall looking into the busy kitchen. Luckily we're into that, though it was a bit of a louder, high-traffic area (shown in the pics here). We could have asked for the patio, which was nice and cozy (glad we didn't though, as the smoke from the fire pit would have made us stink). 

The decor was hip and trendy, but casual - no need to really dress up and still enjoy a great meal and a nice evening out! The LIVE house DJ was cool, hip and out of the way, the music was the perfect volume...we didn't even notice him until we left, just thought it added a really classy touch.

The waiter was satisfactory, but nothing to write home about...he seemed new. However, the bartender we had when we arrived (we waited about 20 min for a table - they didn't take reservations) was great - lots of personality, friendly, and gave great personal recommendations based on what we asked about. 

The drink menu was a great way to keep our minds off of the wait, and several of the signature options sounded great (even to me, primarily a beer or wine drinker). My wife had a Luxe Margarita ($7) - an awesome blend of fresh-squeezed juices, tequilla and ice, no mixes or syrups. Well worth it. They also had some nice craft beers on tap, but I opted for a Great Lakes Octoberfest (bottle, $4.50).

We started with the cheese plate ($9) which was an abundant and filling array of fresh cheeses, crackers, tapanade, fruit, local honey, marinated garlic and several types of fresh olives. 

My wife ordered the Baked Penne ($13.50), a cup-of-soup sized bowl of penne pasta, a spicy cream sauce and a more than generous helping of Lobster. Great portion size for a small plate, any larger may have been too rich. Very tasty. 

She also ordered a small Luxe Ceasar salad ($7), served like a wedge with a large portion of romaine, pancetta, garlic, parmesean and a great house-made caesar dressing. 

I went for the entree special, Veal Short Ribs with gorganzola whipped sweet potatoes ($18.50). The short ribs were cooked perfectly and feel clean off the bone...almost reminded me of pulled pork in texture. The whipped potatoes were amazing, and the entire dish was served with a red wine glaze. Awesome. Paired well with a glass of the house merlot ($6). 

For dessert, we couldn't pass up the Creme Brulee Trio ($7?), three small ramekins filled with classic vanilla, cherry, and lavender portions. This was a perfect complement to the dishes we shared, just t he right size and sweetness. I wish I was offered a cup of coffee; by the time I thought of it, it seemed too late to bother.

Overall, the experience was great and we felt we had received a great value for about $55 (plus tip and drinks) We can't wait to return for another dinner (the burgers, pizzas and salads are very reasonably priced), or perhaps lunch or brunch."}
{"text":"Since I was attending a theater across the street I though I'd check this place out. The food is excellent! Very gourmet. The Brussels sprouts were to die for. I had the fatoosh salad. It was also great but a little on the small side (more like most places side salad) but then the dessert was more than shareable - hot, fresh beignet donuts."}
{"text":"Went here for a happy hour and ordered a pizza with mushrooms and goat cheese that was 1/2 off and tasted absolutely delicious. We tried to ordered the bogo drinks, but were informed we each had to order 2 and they had to be the same. That was slightly annoying as we each wanted a drink."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 5 stars but I don't think that is a fair assessment because I didn't try their food. 

Stopped in for drinks and sat at the bar. The atmosphere in this place is great, very trendy and romantic. It was busy. very busy for a random Thursday evening. The bartender tended to us right away and made sure we were always good with our drinks. 

Looking over the menu, I would definitely return to try out their food. Their prices seemed fair and their wine was delicious. 

Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Love Luxe.  Great food, good service and a nice atmosphere, especially in the summer when you can sit on the back porch.  Their brunch is really solid, and their dinner menu is great."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. I usually come here with a friend who is obsessed, and for good reasons. Their drinks are strong, their rotating menu is always amazing and the servers are fantastic. I recommend always asking the bar tender to make their favorite drink- no matter what they've made, it always is out of this world."}
{"text":"The decor and eggplant fries were the highlights of my experience. It was a saturday night around 6:30pm and it took about 30 minutes to get seated (no reservations). We ordered multiple appetizers (including the goat cheese fondue) which were less than impressive although i did enjoy the squash salad. The service was excellent but overall it felt like a watered down bar cento."}
{"text":"Luxe is a trendy restaurant on Detroit in Cleveland offering a full bar and a wide array of delicious dishes.  It's cool because one half of the restaurant is a bar and the other half is the restaurant.  The restaurant is small, but if you don't mind sitting close to other patrons, you'll like the atmosphere.

I've eaten at Luxe twice and the service was excellent on both occasions.  The food was very good and they offer daily dinner specials.

This is a great place to meet up with friends and have dinner before going out for a night on the town.

{"text":"Luxe is one of my favorite restaurants in the Cleveland area. The food and atmosphere have been on point every time. The only reason I am not giving a full 5 stars is because the service could be better. The wait staff usually seems unhappy and it can come off a bit rude. Aside from the staff, this place really is worth checking out."}
{"text":"I went there for happy hours. We didnt have seatings so we had to stand  by this \"bar\" area to hang out and eat. They offer $5 wine and half off pizza. I would STRONGLY recommend the short rib pizza! We ordered one first and finished it in like a split second. Then we wanted another one, then the waiter was like you know what, I'm gonna ask them to add some jalapeno to it, trust me it's going to change the entire thing. AND IT DID! It was EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE! omg I could not believe it! The waiter/bartender was so knowledgeable in terms of food, AND drinks! When I asked him what kinds of wines they have, he gave me many options and a very sophisticated comparison to other similar types. I didn't know that much about wine so he offered me some samples. He's real nice."}
{"text":"Fantastic upscale eatery in the Detroit Shoreway neighborhood.  Great place to grab dinner with friends or a date.  Excellent pizzas.  They have an amazing patio.  The service depends on who you get as your waiter - I've been there three or four times and had one very rude waiter (or perhaps he was just having a very bad evening?) and three nice, knowledgeable ones.  Highly recommended!  Worth visiting even for east siders.  Their desserts are good but I also recommend going to Sweet Moses across the street for their awesome Cleveland themed ice cream."}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe.  I feel like it is one of the most underrated places in The OC.  I was particularly impressed with their brunch specials, and their BOGO 'happy hour' on Sunday from 11-1.  This included beers, mimosas, and bloody's.  

The decor, inside and out, is stunning.  I have gained so much inspiration for my own house just looking around the patio or the inside walls and window treatments.  It's good to see that type of artistic pride in a place, and it shows in their menu as well.  

I can't wait for patio season to return-I recall an amazing happy hour.  I remember many martini glasses and small plates.  

Also, lots of classic movies play on the tv's as a mesmerizing night cap."}
{"text":"Luxe has so much potential.  It simply needs to do more of what it does well and drop the pale imitations.

THE DRINKS:  I start here because they do not take reservations for parties under 6.  So, if you are on a date, or with a few friends, you WILL start with drinks at the bar as you gaze at the empty tables that remain mysteriously unfilled despite your gnawing hunger.

There are worse fates, because the drinks are really good.  The cocktail menu is creative and fun-- not the usual list of boring girlie martinis.  I had the Bedazzled-- Chinese 5 spice powder syrup in sparkling wine.  Not too sweet and the spices built up subtley but nicely.  Mon cher chou had a vodka/ pineapple/ basil concoction that sounds like it shouldn't work but does-- really does.  The rest of our party contented themselves with a good beer and wine selection.

THE FOOD:  Ah, finally.  The small plates and appetizers are phenomenal.  The calamari was tender , with a flavorful, chunky, tomato based sauce.  The duck ragout ravioli was complex, rich but not heavy.  My crab cake was blissfully deviod of excess filler.  

After that I could not wait for the main course.  The main course, I said.  Main course?  Oh dear, there are two.  As in slightly more than one.  Neither was spectacular.  Not bad, mind you, but nowhere near the quality of the small plates.

There was pizza.  How dreadfully, dreadfully boring to wait eons for \"gourmet\" pizza.  Why does Luxe insist on focusing on something so unspectacular on its dinner menu when nearly every other hip trendy place did the very same thing ages ago and did it better?  It's not innovative.  It's not exciting.  I'll go to Bar Cento for pizza-- cheaper, better and less of a wait.  Why do this when they excell at small plates.?  Do tapas!  Do small plate combinations!  Do what you do best!!!!!

THE SERVICE:  Yes, darling, I understand when your book is published/ movie is made/ poetry is being lauded by kings/ art is appreciated I will be serving YOU.  However, in the meantime, could you at least bring me some bloody silverware !?!  Thanks, then.

The front of the house is lovely-- the hostess, bar staff and cocktail servers were very nice.

THE ATMOSPHERE:  Gorgeous.  On par with the small plates.  The place is stunning, with modern, innovative takes on tin ceilings, chandeliers and moody lighting.

So go, but just order several small plates and some lovely cocktails.  Intimate that you are a publisher or a movie producer and I am sure your service will be better."}
{"text":"I went with a large party on a Saturday night, so we did have reservations and avoided some of the overly long wait times.  Loved the decor, and found the service to be good as well.  My date and I really enjoyed our menu selections (fried chicken livers, margarita pizza, truffle fries, grilled duck sandwich), but our dining companions seemed to have a much more hit or miss experience.  I did find the DJ to be a bit loud, and the clientele to overly representative of the hipsteria americanus, but I would go back."}
{"text":"My parents were excited to take me to their new favorite place for my birthday dinner and although I asked to go to Bar Cento, I was overruled by their excitement of this new place they just went to the week before. I'm always up for new great places, so I went along. 

The decor was kinda cool and I was excited for what seemed like a diamond in the rough. Even crowded by Cleveland Sunday night standards. We did the family style thing and up first was chicken wings, a cheese plate, and a margarita pizza. The wings were spicy (which I like), but soggy and fatty. We sent them back twice to be cooked longer, but the waiter said that their wings are braised and apparently that meant that crispy wasn't going to happen. Pizza was thin crust and good, but very plain considering the rest of the restaurant screamed funky and hip. The cheese plate was boring -- a brie that was nothing special, a blue that was basic, and one other unmemorable cheese. 

For dinner we had a spread which included panko crusted salmon over Chinese beans, ahi tuna with a spicy rub, and penne pasta. The salmon was so bland I thought I had put my tongue in a cup of wax before eating it. The ahi tuna was boring but good...except we had ordered 2 for the table and the second one I honestly had mistaken for duck. It was so improperly cooked that tuna looked like duck. How can that be allowed to leave the kitchen? Saving the worst for last, the pasta was inedible. Have you ever accidentally burned a sauce on the stove? Your have a burnt layer on the bottom of the pot and you think to yourself, maybe I can save the top part--only to taste it before throwing it all out. This pasta tasted like licking the bottom of a charcoal grill. We were embarrassed to leave so much food uneaten, so we had them box it all up just to throw it out later that night. 

For dessert, a chocolate cupcake with a candle. Not worth the calories. But I got my wish: the night was over."}
{"text":"Luxe toes that fine line between \"trendy\" and \"great find\" really well.  There's a front area with seating and a long bar that leads back to a dance area...where you will find mellow ambient or house music (or remixed 80s Madonna).  In the next room, as you walk past the entrance of the kitchen you're going to be in an exposed brick dining area that's open yet intimate.

Great, very attentive service and an AWESOME late-night menu.  So often late-night places are lazy, but Luxe is not.  Come here after dinner, dancing, drinks, or a concert.  Or all 4. :-)

Really innovative drinks made by a super friendly bar staff.

DO NOT MISS: quite possibly the best beignets north of the Mason-Dixon Line.  Served for you with chocolate and caramel dipping sauces (insert contended sigh here)."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and not so sweet. Waitress was awesome, food was terrible. Only thing that was genuinely ok was the board, none of which was house made. Stuffed pork was so far overcooked the \"stuff\" changed texture to something inedible. Daily special hangar steak came cold x3. Would have made a stink for all of us except that my girlfriend was meeting my parents for the first time and didnt want the drama. Didnt help that it took 40 mins for mains to arrive. Then again, if there was a manager on duty we didnt see 'em, so not much opportunity to complain anyway.  
So...i guess dont go on sundays when the chef is off? Ive had good meals here before, but this was a pretty hard miss on the culinary front."}
{"text":"It seems like most of my thoughts on Luxe have been covered on it's many reviews.  But i would like to just say... I would like to shake the hand of whoever created this cocktail menu!  It is always very innovative and changes with every season!  Our favorite drinks in the city are from Luxe.

Drinks aren't all they do well, however.  Their beer cheese fondue is delicious!  The pizzas are also very good.  If you can make it during happy hour, you can catch a real steal - though I think it only goes until 7:00.  

We always sit in the lounge - the vibe is just cooler in there.  We've always had fantastic service.  I recommend a visit soon!"}
{"text":"I really like Luxe. They have a solid brunch and the dinner menu is well priced and inventive. The service has been good each time. My favorite meal was the beef short rib and gnocchi entree. I am pretty particular about my pizza so I didn't try it yet. I hear that the happy hour is when to try it. Gordon Square / Shoreway area is doing alright now and hopefully will be even better in the years to come. All they have to do is gentrify it and displace the current troublesome residents. That makes me think of Troublesome 96 by the late great 2Pac. What a song that is! I have to give Kasich credit for putting up the money for the Detroit-Shoreway project."}
{"text":"I had the yummiest piece of rainbow trout here!  At first I thought it looked like salmon because it looked pink and my boyfriend asked if i wanted to ask to make sure they got my order correct.  I asked if i got the right fish just out of curiosity, because i certainly had no intention of changing my dish.  It was GOOD!  The vegetables that came with it were an excellent complement and the flavors meshed very well together."}
{"text":"I went for some light bites and ordered a few things off the aptly labeled snack menu. Unfortunately I wasn't feeling the food choices I made tonight, though the atmosphere is still spot on and the staff still friendly and upbeat. 

I got three snacks:
The Bolognese Meatballs were served three in a bowl - always an awkward number for sharing. It's a small thing, but two larger or four smaller ones would be better. Anyways, they were good. I loved the meat flavor. While parmesan is only in the description and not the menu item title, it is a major part of the dish. The meatballs were sitting in a lot of parmesan cream sauce which was something I was hoping to avoid large quantities of - nearly impossible. The blistered tomato mention on the menu....I have no recollection of it. 

We tried the calamari. It was served with a side bowl of also creamy sauce. The actual plate of calamari was dry. Though I do have to say the flavor of the calamari without the sauce was good - the heavy breading clearly had some good spice mix in it. 

Finally I tried the mussels. I love mussels, but what makes them is the broth. This broth was not very plentiful and slightly bland. As mussels usually do these came with some type of bread to mop up all the sauce. The chosen bread was French fries. In my opinion this is the wrong kind of bread to choose because fries are not good at absorbing liquid sauce. Fries are good for scooping and picking up thick sauce, but not mussel broth. Fries are also kind of greasy and just really didn't seem to fit the dish at all as the broth just made them soggy. Of the three snacks this was my least favourite. Though I will say the server gets credit for brining out a side plate for the empty shells, a spoon and a tiny fork for removing the mussels - three needed things too many places overlook."}
{"text":"Luxe is literally life changing, I've lived in Cleveland for 20 years, recently moved away, while back over Christmas I went to Luxe twice in the 1 week I was home... it's that good. Brunch is always incredible, wonderful dog-friendly patio, huge portions. Dinner is to die for, the pizzas are always so good, calamari is fresh and flavorful, baked brie is always good too. Plenty of vegetarian options. Drinks are interesting, fresh, and have a good balance between having enough alcohol and tasting good. Have been over a dozen times and always had great service, friendly and attentive.  Wish that they took reservations, especially when we're bringing the dog and can't really wait around, but I usually just call right when we leave to see if there's spots open. Had to wait until I moved away to write the review, was worried it would be too busy if I did it while I was still there!"}
{"text":"Great food! Gets surprisingly loud here, so probably not the best date spot IMO. lol. But that's the only complaint. Great drinks also!"}
{"text":"I finally made it to Luxe!

We had a large group for Brunch that they accommodated well. Everyone's meal was fantastic, with the exception of my overcooked eggs (I am not one to complain). Another huge perk is 1/2 priced Bellini's till 1. 

I can't wait to come back to check out the dinner menu & patio I've hear so much about!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  Gorgeous dog-friendly patio.  Interesting things on the menu.  We tried it on Wed night, but the live music was so obnoxiously loud that we left.  The waitress was pretty bitchy too.  My husband tried to talk to her, and she walked away.  Maybe we'll try it again sometime, maybe we won't.  Our first impression was not great, and the music sucked.  Even if it would have been at a normal tone."}
{"text":"2.5 stars simply because of the service. The waiter continually forgot my appetizer and as I kept reminding him his response was \"let me go check on that\". Entrees came out at all different times. Food is good but extremely disappointed in the service. Not a great place to go for a birthday."}
{"text":"4+

I'm really surprised not to see Luxe rated higher.  It's definitely the best restaurant in Gordon Square, and consistently so.  I simply love it for Happy Hour: you can get an absolutely tantalizing portobello & goat cheese pizza for only $8 (actually all the pizzas are pretty darn delicious).  I also highly (highly, I say) recommend Luxe for Sunday brunch.  They have an amazing array of mimosas made with a nice, crisp Spanish Cava.  The Eggs Benedict, French Toast, and Brie/Mushroom Omelet are also as perfect as can be.   

Here's a rundown of some of the other dishes I've had during my many visits:

Veal-stuffed olives ($9)--a definitely adventurous, but esoteric combo that may put off some, please others. 

Fried brussel sprouts ($5.50)--not as good as the brussels at Bier Markt, but ranks up there. 

Mussels ($12.50)--the miso mussels at Dante have a more flavorful broth, but this dish is a safe bet for shellfish lovers.

Duck spring rolls ($10)--a little sweet for my tastes, but definitely worth a try during Happy Hour at 1/2 price. 

Potato Gnocchi ($15.50)--heavenly! and it comes with braised short ribs--what more can I say? 

**I also want to put in a hip-hip hooray for the Luxe staff--they are some of the nicest, friendliest restaurant people in town--pitch-perfect in how much attention they give to diners."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed with my trips to Luxe.  Well...sometimes I'm disappointed by my check, but that's more because of me wanting to stay there half the day, not because of value.  

Typically I hit up Luxe's brunch which offers delectable options, drinks and there is a buy one get one happy hour (ahem, why I stay there half the day).  

Their patio is phenomenal and the wait staff is always attentive.  In fact, last night our very patient waiter was always there when we needed him and was understanding when we didn't.  

For typical meals I typically order the pizza, which is delicious and last night I tried the fondue for the first, and not last time!  I was so full on fondue that my dreams of dancing gnocci turned to a single slice of pizza.  Oops?  It was just so delicious and Adam DID bring out extra bread.

Thinking about it now, I'm really wishing I'm missing my warm pretzel fondue bites!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say that I gave lux yet another try and yet again I was greatly disappointed. Service was horribly slow and wasn't willing to answer questions. Food wasn't prepared correctly and when an objection was brought to light the server looked at us like we were from Mars. I love the space and the atmosphere but it's sadly enough on my \"do not return to\" list"}
{"text":"Second time at Luxe....and was not disappointed.  For an appetizer, definitely get the cheese fondue, with pretzels.  Huge portion, and realllllly yum!  
Feature of the night was hanger steak, which was perfectly done, seasoned and served with a delicious potato and guyere side w/ asparagus.  
Atmosphere is really nice, but not pretentious.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner one day after work with fellow Yelpers Darren R, Dan S, and a large group of our close friends.  Some of us got there a little early and were able to partake in their happy hour drink specials at the patio bar, while we waited for everyone to arrive.  Their beer specials are good, but they're only available at the patio bar...lame. 

We had a reservation for a table on the patio and it was a great, pleasant dining experience.  Their patio is really a nice place to enjoy a good meal, especially with the gorgeous weather we had that evening.
Our server was attentive and we didn't have to wait too long for our entrées to arrive after ordering.  I decided on the Beef Short Ribs with Ricotta Gnocchi after reading P W's review and holy toledo, he was right!  It was absolutely delicious!  The fresh gnocchi was pillowy soft and creamy, cooked just right and the short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth super tender!  I let Dan S and his wife each try a piece of gnocchi and they also enjoyed it. Darren R had a burger which looked really good and and Dan had a pizza, which he said was da bomb yo!  (yeah, he still talks like that in public...)
Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals, even though I couldn't see what my friends down at the other end of the table had ordered.  

It was a great night for all and I'd definitely come back again to try some other tasty morsels! I heard their brunch is worth checking out. 
Great food, cold drinks, and cool company! Come spend some bucks at Luxe! You'll love it! Cheers, Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Luxe in years but I saw the menu and was excited to go there for our anniversary celebration.  Cocktails were unique but with a classic feel to them. I ordered the Joy, whiskey with cherry purée. With Ribeye 13 oz. I didn't need a starter or salad. The steak was cooked a perfect Med rare and potatoes and beans rounded it out nice. My wife had the Opah, a swordfish like fish.  I had a taste and it was great. Our friends were with us and they had a great time. Service and ambiance were excellent. Bathroom was private and clean. Still one of my favorite restaurants in Gordon square."}
