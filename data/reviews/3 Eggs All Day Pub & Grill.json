{"text":"Quite a large menu with everything from Montreal smoked meat eggs benny to chicken & waffles to liver & onions!  Small street-front but plenty of tables inside. Very friendly staff. Decent food and generous portions. Like the name, everything seems to come with 3 eggs (even the benny)."}

{"text":"Went to 3 Eggs restaurant for dinner. 3 Eggs restaurant is an all day pub and grill restaurant that tried to do everything. They serve breakfast dishes, regular diner dishes like hamburgers and pastas. They are also a full bar that sell cheap beer. The waitress was very nice.  3 Eggs restaurant is nicely decorated restaurant with plenty of seats available. The first two times, I was here, the restaurant was completely empty. This time there were more people and the place felt more like a bar than a restaurant.  I ordered the Cajun calamari and the Jambalaya pasta dishes. The calamari was not that great. It was covered with breading and deep fried. There was not much flavor to it. The Jambalaya pasta was a huge dish that I could not finished eating. It was also very spicy more spicy than any other restaurants where I have eaten Jambalaya pasta. I needed a lot of water to finish to eat it.  Would I got back to 3 Eggs restaurant? I have been here three times already and the food is just okay. It is close to where I live and I will probably return."}
