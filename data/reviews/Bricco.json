{"text":"I've enjoyed every visit to Bricco. It's our favorite place to grub before Playhouse Square events. We usually make reservations as soon as we get tickets to an event, and they've accommodated reservations five months out.

The full and complete \"martini\" menu is matched only by the breadth of pizza selections. We usually get an appetizer and a pizza, and have plenty to take home.

We've had nothing but sparkling service, and have taken note of who to request when making our reservation."}
{"text":"We had terrific dinners and excellent, caring servers every time we've eaten there before Play House shows. Don't understand where the not-so-good reviews are coming from. Terry P."}
{"text":"Disappointing at best.  I should have known something was wrong when I couldn't get the busboy to bring some water to the table. 
The server was inattentive, and did not want to be bothered. The food was mediocre at best.
  Couldn't get my coffee topped off, or water glass refilled.  The goat cheese and 'spicy' marinara tasted like it was created by a freshman home economics student.  The peppers and chorizo  over the fettuccini were lukewarm and the server never did come back.  Only when she saw me put my coat on, did she make a move towards the table to ask if I wanted a box.  I told her no, just my check.  Then she got snotty when I asked her for an itemized check (expenses).  Had I not had the experience of working as a tipped employee, I probably would not have tipped her.  
I do know how to fix that- NOT return."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Bricco today, after not having been there for a while, and was extremely disappointed. I won't be back. First off, the service was desultory. The wait staff had no sense of pace or timing, rushing us at first, and then ignoring us when we were ready to order. They then brought the entrees one minute after delivering the salads, crowding the table and forcing us to rush through both courses side-by-side. The food was an even bigger disappointment. The bread had the look, soft texture and bland taste of store-bought. Okay for the denture crowd, but not for fine dining. The salads--one caesar and one tomato and mozzarella over greens--were lackluster. The caesar dressing was indistinguishable from bland, generic dressings, and the greens were ordinary. The tomatoes in the second salad were hard and flavorless--this at the height of the summer tomato season. Somebody in the kitchen isn't paying attention to seasonal produce. The mozzarella was the right color, but flavorless. The entrees--a strip steak wrap and a crab cake sandwich (on a store bought roll)--looked and tasted as if they had been prepared the night before and heated in the microwave. In fact, after eating this food, I expected to look back in the kitchen and see only refrigerators and microwaves, but nobody actually cooking. The fries that came with the crab cake sandwich were greasy and flaccid, as if they had stood under the heat lamp for too long; they probably microwave these, too, which is why they were limp and not crisp. I think the waiter knew the food was crummy, because he was afraid to come and ask us how the meals were while we were eating. His trainee finally came and asked us, and we told him. He brought us some fresh fries, but they weren't much better than the others. He actually cared about what we thought and apologized; he won't be working there much longer. There are many, many alternative choices in downtown Cleveland, including the excellent Cowell & Hubbard a block away. That's where I'm going from now on."}
{"text":"Excellent food, drinks were amazing and strong! Service was good a well. I came just as everyone was emptying out for a show across the street so it was all ours after. Good drinks too!"}
{"text":"True disappointment - they don't support Cleveland so why should Cleveland support them?  Staff is most unprofessional led by people who should never speak to people...so rude....there are so many better independent restaurants run by chefs/owners/management that get it walk a few blocks - you'll find plenty of options. Truly avoid unless you want sub par food served by those that clearly couldn't get jobs elsewhere.

Take a walk up the street there are plenty of other well run independent restaurants with great food - but hey, if you're starving - there's a subway in the next building - go there - it's better than their salads with wilty lettuce or half cooked food and poor service."}
{"text":"Was in town over the weekend and group of us stopped by for a quick lunch.  We all thoroughly enjoyed our food.  Everything was reasonably priced as well.  I personally had the Salmon BLT on a croissant and I would definitely order it again if the chances ever comes up."}
{"text":"The calamari here is AMAZING, I would say the best I've ever had.  It comes with chorizo, banana peppers, red peppers and a creamy sauce.  It's got just the right amount of kick to it.  
The pizza is also great, we always get the chorizo sausage, italian sausage and prosciutto and you can choose a spicy marinara or roasted garlic alfredo sauce.  We get the alfredo sauce and the spicy marinara on the side for dipping.  It's very filling and at $13 to split, definitely affordable for eating out downtown.  
It also doesn't hurt that it's practically across the street from my apartment (Statler Arms).
If you're a wine drinker (which I am), the wine selection here is pretty bad.  The three or four that I've tried have all been lack luster at best.
I will be sad to see it go.  The owners announced that they will be closing in April and concentrating on the three restaurants they have in Akron.  If you're thinking about going here, I definitely recommend it before they close!"}
{"text":"Recently went to Bricco, and was underwhelmed. Our party of four were having a light meal of appetizers. I settled on the goat cheese and spicy marinara with pita toasts. What a rip off for $7. Server told me the goat cheese was under the marinara. When I looked for it I barely found any.  Very disappointing. The marinara was spicy as advertised, and good. The small triangular pita bread pieces were warm. Couldn't finish them. Guess pita bread in its' abundance is cheaper to serve than goat cheese. The table bread, to start out our meal, was average at best. Friend wasn't wowed by the mushroom soup she had. Pizza that was ordered by remaining dinner companions was very good. A generous wine pour too-$4.50 for a glass of house cabernet. I'd recommend those items. Bricco is very pretty inside with great proximity to theatres. Wish that it would do some tweaking. It could be really great."}
{"text":"Bricco is in a good neighborhood in Downtown Cleveland. Right across the street from Playhouse Square and down the street from Cleveland State University. But that is the best part about it.

The service is not terrible but if you do not look like you belong you might get ignored. This makes the atmosphere seem very pretentious. Even though it has a pretentious, semi-upscale environment, the food is pretty good. I would have to see it is no better then say Olive Garden or a similar place. I order a pasta meal that came out quite fast.

Overall I would save yourself and expensive meal that you will be wondering \"why was this so expensive\" and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Good eats at a good location across the street from Playhouse square.  They actually have a small theater located in the back.  The appatizers   are very good.  The food is HUGE portions.  I had a buffalo chicken sandwich and it was spicy good.  Other salads and pizza at our table looked good."}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Poor service. Overpriced. Terrible vegan options.

I ordered the vegetable ravioli. They messed up my order, and put the wrong sauce on the pasta (which the waitress said came from a box). There were only about six ravioli on the plate, and they were swimming in sauce. I would have complained to the waitress, but she never returned except to drop off the check.

I've heard that the pizza is better, but I don't care enough to go back and check."}
{"text":"I have been disappointed so many times at Bricco, and I'm so bummed because it's such a convenient location for lunch. Yesterday we thought we'd give it one more chance (even though we thought it had closed last month). We ordered salads thinking that there wasn't much that could go wrong. They were awful (almost inedible). It was a plate with huge pieces of lettuce, bagged cheese and a chicken breast plopped on top. The dressing tasted like it cam from a bottle. Really, I wish the place would just close and let another restaurant take over."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best. Over-priced for the quality (just head west a few blocks and you will pay the same for a gourmet entree) and it is clear that the only reason the restaurant is still surviving is due to its location. I could go into details about the dishes we had but there really is no reason. Our server appeared occasionally, never to check back on the food or fill our water glasses. Mediocrity rules here at Bricco."}
{"text":"i am not from the Cleveland area, and finding out that the night life in the city is a little quiet around dinner time was a little disturbing coming from Chicago.  We ask the receptionist at the Double Tree where we should dine, and she recommended Bricco.  I loved the set up of the restaurant, and they seated us in one of those nice old school giant booths in the back. It is perfect when you want to keep your kids from running all over the place.  I had the scallops and shrimp over a bacon infused risotto that was to die for.  The scallops were perfectly cooked and litterally melted in my mouth with each bite."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that the Akron branches are setting the standard for this restaurant.  The salad was fantastic, the bread was nice.  The main courses were flavorless and unimpressive.  Our waitress was cold and lacked a service attitude.  She was even more cold when we told her we were there for an 8 pm show.   It's sad, since it's so close to the theater district, but we'll find somewhere else to eat before shows.
Overall, very unimpressive and overpriced."}
{"text":"A place we use for lunch every month or so - it is convenient - and it never fails to disappoint.  The execution is institutional at best, the menu uninspired, and there are very few, if any, healthy options for dining.

I had a chicken caesar salad today - the dressing was insipid, the chicken tough, dry and overcooked.  The addition of a roasted pepper was decidedly odd and added nothing but did help the blandness of the plate.  The menu advertised shaved parmesan - there was a little shaved parmesan in the otherwise tasteless dressing, but it was of very poor quality.  

My kids do enjoy it before the theater for the (overpriced) pizzas, but it is common food at best and not a dining experience."}
{"text":"with all the crazy construction on euclid and e9, it's hard to tell which businesses are still open, and which ones are gone for good.  you would never think, in the midst of that chaos, a business would be opening.  but you would be mistaken.  like i was.  like a fool.  yep.  mistaken.

out of the construction rubble and in time for the theatre rush, a local restaurant out of akron, bricco, has opened its doors.  it's where the old hickerson's used to be, across from the state and the palace, and next to starbucks.  this hip, new dining joint opened a few weeks ago  (i think), and they offer a unique dining experience a part of the  normal offerings in the area.

there's star across the way, an upscale eatery where your waiters sing for your supper.  there's otto moser's, where the grease is plentiful and your stomach doesn't thank you afterwards.  but somewhere in between (but closer to star), bricco offers a upscale dining option with a whole lot of trendy thrown in the mix.  

it's open during the day for \"the major lunch rush\" (tm 2008), and at night the kitchen stays open pretty late for the after -show crowd.  it very well may be the only deal in this part of town that is.  they offer the traditional american faire with a twist.  lots of gourmet pizzas (or \"phunky pizza\" as they say).  i tried a spicy sausage one.  they weren't kidding on the spicy.  holy candy craps, that tore open some taste buds.

lots of different entrees, from duck or scallops to steak and crab cakes.  a lot of pizza offerings.   sandwiches to gnaw at and salads that are apparently pretty large.

desserts- molten.chocolate.lava.  it's not the traditional molten cake where you cut into it and the lava pours.  it's more a gooey ooey piece of chocolate heaven with raspberries drizzled on top.

yes, please.  sign my ass up for that.  my yoga teacher thanks you.

overall, this is a welcomed change to the landscape of playhouse square.  good for before a show or after, lunch during the day, or happy hour with co-workers.
big martini list.  BIG.

let's see more stuff like this popping up in the land of cleve.  it'd do us some good."}
{"text":"It is nice to see a business opening up in downtown Cleveland. With so many leaving its nice to see something new. The interior is very nice decorated and reminds you of a trendy bistro in NYC. The service was good but they were sticklers for reservations even when we were early and the dining room was empty. The beet salad is good but a little skinny on the beets. The spinach ravioli with roasted red pepper cream sauce was excellent. An appetizer that is a must try is the fried pita beard and goat cheese. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Bricco: fun, taaasty, nice waitress

*GOAT CHEESE AND SPICY MARINARA SERVED WITH FRIED PITA BREAD (soooo yummy!)"}
{"text":"Bricco had delicious food, but terrible service.  On Tues Oct 12 around 7pm we dined at Bricco right before our 8pm show at Playhouse square.  The hostess was courteous and friendly, the bar staff was speedy and accommodating, and the food was absolutely delicious.  However, our female server was so incredibly rude, I was quite surprised that she was employed by Bricco.  She arrived to our table asking if we would like more cocktails - we had drinks from the bar while waiting for our table.  I said we were OK on our drinks for now, and asked if we could order dinner, she rolled her eyes and in an unprofessional curt manner her exact reply was: \"I guess so.\"  Puzzled by her response, I then asked: \"Is it OK if we order dinner now?\", and she shrugged her shoulders.  My friend asked if our bar tab could be transfered to our table, and the rude server shot back: \"No, you have to close out at the bar.\"  I understand that some restaurants have this policy, but never in my life have I been borderline yelled at by a server when inquiring about the bar tab.  My party was so surprised with the server's angry response, my friend went back to the bar to order another round of cocktails instead of ordering more drinks from our tactless server.  Our dinners arrived, and when we asked for the check, our server didn't respond at all.  Moments later she did drop off our bill.  After a long time, fearful that our server would not return, I got up and looked for our server to see if she would bring us our change.  She was no where to be found.  Finally she appeared, we paid our bill, and she did bring us change.  I would like to dine at Bricco again and hope the other servers are more professional."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre.  Not good enough to out weigh the AWFUL service.  Our female server was very inattentive.  It took 20 minutes for us to get our drinks, which granted, may not have been our servers fault.  However, she never came by to reassure us that we were not forgotten.

When it came time to place our dinner order, a couple of people in our group ordered the salmon.  Our server looked at them and said, \"Which salmon are you ordering?\"  Mind you, there is only one salmon dish in the entree section of the menu.  The only other menu item that you could order with salmon is a salad.  It took 30 minutes for us to get our dinners.  Most of us did not have time to finish our meals because we had tickets for a play across the street.

When we asked for our tabs, we brought to her attention that we were kind of in a hurry since it took so long to get our meals and her response was, \"If I didn't have any other tables to serve, I would have loooved to have spent my entire evening waiting on you.\"

I don't know if all of the servers at this restaurant are equally bad or if it's the same female server that all of the other reviewers have had the misfortune of suffering but save yourself the hassle and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Richtig tolles italo-amerikanisches Restaurant im Theaterviertel Clevelands. Tolles Essen, super Service und eine exorbitante Bierkarte von lokalen und internationalen Brauereien. Alles zu einem günstigen Preis in schönem Ambiente."}
{"text":"My family and I are in Cleveland for the weekend and we're looking for a nice casual place to eat with good food (obviously). My mother got a recommendation from the hotel concierge for Bricco, which was two blocks down the street. I'm not sure if the hotel gets a kick-back for the recommendation, but please think twice before going to Bricco.The menu reads fantastic, but don't be fooled. I would love to see this menu at a place that cared more about tasting good rather than sounding good. 

I checked out the other reviews and followed their advice. No duck. No calamari. Stick with the pizza. Try the veal. Have a caesar salad to start. 

We asked the waitress how big the pizzas were in case we wanted to share with each other. This was the response:
\"Well, we can cut it in 4, 6, or 8 pieces\"
I'm sorry... what!?!? Did you just tell me that the SIZE of the pizza I'm about to order depends on the number of slices you cut it into? 
Obviously she didn't pass fractions class in middle school. My two little bros, who are in 7th and 9th grade, were making fun of her just as bad as the adults. So if she didn't pass fractions, then did she pass properties of circles class? 
My mom asks, \"What would you say the diameter of the pizza is?\"
The response?
\"Medium.\"
Oh, this is just putting fuel on the fire of laughter at the table. 

I know that a restaurant's review shouldn't depend solely on the waitstaff since other patrons may not have the same server, but I think you can understand I needed to get that out (that and the fact my mom was annoyed because the waitress kept calling her 'sweetheart').

On to the food...

We got the garlic bread and a caesar salad to share on the table. The garlic bread wasn't very garlic-y, possibly because the bread is topped with tomatoes and tons of cheese. I wouldn't recommend this if you're craving that garlic sensation. I wouldn't recommend the caesar salad either. The dressing was drowning the salad (horrible for the calorie conscience) and didn't taste great to boot. 

I got the veal parm entree which comes with linguini. It was a good portion and was pretty tasty. So if you are going to Bricco then just get this and save the risk of something else. My youngest brother got the salmon with orzo. Salmon wasn't bad, a little over seasoned, but the orzo lacked any real flavor. My other brother got shrimp linguini in alfredo sauce. The alfredo sauce was very thick, and you only get FOUR shrimp, but my brother liked it nonetheless. My step-father got a veggie pizza with mushrooms, artichokes, tomatoes, onions. My mother got a tomato, basil, and mozzerella pizza. The same complaint for both was the first piece is good when the pizza crust is still crispy. After the first slice, the oil makes the crust extremely soggy and very difficult to eat. The pizza comes in 4 slices, so take our waitress's advice and get it cut into 8 slices. WARNING: THIS WILL NOT CHANGE THE SIZE OF YOUR PIZZA

Restaurant itself was very nice and clean. Presentation was not their downfall. 

Pass on Bricco, read some other reviews, and find the other hidden gems in Cleveland. 

Until next time, happy eating!"}
{"text":"The beet salad is a staple in my Cleveland lunch routine. It's great as is, but extra satisfying with shrimp.

Anything else on the menu? Not so sure. Also, the atmosphere is pretty lackluster compared to Cleveland's other dining gems."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner before going over to Playhouse Theater to see Anything Goes!  My veal parmesan was outstanding as was my bacon and spinach salad.  The wine list was made to order for a nice meal with friends. Best of all - our bill with a shared bottle of wine - just over $50 per couple. What a gem - good food, reasonable, good atmosphere and covenient."}
{"text":"Had my brother-in-law's birthday party here. The decor is lovely and the place is right opposite the Playhouse, and that's where all the good stuff ends. 
The service was inattentive, the food mediocre. We got the tomato bisque and turns out that the vegetable ravioli's \"pink sauce\" was our tomato soup.
O_o

We were a total of about 50 people seated on two different long tables. One table hardly had any of the drinks replenished while the other one had to wait over an hour just to get the appetizers. The only thing that saved this place was that we all had good company, can't imagine going back there for a nice, cozy diner."}
{"text":"Bricco was recommended to us by our hotel staff. I got a drink and on the martini glass was a leftover lipstick mark from the last guest. I let the waiter know. He acted as disgusted as I was but for some reason I was STILL charged. Not ok. I had the shrimp fettuccine. It was OK. The shrimp was supposedly sautéed. My husband had the veal Parmesan. He didn't care for it. We did enjoy the fried dill pickles appetizer. That's about it."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by the hotel where we were staying at. Should have smelt something suspicious as soon as the front desk served up a copy of their menu. I think they are in co-hoots.

The place is nicely decorated with faux marble, Venetian plastered walls, nice bar.

Our waiter recommended the restaurant's special entree...\"Duck prepared daily, cooked to perfection medium-rare\"...Not! 

On their first attempt, the duck breast came out like how you would cook a pork chop...until it's white and well done. Sent it back

Their 2nd attempt, i was able to bounce a quarter off the breast and could barely cut into the meat. Raw! I mean really raw! Bloody raw! Did I mention it was raw?

The manager came out to apologized and said that this was one of their best dishes. Seriously? Then why can't you cook it right? Lost my appetite and just asked for the check."}
{"text":"Hubby and I dined here for the first time before seeing one of our favorite authors at PlayHouse Square.  Our waiter did a fine job of catering to my dietary needs, and we ate like kings.  I can't get that roasted duck breast out of my mind."}
{"text":"Food was very good.  Service was excellent,  drinks were good .  I had stuffed peppers which were outstanding !  My salad which was fresh mozzarella slices over vine ripen to tomatoes was good but to heavy on the balsamic vinegar.   It lacked true italian atmosphere and that brought  my rating down by a full star ."}
{"text":"I was privy to Bricco today via the generosity of a coworker of mine.  I wasn't really sure what to expect as I never heard of it.  It sounded like a hipster posh pretentious joint however it was nothing of the sort.  Upon arrival and entry my immediate impression was that this was upscale classy and probably going to be unaffordable.  There were 2 main dining areas, one more fancy and another more laid back high top tables.  We were seated in the fancier booth like area.  Upon looking at the menu I realized the prices were nothing like what I thought they were going to be.  Burgers were about $7-8 per piece as were appetizers and entrees.  All around good prices.  My coworkers and I chose what we wanted and ordered.  We made chit chat.  Appetizers of fried pickles were quickly brought out.  There were 8 fried pickles in the shape of a \"chip\".   Lightly sweet pickles inside a well seasoned bread crumb covering topped with fresh parmesan.  We quickly ate this and then we made some more chit chat, and then some more chit chat.  I started to wonder what was going on with our food.  But the fellowship was enjoyable and atmosphere comfortable.  When the food came out it was very tasty.  I was able stick to my health (ier) eating plan as I got buffalo chicken salad sandwich with green beans.  I was really pleased.  Unexpected tasty lunch.  I will say however service lacked a little bit...drink refills were slow and we weren't checked in on to see if we were ok without food (which the group was as a whole).  I would come back as everything but the service was good."}
{"text":"I have been a handful of times when I worked in the Hanna Building. Service was always slow and never equipped for take out. I'm not even mentioning the food, because it was not memorable."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy Bricco. Both the Akron and Cleveland spots are great go-to's. 

Perfect spot before a show at Play house square. 

Yummy pizza options. Fun cocktails. and AMAZING tomato artichoke soup.  Good, decently priced menu options."}
{"text":"I love coming to Bricco when I'm in the mood for some trendy Italian. This place is perfect to come on a date or with friends. The inside decor is really hip and artsy but they keep a somewhat casual feel to the place. It is a little fancier than say, an Olive Garden but not super fancy, you can wear a nice pair of jeans here. 

The food is great, I'd recommend the appetizer with the goat cheese marinara dip and fried pita pieces (not sure of the actual name), it's delicious. For a main course, I've gotten the pizza a few times, the four cheese pizza is SO GOOD! I've also ordered Ravioli here (I think it was pumpkin) and it was good but I don't think they have it on the menu anymore unfortunately. 

Another awesome thing about Bricco -- their bar is fully stocked and they make pretty stiff mixed drinks. They get the job done! 

Although I've never tried any of their specials they always sound good, I just can't stray away from that pizza, it's too amazing. However all the food is really creative, mixing things that you wouldn't find anywhere else which is one of the things I love most about this place."}
{"text":"Worst $60 meal I've ever had.

Short opinion: stick to the pizza

Long opinion:
I've gone to Bricco twice before with pleasant results.  I've had a couple pizzas there, as well as the veal parmigiana. Quite good, as is their presentation of a Caesar Salad

Today Bricco jumped the shark.  It was HORRIBLE.

We ordered an appetizer billed as Calamari with Peppers ($9).  What we got was a plate of sliced peppers dotted occasionally with a few bits of seriously undercooked calamari.  See it here:
http://twitpic.com/k0wen

Our entrees were the \"Linguine with Shrimp and Alfreedo\" ($14) and the \"Seared Scallops and Shrimp with Apple-Bacon Risotto\"  ($22)

The linguine came in a decent Alfredo.. with THREE shrimp.  No lie. 

The Scallops and Shrimp were appalling - the sauce chosen for the seafood was a horrid combination with the risotto, and the risotto was uncooked in the middle and mush on the outside.  To top off this delightful combo I got a side of broccoli that was ALL BLACK all over the stems.  See it here:
http://twitpic.com/k0xz2 (this photo barely shows the grossness of the broccoli)

This ENTIRE meal should have been sent back to the kitchen.  I just hate to \"be that person\" - but in hindsight I really should have...

Stick to the pizza - if I ever go back, that's all I'm risking.  This was FAR too much money for such poorly executed food..."}
{"text":"I was really bummed out to see that Bricco is closing this April. I LOVE coming here before shows at the Playhouse. 

My favorite thing on the menu is the beet salad - I love that you can get a half size of any of the salads. All of the pastas are delicious, as well. I have also ordered the daily duck special on a couple different occasions (prepared differently each day). Always delicious!

I definitely plan on going as much as possible between now and their closing date. The Akron locations are great, too."}
