{"text":"This USED to be my favorite pizza spot in Vegas. Not anymore. The previous owners sold it. The owner assured me that nothing changed with the pizza. Not true. It tastes completely different. I bueno."}
{"text":"Have to say my family and I really like how it's so cheesy especially the crust very good first time there n great customer service .."}
{"text":"These guys know how to make a pizza and make you feel special!  The crust is unbeatable and all the homemade touches are noticeable and delicious.   Highly recommend - one of the best pies in town!!"}
{"text":"Very bad customer service. The owner is the only one running the place. He was so rude to me and my husband. I give it 3 stars because the food is very good. I got the special, cheese pizza and wings $23.99. The wings are especially delicious but I unfortunately will not be returning. Barros is just as good and only a couple more miles away."}
{"text":"Very delicious, reheats well. You really cannot ask for more from a local pizza joint!"}
{"text":"Just picked up my first pizza from Bruno's. WOW!!! Best pizza EVER and great service! The crust is amazing and the sauce is yummy! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very dirty restaurant. Bathrooms filthy , soda fountain hasn't been cleaned in years. Kids running the place did nothing to clean up. We were the only people in there. Used to be pretty good. Won't be back until they clean up the place."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Bruno is probably the nicest guy ever. He'll do anything to ensure you enjoy your meal. Definitely give this place a shot."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Wish I had read the reviews before going there. I called my order in and was quoted 20minutes. I ran some errands and had some ice in my car which I thought would be fine given the time frame. I got there to pick up my order 30 minutes after I called it in. I was never greeted by anyone, so I stood at the counter. After standing there a few minutes a man from the back with a thick accent yelled for me to \"have a seat\", so I did and about 10 minutes later he came and told me my order was done. I asked for peppers for the pizza and he seemed annoyed, didn't say a word grabbed some and threw them on top. I tried paying using my debit card, and he told me \" I wish you had cash\", at this point I was done I got my card and walked out. I can't speak for the food here but the service is AWFUL. I will never go back. I'll take my business to Tail gaters."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  I am a fan of the Real Deal pizza. My wife loves margherita pizza and I like sausage and onion.  We get a pizza that is 100% margherita and 50% sausage and onion and we're both great.  All crusts are excellent.  The Mediterranean rub wings are outstanding. People, service, delivery are all top notch."}
{"text":"Nice people. Very friendly.  Provided some free garlic sticks while I waited for my pizza.  I took advantage of some website coupon deal to get a large pepperoni pizza for around $10 (dine in only).    While the pizza was worth $10, I would've felt a little ripped off had I paid the normal price (closer to $18 I believe).  The dough is very good (which is supposedly what they are known for), but the sauce, cheese and pepperoni toppings -- I found them all to be similar to what you would get from a made fresh  pizza you get at a grocery store or one of the wholesale club places.  While there is no such thing as bad pizza, there is pizza that is just \"so-so\" such that I don't really have any desire to go back and order it again on a regular basis.  Such is the case here."}
{"text":"We were visiting the area and googled Bruno's pizza. The pizza showed up in 30 mins and was delicious. Lots of fresh ingredients. Definitely will order again. I kept the employee on hold for five minutes while I looked up our address and he never seemed impatient. The delivery guy was personable and friendly. Plus they sent a box of complimentary bread sticks. Yum!"}
{"text":"Bruno seems like he hates his life and provides horrible service. When you ask for ranch he gets his underpants in a bunch and retrieves you the ranch which he charges for.... Pizza's good tho."}
{"text":"We have tried every pizza place in Hampton / Gibsonia area .  Bruno's is the best. Family owned business- they are very nice and have a very nice place."}
{"text":"A great choice in the area for good food at a reasonable price. They do dine-in, take out, and delivery. Garlic knots are a must have with any pizza. They also have a wide selection of pastas and sandwiches! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"We ordered the cheesy garlic bread and the real deal pizza (sub ham for sausage) with original crust.  I enjoyed every bite!! The cheesy garlic bread was good with a hint of garlic and good layer of yummy cheese! Also, enjoyed it because it wasn't greasy at all, sometimes restaurants put too much butter on the bread, making it soggy- this wasn't the case.  I enjoyed the pizza sauce that came with it too, thick and fresh!  The pizza was very good too- fresh toppings, good amount of cheese, liked the sauce, and tasty, light crust.  Live in the NW but when I'm in the area, I'll swing by again.  Thanks for a good dinner!"}
{"text":"Just move to the area, found this on here. Let's just say it's amazing one of the best pizza places I have tried. The \"Real deal\" a must try, now the best part they have a groupon!!!!!!"}
{"text":"They delivered to my hotel, and exceeded my expectations.  The pizza was excellent...loaded with toppings.  Their crust was amazing as was their service.  They brought me plates, cups, and napkins....they were very prepared.  Would definately order from them again when in town."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I've had. Amazing crust! The owner are staff are super friendly and take pride in their food. This place won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the Best Sauce and sausage!  The ingredients are always fresh!  Our family has been eating Bruno's Pizza for over 30 years - we were excited to see them open a location in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Don't have the slightest concern this place can not be seen from the street (unless you have X-ray vision like superman).  It's well worth the stop!  Very good pizza: fresh, fine ingredients, made with care.  And, the Caesar crisp/cold...........and they make their own dressing need I say more?  Priced well!  Comfortable atmosphere...Family business we should support.  Jimi says check it out!"}
{"text":"First time here with two little boys my 5 yo boy and his 9yo friend. We just came from Flipnout extreme and this was the closest dine in pizza place we could find. Very happy we came here. The I think manager or owner was very polite and friendly with us making us feel welcome. The pizza we ordered, a small half cheese and pepperoni and garlic bread, was very good!  Overall, we would come again. :)"}
{"text":"The owner of this place is a no-nonsense entrepreneur. The pizza is definitely New York style. Like the kind that you would buy by the slice in New York City. The prices are good, and the taste is really nice. This is a no-frills restaurant. The only drawback of this place is that the girls at the register have no idea what they're doing for the most part, and are constantly either talking to each other or playing on their cell phones. But I am willing to deal with that for really good pizza."}
{"text":"Great new pizza place! This will def be our new favorite spot! The pizza wasn't greasy at all, perfect cheese to sauce proportions. The cheesy garlic bread is to die for. Phenomenal customer service! It's a must try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered a small real deal pizza for delivery. The pizza dough was raw & undercooked. Can't say that I will be a repeat customer after this experience."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and great customer service. The pizza is so good...I think the crust is what sold me. It's not heavy even though it's packed pick toppings and flavors. Great place and awesome food."}
{"text":"Bomb spot! Everything here is good! The wings are always fresh. Probably the best ranch. Pizzahut dominos an all the other pizza joints have nothing on brunos!"}
{"text":"After reading a newspaper article about Bruno's New York style pizza our family had to give it a try. We are huge fans of traditional New York style pizza and have been looking for a quality slice here in Pittsburgh since we moved here six years ago.  Ordered a large cheese and a medium pepperoni along with small order of garlic wings and cheesy breadsticks. I ordered at 6:25 PM and arrived at seven after being told it would be ready in 25 minutes. The order was still in the oven. I ran a couple errands for about 15 minutes and then came back and it was ready. The owner who I assume was Bruno was very apologetic and even gave me a free 2 L of pop to apologize. Handled it very professionally. Unfortunately the pizza did not meet our expectations and we found it very average.  The sauce did not have a ton of flavor and everything just seemed very simple. The cheesy breadsticks were very good along with the marinara sauce. If this place was closer to our house I might give it another try but cannot recommend it based on our expectations."}
{"text":"What an awesome surprise to learn that my all-time favorite pizza place from my hometown (South Bend, IN) had opened up a location here in Las Vegas. Visited tonight for the first time and was not disappointed. I was fearful it wouldn't match my memories, but they really nailed it, especially their unique dough and the family recipe sausage. Met the staff and they were awesome and treated me and my friends as if I was back in my hometown again.  If you long for the real pizza stylings of the Midwest/Chicago/Great Lakes region, make a point to visit Bruno's and enjoy the great food and friendly atmosphere. If you've only known pizza from the West Coast/Las Vegas, do yourself a favor and give Bruno's a try and taste pizza that is founded on quality ingredients, culinary skills, and the passion of the family that created it! A big thank you to the staff for making me feel at home."}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza I've had in Vegas.  The mozzaralla is fresh and to die for.  I got a bacon/pepperoni pizza and it was like heaven.  I can see why this place is so highly reviewed."}
{"text":"Great place with a friendly staff. Our pizza is always hot. Normally we have to order our pizza with light sauce. Here they use just enough sauce to make sure the dough is not dry, but it doesn't mess with the flavor of the toppings. Definitely recommend to anyone still eating chain pizza shops."}
{"text":"I think I finally found my go to place for pizza. Bruno's has got that spot for me. Really nice New York style pizza that is baked great. I went in to get a slice and was greeted by who I suspect is the owner. He made conversation and was very friendly. He promised that I would be back and he was right. The next day I grabbed a whole pizza for my family. He recognized me from the night before and he upgraded the size of our pizza for free. Give it a try by having a slice and I wouldn't be surprised if you go back too."}
{"text":"Ordered over the phone for fried zucchini and a medium cheese pizza, all was fine until my friend and I went to pick up our order. We get to the counter and talk to a man who we assume is the owner and tell him we are here to pick up. He brings us our food and we ask if we could split the tab he answers \"Sure, anythings possible.\" Which wasn't so bad until we started the pay process. My friend inserts her chip first and as she is doing this he brings up how people don't carry cash anymore and even questions us as to why we didn't have cash. He further discusses how he doesn't looks at his bank statements and then asks us if we look at ours. It was really strange small talk for a pizza pickup and it honestly made us uncomfortable discussing financial topics when I'm there trying to buy pizza. My friend is done paying and it's now my turn to put in my card. I see \"Remove Card\" appear on the machine and so I proceed to do what it said because I'm assuming the payment went through - but their system is weird and I wasn't actually supposed to? so he then accuses me of not wanting to pay them which is extremely rude and he demands me to put my card back. Also, when paying through card he pressed the buttons for me forcing either tip or payment which is usually the customers decision when the machine asks if X amount of money is ok I thought that was extreme odd. While paying again he asks us if we've been there before, my friend has but I hadn't and he questioned me about where I go. This made me super uncomfortable because I don't think it matters when I was giving him business. So I just answered with \"I don't eat pizza much...\" and he says it is because I hadn't tried their pizza, almost like he was trying to make me feel guilty for not being there before. At this point I was really upset I was asked about my financial topics, he accused me of not wanting to pay, and he made me feel guilty for not being there before. Extremely terrible service, neither me or my friend will be returning."}
{"text":"I wanted to write a good review, but can't. We bought the large carry out pizza for $13.00.  The pizza looked really good but the taste was fair at best. Plus I woke up in the middle of the night with a bad headache. Must of had MSG or sodium benzoate in one of the ingredients.  Anyway, the people were nice but the pizza just wasn't there."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on all of the reviews (only had pizza). At that time there was only one or two negative review and they turned out to be spot-on. It's amazing how so few people know pizza (either that or something funny is going on). I guess if you're comparing it to chain pizzas, it's passable. But it's also a lot more expensive.    The crust is very similar to chain pizza. Bland, not much flavor and too thick. I did not see the oven but definitely tastes and feels like it came out of a conveyor belt type oven such as the chains use as opposed to a real pizza oven.  Likewise, the cheese is bland. The sauce is too thick and not very plentiful.  It's basically chain pizza at a premium price."}
{"text":"We were renting a house near by and wanted to pick up something to take and eat. We saw Bruno's Pizza and thought we would give it a try. First, this is a clean, basic, family friendly pizza place that appears to be family owned. They do have beer and wine for those like myself who enjoy a beer with pizza. We were greeted at the counter by a pair of sisters and Dad. Next, I'm a VERY picky pizza crust person and I'm VERY hard to please when it comes to pizza. They have 2 kinds of crust Neopolitan (Thin) and Sicilian (Thick). I prefer thin and crispy so we went with the Neopolitan. We custom ordered 4 different things on each half. We got the pizza to go and retreated to the rental house. This was one of THE BEST pizza's I have ever had! It was so good we decided to get another one 6 days later. When we walked it, we were again greeted by one of the sisters and Dad. Dad asked if we would like what we had last time. Last time! This was only our 2nd time in the place and he remembered what we had the one other time we were there! Amazing! This will be a regular stop on my visits! I suggest you give it a try and find out for yourself!"}
{"text":"I love this place. This is the first time I order, the delivery is so fast. It took only 20 to 25min and pizza is warm and the taste is so gooood. I ordered thin crust, this is so nice. I will order again!"}
{"text":"We live near Bruno's, never tried it until this past weekend. XL Pizza was perfect, staff is friendly and everything is nice and clean. There was a couple eating in when we picked up our order, my wife inquired how their food was and they gave a glowing review. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what all the poor reviews are about, unless the restaurant has its off days or people are expecting a lot more for the money they pay.  And, to be fair, prices here are EXTRAORDINARILY good, when you consider that almost every Italian restaurant in the Valley --- good or bad --- is high priced, though I've yet to figure out why.  Bruno's pizza is not the best; but it's not bad at all.  For some reason, the Albanians have the pizza market covered in PHX.  Not a huge surprise, given how close Albania is to Italy and how many of them go there to either work or live.  The only Italian restaurants in the Valley where I haven't found Albanians are in the more \"upscale\" Italian restaurants ... and I use the word \"upscale\" to indicate price, but not necessarily quality.  The other day, we had a (huge) calzone; a baked ziti with sausage plate; salad and bread; and two very large drinks for $24 before tip.  Given the quantity of food, $24 is hardly expensive and I found the food to be quite good  (especially the ziti).  You can be sure $24 MIGHT get you one dish in the pricier Italian restaurants in Scottsdale and --- having been to them --- that would not have guaranteed something more delicious.  Given what's available in the West Valley (and in all Phoenix, for that matter), this restaurant shouldn't be ignored simply because a $30 bill for two doesn't compare with its competition at 2 - 3x that price in snobbier locations.  It's a very good value for the money; the staff is courteous and friendly and the food is better than average ... especially when comparing it to other Italian restaurants out here in the West Valley"}
{"text":"Clean pleasant lively restaurant, a great peaceful change of pace from the strip. The new owner Niko is hilarious and passionate and has great ideas for a more authentic menu. Definately worth coming to frequently! We asked for split toppings on our pizza and they even brought it out on separate plates. Plenty of toppings, delicious cheese, great sauce but not overwhelming, and perfect crust! Seriously, it was soft and fluffy, but firm enough in the bottom to hold right.  Love it!! Yum! Will be back as much as we can."}
{"text":"I grew up on Long Island so a slice of pizza is very important to me. :) Bruno's pizza is amazing.  Their crust is the best I have had.  It equals that one best-ever slice I had up in Corning, NY at a mall pizza place.  The cheese is great as well.  The dining room is very nice and they use real china plates and solid silverware.  Their service is great.  The also sell pizza by the slice which is hard to find.  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Not good. Decided to try it because we had a Groupon to get $40 worth of pizza (2 14\" + \"appetizers\") for $20. I'd rather have gotten a $5 Little Caeser's. Only ate a couple slices and threw the rest away. The sauce has no flavor and the crust went into the trash, which I typically like as much as the rest of the pizza. They don't really even have appetizers - no mozzarella sticks or calamari or anything like that. They don't classify their chicken wings as appetizers, so I didn't get to try them under the Groupon. That was disappointing. Their garlic cheese bread was OK, but the sauce was just a cold, flavorless paste. The pepperoni sticks were also not good - tasteless bread with a couple pepperonis cooked on top. Biaggio's Pizzeria, 1/2 mile north up Fort Apache is way better."}
{"text":"This is excellent pizza.  You can tell that care is put into making the pizza and they use quality ingredients.  The crust is thicker than a standard New York style pizza, but the outside is crispy and the inside is soft and doughy.  The sauce had a nice tomato zing to it, which gave it good flavor.  There was a lot of cheese on it for a normal order, extra cheese would of been too much.  The pizza is very filling and heavy for its size.  They have excellent specials which make the entire meal very affordable.  We got two large pizzas, 2 orders of breadsticks, and a 2 liter soda for $22.00.  That price is a steal!  Give this place a try, it is very clean and has a personal feel to it.  The owners are very friendly and even thought it is technically a chain from Indiana, it has a hometown feel to it."}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing. We had a pepperoni pizza. None of the flavors were overwhelming. The cheese was very soft and creamy while still having a good stretch. The crust is crispy on the bottom but soft on top. I loved the subtle flavor in the marinara. We ate in the store and they were very friendly and nice guys. He even made sure we knew about the breadsticks for checking in. Overall wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Love it! They did not come short on toppings. You'll get what you paid for. The sauce is great..just awsome!"}
{"text":"My son loves this place. I like that Bruno's is keeping prices affordable so I can take my son out for a meal once a month. Apparently this place has been here a while. The guy behind the counter, Johnny is kind and likes to smile. The staff are young & inexperienced; but truth is- that's how we all start out. I appreciate small business owners who love what they do. Thank you for a wonderful meal each month for the past three months."}
{"text":"I walked into a virtually empty restaurant at lunchtime on a Thursday. In a nutshell, Fox News blaring on the television + bland cheese calzone (yes, it was enormous but more of a mediocre thing is not better) + poor customer service (no fork? no napkin?) = I will not be back."}
{"text":"The BESTEST freshest pizza Ive ever had!!! The dough is so soft! Plenty of meat toppings! Be patient,they make everything as soon as u order,nothing frozen or fake. GREAT service & the owner is super nice & easy to talk to! Cozy setting for a date or family outing. LOVE it here!!!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I didn't go on Yelp before eating at bruno's! I would have missed out on the best pizza and great conversation. I took my 2 daughters here after school for lunch ,the owner was working the counter and he was very friendly. He told me not to worry about my 3 year old who kept trying to terrorize the place and he was sincere. He was prepping food in the back but kept coming out to make sure we didn't need anything, I felt like I was just part of his big Italian family. After reading past reviews I think Bruno is misunderstood. Because of cultural differences, people are interpreting him as rude but he is just an ITALIAN papa.  Pizza was crispy and loaded with cheese and toppings, but not greasy. They must have a new soda machine because it worked perfectly with ice and everything. Will definitely be eating here again and again!! Thank you, Bruno for your hospitality."}
{"text":"Exceptional service and delicious pizza. We got mild wings, which my husband and son devoured, cheesy garlic bread which was amazing, and our meat lovers pizza was to die for. Crispy and fluffy crust and you can smell the yeast which means it was a good dough from the start. Chewy, stringy cheese and fresh toppings. Not too much sauce. This place is a new favorite!! Must have!!!"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I was hit with mouth watering smells. This pizzeria is well taken care of and quite a lovely place to sit and chat with friends or family while you eat an absolutely wonderful pizza, the best pizza I've ever had! Everything was made from scratch with fresh ingredients. The pizza and breadsticks are cooked with dedication and care and it shows! If you're buying pizza from anywhere else you're simply waisting your money. I am recommending this place to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite place pizza place since they opened. It was like it was back east I would rather go there than NYPD however tonight they got my order wrong and that happens, but wow the rudeness from Bruno!!!!  Blamed my husband for picking up the wrong order when they asked for his phone number!  My husband went back and and they gave us the right pizza however it must have been cold and they didn't remake it but put it in the oven and it was burned. I wanted to go back and complain but my husband said, don't we just won't ever eat there again.   Customer service just awful. Shame on you Bruno."}
{"text":"Good reviews so we had to check it out.  We had a buffalo chicken & meat lovers pizza and hot wings.....and it was all deliciouS!   The crust, sauce, toppings and the chEEsE = yummO The hot wings aren't too hot but definitely flavorful, my husband would probably prefer a lil more heat but for me they were perfect. Oh and don't forget to check in for free tasty  pepperoni sticks!"}
{"text":"Great pizza place with a small hometown feel. The owner takes pride in his fresh ingredients and spares no expense in topping every inch of the pizza with those fresh meat and veggie selections. It's not an oily or flimsy pizza that can hardly withstand the ingredients either! This is an all around great quality pizza for a fair price. A large pizza will run you $22.00-$23.00.   My favorite pizza is the Real Deal. It has pepperoni, sausage, green peppers, mushrooms, and onions.   While waiting for our pizzas, we enjoyed some breadsticks. These are also made fresh in the restaurant. They offer two selections of dipping sauces. The red marinara or a cheese dip. Both were good and the breadsticks were top notch.  They just starting serving wings as well. They are butcher fresh wings - never frozen. They are well-cooked and meaty. They are a $1.00 a wing and well worth it!!  The restaurant is clean and customer service is excellent.  The next time I am craving pizza, this is where I am heading."}
{"text":"Happened to find this place through Yelp looking for close restaurants. The employees from start to finish were hospitable, friendly, and thankful.  We ordered The Real Deal (pepperoni, mushroom, onions, sausage, green peppers). From the ingredients alone, one would normally think that the pizza would be greasy. From the moment the pizza was never greasy. Most other pizza places you can instantly tell the meat and cheese are cheap when the oils flood out as it cooks, and near the end of the meal, the pizza is salty and soggy and you feel gross. The pizza at Bruno's, however, was consistent from the time it landed on the table to the time the last quarter of the pizza was placed in the box. It tastes clean, never tasted salty, and most importantly, I don't feel disgusting afterwards. The pizza does not need towels, let alone a single piece of napkin, to remove excess amounts of grease a usual cheap pizza would normally need.  The dough itself is not spongy, yet has a great chewy dough texture that is chewy, not soggy, and yet crisp from start to finish. Prices are definitely reasonable. Offers pizza by the slice. Simple menu yet still has diverse options for toppings. Friendly owners and employees. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Every time we have placed a delivery order with Bruno's Pizza it has been great! The delivery arrives in a good time and the food is exactly as ordered.   We've only ordered pepperoni pizza, bread sticks and wings. The pizza we typically will order original crust which is not too thin, not too thick. Thinner than Pizza Hut, for example... but thicker than your average NY style slice. I love it as it creates a really good balance for the toppings. The pizza has not been too greasy nor too dry and also reheats well.   The breadsticks are a bit greasy for me, but some may enjoy them. The wings are pretty good as well. I prefer a little crunch to my wings and Bruno's wings have just that!   We will absolutely order from Bruno's again."}
{"text":"If you like authentic east coast style pizza and not the trendy wood fired stuff, check out Bruno's. Excellent service and neighborhood feel with people hanging out and the owner seemed to know everyone inside. Pizza was excellent and with 2 slices and a drink fir $5 how can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"For a quick, inexpensive meal this is the place to go. It's served very quickly and was decent tasting. The owner or manager was very friendly, helpful and fun to talk too."}
{"text":"I am blown away by the Yelp reviews for this place. I kind of feel bad leaving a review this bad but holy hell the pizza was horrible. The sauce makes tomato paste look thin. The crust is like chewing on rubber bands. The worst of it all was the cheese. How the hell are all of the previous reviews okay with the cheese? It's the most tasteless mozzarella cheese I've ever had. It has literally no flavor. I really wanted to like it, the price with their coupon was right, staff courteous and delivery fast but this place is an absolute no."}
{"text":"Finally a great pizza place in Vegas!  Crust and sauce are what puts this place on the next level. Family meal deal at $25 is a bargain for such great pizza."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Bruno's and I ordered a Sicilian pizza. When I got home and tried the pizza it was thin and the crust was hard like the dough sat out for to long. When I called to tell them , I imagine it was the owner Bruno said he made the pizza and it was perfectly fine. He offered to remake the pizza , however I don't live close by so I asked him if go another time and he said sure just ask for Bruno. I then tried to give him my name so he could write it down and he said oh I'll remember you people don't usually complain about my pizza. This made me feel like he was accusing me of lying about his poorly made pizza. I then decided to call him back and tell him I would bring his pizza back but he said he didn't want the pizzas back because he didn't want customers to see I was returning the pizza. I will definitely never go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had just moved to an apartment near by and we were given a voucher for a free pizza and 2 liter soda at Bruno's. The owner was there and despite using the voucher he treated us so kindly and was very welcoming. Most places would immediately think you're cheap and tip poorly for some reason. It's hard to find such genuine service like Bruno's. And the pizza is incredible! They use higher quality ingredients and it shows! And the best part is that it wasn't greasy at all."}
{"text":"I went to Bruno's last week the next day I started to feel sick went to see my doctor told me I had the flu!!!  The wings tasted gross like the oil hadn't been change in weeks I would not recommend anyone to eat there!!"}
{"text":"Had the \"real deal\" it's better then the \"supreme\" from pizza hut. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"Delivery:The crust was soggy,the box was full of a liquid  every slice fell apart,the salad was a joke I weighed it and it was only 3 ozs,what a rip off Don't waste your $ on this dump."}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent! We ordered sausage and mushroom pizza and the breadsticks.  Lots of cheese for all the cheese lovers, great sauce and sausage.  Delivery driver was great too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"First off the owners Mark & John are very laid back, charismatic and friendly people. I tried the Meat Lovers & I don't even like Meat Lovers & I now LOVE theirs!!!! The ingredients taste so fresh.  I could only eat two slices of the delicious goodness before feeling stuffed!! I will be back... Very soon!"}
{"text":"Picked up a pepperoni, sausage & mushroom pizza along with some wings frm Bruno's last nite for the fam.  We were blown away by the quality.  The meats had exceptional taste and the sauce was out of this world good.  If u like chix wings, their's are twice baked and not fried.  They were the best!  I plan on duplicating this order time & time again."}
{"text":"I happen to be in the area and ended up eating at Bruno's. All I can say is omg! The prices are very reasonable, and I loved the pizza. I think the best part was the crust :) I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"The best pizza and chicken wings in town! Just ate the  half pesto artichoke/half real deal and I'm in heaven. Freshest ingredients and cooked to perfection!! Also, got the hot wings, and they are wonderful! Perfectly hot, but not too hot. Saving the antipasto salad for tomorrow. Can't wait!!! I'm hooked!!"}
{"text":"Bruno's is one of our Friday night pizza and (BYOB) beer regulars. Bruno and his staff are always on top of their game for service and quality. We usually get a meat lovers pizza, but have enjoyed vegetarian and calzones too. Put it on your list!"}
{"text":"DO-NOT-EAT-HERE!! We went for the first time yesterday to try something different. HUGE mistake... we ordered fried mushrooms, large pizza, and three drinks. But before the food review, let's talk about the drinks and customer service. We immediately noticed that the fountain soda was super flat, I mean it might as well be water flat. So of course, we say something to the restaurant team who tell us they will \"look into it\". A few minutes pass by and one of the servers comes back and says that the owner \"changed the ice\" and that the soda is \"not flat\". Really??? I just drank the water that is pretending to be soda so I know it's flat. After being a little frustrated with the drink situation, our food arrives. DISGUSTING. I've have better frozen pizza then the pizza at Bruno's. Crust was soggy, and the sauce is definitely canned. Super disappointing... did not taste good at all. After letting our frustration build, we decided to not eat and leave. On the way out I approached the owner to let him know that I was disappointed that we would send his 15yo server out to tell us that he said the soda is not flat. When a customer service issue arises, maybe the establishment should take some action to make a disappointing situation better. But instead, he said the soda was not flat. No apologies, no offer to refund the soda. Nothing... after being approached, all he had was excuses at to why the soda was not flat which it clearly was. I asked him several times if he tasted the soda and he could not answer. Ultimately, I could have chalked up the soda thing I guess if the food would have been good but, the food sucked, and so does this place."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and was disappointed. Went in around 630 and the place was dead. They had 3 teenage kids working, a girl at the register and 2 boys doing the cooking. The girl at the counter wasn't very friendly at all and showed no emotion although the boys were pretty friendly. Our food took about 20 min as we ordered it to go. The pizza was ok, tasted like a microwaveable pizza and the wings we ordered were very small and looked like the frozen wings you buy at the store. Had the barbecue sauce and mild sauce and both were ok( hard to mess up barbecue sauce) and the ranch sauce the have gave us had no taste and very very watery. I must say the price we paid for was fairly good but not enough to go back. Tailgaters or Barros is way better!!!"}
{"text":"Bring cash or SKIP IT! We like the pizza but we won't be going back. Called ahead for a pepperoni pizza to pickup. Husband went in to pay with CC and the owner forced him to tip. Right on the CC screen it came up with a tip screen and no option to cancel out of it. he said \"you have to pick one of these lovely numbers\" which was to add 10% tip (or more!). Really?! Has the owner forgotten what a TIP is? It's gratuity, not to be forced. Even if we had eaten in the place, it's COUNTER-SERVICE!!!! That's not a place you usually tip! we do if it's good service, but to be forced? Not only that but to be forced for just a pickup order? Get out of here. If he is needing more money he needs to raise the prices, not jump his CC customers like that. Although, the prices are already pretty steep for the product you get. All in all, our business is going elsewhere from now on. So I hope that $1.90 tip was worth it to him, because he will no longer be getting orders from us!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Bruno's tonight and what a great experience. First- the sauce is outstanding. I usually add seasonings to pasta sauce when dining out but not tonight. You'll want to save your buttery garlic toast to get all the sauce off your plate. The pizza dough was perfect as was the pizza. Service was excellent and the owner adds just that special welcoming ingredient. It's a simple restaurant setting in a tiny clump of businesses but tastefully decorated and food that was beyond expectations."}
{"text":"Great service. Excellent Pizza. Yummy salad and dressings. The owner is super nice. Waitress was great. Nice ambiance. Clean and nice to stay and eat. Plenty of parking. Baby friendly. We will be coming back for sure. Pizza has a delicious crisp to it. And breadsticks are also delish."}
{"text":"Really good and fresh tasting pizza. Best so far in the area  and great service as well. I will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"12:06 pm and doors were closed and they are suppose to be opened by 10:30 am. Inside looked dark and tables and chairs were taken out i guessed they are closed for good."}
{"text":"Holy crap my margarita pizza with pepperoni was amazing. Hands down the best pizza I've had in a very long time. Crust was beautiful and airy but not heavy at all. Yum, yum :)"}
{"text":"I drove through Arizona and stumbled across this classy little Italian diner. I got the salad, pizza, drink combo for $6.99 and added an extra slice of pizza. It was great and the owner, Bruno, was very friendly and fun to chat with. He is an authentic Italian. Next time I am in town, I'll be sure to come again and gets the hot sandwiches."}
{"text":"Bruno was recommended to us by a good friend and they did not stear us wrong.  One of the best pizzas we have had in a LONG time.   The sauce was so Good and the staff was great.  On little surprise was the Cesar salad. The owner shared that they make all their own dressings so we had to give it a try Spook good. Give Bruno a try and the only problem you'll have is trying to figure out when to return to try something different."}
{"text":"The restaurant offers two types of pizza, thin and sicilian, but the owner never asked us what we wanted when we ordered. About 3 minutes after we ordered (a special, nothing fancy) we asked if they were making it a Sicilian like we wanted. The answer was, \"no we already made you a thin crust\". They refused to start again and make a Sicilian for us. Yes that's picky, but what ever happened to the customer is always right?  It's their fault for not asking what we wanted, since the price for both pizzas is exactly the same. And it's not like we're the only people in history to order a thin crust combo, the pizza would get sold, or at least go to their skinny, underpaid employees. Customer service, 0. Food, eh, I've had better. It wasn't good enough for them to NOT be all over themselves trying to make it right."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in town!!!! By far!!!!! The people there make u feel like family!! The pizza has love in every bite u take!! I think it's best pizza sauce and crust in town.. No place I've ever been and I'm a pizza lover has as good REAL spicy Italian sausage like they do!!"}
{"text":"We are new here in Arizona, originally from LA, we went to Bruno's for pizza after my daughters Softball Game. When we walked in we were immediately greeted by Bruno himself,  he actually knew that we had never been there before, that shows you how much he cares about his customers, as we sat in the restaraunt waiting for our dinner, we observed other patrons that came in to get pizza and Bruno and staff really treated each and every customer like they were family, what a great guy!! The customer service was epic!!!! He made us feel like family. We ordered a thin crust pizza, it was so delish!!! Exactly what we were looking for! The sauce was perfect, and the pizza was not full of oil or grease. The pizza by far surpassed our expectations!!! This is a must eat pizza place!!!!!! We found our favorite pizza place!!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Got a delivery from Bruno's and the pizza is pretty good! They also delivered to me within 30 minutes.   I order a large pepperoni pizza and garlic bread sticks. The pizza was a pretty good size for a large and had many slices to share from. The cheese was nice and thick and stretched every time you took a bite! The pizza was also on the more thicker and fluffier side. The pizza also could had a little more sauce on it since there was a lot of cheese on it and bread.   The bread sticks were only okay to me. They seemed a little over cooked!   WORST THING EVER: they forgot to pack red peppers and Parmesan :("}
{"text":"Totally awesome in every way, sauce spectacular! Cheese Amazing!  Service so great, named it after his Father.  Please check it out , so worth it.  While I was waiting on my pizza to take home , he made a Caesar salad for a couple who was there eating and did it on the house.  The absolute best pizza ever I've ever had in Vegas"}
{"text":"In the area on vacation, we turned to the web to provide some guidance. Bruno's was at the top of the list. The pies were tasty, the folks friendly and couldn't beat the location. If we lived here, we'd be regulars."}
{"text":"Walked in and ordered a pizza and a few other items.  While it was not particularly busy (maybe 1 or 2 other customers) I ended up waiting 40 minutes for my pizza...   the experience was a bit frustrating as well where the owner was upset with the credit card I was using saying something to the effect they take too much money.  Long story short I go from Bruno's to about 5 min down the street and my entire order was essentially half cold.  Not sure how it could not be warm unless it was left out for a bit before being boxed..... I could go on but overall bad experience"}
{"text":"Another bad pizza shop . Being new to the area we thought we would give it a try...... Bad choice. The best part was the Italian accent of the guy taking the order. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"You better come hungry, because this place puts lots of everything.  Lots of Flavor and the salads are top notch.  Owner s a pretty nice guy too. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Sooooo impressed!!! AMAZING customer service and INCREDIBLE food to match!! I just moved here from the BayArea/Cali and I am soooo happy I found this diamond!!! Way to go to the NEW OWNER!!!!  BRAVO!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for my prefight pizza and discovered a jewel. Pizza is delicious and they have a nice priced special.  Its nothing to say but THE PIZZA IS GREAT. THE PIZZA IS GREAT. THE PIZZA IS GREAT. Customer service is top notch and very attentive."}
{"text":"Had pizza there this weekend, loved the thin crust but please where are the toppings, the girl in front looked out of place like she was new and not sure what to do and stood around doing nothing waiting for customers which there was only one in the hour we were there! Never  had pizza in new York but have had Luckys and NYPD pizza and I have enjoyed both of them think I will stick with them!!!"}
{"text":"Cannot recommend this place highly enough. A hidden gem in SW Las Vegas that my family has been to a couple times. We loved it so much we approached Mark to host our basketball teams end of season party at the restaurant. The party went amazing. The service was amazing and they even shut down the dining room to accommodate the party.  The XL pizza's are REALLY big and we had to order multiple because the kids loved it so much. So many parents told me the food was amazing and the staff was super nice. You have not experienced what service should be like until you have been here!"}
{"text":"I moved to Goodyear about 3 years ago.  My wife and I love New York Style Pizza.  We made a point of trying pizza everywhere in the area.  After many pizzas we stumbled upon Bruno's Pizza in Goodyear.  The pizza is a dead ringer for New York Style.  The dough is perfect, the sauce is delicious and the pizza, well, I don't think you can find a better Pizza anywhere.  Besides that, Bruno is a great guy who takes pride in his pizza.  You can't go wrong with this pizza - give it a try"}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite, I recommend it like a missionary!  The most quality ingredients, not replacing wholesomeness with higher costs. The meets do not have nitrates, the vegetables are cut fresh, you can watch them cut them, low gluten flour, this place is the best!  My favorite was the chicken wings. They were so great, I thought they were fried until I talk to one of the employees and learned it was actually baked!!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad,  not the best. It's acceptable for the price. Pleasant staff. Ate cheese pizza oven baked."}
{"text":"I've never seen many people here, but that should change. The prices are great, the service is incredibly friendly and fast and the pizza is very good. Go eat here! Let's start with the crust, it's crisp and crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside, it's got a great consistency and mouthfeel. The sauce is pretty good and the cheese and other toppings are plentiful and flavorful. I would also recommend the cheese or pepperoni breadsticks, both are good options. On my first trip here my wife and I were also comped a Caesar Salad. The dressing is made in house and was quite tasty. If you're interested in a lighter side (instead of more bread and cheese) this is an excellent choice. If you live in the southwest or don't mind driving you should definitely check this place out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow! Very good pizza. I've drove by couple times but the Plaza is always empty so I was skeptical but boy I was wrong. We ordered double pep and cheese....wholly cow!  They are definitely not stingy on toppings! First time I can actually say i might have to complain that there was too much cheese but entirely my fault cuz I asked for it. But I love cheese"}
{"text":"This place is definitely my favorite pizza joint! Bruno is a stand up guy with really good food! I have been coming here for years and proud to support his business! He makes pizza for you to enjoy and to also support the community!"}
{"text":"What more can you ask for? Perfect wings and perfect pizza. Owner is very professional, I would recommend to anyone. !! Great food!!"}
{"text":"Great attentive service. Prompt service. Crust is crunchy with air bubbles. Sauce is heavy on the tomatoes. Kids enjoyed it too. Overall a good dining experience."}
{"text":"I hadn't heard of Bruno's Pizza until just a few weeks ago.  One of the folks at our martial arts school is from the same place Bruno's comes from and she thankfully made us aware.  Prior to Bruno's opening she brought some pizza in that they made while working out the finer points of the dough recipe for the climate here in Vegas.  It smelled great, they offered a couple of slices, and I found a new favorite.  It was just cheese pizza, and it was probably the best cheese pizza I can remember eating.  Ever.  Excited that they finally had their soft opening on October 1st, we went in to try more of what they do, and we weren't disappointed.  We ordered the cheese pizza for my son and the meat lover's pizza for the two of us.  A side of garlic breadsticks and soft drinks complemented the pies and in no time we had our happy pizza faces on.  The toppings were delicious and the crust was amazing even thought they'll tell you they're not quite content with it just yet.  Even more amazing:  no grease sitting on the pie or under the crust.  The meat pizza was delicious, the toppings were tender, and somehow they've found a way to get rid of all the grease and oil that seems to settle on pizzas like this.  They're still getting their rhythm down, but Bruno's is a must visit place if you're on the southwest side of the valley.  Go enjoy a pizza, and help them hit their stride as they approach their grand opening and a full menu.  Note: there used to be another pizza joint in the same location, so don't miss that it's a new place now."}
{"text":"The pizza was okay. It was crafted well and looked the part, but was fairly bland. I probably will not order their again, but I set my pizza bar pretty high and I'm looking for a must have type of place."}
{"text":"I want to show some love for Bruno's Pizza. While passing through the area, I took a chance and ordered a sausage & pepper pizza to go. I'm happy to say that all the ingredients were superb and fresh. The cheese and dough were both really good and very tasty. To me Bruno's represents the best of the quick fix pizzas out there and competes with places like Grimaldi's. I added their number to my favorites on my phone because I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"The process was painless and food is very good ! Service was quick and will definitely put this on my faves !!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out after it changed from Pizza gourmet to Brunos pizza, and i must say, im glad i did. Very fresh ingredients, good service, and the place is nice and clean. 5/5"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I understand all the high ratings. The pizza here is pretty good, but not the best in town. They wouldn't even crack my top 5. I've gotten a veggie pizza and Hawaiian pizza, along with garlic cheesey bread. The crust is thicker than a NY style. It's doughy and less crispy. The ingredients aren't bad. Prices are decent. Not a bad pizza option at all for either dining in or take out."}
{"text":"Delish!  My first time to order their special 14 in Large pizza with pepperoni and love it.  Try their pizza and you 'll love it too \")) I am a happy customer and definitely would keep reordering here...just really yummy italian made pizza :)"}
{"text":"We ordered half Hawaiian and the other half pepperoni/olives for the office and it was DELISH!!  Ingredients taste soo fresh and the way the pizza layered made it even better!  We also ordered breadsticks and side salad which were also amazing.  I think their dressing is made in house!  Would highly recommend this place to anyone.  Try it if you haven't already..."}
{"text":"Pizza Sunday's are a staple, and Bruno's did not disappoint. Everything tastes homemade and fresh. The dough and the cheese were extraordinary! Great service - they make you feel like family! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I just moved here and needed a quick meal for football.  Showed up and they weren't open yet, but the door was ajar. I asked when they opened and rather than turn me away they took my order 30 minutes before business hours and had it ready for me the minute they were on duty. Great food and service."}
{"text":"A native New Yorker is giving this pizzeria hands down FIVE stars!!  We have been ordering pizza from here for about two years now, and I am NOT disappointed.   I have not tried their sandwiches or their entrees, because I can cook those items at home.  I cannot cook pizza, and this really is New York style pizza.   I like the staff there, they are all nice people.  So, we will continue to order a large pie every Friday or every other Friday evening.      UPDATE:  Now my review changes... the owner told us to go over to the Walmart next door and buy a can of anchovies if we wanted anchovies added on top of our pizza, okay he's rude.  But the real clincher that caused us to NOT return anymore and turn my FIVE stars review to 2 stars is that two times the pineapple on top of the pizza was so bad that it tasted fermented!  Like it was turning to wine or beer.  Why 2 times?  Well, everyone has a BAD day so we gave another chance... it happened again.  I'm done.  How sad that my kids like pineapple on their pizza (not me, no thank you), and the entire pizza ruined by bad pineapple. How the heck does pineapple go bad?"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this pizza place. The company I work for was given free pizza from Bruno's to get the word out about them and that is the only way I would eat this. The dough was very dense and rubbery, the cheese was rubbery and did not taste good, the sausage had no flavor. The sauce was the best and most flavorful part of this pizza."}
{"text":"I tried this when we moved in the area and got a complimentary coupon for a free medium pepperoni pizza and breadsticks I added wings to our order.   I've been so used to frozen and chain pizzas I forgot how freshly baked dough tastes like with fresh ingredients and how much it can make a difference.   It was just wonderful and you can smell from the crust how it was cooked traditionally not one of those conveyor thingies.   Ordered here again a few weeks back and had their all meat pizza and it was good. Their wings are not those small and almost no meat kind it's actually the opposite and I enjoy it as much as the pizza especially the BBQ flavor.   My go to pizza place and I'm so glad it's within reach in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Just as good ... as back home in Brooklyn!"}
{"text":"I'm a firm believer there's \"no such thing as bad pizza\" but I just spent $25 on a medium pizza and wings and I refuse to eat a second piece. My boyfriend keeps saying \"I told you so\" .... I'm very disappointed in this choice of pizza place. I don't know if it's the cheese or the thick sauce but it's truly awful. 2 stars because the customer service was good and delivery was fast. Won't be eating here again"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery so I haven't been there but the pizza was amazing. The crust is thick crust style and they make their own ranch dressing which was amazing! Will definitely order deliver again!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  My family and I ate here and the pizza was delicious.  We checked in for free breadsticks. Which were also great! They went above and beyond to make our son a personal pizza for free. Excellent customer service, personable and kind! We will be ordering and coming in here again!"}
{"text":"I'm from the east coast so I know good pizza when I eat it. I've lived in Vegas for 3 years and it's taken me that long to find a good pizza place! I'm so happy and it's right around the corner from my house. I ordered delivery and it got to my house in under 20 minutes. The pizza was hot still! The cheese to die for and the sauce yum! I'll be forever ordering from here! Please never go away Bruno's  we also got the breadsticks... Yassss! I'll be trying different stuff next time but this place is awesome."}
{"text":"This pizza is excellent we had the skinny pizza with our favorite pepperoni, sausage, pineapple,green olives, artichoke hearts. Sausage was amazing!  It was awesome very flavorful and perfectly cooked crust which is the way we like it!! We  got to meet the owner Mark and he was terrific and so is his staff! Also on another note we had the wings with the Mediterranean Rub - absolutely incredible!!!  Buffalo Wild Wings eat  heart out!  We had been looking for a new pizza home and we have found it! Do yourself a favor and try Bruno's  you'll never go back to Pizza Hut, Domino's or anything else again!!  Mark and Janet J"}
{"text":"I call the owner the pizza Nazi. I don't make eye contact in fear of losing my beloved pizza. This is the closest thing to real Manhattan slices I have found here in Az.  The young girl is not sooooo friendly as someone mentioned earlier but she is young, what do you want from her? A dance number after you order? Just get your damn pizza and bounce, its well worth it!"}
{"text":"I asked for \"extra extra extra extra pineapple\" and they delivered that 100% hence the 5 stars. If I had one critique it'd be too much cheese but I'm sure that's just their style and I won't dock them for that since I'm a first time eater and didn't know. Next time is ask for the same thing but 1/2 the cheese."}
{"text":"My review is based off them delivering it to me haven't been in the store.  I live on blue diamond. They drove all the way there to deliver their pizza there! I've never tried this place but recommended by a friend that was coming over.  Anyways, the pizza was so great!   We ordered breadsticks, pepperoni pizza, and I can't remember the last one we ordered I think it was a mushroom and sausage pizza.  Their marinara sauce was to die for. I was told they make their own. Its served cold but its still good! Their portion on that pizza was pretty big too. It wasn't extremely greesy and tasteless.  Just go give them a try!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their Pesto Pizza. Good crust and generous portions of cheese and toppings without overkill. Great Pie!  Service from Ashley was Excellent!  Thank You!!"}
{"text":"As a New Jersey/New York resident, my expectations for pizza by the slice is rather high. I ordered an order of garlic knots, a plain pie, and a slice of a whole buffalo chicken pizza.  Promptly, my order arrived at my table. The Garlic knots were some of the best I've ever had. The medium/thin crust, when struck with the initial bite, was was at first crunchy, then soft in the center.  Bruno's was an incomparable experience. Best of pizza and Italian that I could find in the Gibsonia area, I would definitely recommend for repeated visits!"}
{"text":"Bought a meatlovers pizza and trying brunos for the first time. The gentleman (possibly the owner) was kind enough to let me know he mistakenly left out an important ingredient, but all was forgiven as soon as I had my first slice and taste! Savory juicy and basically one of the best tasting pizza ive had in a while. My wife is a hard woman to please when it comes to food, but just goes to show how good brunos pizza is that she actually liked something i brought home for her! Haha kidding aside, brunos, you get my 5 star rating and i honestly dont remember the last time i even bothered to write up a review on yelp or let alone rate anyone, making this my first review ever. Kudos and more power and success for you!"}
{"text":"We order the meat lovers I recommend it. I will have some friends over for Thursday night kick off for the NFL will definitely have the pizza."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!! I will only order pizza from them. And there staff is really friendly. Thanks guys for good food!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE IT!   The owners are from the midwest area & so am I!   I love this style pizza..lots of toppings fill you up quickly.  Very good taste & texture.   Try it!   You'll also become a regular!"}
{"text":"Everything you want from a pizza delivery place.  Efficient phone service, decent delivery time, friendly driver and 3 pizzas that did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Best pizza we have found since moving to the southwest. Fresh ingredients, not greasy at all and we enjoyed the leftovers almost as much as the night we ordered it. The delivery guy was also super friendly. We will definitely be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best pizza places in the world! I have never tasted anything more authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"Great pizza !!!!! What's great is they sell pizza by the slice so i can stop in for a quick lunch. The pizza is always fresh and the staff is extremely friendly. Definitely a great little place to sit back and enjoy some comfort food"}
{"text":"It was our first time here...very warm and friendly service and awesome pizza (we got Chicken Bacon Ranch and Real Deal) made for a lovely dinner out with my family. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ive been here several times. Fantastic pizza made with real ingredients by lovely staff! Delivery is quick, and pizza is always hot :)"}
{"text":"Not sure what everyone is raving about. Prices are good, but the pizza is bland. About the same crust as a NY-style pizza, but it's no where near as good as the real thing in NYC.  Tried some of their wings also.  I like that they really douse them in sauce, but they're small, tough, and fairly poor on the quality scale as far as chicken goes.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I think I'd consider myself a recovering pizzaholic, and I really can't stay away from it. This was by far one of the best pizzas I have ever had!!  I usually like thin crust but the girl taking our order told us the original crust was really good. And boy, was she right. The crust was on the thicker side, but it was so fluff, and airy, yet also the right amount of crispness.  The sauce was on the tart side, which I usually don't like but it worked with the rest of the ingredients. Plus it tastes so fresh!!  The cheese, you could tell was high quality.  But my favorite was their ranch! You could tell it was home made and I wanted to secretly take a gallon home, just so I could put it on everything!  Do your tummy a favor and go here!! I'm just sad they are so far from me, but it's probably a good thing they are, because I'd seriously be here all the time."}
{"text":"Stopped by Bruno's Pizza.  Ordered a cheese X-Large (12 cut) pizza to go.  Very good New York style pizza, really enjoyed everything from the crust to the sauce. The place looked to be very clean, and the owner was very pleasant when I spoke with him.  I recommend a visit if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem. I loved every slice of the pizza. Quality ingredients and the original dough is perfect!"}
{"text":"Tried Bruno's for the first time the other night. The delivery was pretty fast and the pizza was delicious! The ingredients tasted fresh and the crust was perfect. We also had garlic breadsticks which were underwhelming. The price was pretty high too: $24 for one larger pizza and breadsticks. The pizza really was great...would have given 5 stars if the prices were better."}
{"text":"After my first bite I knew I would be a custom for life. Everything on this menu is mouth watering delicious. The pasta dishes could easily be compared to any fancy Italian restaurant and Bruno's would still be better. The sandwiches will blow your mind they are so good. Bruno uses the best ingredients and puts his heart into everything he makes and it makes a difference the food here is so damn good. No matter what you order you will not be disappointed and if you are it's not his food it's you. I would ear here every day if I get a chance."}
{"text":"Great pizza for a great price.  It's hiding in the Walmart parking lot but definitely worth finding.  I have stopped at several other restaurants in the area and none stand up."}
{"text":"Love this place! Glad they opened a location in Vegas. Not like the other pizza places throughout the town. Has fresh ingredients and the whole pizza is cooked from scratch, no frozen crust nor are the ingredients loaded with preservatives. My personal favorite is the margarita pizza. Fresh basil and tomato with and olive oil based sauce. Give the pizza a try, I promise you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza experience in Vegas. In a city of corporate monstrosities and cliche chain food options, Bruno's is a hidden gem closer than your neighborhood bar. John, the owner, is not your typical owner. Extremely involved and extremely dedicated, his talents are displayed throughout the shop. Shout out to John and Bruno's Pizza, thank you for feeding Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza for the price, super fast and friendly service - why is this place always empty?!   The first time we stopped here was on a weekday afternoon. We were greeted immediately, brought drinks & used the great Yelp check-in offer to get a free pepperoni appetizer. As soon as we had finished that, one of the servers brought us out a delicious comped Caesar salad! The dressing was delicious and the salad was huge!   Their pizza is good. The crust is buttery and has a great consistency, the sauce is very good.   We will keep coming back because the value here is great, and the service is just as good!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and wings to go. While I was waiting for my food, what I'm assuming is, the manager or owner came out and talked to us. He was extremely friendly and you can tell cared about the integrity of the food and the well being of the customer. When I got home and ate what I ordered, the pizza was awesome and the wings were great. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I have been to Bruno's but after reading some of the reviews, I wanted to put in my 2 cents.   I love the pizza. Never had anything but pizza here. Whenever I went in, Bruno was there.  Always very nice to me and even comp'd a few beers here and there while I was waiting for my pizza.  Better than a chain anyday.   Thanks Bruno!!"}
{"text":"Came all the way from Kentucky to experience Bruno's amazing pizza!!!! Fresh ingredients, incredible sauce and the crust was top of the line...and you must try the homemade Caesar salad. The staff was attentive and extremely friendly. And the food came out faster than I would have ever expected!!   Definitely worth leaving the hustle and bustle of the strip. Don't miss out on this gem!!"}
{"text":"We were fortunate to be in town for the soft opening. Many of you probably do not know that the original recipe for this pizza comes from Indiana, my home. The pizza that I had at this location was by far the best one yet! The pizza was loaded with quality toppings, especially very tasty meat. The crust was crispy on the outside and done on the inside , yet tasted moist. We were very happy to be able to get away from the strip for a day to eat at this location, by the way it is on the way to Red Rock Canyon so was a convenient location for us. Just a short jot down flamingo or Tropicana Avenue and you're there, for my friends back home here in Indiana , if you go to Vegas you must get a Bruno's pizza."}
{"text":"I looked up local pizzerias on Yelp and found Bruno's and stopped on for dinner.  I was not disappointed.  The complimentary breadsticks and sauce appetizer was tasty; the sauce had a nice sweet quality.  I ordered a half-vegetarian, half bar-b-que chicken pizza. It was delicious with a light, fluffy crust, and every bite delighted my taste buds.  Service was excellent -- Mark, one of the owners, was great.  I plan to be back again and again and the next time I'll bring my friends to enjoy Bruno's pizza!  10/28/16, Update: Bruno's has closed.  I called the old number and the new owner Nico answered and said it's called Nico's now and that he's still using fresh ingredients and has added new items; hours are still the same.  I'll be checking out the new place."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area looking for the perfect pizza.. We decided on Brunos and I'm happy we did ! First off the costumer service is excellent ! Mark made us feel welcome and was so friendly !  I ordered a medium half Hawaiian and half pepperoni. Hawaiian side was def our fav but the pepperoni was good as well.The cheesy garlic bread was ok.  We will come back for sure !"}
{"text":"No where else will you find an eggplant sandwich, so good. The pizza is out of this world, about to munch down on my two slices a coke for $4.99. Unreal taste of back east."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Amazing wings! Great breadsticks! Super friendly staff and very clean fun place!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, solid pizza! Would stop here again for sure and recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"Pizza was not very good but the ingredients were fresh which I can appreciate. The crust was too thick and too much cheese on the pizza if that's possible. Customer service was good they redeemed a Yelp coupon for free breadsticks which was nice. Breadsticks were just ok not bad not good. Overall I'm giving them 3 for the service but I won't order from them again since they don't deliver to my house I just happened to be in the area so I gave them a try. We do drive far all the time for food that's worth it. Not the case"}
{"text":"We Ordered large 1/2 Hawaiian and 1/2 ground beef and artichoke.    The cheese was delightful and the original style crust was soft with just enough crunch to give you that old fashion pizza dough wonderfulness.   Very reasonably priced for the quality ingredients  Staff was extremely friendly and helpful.   I'm a fan of this place."}
{"text":"Small pizza joint just down the street from us. Small and not very appealing when you walk in. Very friendly staff and owner comes out to chat with you. Wait was a bit long. We ordered the Real Deal. Veggies were crisp and cheese was gooey but the best part was the crust and the sauce! I would give another 1/2 star if the appearance was upgraded. This place, though, is owned by good people who support good causes. So, I will take advantage of their specials when it benefits charity I support. Kudos to Bruno's for giving back!"}
{"text":"Simply put this my new place for pizza. Awesome. The meat lovers is fantastic and the customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"I love Pizza and I loved my experience at Bruno's Pizza!  I am so over commercial pizza places like pizza hut & dominio's so I had to search for a hand crafted pizza place. Bruno's Pizza most defiantly deliver on my order. I ordered a large meat lovers pizza, buffalo wings, and received two free garlic breads, and EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS.  When ordering my pizza the staff was nice and friendly, and very helpful. The inside of this establishment is pretty small. They have a few chairs and tables sat up if you want to eat, but I think I would just order take out. If Bruno's pizza would add a few TV's & have Sunday football beer specials. I would love to come here enjoy yummy pizza and watch the game, but I will defiantly be back.  Thank Bruno for the yummy Pizza!!"}
{"text":"I saw someone eating this pizza at work and it looks so legit, I had to stop by. Thanks to groupon I got a stellar deal and picked some up to-go.  The ingredients are fresh, and the toppings were very good. I wasn't too fond of the crust (seems I am way hardcore about my crust preferences) but my better half really loved it.  We shall be coming back to try more again, but the crust is a BitTorrent thick for my taste."}
{"text":"So I did a Pizza battle royal between Bruno's and NYPD Pizza this week. I ordered the same thing from both and I have to say that Bruno's was a clear cut winner for best Pizza Place in the Goodyear area.  I did not expierience a service issue while waiting for my pizza and wings for takeout.  They offer combo specials unlike NYPD and overall was about 10 dollars cheaper at Bruno's for a large with wings (40 at Brunos, 12 at NYPD) both Large Pepperoni pizzas.   Not to downgrade NYPD at all I feel they deserve 4 stars as well because of the better tasting pizza, the obvious wings edge would have to go to Bruno's Pizza. Appearance goes to NYPD.The Value edge would go to Bruno's and thats why I feel it's the best in Goodyear."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a lower rating. The manager or owner whomever it was, is extremely rude. The girl took my order and told him what it was. He forgot to cook it. After 20 minutes I ask, he says she never told him, I call him out cause I was right there. After he throws it in the oven he calls me back over to watch him ridicule the girl. I had enough and told him it's not her fault and reminded her she did nothing wrong. I will never go back there."}
{"text":"I have NEVER had a bad meal. The owner is amazing. He gets a lot of bad press but get to know someone before you judge. This guy loves his restaurant and loves real people. If you want real NY pizza a must stop."}
{"text":"I gave this place a 1 star because a zero rating was not an option. The pizza tasted like it came out of the microwave, they must use imitation cheese.   If McDonald's served pizza it would taste exactly like this! Very surprised this place is still doing business, and serving this nonsense to the public.  Brunos is to pizza what Taco Bell is to Mexican Food."}
{"text":"First time here.  Checked in and got the pepperoni cheese stick for FREE.  It was great.   The service was very welcoming as they checked to make sure if everything was ok.  The dining area was roomy and my son had room to stretch his legs and did not felt pressure to just sit there-felt very welcoming.   Ordered chicken wings with garlic ranch. Omg so glad we did,  it was amazing. The chicken was crispy with a nice crunch with every bite and did I mentioned the garlic.  It was so delicious!  The XL pizza was huge with a crispy crust and a soft bottom texture that was not overly oily with every bite.  The topping were really tasty with half of it topped with pepperoni,  black olives, and sausages.  The other half had pepperoni,  onions,  and bacon.  To spice it up we asked for jalapeno on the side.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This pizza place is amazing! We had the real deal.....so delicious! Not greasy at all! Kids loved the pepperoni and garlic bread sticks. ALL of the staff are super friendly! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, breadsticks, wonderful friendly service. Good for take out or for dine in."}
{"text":"The food is good. The pop machine needs an upgrade. Customer service is awesome. Patrick is an awesome customer service/cashier/ host/ food preparer."}
{"text":"We ordered Bruno's Pizza for a birthday party the other night (one cheese, one pepperoni, and one bacon). I liked the bacon pizza. It had a good amount of bacon but the crust was a little dry."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews I must admit I was nervous about ordering from here but my family decided to try it out and were pleasantly surprised.  The pizza was really good.  Nice NY style crust, cheesy goodness and a lot of pepperoni.    We also ordered wings.  The flavor was really good and they were nice and crunchy (not fatty/stringy...man, I hate that).    My hubby went to pick up the food and the owner was very pleasant, made him feel like it was a down to earth neighborhood joint.   Will definitely try it again!"}
{"text":"Nice little family place.  Nothing fancy.  Owner and staff were very nice.  Great place to get dinner for family of 4 under $30."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery after reading the reviews... and I'm not disappointed. Food arrived about 15 min early. The crust has a hint of garlic and the sauce is thicker and tastes great. I would recommend this place, nice unknown gem in the SW."}
{"text":"Terrible saggy pizza not even fresh. We ordered the 2 large pizza specials (21 per the coupon) but didn't tell us they were charging $4 dollars a topping so ended up paying $41 dollars for 2 pizzanot going back there."}
{"text":"Horrible service, no longer have turkey sandwiches even though it is on the menu, no Italian sandwiches, no soap in women's bathroom, no paper towels in the men's, they do not have bottled water, no tea just soda, water in the soda machine tastes like shit.  Food was decent, wings were well cooked but very small."}
{"text":"Thank you for the early delivery for my daughter's birthday!!! Lots of guests asked me where the pizzeria was and they took the menu with them. This is fourth time ordering from Bruno's but it has been consistently good. I love the fact that the pizzas have never been soggy despite we have them delivered! By far the best around 89117/89147 area."}
{"text":"The staff was kind and helpful.  They did a great job.  The food however was bad.  I mean for $8 I got a bad salad, cardboard tasting pizza and a very watered down ice tea.    The store bought frozen pizza I had with friends the night before was better than this.  Also they charge 50 cents per topping for a slice!  Most places include one topping already as an option.  I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Had a couple people recommend this place and I'm not really sure what they got. We got a scicillian pizza and some breadsticks. The breadsticks were good but the pizza left a lot to be desired. My fiancés said it tasted freezer burnt. However I think it was over proofed or sitting out for a while and then baked. It was bland and for 1.99 for an extra topping I would have expected more. It might be in some people's taste but definitely not ours."}
{"text":"The salad was so fresh...NOT bagged lettuce. The homemade Ranch Dressing is quite yummy, too! The Meat Lovers pizza was delicious. Great sauce and not greasy. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Same as the previous reviewer mentioned.  The owner hyped up the joint, boasting everything is better they Brothers pizza, Barros.  He hooked me up with a free slice to back up his claim.  I ordered a steak sandwich. So that's why he wanted me to try a slice. That's awesome!    Fast forward maybe a year, dunno a weekago from this post date. I ordered a large pie with half pepperoni, half Hawaiian. 8 slices on a large on a large pie.  I laughed my butt off when I got home and opened the box.  2 Pepperoni's per slice. 4 slices of pineapple, and 2 small chunks of ham per slice. Super symmetrical, almost intentional.  Crust was new York style, and had good flavor.  Shame on cutting corners on the toppings, that was very embarrassing on your part."}
{"text":"I found this place here on Yelp and I'm so glad I did. The pizza is excellent. The sauce is perfect not too sweet... just right. I judge my pizza by the crust and this crust is three real deal. It's crunchy on the outside but once you bite into it it's so soft! Some pizza places use cheap dough as you can taste a sweetness to it but not this place you can tell they use top notch ingredients.   Another perk... the owner. Mark the owner was here during our meal and made us feel so welcomed and at home. Where can you go and get that kind of service now a days...? Here. If you live in this area or are just here for a getaway you must try this pizza... We will be back"}
{"text":"Service was fast n friendly and had the family owned feel !  My review is more toward the food side;  The pizza seems to be a big hit with most but not my type of flavor. It wasn't gross by any means but we ARE in the search for the BEST pizza in town so I'm prob being too critical.  Reminded me of Sbarro 's pizza."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I didn't know what to think.  But the pizza is good, wings decent, good specials the owner is real and not fake. He just says it likes it is.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"My husband was up in the Cranberry area so I told him to get a recommendation for a pizza place to bring home pizza to Canonsburg for us. Bruno's was suggested by more than one person so this is where he stopped. We went with a large pepperoni Sicilian pizza and an order of the breadsticks with cheese. These items did have a 30 minute drive getting to us so I realize that the flavor may have been affected somewhat by this.  The breadsticks I thought were a little bit tough and I likely wouldn't get them again. They did have a lot of cheese on them but didn't really make up for the tough dough. The accompanying marinara sauce that came with them was literally to die for. The best marinara I have every eaten. I would buy jars of this stuff. Amazing. This was also the same sauce used on the pizza Yay! That made the pizza for me alone. I would have been happier with more pepperoni, but I want so many you can't see the pizza! The pizza itself was good, I wouldn't say my favorite of all time but I do like the Sicilian style with the thicker crust and like I said, the sauce is to die for. Unfortunately we don't live in the area so we likely won't be back but for those of you who are definitely try it out. Would have loved to try the garlic knots as well. No military discount here."}
{"text":"I ordered off this for delivery off the Yelp eat24 app. I've ordered numerous times and this was one of my best experiences and tasteful pizza. It was very quick with delivery and the pizza was fresh out of the oven, the salad was fresh and I loved even the basic garden salad.   I would definitely recommend ordering from this place as I will be again. Yum!"}
{"text":"Tried papa murphys for the first time today. Great and friendly service and Great pizza."}
{"text":"My family has been in the pizza business for 45 years. I have eaten pizza from all over the world. I know pizza. Las Vegas is quickly becoming the best pizza city on the planet . Sure some would argue New York, Chicago etc. But, Las Vegas gets the best Pizza places from every city that migrates here and opens up a shop. Bruno's is one of those shops. Here is a classic 1970's pizza place that understands that you need great ingredients to make a great pie. The best dough, a unique flavorful sauce , great cheese and toppings. Everything is top quality. The guy below who gave a 1 Star review doesn't know what he's talking about. First , who would dare talk smack about free pizza brought to their work. But to talk smack about what is easily one of the top pizza places in Las Vegas. He must be a hater for sure. Ignore his review . Trust me and the others on here . This pizza place deserves a visit . The people who live around there should be rejoicing . These are owners who care about their product and customers . I came in with my two kids and they brought us out cinnamon rolls on the house . Bite squad delivers and I'm sure Postmates will too. Pizza lovers you need to come and try this for yourself .    Helpful advice :   My only advice to them would be to carry more rare and hard to find bottled sodas and root beers. Those would warrant the price you are asking . Or lower it a buck. Just my two cents"}
{"text":"Just tried Bruno's pizza for the first time! I got a house salad that for $5 was small, but has quality greens ( I'm a huge veggie person so salad is important) I also ordered their pesto pizza with artichokes, tomato, spinach basil ect....... It's HUGE! Great pizza! Quality veggies, perfect crust! I also got a 2 liter soda which was delivered cold out of the refrigerator. Usually 2 liter soda is room temp when delivered so that was a bonus.  Delivery was very fast!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have had pizza from here two times already and both times it's been really good. We will continue to order pizza from here."}
{"text":"This pizza is the Best around. I have search high and low and this is the winner. I can't wait till Las Vegas gets a chance to try. The atmosphere is comfortable and homey. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Living in the Midwest you're spoiled with a plethora of amazing pizzerias whether it be one that specializes in award winning thin crust or your traditional Chicago deep dish. While you have the finest restaurants in the world in Las Vegas, yet sprisingly, finding a shop that makes a decent pie isn't an easy task. Over the five years my husband and I have lived here we tried countless restaurants and finally when we were visiting a friend in this area we stumbled upon the restaurant to via yelp. Needless to say this place took our breath away! The pizza was of the utmost quality! A crisp crust quality homemade sauce and a variety of the most delicious cheeses I've ever had. Well we normally never order chicken wings when it comes to pizza delivery we decided to roll the dice and order some of their traditional barbecue wings. All I can say, is OMG!  This place makes wing stop and any other restaurant that specializes in chicken wings seem like Autre crap. The chicken wings that they serve here are moist thick juicy, and some of the biggest chicken wings I've ever seen. I don't know what kind of sauce they use but I either want the recipe or I I need to buy a vat of it! This place is truly a hidden gem and I've already been back here countless times since then, yet I've never made the point to write a review. To be completely honest, I was a bit hesitant as my husband and I feared that if this place received too many positive reviews and people found out about this incredible shop, then we'd never be able to order a decent pie and have to wait forever for a pizza of supreme quality. But we decided to not be a stubborn selfish kids and share our experience with you.  Trust me, if you know anything about pizza, have a disc concerning pallet, or a picky eater at home this place will always be a win!"}
{"text":"Pizza was really good like Ray's NYC pizza...hubby didn't like skimpy sausage toppings lightly sprinkled on the pizza. I personally prefer cheese, so I liked it.   Wings were really good. Mild was a bit spicy. I wonder how spicy the medium would be.  Had it for carry out with a pizza & wings coupon."}
{"text":"Really really good crust with solid toppings. Unlike most places they put the cheese on top of the toppings. That's better for some things though I like my pepperoni and sausage crisped up.   Bread sticks are made in house and delicious. Ownership clearly takes pride in making a good product. As good as you'd want from a neighborhood casual pizza place."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, Real Deal is it. Good cheese, fresh vege topping. Awesome crust.  My #1 pizza in the neighborhood.  Meat lover is excellent too"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service!!  Just moved to the neighborhood and have been here three times!  Great calzones, good pizza and I love the conversation with the staff!  They are very friendly!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this hidden gem in the southwest part of Vegas. Found it by accident, but wish I had known about Bruno's years ago.   Here's what we ordered: Breadsticks - 2 orders because they're SO good Chicken wings - made my husband and son speechless for once Caesar salad - the homemade salad dressing put it over the top Buffalo chicken pizza was very satisfying and not too spicy.  Big shout out to Zee and the owner/manager for the extraordinary service we received."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best pizza I have had in Vegas, if not ever. I will not be ordering pizza from anywhere else ever again, seriously. Magnificent, superb...there just aren't words to adequately describe it."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, and great pizza. What's not to like?  If you are looking for really good pizza in Richland or Hampton, definitely stop here. Our kids get excited whenever we go here.  They will even sell you dough."}
{"text":"Plain and simple, the pizza is GOOD!!! If you want a fancy joint with luxury seating and attentive servers, you're not gonna get that here... But what you will get is a great conversation with the staff and amazing pizza. The owner, Bruno, is a very down-to-earth type of guy, and you'll love hearing his stories. He specializes in New York style pizza, so if that is what you want, go to Bruno's, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is INCREDIBLE!! I have not found a better pie in the almost 9 months that I have been here in Arizona and we have tried probably 25 places. The food is freshly made and the flavors....OH MAN! We have finally found our pizza home! We have had slices and a whole pie as well as fried mushrooms and everything has been fresh and delicious! The owner is from New York and has that New York sassy/friendly demeanor and he remembers you after only one time visiting.  You find fake nice service all over AZ, but this is real and you can tell be really takes pride in his food and his service!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Fresh ingredients and very yummy. Highly recommended. Very casual and very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved the thin pizza! Had the right crisp, not too much but not missing! Tasted as advertised... NY pizza! Staff is friendly as well! They also serve beer on tap surprisingly enough."}
{"text":"I ordered two pizzas from this place to go I had a coupon for one large 16 inch  cheese pizza and I ordered an extra large 18 inch pizza.when I got the pizzas they were in two different size boxes and when I got homeI open the boxes and realized that the pizzas were the exact same size I measured with a tape measure even I couldn't believe it so I called the business Bruno's and spoke with the someone that was there Who said they were not in charge but they would have the charge person call me back I told him the situation and that's the last I heard of it nobody called me back. I had guests coming over so I was not able to take the pizza back I was very disappointed because I just moved over to this neighborhood and I was looking  forward to having pizza from there cause it was really good the first time I had it. Poor customer service they could've called me back and at least seemed concerned about it I guess they don't need my business"}
{"text":"Short Review: Great pizza, go and check it out!  Long Review: We had a card for a free pizza and finally got a chance to get over there to check it out. Cute little place, very clean and everybody was really friendly. The waitress actually told me about checking in on Yelp to get a free breadsticks appetizer which I thought was very nice especially since our pizza was already free.  The chef even came out and talked to my husband for a while and seemed to be out and about in the dining area talking to people (and even refilled sodas!) which always makes me feel like they really care about what they are making, so I thought that was great.   On to the pizza, I was worried when first going that it was going to be that flat greasy type of pizza that everyone seems to love (and I hate) but it wasn't at all. It was really poofy (for lack of a better word, lol) and the large was HUGE! It was really good, and VERY filling! Not a skimpy pizza at all, we didn't even finish half between 3 of us! I really liked the crust and everything tasted very fresh. The breadsticks were also really yummy, lots of garlic, which I love :-)  Prices are very reasonable, especially considering how filling the pizza is. A large will easily feed a family of 4, probably with leftovers. We also noticed they had a lunch special, 2 slices and a drink or 1 slice, salad and a drink, for $6 (I think) which I think is really a great price for the quality of pizza, so we are looking forward to coming in for that one day.  We are definitely glad we checked them out and I think this will be our new go to for pizza night, between the price and the quality I think they would be hard to beat!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give them 1 star but I had to. We got there and there was nobody in there. We ordered, my sister ordered, we got our food 15min later, still 30 min went by and yet my sister still had no food, just ordered pizza and wings. They asked where their food was and they hadn't even started making it. A cheese pizza and wings. Then they brought them a pizza in a box and open it and it was a pepperoni pizza that belonged to someone else. Still hadn't made the cheese pizza. Needless to say they went home with no pizza and 20 wings. Very disappointed..."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late-lunch and the guys at Bruno's were great! They quickly took our order and while they were making the pie we got to chat a little. It made me feel like I was with friends and this was my own little neighborhood hangout.  They have a great, quiet atmosphere, amazing customer service and the pizza is incredible. I would wager to say it's the best pizza I've ever had. I highly recommend trying Bruno's when you've got a craving for delicious and quality pizza that's right around the corner and doesn't cost a arm and a leg."}
{"text":"Their pizza is decent but nothing worth ordering from again. We ordered their version of a supreme pizza which was just average. They had plenty of toppings but the crust was too bland and soft. Overall, the pizza is just average."}
{"text":"Good pizza, clean restaurant. Check the specials or they'll be glad to overcharge you.... just soaked my kids and I for an extra $10. Bring your own ice. Owner is aware the machine is broke and well, not a priority. If you beg he'll get you some from the \"back\"."}
{"text":"Wanted a no frills, but good, pizza. Brunos is the place! One page menu is all that is needed. We ordered the garden salad. For $5 we were not expecting a full salad bowl, but that is exactly what we got! The ranch dressing was housemade and delicious. We were given an order of breadsticks on the house, also delicious. Our wings and pizza, the Real Deal, came out shortly after. All was excellent. No other customers dined in while we did, but several picked up and there were many deliveries. We will definitely come back and this may become our regular spot."}
{"text":"Underrated. Better than the ultra-hyped Pizza Rock.  Chef hubby noted that he could differentiate their superb pizza from others through Bruno's use of fresh, quality ingredients, & whole milk cheese. The crust is slightly burnt, but intentionally & just enough: for the sole purpose of enhancing the flavor of the pizza -- not because the ovens haven't been scrubbed clean, as was the case with that other hyped pizza place.  Good value, good service, now 1 of our favorite pizza places here in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Best pizza place in Vegas  They have really great costumer service. They take the time to speak with you and get to know you. I would really recommend to stop by and try their pizza. My favorite is The Real Deal, it's the real deal."}
