{"text":"I'm giving China Sea Express only two stars, but I do go here quite frequently.  Why?  The food is perfectly adequate and it's only $6 for the buffet - it's a bargain! Keep that in mind as you read.

I work less than five minutes from here, so it's convenient, and I have to admit that when I think about paying $7 for a sandwich or a salad at a nearby shop, or paying $6 for the buffet, my frugality often leads me back to the trough.

The place is clean and the staff is attentive, and the lunch crowd keeps it busy.  There's a real mix of business people and students from CSU.  It's also heartening to see that a lot of the Asian students go here for lunch, although they rarely seem to order the buffet, and I'm not really surprised, because I don't think it really even approximates authentic Chinese cuisine.

There are a few items I favor: the curry chicken skewers, the General Tso's chicken; the peanut butter chicken and the green beans with black bean sauce are my usual fare.  I try to limit myself to two plates, but sometimes I go back for a third, and I'm rarely glad I did.

The peanut butter chicken is something that is unique to my Cleveland Chinese food experience.  I have seen it at other restaurants, but never in California or anywhere else I have gone.  It's creamy and a little sweet, but very tasty and has to be hell on your arteries.

I don't really care for the Cleveland style sweet and sour chicken either, which is merely strips of chicken that have been battered and deep friend - almost like fish.  You take as many of these as you want and then just ladle that sweet red glaze over them.  That's not the kind of sweet and sour I grew up with, and it doesn't appeal to me.

I find their eggrolls a bit bland, as well as their vegetable low mien.  I avoid the pork stuff and anything with shrimp, so I can't comment on their taste, but they look perfectly, generically acceptable for Chinese buffet fare.

I always want it to be better, but it is certainly reliable in its mediocrity, and I will continue to frequent the place, as long as I'm working in the vicinity."}
{"text":"Very helpful when I stopped in Tuesday night for some to go food.  I let them know that I was trying to stay on my diet and they have a lower calorie section on their menu.  They suggested the steamed rice but I really was in the mood for fried rice so they said they would use almost no oil and wow was it delicious.  They deliver and are almost always open on Sunday.  My entire meal beef & broccoli w fried rice & egg roll was only $7.  This was enough food for a few meals for me.  They have been here 22 years which is not a surprise to me."}
{"text":"China Sea, is located right next to Playhouse Square. I went there once while going to school at Cleveland State. The price is not bad but the food is just not that great. You should save yourself the trip and not par take in its bland mediocre food. 

The inside is large and has enough sitting for a lunch rush but there was no one else in there. The food took longer then normal to get even though it was extremely slow. The waitress doesn't seem to care about her job, walking and talking in a unprofessional way. 

Find another place."}
{"text":"OK, here's a secret.  You know how in some Chinese restaurants there is the \"regular menu\" and the secret \"Chinese menu\" for people who, you know, speak Chinese?  The secret to getting great food at this little hole in the wall restaurant is talking to the wait staff or owner and asking to try some food from the Chinese menu.  At a friend's (who has far more distinguished taste than myself) recommendation, a friend and I tried this place for dinner last night.  They have really authentic Taiwanese food.  The things that I tried were some homestyle classics- ask for \"Ma po dofu\" (a spicy, hearty tofu and pork stew'ish thing) or \"neeo-ro-mien\" a hearty beef noodle soup.  Prices are good for this level of authentic food.  Only place I know in the Cleveland area to get authentic Taiwanese food.  I also hear their \"Jia-Jiang Mien\" is good (a dry noodle in a savory brown sauce dish).

Skip the buffet- ask the waiter for recommendations on the Taiwanese food from the Chinese menu.  They are eager to please and to show the world what authentic Taiwanese food tastes like.  Then see if you really think this place is a one or two star place.  

I'm not sure why the other three good reviews have been voted down."}
{"text":"Went there for some sushi...it was okay.  I don't remember what I got but it is definitely no Sushi Rock or Wasabi, lol.  Something quick to get for lunch.  I might go there again.  When I went inside to take a look at the so-called buffet...it wasn't much to choose from, that is why I opted to get sushi to go.  The buffet looked not so appealing."}
{"text":"Do not be alarmed when you walk in and see patrons eating with knives and forks.

I have to admit that I was a little skeptical at first, but because of strong and highly reputable word of mouth recommendations, I headed to China Sea Express to try out their secret menu Taiwanese food.

I was saddened when Garden Cafe (a small Taiwanese restaurant) closed because of the hole that it left for good beef noodle soup (\"niu rou mien\"). Beef noodle soup in Cleveland is BACK. 

We came on a Saturday evening right before a performance at Playhouse Square so it was a little busy. However, we were promptly seated. The waitress redirected us to the owner for our special off-menu order. 

My bf and I both had beef noodle soup ($6.95) -- \"hong sao niu rou mien\". The beef noodle soup broth was sooo good... very flavorful and authentic! I could distinctly taste that carrots had been stewing in the broth for many hours. The noodles and the beef (says the bf) were pretty decent, though not mindblowing. I'd definitely recommend the dish just for the broth though!

Since he has a good eye, he spotted the platter of handmade dumplings on the table behind us. Apparently they make beef and pork dumplings by hand. We ordered some dumplings ($6.95) and they had pretty good flavor and thick dumpling skin. Not the highest presentation points as it was clearly handmade, but we definitely thought they were pretty good.

The owner and his wife came over and chatted with us for a while. They are Taiwanese, and while they are very fluent English speakers, speaking in Mandarin with them definitely helped us connect better. I'd give this place an extra half star because of how hospitable they were to us. They told us that they don't put MSG in their food (at least off-menu?) because it's what they like to eat themselves. Huge plus.

I would love to go back. My next question for them is... do they have tomato beef noodle soup? (fan qie niu rou mien?) If they do... game over. drool."}
{"text":"Mike C. is right!   This place has good authentic Taiwanese food.

I went for the Jia-jiang Mein--  good stuff.   Thick white noodles with ground pork and a soybean paste.  Spicy.  Good.

Large dining space.  Nice peeps.  Super value.

the only lingering question is...   how will i feel in the morning?...

Update:   minimal diarrhea!   great success!!"}
{"text":"Being raised in Taiwan, I was so excited to try China Sea Express after hearing all the great recommendations from my Taiwanese friends and about how the owner and his wife is from Taiwan. That being said... i will more than likely come back to this place again to give it a shot, but for now, i'd say it's not my top 5 favorite restaurant in town quite yet. 

Also, don't be fooled by the storefront and the name. This place is more authentic than the name gives it and it's wayyyy bigger than it looks from the outside. give it a shot!

Beef Noodle Soup (3.8): This is the first time I've had beef noodle soup (niu ro mien) in Cleveland so it's hard to compare. I'd say it's pretty authentic to what I would've expected. The good news is... I have to applaud China Sea Express for using authentic beef noodle soup noodles- that's pretty rare to find in Cleveland (specially after all those failed 'ramen' restaurants in CLE). That really excited me. The beef is pretty authentic too with a good portion. The only thing was that the broth was a bit too much on the sweet side so if they could improve on the broth, it would be a pretty decent dish!

Steam & Fried Dumplings (4): my favorite part of the meal was their dumplings. It's homemade and although the dumplings are really small (I can probably eat 30 of their dumplings), the flavors and the skin is good!!! I recommend the pork & cabbage FRIED dumpling. 

Mapo Tofu (3): This was recommended by the owner and it was a bit better than i expected. The only issue (common issue at this restaurant) is that all i taste is the spice and the sweetness of the dish. I was expecting more salt + spice, not sugar + spice.

Green Beans + Pork (3): This dish does remind me of home since my mom cooks it alot. The saltiness flavor was there (yay) but it wasn't authentic. 

HOWEVER, after trying their green beans + pork dish, i'm very very curious about their jia-jiang mien. only because the pork sauce they used in the green beans dish tastes like jia-jiang mien sauce. 

China Sea Express, I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is like the McDonald's of Chinese food. When I worked downtown, we'd head here about once a week or so to get out of the office and I would almost always get the Peanut Chicken, which would put me in a sodium coma for the rest of the day. You know, sometimes you just need that. Life ain't all Skittles and beer."}
{"text":"Is there some sort of contest for cramming the most sodium into every bite of beef and broccoli?  If so, China Sea wins.  I just walked past the lake and the water level dipped.  That is how much salt is now in my body.  

It's a pity-- the delivery is uber fast and the veggies are nice and crisp-tender.  But there is no flavor aside from salt.  Lots and lots of salt.  Salty, salty salt."}
{"text":"The food here is not very good quality, it made me feel a little sick after eating it. It's cheap but not good quality. If you want good Chinese in Cleveland stick to a chain restaurant or something more well known!"}
