{"text":"Well that lasted two weeks? I'm now going to cancel my membership to the $3 Juice club. Came in today and had THE WORST customer service.  * Employee working was very rude and unwelcoming when I walked in and placed my order...  * She asked if she needed to write on the bottles what Juice it was when why wouldn't you?? It would be nice to confirm what is in the bottle!   * I was forced to place the caps on myself and she filled the bottles over the top so Juice spilled all over my hands and she had the decency to tell me I put the caps on wrong she didn't do anything wrong!  * She also failed to tell me she had orders to fulfill from next door first and that I would have to wait a few minutes (would have just been a nice heads up so I wasn't confused why I saw her putting Juice in cups instead of bottles)  This is why I felt no need to tip her. I'm very disappointed as I had such a great experience my first visit. Luckily I bought enough in my two visits to cover the $10 monthly charge. I still have two weeks left of my membership but I don't even know how to go back after today that was horrible and makes me want to spend $6 a Juice at Pressed Juicery instead."}
{"text":"We tried a couple of juices here on a Sunday afternoon. The counter is neat and the service is friendly.  Basically, you are going to be paying ALOT for some juice. It tastes really good and might be \"healthier\" for you than, say, a bottle of mixed juice you could get at the supermarket across the street, but really, it's just juice.  So, if you got a few extra bucks burning a hole in your pocket and you want some juice that comes in a neat cup, this place will hit the spot. Otherwise, I don't know, drink some water and eat a banana?"}
{"text":"I love it!!!! I was spending $10-$13 daily on just one juice at fruits and roots and the juice standard . Cold press express is way convenient and way more cost effective, and you can customize what you would like in your juice!!!!! Unlimited $3 drinks after membership of $10 a month is a great deal! If you have ever bought a juicer you know how much time it takes to prepare all lthe ingredients,  this just gave me back hours of my life !!!! Thank you"}
{"text":"I came here to waste some time as I was waiting for an appointment at another business. I was nervous about their strange juice options and decided to pick one of their specials since I'm sure if I tried to make my own it would be horrible. I got the Berry Bucha Bomb. I was really surprised at how delicious it is!!! So refreshing. The price was $8.95 which I felt was on the higher end but maybe I'm just cheap. It does taste worth the money though. Like...\"wow\" good."}
{"text":"I came in today to the juice shop and was greeted by the most cheerful lady, she was tall with long hair. I told her I was tired and thirsty. She made me the most delicious cold brew coffee, almond milk, date, hazelnut iced drink. It was perfect. I will definitely be coming back.  The shop itself is clean and bright. I only wish I had a stool so I could have stayed longer."}
{"text":"I love this cold press juice spot! I joined the $10 a month juice club and all my juices are $3! I go here at least once a week and stock up. Kelly is amazing she's like a mixologist but with juices! She's knowledgeable about the supplements and makes kombutcha taste like apple pie! Even my daughter drinks it with no problem! My favorites are kombatbucha (tastes like apple pie) and the face lift (yummy green juice with chlorophyll). If you like juice this is a must try!! If you buy juice more than once a month the $10 juice club is a steal!!"}
{"text":"Just tried this location and was impressed. I like being able to just run in on the juice side and not have to go through the regular restaurant.      I ordered the Minteral smoothie which was chocolate and mint it was yummy. My boyfriend had a Chocolate Foogazi, his was way more complex with chocolate, banana, dates, Maca powder, and some other stuff . Prices were a little high but that comes with the quality. They have juices and shots so stop in and make sure you look at the specials board!"}
{"text":"GOOD Damn right it's 5 stars!  I luuuuuvvv the shakes from here.   MY personal go to is the Minternal Affair with no mint and substitute banana....OMG...just think chocolate malt ball with little cocoa nibs that swirl around your tongue and you just can't wait to crunch between your teeth.  If I'm not mistaken it's where skinny fats punch was born....another great refreshing drink in the summer...order with extra ice...makes it last longer....brain freeze galore!!  BAD Yes it's kinda pricey for a shake but it's sooo worth it.  Quality ingredients and always so fresh. Bring your patience cause greatness takes time...thanks SkinnyFATS family for always making my belly and taste buds so happy  5 stars all around for everyone!"}
