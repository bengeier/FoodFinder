{"text":"Great Restaurant with great service and amazing food. Not your typical Italian menu that every other Italian restaurant has. If you like steak try it at Prop best steak in town! Such a nice addition to the St Clair West community."}
{"text":"This place is great . The only drawback is the fact that they put pepper on most of their food, and I mean a lot of pepper. That is like a slap in the face to pepper loathers everywhere."}
{"text":"For those who enjoy Italian, and really who doesn't, then you are not limited to Pizza, especially when there are exquisite Italian restaurants like Prop. It was a Friday night, and we were out with another couple - so I was forced to order fish -but  I was not disappointed - we shared, shrimp crostini, salmon ricotta crostini and grilled sardines as an appetitizer, (I'm sure the other couple ate more than their share) - the apps were thoughtfully prepared, and abundant in fish. Not to mention that having such a variety of fish to choose from is a rarity. The mains (no sharing) we had a hearty fish stew,  grilled salmon and the special Spigola and- Sea Bream - wow, this isn't even a seafood restaurant. we were overwhelmed, the fish properly cooked - showing off the true flavour and proper texture of the fish - beautifully prepared. But it's not just seafood, it's a fine Italian dining, at very reasonable pricing -  I watched other tables enjoy a liver dish, and risotto nero, a black ink risotto.  The portions are filling and you don't feel bloated, and the freshness and quality of the dishes sets Prop ahead of some of the other restaurants in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Brunch is delicious, with lots of fruit on the side. Way more than just a \"garnish\", which is great. Unfortunately, the staff are rude and snobby. I went for dinner a few weeks ago, and was greatly disappointed. I was the happy to see they had mussels on the specials for the night, but had already run out by our 7:00pm reservation. Very disappointed overall."}
{"text":"We wound up here last Sunday around 1ish for a default brunch when we found our first choice closed.  I had the eggs florentine--eggs overcooked on a bed of elderly (yellowish flowers) rapini--and sampled the fritada which was a little dry.  The service was o.k. but not great.  We had one coffee refill offer which came within minutes of the coffee after which the pot disappeared, and we had to ask twice to get a bit  of salt.  After this, a concensus emerged that coffee and desert there was not in the cards.  In short, it wasn't terrible but it just wasn't good."}
{"text":"Delicious food at a very fair price. Marinated sardines appetizer was delicious. I had the calf liver for my main and it was outstanding! Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Yesterday, my husband and I took possession of our first, ever, house.  After a brief, dewy-eyed walk through - touching all the walls and grinning from ear to ear, we decided to explore the neighbourhood.  We are steps from St. Clair and so we walked along the strip in search of our first meal as home owners.

Prop seemed to fit the bill.  It was nice but not excessively expensive and had an interesting menu that included truffle risotto (yum!) and spaghetti with ginger, black mission figs and peppercorn (ooh!). 

The waitress sat us quickly and took our drink order.  Unfortunately, the wine we wanted wasn't available by the glass (we were saving ourselves for the bottle of champagne that waited in our fridge back home).  In fact, no wine was available by the glass other than their house wine - quite a disappointment. 

Appetizers were quite good and just the right size.  Orange and fresh fennel salad had a lovely salt/sweet balance with some italian black olives.  The mushroom polenta was homey and flavourful.  

Mains were more disappointing.  I had salmon with vegetables and, while the waitress promised a pink middle, my fish was overcooked, as were the veggies.  My husband ordered a simple penne and tomato sauce, but asked the waitress if the kitchen could make it spicy.  His pasta was good (yummy, but not mind-blowing) but when we got the bill, they had charged him $3 extra for giving him the spicy sauce.  This took his simple penne and sauce up to $17.  Bad karma (and bad business), we thought.  

Our meals were okay, but I'm not sure we'll be back.  There are just so many great places to explore on the St. Clair strip...

Vegetarian score: 7/10.  Like most italian places, there are some good pasta options.  Non-pasta/risotto mains are all meat."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and this restaurant always looked so cozy. We tried it a few times and I have to post something because I was so baffled. First time, the place was half fyll, we had no reservation and we walked in and the waitress (an older woman) at the bar ignored us even though she could clearly see we were waiting to be seated - she made eye contact a few times -- until finally we asked if there was room and she said no -- she wa so rude. A year later, we decide to try it -- again, food mediocore for the price and the service jaw droppingly bad and rude. A million other restaurants in the area. Never going back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and really great service.

Everything here was great. We arrived just as they opened and scored a spot right by the window. Our server was incredibly friendly, professional and helpful. 

The Hubster started off with a caesar salad which was their special version with whole romaine leaves and a disappointing dearth of croutons and bacon. I had the white salad which had fennel, pear, frisee and possibly something else. I loved it. It was the perfect balance of sweet, salty, bitter and sour. It was literally all white, which made every bite a crunchy flavour surprise.

The Hubster had the meatball rigatoni ragu which was the daily special and I had the pancetta bucatini. I tried some of his rigatoni before it got cheesed and it was AMAZING. My pasta was also very good, but on the salty side. The sauce and pasta were perfect. I think they may actually use the same brand of pasta we eat at home, and I'm not inspired to cook it just a tiny bit less to make it more al dente. 

Pastas are roughly $16-18 each, and they are perfectly portioned. I think we'll definitely be back next time we're craving delicious pasta. I had an incredibly tough time deciding what to order on the menu, and I can't wait to go back and try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"In my opinion, even the world's greatest food cannot offset terrible service. 

So, imagine how I felt when terrible service is combined with pricey mediocre food.

From the moment we walked through the door to the moment we left the restaurant, we were made to feel very unwelcome, almost as if we were being intrusive. And that feeling began even before I showed our server a gift certificate I got from a work raffle.

Our server didn't bother doing a quality check for any of our dishes. Although for our mains, I saw that he thought about doing one, but then decided not to. We were not asked if we wanted to order any more drinks. Nobody said thank you when we left the restaurant.

I hope that doesn't make me sound picky and whiny. I don't always expect above-and-beyond service whenever I dine out (although that would be nice), but I do expect standard service with a side of friendliness. We definitely did not receive that at PROP.

Finally, given the name of the restaurant and the prices, I was very surprised that they didn't serve fresh pasta."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in the neighbourhood. Great food, wines. My favourite appetizer is their Caesar salad, which is the best I've ever had, anywhere. 

Huge wine list, not too pricey, unless you want. 

As for mains, everything I've ordered I like.  I moved into the area last year, and I've been to Prop probably 20-25 times. Service is a little hot and cold, but they bring you good food and that's enough for me. 

Solid Italian."}
{"text":"This place is close but not quite hitting the mark.  Pros - Nice bar areas with some local crowds, can always get a table, funky atmosphere.  Cons - over engineered pastas  (really, do we need asian fusion when you don't have the basics?) - for such a long menu I struggle each time to find more than one or two things to try.  Also the finishes are cheap and the dinning areas looks a bit messy at the back - like they ran out of money while decorating.  Finally, it is fairly pricey - went for dinner on a week night without wine and still spent over $60.  

I will go back because I live in the area, but would not tell you to rush."}
{"text":"This place just opened last year on St. Clair West near Rushton so my wife and I decided to check it out.

PROP stands for the People's Republic of Pasta, which is cute and evocative but I think doesn't do the place justice. Some really interesting and yummy dishes here, and the menu is enticing and makes me want to go back a second time.

I had the Bucatini with pancetta and spicy tomato sauce. SO GOOD. The pasta was done perfectly and the sauce simple but flavorful.

My wife had the Risotto special, the ingredients of which escape me right now but it was also fantastic.

The starter was a cheesy bread with prosciutto, I couldn't eat much of it, but it tasted great.

It was highly affordable, the wine selection was decent for my tastes, and it was an enjoyable evening.

Cons: It was a bit cold in there, wish they had the heat on a bit, the service was a bit slow, as they were catering to a group of really obnoxiously loud people, which also ruined the experience a bit. But whatever, no big deal.

We'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Customer service is brutal, food is mediocre to bad, and the owner is just a horrible mean human being, treats customers like garbage. Avoid."}
{"text":"I've been to PROP about a dozen times now.  I've had a great deal of the menu, and enjoyed everything, but especially like the white bean and sausage risotto and the shrimp crostini. The desserts are all homemade and really delicious as well as fresh. These aren't fancy dishes, they're simpler dishes done well. 

The atmosphere is pleasant, it feels like a nice place without feeling uptight. Service has always been polite and pleasant.  There's a summer patio as well!"}
{"text":"We ended up at PROP by fluke. I usually check places out before we go but long story, here we were. We were warmly greeted and seated for dinner.  Our server was lovely and very welcoming and friendly.  The decor of PROP was very nice.  It would be a very nice place to have a nice dinner with friends/family if you don't mind the prices!

I found the menu a bit pricey.  No big value for money here.  The complimentary bread is more like 4 big croutons.  The food was good but I just felt it was too expensive for the area and for what it really was... $15 for penne with tomato sauce (really?!).  Wine is quite expensive too.  Pinot Grigo is $10 for 5 oz or $15 for 8 oz.  

I had a hard time choosing a pasta to eat.  I wish they didn't have the \"no substitutions\" clause at the bottom of the menu.  I recently became lactose intolerant and found it hard to find a pasta that I liked that did not have cream sauce so I ended up just ordering the penne with tomato sauce.  Being \"new\" to this condition, I'm still figuring out how to order-around dairy which I love. Even though I mentioned my lactose intolerance to the server and how I would like to order the italian sausage pasta except it had cream sauce, she did not offer that I could change the sauce.

Bottom line, it was very nice but I just felt it was a bit expensive."}
{"text":"Went to Prop a for a second time last week (first time was a year ago).  I live in the hood so I really do pray for local restaurants to hit the mark and be successful but Prop just misses the mark.  My wife  and I eat out locally at least once per week so I wold imagine I am just the kind of customer Prop would like to see come back as a regular.

My first time up to the plate at Prop, expectations were high so it was only natural that it was difficult for them to be met, let alone exceeded.  With lowered expectations for my second at bat here, I thought for sure they could rise to the occasion and I was looking forward to being pleasantly surprised.  Sadly, the food was mediocre once again (especially considering the price)...not bad but not great.  Service was better this time around but then again, it was quieter than the first time which surprised me for a Friday evening at 7pm.   

Come on Prop!  You can do better I know you can!  I am rooting for you.  See you next year for my third time to the plate (pun intended)."}
{"text":"There was nothing overtly horrifying about my experience at PROP, but I can definitely say the entire experience was very \"meh\". 

The food was tasty, but pretty pricey for items that you can get at most Italian places. The service was very slow and inattentive - we had to ask to order and to get a dessert menu. Our waitress also never asked how things were or if we needed anything. 

Not a horrible experience, but to sum it up in a few words PROP WAS NOTHING SPECIAL. 

***they do have a bring your own wine night on Tuesdays, which I thought was cool. $5.00 corking fee!"}
{"text":"Best risotto in Toronto.  I personally can only order sausage and white bean risotto.   So delicious and peppery.  I'm so addicted to it!  Outdoor patio  is cozy and intimate.  Pastas are generous and fish soup was superb.   Such a gem of a place."}
{"text":"Prop always smells better than its food tastes.  It's two-steps up from an East Side Mario's but two steps down from a Ferro.  We've been a few times and it's ok but has never lived up to our expectations.  That may be their fault, that may be ours.  I'm not sure.

I had a great fungi but a very boyardee spaghetti and meatballs.  Penne with a basic bolognese was initially good but in the end so salty that I needed a beer.  The taglatelle with peas, prosciutto and shrimp was excellent in flavour but the pasta was so dente that you had to remind yourself to chew it.

Avoid the fusion dishes.  Expect a portion slightly smaller than you'd like and for the food to be not hot enough.

The Big Ragu at Lansdowne and St Clair doesn't have as hip a vibe but the food is better.  Choose Prop if the atmosphere is more important than the food, although lately it's been feeling a little tired.  The guys smoking out on the patio pre-supper isn't a particular attraction either.  That's the last thing the St. Clair Strip needs, another patio with sketchy smoking men.

The saving grace is the brunch - excellent, excellent, excellent - and not your standard greasy sausage fare either.  Interesting that a pasta place exceeds expectations at the one meal where pasta largely isn't present."}
