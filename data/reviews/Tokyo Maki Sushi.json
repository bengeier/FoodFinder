{"text":"I go to this place all the time and i think it is one of the best all you can eat sushi!
You place your order with an ipad bit you have to wait for a server to send the order to the kitchen which slows the process down.
Service is usually quick - ive never had to wait to be seated.  Atmosphere is great. Variety and taste of sushi and sushimi is pretty good too.
However, the staff could be a bit friendlier.."}
{"text":"The interior design is great... the food... is ok.

I am not a fan of mayo.... and this restaurant uses it on almost every dish. To me using mayo at a restaurant is just an easy way out, this isn't supposed to be \"home quality\"- this is a RESTAURANT!!! I would expect the chef to make a fresh garnish/dressing daily, and take pride in his/her creation."}
{"text":"Tokyo Maki is the restaurant I most frequent to when I am craving sushi. It is located right across the street from Shoppers World mall and the Brampton bus terminal which is really convenient. The restaurant itself is nice and modern, although it could use a little dusting but that's fine. 

The service is not spectacular or anything, but it is adequate. Since the food is ordered through an Ipad, there isn't really any communication between you and your server. It's alright because the food is always quick and dishes are always taken away. Our server was also quick to replenish our drinks whenever we were running low. 

On to the food! I have been going here for a couple of years now and the food has always met my expectations! The raw sashimi is really fresh tasting, the hand rolls are delicious, and the green tea ice cream was mouth watering. One food to avoid though is the sushi pizza. It just doesn't taste good. But to be honest, you shouldn't even order sushi pizza at any sushi establishment. 

All in all, Tokyo Maki is one of the gems of Brampton! The food is great, the service is efficient and it is extremely affordable for an AYCE! I would recommend everyone to dine at Tokyo Maki at least once!"}
{"text":"Ordered a few items a la carte - love the tempura veggies, had the salmon skin roll - yum! Very disappointed with the calamari as they give you tentacles instead of the white part and the batter was heavy & the whole thing was chewy & hard.  Been to many other places where the calamari was tender & batter was light & crispy.
Brown rice spicy salmon sushi was just ok same as the salmon avocado sushi.  Probably not going back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch , poor selection . Poor quality . Overall did not enjoy this place . It's nice inside though . Server was friendly but unorganized , received miso and salads last on order (had to ask to remind her)."}
{"text":"Food is sub-par and service was disappointing. If you complain about something, be prepared to have it be made your fault. Not impressed. 

Also, when I received my second refill of gingerale, it was half full. The server's excuse? There were too many bubbles. Really? Ever hear of waiting and refilling accordingly?

So disappointed! 

Don't order:
- any meat unless you enjoy eating only jerky
- calamari (disgusting...only served the tentacles and they were not cleaned properly)
- sushi pizza (bland...missing a lot of flavour)
- chicken wings (bland and overly battered)
- any sushi because the rice was old and didn't have good flavour"}
{"text":"Coming here since they opened. Ordered Philadelphia roll and it came with small amount of cream cheese. Told them to redo it and they gave me 2 slices instead."}
{"text":"My sister &I  come here quite often since it is walking distance.  It has a nice interior design.  Food is okay. Servers are nice.  The manager who helps out, doesn't smile; when he gives us our food he doesn't say anything."}
{"text":"Came with the family to try the food but sad to say I'm disappointed. We like the ipad ordering but  the food is not the best, i don't even know if they are using a teriyaki sauce or something else. 

The service is a little slow and you can't send your order until a server enter their code on the ipad so a lot of waiting. 

Well it was a good try i guess but won't try it again."}
{"text":"Ummm...no.... I've had better sushi for the same price. Everything was bland. Their sashimi was not too bad, but that's the only food I actually enjoyed. The food was bad that my boyfriend and I didn't want to stay any longer to try desserts. 

Anyways, I would give this place a pass, but there're definitely more better sushi restaurants out there in Brampton."}
{"text":"Im not a fan of sushi, but they had much more to offer. Great tasting food with a unique atmosphere. I'll be back."}
{"text":"There has been a lot of AYCE sushi restaurants popping up in the area lately with Tokyo Maki being one of them. I've been to this restaurant a few times seeing as it is a tad close to home but never had the chance to review it so here goes:

The owners of the restaurant did a great job at remodeling what use to be various fast-food joints (Fried chicken, Wendy's. . . .) They've utilized a modern decor with darker colours and nicely dimmed lighting that creates a great ambience (The decor is my favourite thing about the place.)

Their dinner menu includes about 200 items for $20.95 (Lunch is cheaper at around $12.00 but with less items to choose from). 

Since the restaurant opening, I think my liking of the place has declined. 

On the first few visits when I filled an order, there were many times that an order would have been forgotten or someone else's order would have been placed on our table. I figured since it was a new establishment the staff was just getting into the swing of things, but on the last visit (late December 2010) this was still happening. However, the wait staff all seem friendly. 

The nori on the sushi seemed a tad drier than others I've had but the rolls were still good. 

Presentation of the food is always nice.

Overall, this restaurant has landed on my \"Just-OK\" list. But if a friend or relative asks about a great sushi place I may just recommend 168 a few streets over. =]"}
{"text":"The place to really eat with a big set of friends. Fast service, chunky sashimi and crunchy tempura, I am one happy camper!  This AYCE definitely is a good choice."}
{"text":"The food here is great, as well is the service and price. Me and my girlfriend frequent this establishment often. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not bad for all-you-can-eat sushi! I liked this place for what it was. It's housed in an old fast food franchise building, so the set up feels a little cheap, but it's been renovated to sort of resemble a restaurant. The food was good, and easy to order, but definitely not anything fancy. Staff was polite and the price was affordable. Really the big draw is just the all-you-can-eat option, because if you're looking for a fine dining experience, this isn't the place. However, it's good for what it is, so if you're in the mood to eat your body weight in salmon sashimi, might as well stop in!"}
{"text":"I have been to AYCE restaurants in downtown Toronto, North York, Scarborough, Hamilton, Ottawa, London Ont., Newmarket, Vaughn, Brockville, Mississauga and Brampton. The meal that I had today at Tokyo Maki Sushi was probably the worst meal of the lot. The Kitchen items were very overcooked. For example, the Yakitori was 2 pieces of dark brown meat that may at one time have been chicken. The rolls that I tried were marginally edible. I wish that I had not ordered something called a Cowboy Roll. I tried the Spicy Crab Meat Salad and the Spicy Dynamite Roll. They were covered with some orange goop that had a touch of spice. Finally, I am not sure how you can mess up Banana Tempura, but Tokyo Maki found a way to do so. 

On the plus side, the restaurant looks good and service today was OK. Some people seem to be impressed by the Ipad menu, but even here, Tokyo Maki took a short cut. I have been to several other restaurants that use Ipad's and all of them employed a more sophisticated and easier to use program. Ipad menu's might be trendy; but since the food was not enjoyable, I have no interest in returning."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I have ever experienced. Took 25 minutes to even get a drink, the staff barely spoke any English. We were brought 3 separate dishes that we did not order. They refused to honour their free meal system, and were very rude and abrasive. I DO NOT recommend going here! There are so many better sushi restaurants in Brampton, this one should really just go out of business already."}
{"text":"Editting my review to include my check in from today!

Had my review set to 4/5 before, for the great food, but long wait times, but then:

Came in for Mother's Day! Despite the crowded room, we were seated pretty quickly, and we were really grateful, my mom has a condition that makes standing too long very painful. They even gave her a folding chair to sit on for our (brief) wait! The food was great (especially the chicken wings and salmon sashimi) and service was awesome this afternoon from the manager and young man serving us,  even with the completely bustling tables! 5/5!"}
{"text":"Tokyo Maki Sushi was on my radar to try for 4 years now, so glad  I finally ate here.  The atmosphere was very modern and clean. Being a tech girl, I was impressed with the ipad ordering system. However I felt the system was slowed down by getting the server to process the order.  Being our first visit, I was a bit disapointed that no one explained the ordering system, however we figured it out just fine.

This visit we had a lot of the fried foods, because I did not realize the ipad menu slid further right with more options.  On my next visit I am interested in over indulging in the chefs specials of sushi. They all sounded so intriguing. 

Note worthy dishes to try:  

1) I had the pleasure of trying the Kamikaze Roll, which was delicious, fresh and awesome!   
2) The teriyaki beef was tender and juicy; and what I liked best is the sauce did not over power the natural beef flavour.  
3)  The mocha cake was fit for royalty, light, fluffy and full of flavour, but not over sweet. 
4) I drank a lot of green tea, it was delicious, not too pungent. 

Pop and tea were included in the price. Our dinner of two AYCE costed just under $60 with tip. This will be my new regular sushi place for a while, at  least until I try all the chef special rolls :)

I deducted 1 star due to air temperature. It was cold in the restaurant, we had to wear our coats throughout nearly the whole dinner, which was really uncomfortable and considering how much hot tea I drank, I should have been feeling hot. At first, I thought it was cold air coming through the door opening and closing, but as I walked around the restaurant I felt a lot of drafts. The building must be poorly insulated."}
{"text":"$30 (some change) for two people is not bad for all you can eat. The place is clean but really busy. They have the new digital Menu ( basically have iPad) on all the table for you to order so you can see picture in digital as to what you will be ordering , I would say a good way to approach the customers.  Since it was busy the service was a little slow and I understand just because it was busy but I like my food on the table however I had to wait for my order every time I finish my plate which kinda lose my appetite because I hate waiting for my food or should say more food to come. 
Oh I was also told that since I order 80 pieces which is they think a little too much so they will bring my order in intervals but really I don't want to be told how I would like to eat my order so next time I would rather have my 80 pieces on the table for me to choose from :) 

Otherwise good food and I would go again 
Thanks"}
{"text":"Tokyo Maki Sushi is the family's go-to AYCE sushi joint. We visited recently and it seems like they've done some renovations - the dusty paper flower decorations that used to sit on the ledges are gone, and that's a good thing! The place also looks brighter and more modern.

We went for a late dinner (around 8 PM) and I can definitely say that the service has improved. The waitresses were easy to call over when we wanted to send our orders in. Another waiter had actually come by and asked how the food was.

Food-wise, it's decent. My menu favourites are the salmon sashimi, chicken skewers, and the spicy raw tuna roll. The white tuna sashimi was kind of dry. Drinks (pop and green tea) here are free with free refills so that's always a bonus."}
{"text":"This is the second worst sushi I've ever had, when you see \"cream cheese\", \"all you can eat\", and \"cooked sushi\" on a menu RUN!!! Run far away and never look back.

The only sushi I've had that was worse than this was in Mexico."}
{"text":"Being confronted by a computer and having to use a computer to order my food was not my idea of a relaxing experience.  If I wanted to work on a computer I would have studied computer programming and stayed at the office.  I was hoping for a relaxing time with good food.  The food was good but I was not relaxed.  Not going there until they bring back paper and get rid of those horrible computers."}
{"text":"This place was amazing before the reorganization in 2014/2015. The sushi use to be amazing and the kitchen food was fine. But now, the sushi is terrible and the kitchen food is alright. The service is the only good thing left of this place."}
{"text":"The interior of the restaurant is great -- dimly lit, tasteful decor (you'll hardly remember it was a Wendy's years ago).

The food is what you'd expect from an AYCE sushi joint. Pretty large menu and decent range of options (including fusion/Canadian-style rolls too for those who are into that sort of thing). The service is prompt and usually fairly accurate (you fill out a menu card with what you'd like for the table vs. dictating your order out loud).

Not the best, but great for lunch (the dinner/weekend costs are higher, not sure if it's worthwhile then)."}
{"text":"My friend and I were trying to find something to eat, and then the \"all you can eat\" sign caught our attention and we decided to check this place out. Before this place, their use to be a Wendy's which I grew up going to regularly.. so it was quite weird going into the same place, now serving sushi. This place seemed very open but a little dark. I was seated immediately and the server came quickly to grab me and my friend a drink. We looked through the menu and had our regular rolls and decided to see what the \"brampton roll\" was all about... let me tell you it was about the most disgusting concoction, the cream cheese just didn't mesh well. I tried the other rolls as well and it didn't seem fresh, it was kind of chewy in a way lol. The only thing I enjoyed was the tempura and the green salad. Just because this place is all you can eat and they have their lunch specials.. Its garbage. I rather pay more for better sushi, especially when its raw.. I need it to be fresh."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week and already going again tonight - this place is great! 

Wonderful selection of sushi and dishes. Everything we tried was delicious and fresh tasting. They have a lot of original sushi rolls too named after local cities - the Brampton roll is really good! 

Service was great and everyone was very friendly. They seated us right away and explained how to order with the tablet right away. 

Ordering by tablet made it really easy. Pictures and descriptions helped us try new things that we wouldn't of tried before then. 

Prices are definitely reasonable (22.99 for dinner during the week or 23.99 on the weekends) especially for the selection and quality of the food."}
{"text":"We love this place!! 
It's the best sushi in Brampton and Mississauga! 
The food is amazing, they have lots of options and it's 15$/person all you can eat!  not bad!"}
{"text":"Food is satisfactory. Service needs lots of improvement. Waited a while to be greeted and seated by staff. Staff aren't friendly, they don't speak to customers and when they do its one or two words. Ex. \"Done?\" Or \"more?\" Or \"receipt?\". Also, they don't take away finished plates right away, and when they do they take one or two at a time when they can easily stack them to make room for more plates. Worth a try, but won't go for a second time. I prefer a more friendly and welcoming environment."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday for lunch. Service was standard. You order on a tablet. The sushi was alright. Would return tho."}
{"text":"My cousin told me about this sushi spot, she said it was really good. So I had to drop by and try it out. Coming from Woodbridge to Brampton for this sushi spot was a mission Lol. But I arrived. The line for take out wasn't too old, but there was a lot of people there to eat at the restaurant. I went through the menu and ordered the rolls I wanted to try. I order the spicy California roll, yam roll, & the avocado roll. I didn't like the avocado one as much. But the other two were amazing! I got my side of spicy mayo which made the food taste even better. As of parking, there is parking around the restaurant. As of service, the food was made pretty quick I probably waited around 6-10 mins. I definitely by coming back with my cousin to try more!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for me for Tokyo Maki Sushi (Urgh...I hate starting off reviews with an out of the scale rating).

Came in here with a couple of friends interested in getting some AYCE on.  But AYCE for $21 compared to $16 for 18 pieces left \"not so hungry\" me ordering off of their a la carte menu. 

Just a side note on their AYCE menu; it's on a tablet which is pretty and effective but at the same time I know how these things accumulate all sorts of germs and stuff from multiple touches, so I would definitely opt for washing my hands before eating unless I'm certain my hands will not be coming in to contact with my food (I guess it would be more effective if there was a system of ordering straight from the tablet without your server having to take down your order).

Their AYCE menu certainly seems well stocked up and if I was a hungry customer I would have gone with that, but I always get intimated by that $0.50 charge per uneaten sushi and I don't know exactly how much I can eat at the time of ordering. I was very happy with my sushi and sashimi dinner, I don't have much sushi experience in Brampton but I was very happy to see that my sashimi pieces were pretty fresh (no fancy pieces though, just your typical salmon, tuna etc)

My miso soup and salad were both \"meh\" but I've definitely had worse. 

The staff were really friendly, there was a little lost in translation going on, but in the end they pulled through and were friendly and kept the green tea flowing well after we had paid the bill and were still chatting. 

The only hiccup I would say is that it looked like they might have brought out 1 or 2 extra sushi dishes for my AYCE friends, which wasn't a huge issue since they managed to get it down, but with that extra charge for uneaten pieces, that could have been another $5 to $10 extra on the bill. But since the staff are friendly and service is quick, they get the benefit of the doubt jumping from a 3 to 3.5/4 star rating!"}
{"text":"Typical all you can eat style Japanese restaurant. Been here a few times but it's anything special. The sushi isn't very authentic and well made, very small and easily falls apart. The only good part is that it's filling, make sure to eat the Kalbi meat if you're here and also the mango yoghurt."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this sushi restaurant for years now. When I first started to go there it was so good, now on the other hand not so much. My friend and I went there last night, the new renovations are nice but the service was gone way down. You still order on the iPads but before you had to wait to for the server to send it, now you send it on your own but no one tells you that. We had wait to get drink orders and refills. The owner randomly made us move tables so he could fit more people after we ordered. They try to kick you out as soon as possible because it's busy now which my friend and I find so rude. The price has gone WAY up it's now $29."}
{"text":"One liner summary: Thank God-zilla their name isn't Tokyo Cooked foods.

Order: a bunch of sushi, Toronto roll, BBQ eel roll, siu mai, BBQ beef ribs, salmon belly, miso soup, seaweed salad, pork cutlet on rice,

Likes: 
#sushi was fairly fresh and wasn't overloaded with rice, I especially liked the tobiko
# very friendly service and with a smile (if you regularly frequent Asian restaurants, you know how rare this is
#about $1 cheaper than most AYCE places - $13.99 on weekdays and 14.99 on weekends
#ribs were tender although they seemed more like the Chinese cooking style but still good

For the sushi portion and price, I would give them four stars but what brings it down is the cooked food.

Dislikes:
All the cooked food except the ribs. It was all too salty and or drenched in soya or teriyaki sauce, especially the pork cutlet and salmon belly. Quite ashame too as the cook on the salmon belly was perfect.

Verdict: come for the sushi, not the cooked foods (unless you are trying to get a few days of sodium intake in one day)"}
{"text":"Had been waiting to go to this sushi place. So here is the thing, all these sushi places are purchasing the sushi grade fish from the same wholesale vendor. So all these sushi places now taste somewhat alike. 
Sushi rice (cause thats the imp bit) : lacked the balance of acidity and sweetness. 
Fried foods : not so good, not so bad. It's the same everywhere you go now.
Teriyaki sauce and dishes : a bit bland and lacked flavour that a typical teriyaki sauce has. Beef was not succulent , it was disintegrating. 
Service : a bit rough. Hardly any smiles, in your face service with being straight to the point. 
How about a Lil please ?"}
{"text":"Tokyo Make Sushi to me is your typical sushi restaurant.  Nothing makes this place stand out from the others.  Service was a bit slow but good, food was fresh but the rolls were not rolled very tight and were falling apart.  I would return again if im in the area but I would not go out of my way."}
{"text":"When I first came here in 2010 it was good and not many people knew about this place much. Since then their menu has upgraded and even the ordering system is better from paper and pencil to now an iPad..

They have added many new dishes due to I guess the amount of people that have changed their eating habits they have now brown rice sushi which is an $1.00 extra To each roll which I guess is understandable due to the want to make sure people eat it and finish it.

Lunch time they don't have a big amount of selection of food there's no sashimi and some cooked dishes are not available.. their lunch hours are 1qam-3:30pm and dinner is available the whole day.. I recommend coming when they just opened or right after lunch hours  if you want the dinner menu cause once they get busy you don't reciever all the items you ordered or takes a while for them to check on you.  One of the downfalls for me is that you have to wait for your server to verify your order unlike other AYCE you just send the order yourself..

The dishes I enjoy the most is the YAKITORI, BLACK DRAGON ROLL, ENOKI BEEF ROLL, AND their UPON NOODLES..  They have free refills which is good if you love your ice tea and soda..

Overall it is a good sushi place and my son loves going here cause they have certain salads that he likes and other places don't have.."}
{"text":"Best place for AYCE sushi!!! Amazing service, super clean. They just redecorated and it looks fantastic. Everything is made fresh and comes quickly."}
{"text":"Very good food and lots of selection. Staff is not quite good but cant complain for the price and quality of food :)"}
{"text":"I used to eat here before switching to another AYCE in Mississauga. I stopped coming here because the epitome if this place died down once we had to keep waiting on our orders to be sent.

The servers all look so busy and it was very hard to grab their attention given the fact that this place is usually always crowded.

Most of the items on the menu are pretty good but I tend to stay away from the sushi pizzas because they give me a feeling of discontent due to the deep frying method of the meal. Other than that, not much to be said about this place. It's just 'okay'"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we discovered this little slice of Japan!

On various occasions, our family had driven to Spoonful for a fantastic feast.  And while I enjoyed all of their western food, I felt that their Sushi/Sashimi was lacking (as you'd expect from a hot-plate style buffet; yes Wasabi, I'm looking at you!).  Of the several times we visited, I always noticed the little restaurant on the corner seen as Tokyo Maki Sushi.  After seeing quite a few good reviews on Yelp, and even more delicious pictures, I decided to give it a try. 

First thing I noticed about the restaurant as we drove in... was that there was a drive through lane.  Curious enough as it was, my partner informed me that this was a previously owned Fast Food Chain (Wendys?).  Amusing as it was, I was a little curious to see how the restaurant layout would be, given this knowledge.

We arrived there around dinner time, to find (not surprisingly) that the restaurant was full. We were seated after a few minutes of waiting, given our ipads and left to order.  Excitedly, we ordered our usuals (stock spicy rolls, hand rolls, roses, sashimi and kitchen items) along with a few custom rolls unique to the restaurant.  

With a speed only comparable to 168 Sushi, our food arrived.  Arriving in droves, we soon realized our small table wouldn't be enough.  That was okay; it was just a challenge for us to eat quicker. 

So for the food.

This is it. This is THE restaurant.  The restaurant I've been looking for.  For the first time in my search amongst Sushi AYCEs in Mississauga/Brampton, this is the FIRST restaurant I've found that they use superb quality salmon.  I was ecstatic. The quality comparable only to a-la carte restaurants.  With it's higher than usual amount of fat, the flavour was phenominal. They also used this quality of salmon for their salmon roses (which might I add, had 2 pieces of salmon instead of the restaurants that skimp and only use 1), which made me even happier.  And to add, they served both versions of white tuna; escolar and albacore.  Unfortunately they didn't serve red tuna, but hey, I'm still extremely happy about the place. 

Ashley has stated her extreme satisfaction in the kitchen items (she's quite a stickler for her kalbi), which is a definite plus.  

Their dinner variety of rolls were rather limited, and while some of them were good, many of them came out just okay.  I was too enamored over the sashimi to think about anything else at that time. 

Their standard sushi rolls were quite good as well, including their hand rolls.  One cute thing to add is that they are the only restaurant I've been to that uses traditional handroll plates (a stand with little holes to insert the cones; coolest presentation for temaki).

All in all this place was fantastic.  I will definitely come back here for dinner with the family when the time comes instead of Spoonful (which, might I add costs an arm a leg for dinner in comparison to this place, which is reasonable for dinner).

The only downsides is that the restaurant layout was rather crowded, and a little loud given the small space you're put in. But considering that the establishment went from a Wendy's to a AYCE top notch sushi restaurant, I couldn't help but think to myself: 'Now THAT'S better'."}
{"text":"I drove here on a Saturday night to pick up some sushi for take out, because I really liked the sushi the few times I'd been here prior to this visit.

I ordered 4 rolls. Yam tempura, California, spicy salmon and tuna.

The price was great. I was surprised there wasn't avocado in any of them. The (mobile) website doesn't provide a description of the rolls so it was kind of a shot in the dark.
On the plus side, you can order online so you don't have to speak to a human being XD.

The taste was horrible. They were all chewy and not good at all. The yam tempura roll was almost inedible. 
The fish was tasteless and the rice was soggy. The texture was just off.

I don't think I would order from here again."}
{"text":"We tried Tokyo Maki Sushi a few times and found nothing wrong with it, but our preference is 168 Sushi, a local favorite. The location of Tokyo Maki is arguably better so if it's more convenient for you I have no doubt you'll enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"the food is good, i just dont like that you need to call the waiter to send your order everytime. Wont go back again..."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because their sashimi is ALWAYS fresh compared to the other AYCE that I've been to in brampton. I'm a big fan of sashimi, so if the raw fish is fresh, you're doing it right. Plus, the sashimi is always nicely sliced - not too small or thin. I kind of wished that they'd put squid as a sashimi though. Their rolls have potential to be different, but it's kind of repetitive to have dynamite roll inside every 'chef's special' roll. It REALLY helps that they have the ingredients listed on the menu for each roll."}
{"text":"Had dinner with family here. GF wanted to try this place as it had a bit more choices outside of sushi dishes, which suits her.  
Overall, I find it was fine. There does seem to be bit more choices. All the chicken dishes was fine, but the beef was all very hard to chew. Ribs were good, but don't think it is Korean/Japan style. Went to pick up my first piece of sushi and everything just fell apart once I touched it. Other than that it was fine. They do not overload the rice like some places do.  Rolls can use more flavor, is what we came away with, and seem in review on yelp as well.
Everything seems to come all at once. We ate, ordered more, waited, and again everything came one after the other. With this type of system, I am sure an order here or there will get mixed up or forget, happened once, that we noticed, but no big deal.
I  find the service was good.  For some reason they do not give you much wasabi/ginger like most places do, but of course you can always ask for more. One thing I felt was a waste of time, for both sides, is that you cannot send the order yourself. A server has to come and enter a code into the ipad in order to send. 
I would be open to trying again."}
{"text":"Pros: soft drinks and tea was included. 

Cons: service was slow. Food was average. No menu item was memorable. 

They would benefit more from hiring more people. In fact I wrote this review while waiting for the bill."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout of the Maki sushi A and Sashimi regular.  The sashimi was fresh and in generous portion.  The sushi had a lot of ingredients with a thin layer of rice wrapped around them.  Overall, good value for money.

Side note, I understand crab is consider a sashimi but it would be nice to have less of it."}
{"text":"Food looks great but Service is good but needs improvement but the review is all about the food the rolls are in my opinion is 3 out of 5 star's needed more flavor.  Hot food was 3.5 star's desert simple and Good. Pizza I didn't enjoy it and won't order again . my table was 101"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with the wife last night and was generally disappointed. 

No bulgogi on the menu anymore. 

Korean short ribs soggy and very little sear on them. 

But the big killer and main reason for this low score is that they leave the disgusting vein inside their shrimp. Try biting into one of their tempura shrimps and looking inside of it. That black stuff is the poo. 

Disgusting, and if they weren't so lazy it takes literally 2 seconds to remove. 

Until they learn to devein a shrimp i will never go back"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night at 7:15! There was a wait of 10 minutes for a table which was totally fine considering the place is tiny and cozy! The spicy crab salad was good and so was another crab salad! Did not have any of the kitchen items so can't vouch for those, i was in the mood for hand rolls and sushi and those were all delicious! The cream cheese rolls are all to die for! Price is very reasonable, at 55$ for two! Would i go back? Heck yes!!!"}
{"text":"I love that this sushi  buffet restaurant uses a tablet ordering system. There's no need to get up to grab your own food. Just order on the Ipad provided and the  food will be brought to your table. They serve pretty fast, too! I love the clean and classy ambiance, as well. Above all, the food is prepared well and is delicious."}
{"text":"This is the only all you can eat sushi place my friends and I go to. Great selection of thing to try and very good customer service.  The unagi is so delicious definitely a must try."}

The parking has limited space, we were lucky enough to snag the last spot, but even then it was a hurdle for my friend, Kharen, as there was a little small snow mountain. [PSA: carpool, park across the street in the plaza and or mall, if you can and or have to.]

The restaurant was pretty busy, a lot more than I had anticipated, we were seated down promptly. We ordered off the iPad, our food came in batches, starting with our sushi. Our sushi came out cold and fresh, it was delicious. Everything else came after besides my friend's one order, the BBQ short ribs. Luckily, it hadn't since we both were so full. When it came to ordering desert, it was a little difficult since it doesn't have the option for guest 1 and guest 2... we ended up sharing the same spoon and desert.

I felt like we were rushed to pay since we had requested for our bill but was still sitting at our table talking. When we got up, there was a line of people waiting to pay. There was no necessary rushing needed."}
{"text":"Or favorite AYCE sushi place.  Has a greet variety of grill items, soups, salads, tempura, sushi and sashimi.  Love their sashimi!  iPad ordering system, and great decor."}
{"text":"I have been to this AYCE sushi place quite a few times now and it is one of the best in the area. They are always quick to seat you, I have never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a table, even on busy Saturday nights. The seats are pretty comfy, I have sat in various places throughout the restaurant and all of them are good. However, like many AYCE sushi places, the tables are a tad too close together, which can be irritating if you get seated next to a loud party. 

The sushi is pretty good, always fresh, and not loaded down with rice like some other places. However, the spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls are not spicy at all...which is disappointing. The cooked dishes are hit or miss, some of them are quite good, like the dumplings, spring rolls, tempura, and some vegetable dishes. While others are not the best, like the beef dishes, and some of the noodles. 

My only complaint is the service, which can be kind of slow at times, depending on the day. I have experienced incredibly quick and accurate service, and other days I have endured really absent minded and inaccurate service. However, the majority of the time the service has been decent. 

Prices vary depending on if you are there during lunch or dinner and also if it is a week day or weekend. 

Overall, I still enjoy this restaurant and will continue to dine here whenever I am in the Brampton area."}
{"text":"i also came here a few times. 
i like the ipad order idea because bubby can actually see and know what is in the rolls. menu is quite good, lots of selection. sashimi is good. rolls are consistent , one time i was there , rolls tasted great, but the second time had too much rice and no deep fried roll. 
udon tasted absolutely horrible. the broth tasted like warm water with salt! please imagine that ! it was really gross!
i will not go back ."}
{"text":"Yelp is right, I am definitely a fan! 
The hi-tech sushi order system is a first for me and I enjoyed it, once I got the hang of it... I did not realize you could scroll and when I got the hang of that, well that made my experience so much better. I wish the staff were a bit more friendly but they were quick and the sushi was delicious. I urge everyone to try anything butterfish, it was a great discovery and Tokyo Maki Sushi makes one heck of a butterfish handroll. Plus, the handrolls are served in such a neat way; individually spaced and on a pedestal. 
Even with the added scrolling the selection of sushi was mediocre. There was a lot more extra items: deep fried, teriyaki, curry, etc. Sad. 
The restaurant was clean, open and plenty of seating. All and all a pretty good sushi day!"}
{"text":"My favourite AYCE sushi place in Brampton or Mississauga. 
No matter what you get, it is quite delicious, and their options are great. 
The best cucumber wrapped rolls."}
{"text":"This place was very disappointing,  I cannot even explain how bad the customer service is.. went here with my boyfriend at about 9pm sat down and everything was fine. We waited about 25-30 mins for our food, just took one bite of our food and the manager comes to us telling us we have to pack up our food to go because they're closing! Talk about unprofessional!  To top it all off they made us pay for boxing up the food, on top of already paying for the sushi. The sushi was not even good, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place.  IPad ordering system.  The food comes out quite quickly and is fresh.  Above adverage for your AYCE sushi.  
I like that we get what we order.  Some places we find dishes we ordered but never got... or we get dishes we never ordered.

Service is ok... they dont bother you and for the most part attentive with the tea refills.
At the end... when you get your bill, its best to bring it up fromt to pay.  Waiting for a waitress to come seems to take a long time.  Nor sure why but I have sat for 10+ mins and finally gave up.  Once I went up front... I have 3 orther diners follow suit as they were waitinf awhile too.

Private parking lot with ample parking spots.  There is a section on the north side of the building where they can have outdoor seating in the summer... which would be a nice touch.

I am glad that this place seems to be doing well.  For those who are familiar with this Brampton location... it seemed to have a bad curse for many years... businesses prior never seemed to last."}
{"text":"This was my first AYCE Sushi experience. I was a little confused with the tablets at first but then I quickly realized what a cool concept it was. It's like living in the future! (haha)
When it comes to sushi and japanese food, I am so easy to please. I enjoyed everything that we ordered which included a spattering of everything (singapore noodles, dynamite rolls, tempura, general tso chicken, etc etc) and I had room for dessert of ice cream which is a nice lighter type of treat after stuffing yourself to the gills. 
I remember when this place was a Wendy's, but I like it more now. :)"}
{"text":"Costs $14.99 + tax (Mon-Thurs lunch) and that include drinks already. iPAD ordering system. Fast service! And many items on menu.

I suggest trying...
1) snow crab roll
2) corn salad
3) cheese wonton (bomb!)
4) Brampton roll

Keep your jackets on because it can be cold inside."}
{"text":"Been going here for a couple of years and this place is good enough to satisfy any sushi craving I have but am too lazy to go out of my way to another restaurant (I live about 10 mins away). I've never really had a bad experience so no complaints at all. 

They did add a lot more items as the years went by which is great because who doesn't love a wide selection of sushi? I believe this is the only sushi restaurant I've ever been to (and I've been to plenty because I am a huuuuge sushi lover!) that offers sushi with brown rice! The sashimi is really good - I notice that they do give you bigger slices when you go during less busy times (right when dinner starts!). The take out portions are really good too - I get super full and can barely finish my order. I've only ever ordered the Salmon Lover daily box which consists of my all-time favourite sushi items - spicy salmon lover and salmon sashimi! Definitely recommend this if you're on the go and love salmon.

Service is good - nothing outstanding but it meets the standard and keeps me content every time I come. I really like that when I ask for some spicy mayo here they give a lot as opposed to other sushi restaurants that give only a little bowl of it. 

Tokyo Maki is also very affordable compared to most sushi places - I believe $23.99 for weekend dinner AYCE! 

I definitely recommend this place if you are in the area (Shoppers World in Brampton) and need to get your sushi fix!"}
{"text":"Good place to get you ayce sushi fix. i went here with my family. We came at an earlier ish time i guess (i think it just opened) since it wasn't busy. It was easy to find parking and we were seated quickly. The food was good - i can't really remember what i has since it was just a crazy long order in whatever order. I'd go back again :)"}
{"text":"This place is awful. Sushi was small. Rice wasn't sticky enough so it fell apart. Tablet system is a joke because you need to get a waitress to put in the order anyway. The service was awful. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute BEST.  The main gentleman who works here is absolutely amazing.  He always makes sure that everyone is taken care of and you aren't ever waiting to be seated.  
I am a huge sushi fan, and can vouch - they are so fresh, so delicious, and masters of their own art. I can't say it enough - they are the best sushi place I have been to.  This AYCE restaurant is one of a kind.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place has really improved. The restaurant itself is very simple and Asian traditional.
They have the iPads for ordering and it is very convenient and easy! The waitresses/waiters are always very fast and the food is always amazing. Even on busy days, they will not screw up the fish to rice ratio as most other places do to fill you up. 
The place is relatively cheap and even offers free drinks.
By far the best sushi place that offers AYCE in Brampton."}
{"text":"Tokyo Maki me some Sushi!

So I came here for hung-over lunchtime sushi with my gf after her party the night before and man am I glad we did. AYCE sushi IMO is the best hangover cure. 

The sushi here was quite delicious, I really enjoyed it. I like how they don't stuff too much rice in their rolls and I also really like how their green tea cups are oversized so you don't need to refill it as often. When I got my salmon handroll, I was disappointed because it looked like it was stuffed full of only rice, but then I bit into it and realized that it was actually stuffed with mostly salmon! I'm not gonnna lie, writing about it makes me want another one.  

I highly recommend their seaweed/cucumber/crab meat salad as an appetizer. It was a great a spin on your typical seaweed salad. The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because they don't serve sashimi (at least for lunch anyways). The inside décor of the place is nice but the outside is meh. I mean tbh though, who really cares what the outside looks like? It's all about the food! 

I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Was disappointed, not lot of selection, sashimi were not fresh and the food was bland...have had a better AYCE with the same price...the service was nice though. 
Miso soup was salted...beef teriyaki was soggy and cold. First time and will be the last time here."}
{"text":"I typically get take out from here, but today I stayed for the all-you-can eat. The spicy dynamite roll is a regular go to, but overall the food was great. Fast and fresh service, at the right price."}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying for an AYCE joint, it's not so bad! 

I was here on a Monday evening for dinner, not too crowded. We got seated right away and given an iPad. They have a good variety of rolls and different food items. Got off to a good start UNTIL.. the iPads went down! UTTER CHAOS. Okay, I'm being a tad bit dramatic. After finishing our order on the iPad, it decides to go down. The server hands us the paper and a pen, going back to the old fashion way. 
I was really disappointed just because some of the items weren't on the paper, oh well.
I actually did enjoy the sushi and the sashimi.
The only issue was the service after the iPad went down. Took a while to get our food and it was difficult to flag down a server.
I would definitely return, 24.99 for dinner is a decent price at least!"}
{"text":"Yeah, never coming back here again.  My boyfriend and I were having a perfectly good time, until we went to go pay, and the manager was beyond rude to us.  He had zero patience for our situation, and began speaking to his employees in another language, which proceeded with them looking at me and laughing.  I felt disrespected and mistreated as a consumer; he was unwilling to be helpful or cooperative and it ruined the whole experience for me."}
{"text":"The best AYCE sushi in town. Nice staff (most of them) who remember their returning customers. I've always enjoyed the food. It's not as good as some of the high end sushi places in Toronto, bit or what it is (all you can eat) you'd be hard pressed to find a similar quality restaurant in the region."}
{"text":"This is the first time might be the last time. Serve is way too slow, week day lunch, almost every table is empty and waiting for the dishes. For the food itself just soso"}
{"text":"I actually just came home from dining here this evening. This was my first time visiting this ayce restaurant and I probably would never come here if my friend didn't bring me here.

The sushi was pretty good and included in the $20.95 price is the sashimi. This made me happy because if I wanted sashimi from Sushi 168 I would have to have the deluxe buffet instead of the regular buffet. Apparently they added more items to their menu since Mother's Day, which included their lobster roll. My friend hyped up the lobster roll and I was disappointed because I didn't even taste any lobster. I think they were REALLY cheaping out on the lobster meat. We only did 1 round of sushi because we ordered a lot for the first round. For dessert I had the mango mousse cake (additional 10 cents...my friend's fault for ordering the wrong mango thing), strawberry and mango ice cream. I only liked the strawberry ice cream because both mango items tasted artificial. After finishing dessert my friend demanded that I try their mango yogurt because he said it was soooo good. When I ate it I disagreed with him because it tasted bad.

Would I come here again? Yes I would but not for a while because I am way too full."}
{"text":"best AYCE sushi in brampton
great quality, never rushed, good service
excellent price, no weird combinations"}
{"text":"Ever since the wife introduced me to this place I fell in love. Ray is such a nice guy as well as all the staff. Sashimi is big pieces and the rolls are on point. 

You gotta try this place

Be advised that they will be closed around june for renovations to make more room. 

Ill be back in two weeks."}
