{"text":"I want to put 0 star here but no option to do so. I never write a review for any restaurants in the past, I felt this has to be my first one because what I have went through has to be shared with all foodies.   This place is disgusting, the food was shitty and as a Xi'an person myself, I would say it's the most disgusting lamb soap I have ever seen in my life! It was like a leftover! (too bad I forgot to take pic for you guys)When I go ask the owner why it's this little,he's reaction made me shocking even more! He start yelling and arguing and throw towels at his counter to make a scene. As a business owner, how can you take customer's comments like this! Your business will not go anywhere. Your food quality plus most importantly 0 customer service and 0% improvement mindset, it will make your business go down! Poor Canadians and international students! Please be aware of this restaurant ! If you have better choice, never ever come to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Hidden in a small plaza, this family run noodle shop has better hours than the one next door, but the limited English menus and service aren't offset enough by GOOD but not amazing food with below average portions.  What I Liked: Country Style Spicy Cold Noodles were okay What I Didn't: Ban Ban Noodles, Lamb Skewers  What I'll Try Next: Pita Bread Soaked in Lamb Soup  The food is REALLY REALLY amazing to LOOK at, but I don't think it tickles my taste buds - and this is possibly more of an indictment of my personal preference than the actual restaurant. The Ban Ban noodles are somewhat tomato-y in taste, and the noodles felt like a mix of different flavours that didn't quite work for me.   The cold noodles were fairly good - but I've had better as well.  Skewers were decent, but not worth $2 per small stick."}
{"text":"Like Ada said, this is a hole in the wall. I really like that. Had I not wanted to go to have noodles next door, I would never have even gone into this plaza. I ended up at Tang Home because the noodle place next door closes at 4pm every day, and we went around 6pm. They do have an English menu now, available upon request, but service is either Mandarin or very basic English.  We had the pita bread soaked in lamb soup, the cold noodles in country style spicy, and the beef with pancake in country style (burger). It was a light dinner for three.   The pita bread soaked in lamb soup was $9.99 for a small, and $10.99 for a large. We got the large one. It wasn't really all that large. It was what I would actually think was small. It was served in a large bowl, but the portion was not very big. This pita is not like a pita pocket. It's fairly thick and fairly dense. When soaked, it takes on the consistency of chewy rice cake. I think it could have used more soaking. I was expecting more soup than what we got. Towards the end of the bowl, there was basically no soup because the bread had soaked it all in. The soup was very tasty though. Definitely lamb based. There were also a few slices of lamb in the bowl, and those were fairly tender and tasty as well. This was my first time having this dish (Yes! One off the foodie bucket list!), and I enjoyed it, but I think I'm going to try to find a version I like more.  The beef with pancake ($3.70) had a nicely cooked pancake (well, more English muffin-esque, but more crisp and cracker-like on the outside), and the beef shank on the inside was sliced very thin so it was almost melt-in-mouth consistency, but that was all that was in the pancake. Where are my green onions? What about my coriander? What about some kind of sauce? It was a fairly dry mouthful.   The cold noodles ($4.50) were probably my favorite dish. Unfortunately, I'm a tad sick right now and trying not to have so much spicy food, so my intake of this dish was rather lacking. However, what I had, I really enjoyed. These are noodles with bean sprouts and tofu pieces all drowned in a chili oil of sorts. I'm guessing it's the Sichuan peppercorns that give this dish its distinct taste, but I could be totally wrong. Regardless, this chili oil makes me want to keep eating.  This was cute. I liked it. I liked that it was quiet. I liked that they had a booster seat ready for a little kid that came in, and I really liked that the little kid proceeded to sing \"Row, row, row your boat\" throughout our meal."}
{"text":"I agree with Ada. This place is lit.  By lit, I mean I love the food. But it is not Asian Fusion as categorized. It is Chinese through and through.  The Ban Ban Noodle and Pao-Mo dish are must-trys in addition to those already recommended."}
{"text":"Ive been to Tang's many, many times and I never stop craving it. In fact i decided to start this yelp page because the food is actually lit.   This is a very bare, hole in the wall place, and inexpensive place. My personal favourites include the lamb skewers, the cold spicy noodles and the xian style burgers (its pretty much all I get when I come here)  Me and my family are originally from Shaanxi (xi'an) and im so happy i found this place about 2 years ago.   it is cash and debit only, but you never have to spend more than $8-15 on a full meal.   Word of warning, some of the food is kind of spicy and the place is very chinese, but if youre looking for good food and a satisfying experience, then this is definitely the place to visit :)"}
