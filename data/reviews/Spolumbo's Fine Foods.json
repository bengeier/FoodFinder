{"text":"Had a great turkey sandwich and what was best about it was it was gluten free. It's fantastic that they offer that and the bread was good. Most gluten free bread stinks this however was much better than most."}
{"text":"I went to Spolumbo's today for lunch, and man oh man, I've gotta say, they serve up a mean sausage. 
I got there at noon after circling the block a few times to find parking, as their small lot behind is perpetually packed. 
When I got inside, I knew why parking was at such a premium - the place was slammed, which is always a good sign. While waiting in line, I had plenty of time to sneak peaks at everyone else's meals, which only served to whet my appetite. 
I opted for the Spicy Italian Sausage, which comes on a crusty bun with fresh tomato sauce. It was awesome. The sausage was the right combination of spices and lean meat, and the baguette was super fresh. A definite winner in my books.  Strangely, the side dish with every sandwich is a handful of dill pickle slices.  I'm a true Bick's fan, so I was pleasantly surprised at how good they were, and I ate every one.
Funny enough, the place cleared out before I even finished eating, so perhaps head here around 12:15 if you want a parking spot."}
{"text":"Whenever I come to Calgary I make it a point to stop at Spolumbo's for their sausage on a bun. You can't find a sandwich this good anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I guess not the best place if you're trying not to eat a lot of meat and cheese.  They have a veggie sandwich, but with no cheese it fairly dry.  I know everyone else I go with who actually eats the various meats and cheese dishes they offer are raving about it.  So it probably depends on what you're into, and if you're into sausage, then this is somewhere you want to check out."}
{"text":"For this sausage lover, Spolumbo's makes food that's just fine. I'm pretty sure that it won't impress pig-sty dwelling narcissists with dreams of being the CONfident authority of haute cuisine. If you're one of these people and you step into Spolombo's expecting them to make only what YOU want to eat, then maybe you should spend more time with a specialist. 
     However, if you appreciate sandwiches then check these guys out! You may be impressed, and satisfied."}
{"text":"UPDATE - The owners have not responded to the email I sent. Indifference seems to be a line item as well. I guess they know they use far less than perfect mass production rather than perfected traditional methods to heat their sandwiches and when challenged, they did not step up to the plate. Serving the finest sandwiches is not their forte, just the largest quantities. This is a restaurant to avoid if you are seeking quality Italian fare, better sandwiches can be found at Lina's Italian Supermarket on Centre St. N.

When one first enters this establishment, it easy to get overwhelmed by the yummy looking meats and sausages they have in full view for your sandwiches. Equally enticing is the rack of freshly baked crispy crust Italian style bread they have to make your sandwiches with. Then they kill it when they heat the sandwich before serving.

Any chef that is worth her or his weight in truffles would totally eschew the use of microwave ovens to heat a sandwich with Italian bread and cutlets that have been baked or shallow fried schnitzel style. That nuclear energy abomination is what they use to wreck what could have been an incredible sandwich. The bread was soft and soggy after being zapped with extremely high frequency radio waves and the crunch of the breading on the cutlet was utterly destroyed. The parmesan cheese was tasteless. It did not taste like an aged Reggiano or Grana Padano.

When I think of Italian sandwiches memories of San Francesco, Commisso Brothers and Racco, and the Casa Commisso in TO come to lite. Hot, fresh, superbe sandwiches which have been cooked properly, in a real oven, most a pizza oven. Microwaved sandwiches, not in your life, these restaurants are the real McCoy. In Calgary, Lina's and the Italian Supermarket heat sandwiches in ovens not microwaves.

What I was served was reminiscent of a sandwich from the coolers of Seven-Eleven or Petro-Canada.

My suggestion to Spolumbo is to donate the microwave ovens to the Drop In Centre or the Mustard Seed and install real ovens immediately. Do this an my rating would jump from a 1 to 3 stars.

However, the soups need fixing to up the rating to 4 stars and pepper shakers on the table and soft drinks that do not cost $2.50 to bring it up to five stars.

The soup was a Minestrone. It tasted nothing like a soup I would receive in the North End of Boston, St. Clair Avenue in Toronto, or Southern Italy. Under cooked potatoes and celery are not my idea of real Minestrone. There were no beans, no pasta, no tomatoes, nor any carrots. Bland bland bland. There was no cheese to put in the soup handy for the customers, I had to ask for it.

A restaurant the microwaves their sandwiches is not one bent on a sensational dining experience. It is about getting as many sandwiches out the door as they can in the shortest period of time. Even though they have all the ingredients necessary to produce an absolutely fabulous sandwich, they choose to ignore this and serve soggy, mushy, boring convenience store style fare.

If I was not there for a business meeting, I would have returned my sandwich for a refund and eaten elsewhere. NOT UP SCRATCH, NOT EVEN CLOSE."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic Italian sub with capicollo and proscuitto, or sausage, this is the place. Homemade soups and meatloaf sandwiches are great also. I've dined here for over 10 years, and have always had a great meal."}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent! They are doing everythng in their power to feed people faster. Careful when ordering, though, portions are huge! I was full even before I finished the first half. Ladies, take my advise and share! The quality of ingredients was great: everything fresh and full of flavor. I had Spolumbo's Special.

The place itself is very nice.

The only headache is parking- very tight and small; but, I guess, it is universal problem in Calgary. Next time I'll park a block away."}
{"text":"This place is THE place to buy good sausage in town. A lot of local restaurants serve Spolumbo's products in their dishes and even the premier eats here. True story....
Anyway, their deli is fantastic for lunch, offering a wide variety of specially made sandwiches, Italian-style. This place offers a truly original flavour in this city. It's always busy on weekends, but worth the wait. The guys actually move quite quickly, though, so you're not waiting too long. If you need to buy good sausage, you can't go wrong here. They have everything from an English banger to a spicy Italian to some sort of lamb medley. Good stuff, and they're all made with quality meat and no preservatives. It's worth a try...."}
{"text":"This place is so bloody expensive. I will not go here for lunch again. I had never had it until today, other than at meetings. I never thought it was anything special in those meetings either. The only reason I'm going to give it as high as 2 stars is because of the deli counter where I can actually get their sausages to cook at home."}
{"text":"I don't understand how a place that is known for their sausages doesn't have any toppings that would typically go on a sausage. No ketchup, no sauerkraut, nothing! Your local hotdog vendor is more delightful - and way cheaper."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed and over priced! 
I guess Spolumbos isn't too worried about their market share. 
Very mediocre for Italian subs and sandwiches!  
I ordered the chef salad which was mostly chopped lettuce some nice cherry tomatoes but as far as the ham and or turkey and cheese ... I doubt there as more en 2-3 oz at best combined for $8.00! 
I would have rather had a McDonalds or Wendy's salad! 
My husbands Rachel sandwich was fine. (He was pretty hungry though)
The real disappointment though was the staff. Definitely not very friendly or interested in their customers.  Very sad! Makes me wonder what training management offers. 
I usually have some of Spolumbos sausages in my freezer because of purchasing to support local sports teams etc. I can't complain about them. They are good but not spectacular! 
It will take a lot of convincing to get me to go there again in the near future!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for Italian sandwiches in Calgary.  Go on Thursdays at lunch for an awesome panzerotti, as well.  This is a true Calgary institution and is a great place to go after wandering in and out of the shops in Inglewood."}
{"text":"A  Calgary institution with a great reputation for their place in the community. From a food standpoint they really don't offer anything outstanding, and are rather overpriced.

Like many of the reviews here, my first experience with Spolumbo's happened shortly after moving to Calgary and hearing about this great Calgary institution. And, like many of the reviews here, that first visit (in the mid-2000s) left me more than a little underwhelmed. Fast forward to 2013, and a new office in Inglewood has had me back again looking for lunch. Subsequent visits have left me...more than a little underwhelmed. 

The sandwiches are filling, largely due to the massive amount of bread, but ultimately forgettable. Standard Italian Cold cuts and cheese are dressed with a smear of Gloria spread, yellow mustard (ugh...somewhere an Italian weeps at the thought of prosciutto meeting mustard), standard leaf lettuce, and a mealy tomato. No pepperoncini, no giardiniera, not even crisp shredded iceberg lettuce, heck not even onions for crying out loud. 

The namesake grilled sausage on a bun is passable but could hardly be considered a deal. Served on the same torpedo of bland bread, the almost $10 sausage comes with a ladle of tomato sauce and a handful of sour pickles thrown down on the tray beside it, with not a roasted or grilled pepper or onion to be found.

The only thing that has not been disappointing has been the Cutlet on a Kaiser. The generous serving of stacked schnitzel style pork cutlet actually plays nice with the basic yellow mustard. Warmed on the grill, rather than the microwave as I'd feared, this would be my go-to order if someone insists we meet here for lunch.

Sides are about as thoughtful and/or authentically Italian and as the mains, consisting of a one-note tomato, pesto pasta, or potato salad.

Services is generally fast, and the place is filled with a wide assortment of customers throughout the lunch hour, but if you're looking for authenticity, value, or exciting deli eats, you're better off trekking north to the deli at one of the Italian grocery stores."}
{"text":"This deli has the most efficient service, especially during a lunch rush. It is slightly overwhelming for first time customers, but conveniently enough  they've thought of that and recommended three types of sandwiches. I had the turkey sandwich and the Italian bread was to die for! The regular size is quite large and the mini would have been sufficient."}
{"text":"Spolumbo's was one of the first \"Calgary\" things I learned about when I moved here 6 years ago. Best. Sausage. Ever. I was told.

And their sausages are fantastic. I've tried several varieties, purchased either as part of a meal at local restaurants or from my local supermarket.

But our trip to the flagship deli was completely underwhelming. First of all, $8.50 for a sausage on a bun? With a handful of sliced pickles lazily thrown on the plate/basket with zero enthusiasm from the staff? Sigh. The staff then went on to have a bit of a discussion in front of us as to what story to tell a caller on the phone who was looking for the manager. Kind of awkward.

I think what made me so disappointed in my visit was that it wouldn't take much to make this retail space a cool, happening place with interesting food options...whether it be table service or cafeteria style (as it is now). Instead their little restaurant seems like an after thought, something they dabble in when they aren't making sausages for mass consumption. I'm glad it took me 6 years to try this place out. Had I gone there when I first arrived I probably wouldn't have tried their retail products based on my experience.

My advice to Spolumbo's...make your restaurant space awesome and a destination or just close it before if does more damage to your brand. You can do better."}
{"text":"I love this deli.  Fresh food good tasty meats and dishes.  Order,  grab you food and go sit down type deli . Plenty room to get a seat and warm days a few tables outside.  Grab it go and walk a couple blocks to the river,  plenty spots to sit and eat.. Deli fast lunch people will love this place and style."}
{"text":"Been going to Spobo's for years now since it's a good lunch option. Used to always get the Spolumbo' Special or the 9th Ave - which are amazing - but are way to filling for lunch for me. You can get them as a 'mini' instead which is a good option but lately I've been loving their Egg Salad on Brown Bread sandwich instead.

They have specials pretty much every day of the week. It's always packed from like 11:30 - 1:30 so if you want a bigger table, quicker parking or quicker service avoid this time frame.

It's also licensed so you can get a cold pint with lunch if you want, or they have a good selection of pop and now carry OddWalla juices.

If you're a sports buff, you'll appreciate all of the jerseys, helmets and other cool stuff the guys have collected and put up on the walls over the years.

Oh and Pesto Pasta Salad is awesome."}
{"text":"It had been years since I had been to Spolumbo's. Why??? It is awesome. In addition to their many meaty options they do offer a good selection of veg. friendly sandwich and salad  options. They do everything very well! The have a great selection of desserts too. One can eat in or take-out. Their prices are reasonable! I will be going back soon! :-)"}
{"text":"They make a decent sub except for our last experience.  I had a craving for a Spolumbo sub and couldn't wait for my husband to get home as he was picking them up. Unfortunately, it was very disappointing. There was one little slice of ham, a slice of cheese, and a wilted old piece of lettuce. 

What was even more disappointing is that I did email them my concerns and never heard a thing back, not even a generic reply.  For that reason, we won't return."}
{"text":"I'm a born and raised Calgarian and I am a little embarrassed to say my first time at Spolumbo's was only very recently! I'd never been there before, but I've been hearing buzz about their fabled sausages and sandwiches for a long time now. My boyfriend has had many a Spolumbo sandwich in his day, so I let him take the lead on the orders. We were headed out to Banff to take in an outdoor concert, and wanted to get each person in our party a sandwich for the drive. 

After putting in our three friend's orders, my boyfriend recommended we get the Spolumbo's Special. Since he'd been there before and we have similar taste, I agreed. There was also an extremely long line and sandwich makers were actually walking down the row taking people's order before they reached the counter, so I didn't have a ton of time to make a decision. 

Each sandwich was between $7 - $9. Honestly, a little on the steep side for something one could definitely make at home for half the cost, but the point is that I don't make this at home. I'm not about to buy a full jar of roasted red pepper spread, and three different kinds of Italian deli meats, cheese and fresh bread to satisfy my sub craving. So I guess you're paying for the convenience factor. And they sandwiches are big, and very filling, so at the end of the day, it's a full meal for me, which actually works out to be a steal of a meal deal for $9. Or at least these days it does IMHO.

The sandwiches themselves were really good. True, as some other reviewers pointed out, perhaps they're not \"authentic\" New York/Italian deli style sandwiches. But they are good regardless. They meat and cheese tasted fresh, the sauce was tasty, the pickles were a nice touch and I was full after I ate. In fact, we drove from Spolumbos to Banff, and when I unwrapped my sandwich to eat once we reached the mountains, it was still fresh and delicious and satisfying. It hadn't gotten soggy or droopy during the car ride. Extra points. Ideally, I would give Spolumbo's 3.5 stars, and I would definitely go back for another sandwich, and to try the sausage!"}
{"text":"You need to get in before 12 on a weekday, it's a busy place. 
The line moves quickly however they have limited seating and it fills up fast. Spolumbo's has a deli side where you can buy any of their sausages to take home and BBQ. My favourite is the chicken and apple sausage."}
{"text":"I saw these guys at the Gluten Free Expo 2014 in Vancouver. Their selections are well spiced and balanced. I will be honest in saying that I had more than one sample 'cause they were that good. The guy at the booth who I assume was the BC rep was really friendly and informative."}
{"text":"I love the food, local beer and location. 

However, I feel uncomfortable inside. There are belittling signs posted all over the walls directed to staff. Like: \"staff must NEVER take a water BEFORE paying!!\"

It's embarrassing and unprofessional. I don't want to frequent a place that does this in front of me OR behind closed doors.

I was there today, and I got to see first hand management belittling three young men who were trying to help me. It was so rude, and in front of a customer! The employees saying 'I have the receipt! I'll show you!'

The whole thing just made me sad. If you can't lay off your employees in front of people imagine the shit that goes on behind the scenes. 

So, my opinion, management needs a makeover. The staff was awesome."}
{"text":"They misheard my order and quickly offered to make it right.  When I said I was happy to take what they made (it looked delicious) they gave me my beer for free and made it clear that I could exchange the sub if I didn't like it.  It was a great customer experience.

The smoked meat sub I had was very tasty but didn't live up to the high (and unfair) expectations I had of this place, so I would recommend people try the sausage for their first time there, because the sausages are top notch."}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot in inglewood, got some chicken sausages for breakfast burritos we were making. Didn't get a chance to try the prepped food though. Saw some cfl player in there with his friends."}
{"text":"Spolumbos is a Calgary staple that has significant ties to the community and football programs.  If you are expecting full blown A+ New York-style italian deli, this place will probably fall a little bit short on your expectations. But as far as legitimate italian subs go in the city, Spolumbos is my #1 pick.

The meats are of very good quality, particularly the cold cut trio found on the Spolumbo's Special - a capocollo/prosciutto/mortadella sandwich with red pepper spread, herbs, tomato, and lettuce on a white bun.  I usually order this with the veal cutlet parmigiana (a hot baked veal cutlet with melted mozza and tomato sauce) for my SO and we swap halves. 

For the full-blown experience, be sure to order this with the (extremely generously sized) tomato salad and a chinotto flavoured San Pellegrino."}
{"text":"Spolumbo's has been around for decades, and has a loyal following even in the supermarkets where their sausages are very good quality, super flavourful, and worth it (Coop).
One day at lunch time passing by, I decided to drop into the 9th Avenue restaurant and soon found out it is mostly a cafeteria-style place with marginal sandwiches. Far too much bread; too little meat. But the flavour is up there, and to take out some of their varied meats for home sandwiches likely would be better.
Skip the sandwiches there, do takeout their meats, and make your very own at home in some super-special red fife sourdough breads from Sunshine Bakery in the old Simmons building?
Buy the sausages and be creative with eggs, mushrooms & onions, or pasta sauces at home?"}
{"text":"I ordered the Spolumbo's Special Italian Panini to go just before closing. After getting to my destination I eagerly unwrapped the sandwich expecting meaty deliciousness. Instead, I got a roll with lettuce, tomato and cheese. Was there Mortadella - NO! Salami-NO! Proscuitto - NO! Capocollo - NO!

 The sandwich maker forgot to put any of the meat on the sandwich!

Seriously, how clueless do you have to be to forget to put meat on a meat sandwich? Unless I feel like unwrapping and inspecting all take out orders before I leave the premises from now on it is probably easier to just go someplace else.

Epic fail."}
{"text":"I have lived in Calgary for close to two years and in that time I have seen Spolumbo's products everywhere: hockey games, football games, on Westjet flights, in grocery stores and god only knows where else.

I finally had a chance to eat at Spolumbo's proper and it was well worth the trek from the SouthWest. In Ottawa there is a huge Italian community, so there are quite a few quality Italian delis where sandwiches with all Italian ingredients are plentiful. It's way harder to find that in Calgary, and Spolumbo's has officially filled the void. 

The sandwiches are huge and they have a few special ties you'll want to try, but feel free to come up with your own. It's a counter service kind of place, so things are nice and informal. It's a great atmosphere to wolf down a sandwich and some homemade soup. They also have meals to take home and pop in the oven.

If you're hungry and don't feel like a Subway production line creation, go to Spolumbo's, I think you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a quick bite last Saturday with the boys and they were busy!  My son just devoured his meatball sandwich(caution: it's very messy to eat; so he used a knife and fork) and my smoked meat, lettuce, tomato and cheese sandwich was absolutely delicious.  My husband also enjoyed his Spolumbo's Special sandwich(capicollo, prosciutto, mortadella with the fixin's...).   The ambience was enhanced with live accordion and violin music(and yes, they do take requests...)
      The only thing that's preventing me from giving Spolumbo's another star is the fact that they only gave us a side of pickles for a sandwich that costs $8.95."}
{"text":"An original Calgary success story. Football aside these individuals get the job done every time. Hot and delicious in the Inglewood location and they don't dawdle at lunch. Their product is available in store prepared or you can take it home for your own preparations and lunatic rituals, its also available at the grocer and don't forget to sample a sausage at the football game. A local community minded business. always a plus 4 Minus 5. Businesses like this anchor safe prosperous communities."}
{"text":"While I probably would not go out of my way to eat here, I would likely eat here at least once a week if worked nearby, if not more.

As Spolumbo's recognizes that it has a reputation to uphold, the menu recommends that newcomers try one of three items:
1) The Spolumbo Special (a cold sandwich with mortadella, capicollo, prosciutto, lettuce, tomato, and red pepper spread)
2) The Italian Sausage
3) A Turkey Sandwich (for those wanting something a bit healthier)

So naturally, I dug into the Spolumbo Special because I can't resist prosciutto. And it tasted like a standard italian deli sandwich. It wasn't amazing, like the muffuletta at the Central Grocery in New Orleans, but definitely crave-worthy. It was also gigantic - you could eat one half one day and save the other for the next.

And I liked how they served a crispy doughnut hole covered with powdered sugar with my sandwich - that was a nice, and tasty, if unhealthy touch.

The building itself is rather cavernous, with very high ceilings, but it also has lots of windows and plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Can't say what the staff is like there now. I went in once a few years ago, a food handler coughed into their hand and continued to prepare food. I didn't eat there and never went back. It could be totally different now, staff come and go frequently in restaurants."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are good unless it's summer and then little flies are in it. Always long waits at lunch and you feel rushed to make your order at your turn. Meats are fresh and flavorful. I really enjoy the spreads they put on the sandwiches. There are very few choices for a vegetarian."}
{"text":"Spolumbo's has some of the best food in Calgary. I am especially partial to their uber delicious chicken apple sausage, which is just right. It's perfect for dinner or breakfast, a little sweet and tangy and less fatty than normal sausages.

That being said, all of their sausages are delicious, especially when they are in spolumbo's sandwiches. There is a reason those sandwiches are served all around the city. You can get them at the zoo, and you can even get them on some Westjet flights. Sweet.

The staff tend to be funny and quick, but there are always lineups. I recommend making a morning or afternoon of it by taking your time eating and exploring Inglewood after you're done. Definitely one of my favourite excursions."}
{"text":"Best italian sandwiches! I've had most of them.. spolumbo special, cutlet parmigiana, meatball, spicy sausage, and others I can't recall all the names. But usually those are my go to sandwiches..in that order!

Service is really quick and they serve you a handful of pickles with all sandwiches. And if you want extra tomato sauce for your sandwich ..just ask! AND on Thursdays they have these homemade Italian donuts covered in powdered sugar. I'm sure it's super easy to make but it definitely feels like mom made it.

I've been to peppino's and spolumbos is way better! But sad to see the prices keep getting higher and higher each time we go. ...whatevs it's worth it"}
{"text":"The BEST sandwich in Calgary, period. 

Every big city in the world has incredible sandwich joints, Calgary Is a wasteland of chain crap. You simply cannot beat the cutlet parmigiana or Mama's meatloaf sandwiches. Today I had the cutlet with hot peppers and once again it was incredible. The bread really makes or breaks a sandwich and the bread here is nice and chewy and overall perfect. I have been eating here since it was a small joint across the street and could probably eat here every day"}
{"text":"Spolumbo's I love you.  There I said it.  I first discovered my love for Spolumbo's at an industry work event where Tony was serving up some of his famous spicy italian sausages on a bun for lunch.  Being fairly new to Calgary I had no clue who this person was and why he was handing me his famous sausage.  It was love at first bite.  From that moment on it has been a fabulous love affair.  So much so we special ordered a whole whack of their sausages for our Wedding Rehearsal Dinner BBQ when hubs and I tied the knot many years ago.

Over the years we've continued to purchase and enjoy the sausage variety offered by Spolumbo's.  We love to grill some up whenever we have guests in town visiting and a few have even request it for dinner after hearing me babble about how good our grilled Spolumbo's sausage dinner was on local social media.  Seems everyone wants to try the mighty sausage I speak so highly of.  So far none of our guests have been disappointed.

When it's time for a meal we choose to head into Inglewood to wander the stores, grabbing a coffee or treats along the way with our end destination being Spolumbo's for fresh sausages.  We like to stock up and always seem to get a better deal here than any of the supermarkets selling them.  The staff are very friendly & helpful.

All hail the almighty Spolumbo's Sausage that keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"One Sentence only- Huge fresh Roast Beef mini sandwich on fresh bread with tons of pickleson the side for under 5 dollars!"}
{"text":"There are people who claim Spolumbo's  has THE BEST sandwiches in town, and the fact that it's usually crowded and has it's loyal clientele says a lot. 
Spolumbo's has history and character, it's well known in the heart of Inglewood, they are proud of their offerings and rightly so!

Yummy! Sooo yummy!"}
{"text":"Had the spicy sausage on a bun. could've been spicier... But loved the sauce, friendly staff."}
{"text":"You know, I still think about the meatloaf sandwich I ate here over a year ago.  It was a special and I haven't seen it since, which makes me sad.  It was to die for.  Everything else I've ever eaten has been good and generously portioned.  I prefer their sausages (especially the chicken variety) over most other brands."}
{"text":"Came here a few days ago for lunch with a co worker and had the spicy sausage in a bun thing. For me, when someone mentions Spolumbo's to me, I think of the spicy sausage and honestly quite disappointed with it. For $9.00 I was not impressed, it was burnt to shit same as my co workers, also you get a few slices of pickles. $9.00 does not justify that cost. What a waste of money, you can find better hot dogs on the streets in front of the bars, better yet, go to the store and buy a package of Spolumbo's sausages and you can definitely make better and cheaper ones. 

My co worker treated me, so it was free and I'm STILL here complaining about it."}
{"text":"We stopped here after an appointment in Calgary. I haven't been here since I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease in 2011 however I was craving their tomato salad. I was just going to have the salad until my husband noticed a sticker on the register that they had gluten free bread.  So I promptly ordered a Spolumbo's Special after I confirmed the meat combination was also gluten free. The bun that it came on tasted good. It wasn't dry or dense. Will definitely be stopping again on my next Calgary trip."}
{"text":"Not super stoked with this place but I wanted to be, such a name in this huge YYC - but i was so let down.

Not only are they super expensive, but act like your wasting their time. I hate when Im rushed when I order. If im spending $15 on a sub I want it made my way - and asking for meat alternatives was like asking for crack. They looked horrified. The staff act scared, with signs posted everywhere .. leaves the impression that they dont trust their staff and leaves you with a bad feeling when inside. 

So my flavourless, mostly bread, sub was ok. Subways $5 veggie beat it out of the park though. 

I want to buy local, but common. Especially when theres the Heritage that comes along with the name, keep it up. Train your staff to be stoked , maybe pay them more? - i dont know what it is, but I will not be returning. Booooo i was so excited, big fat thumbs down.

* Only reason they recieved one star was because of the excellent loctation.

This place makes me sad."}
{"text":"For a trip to Inglewood, and a hungry stomach - Spolumbo's is the number one choice.
They have ample seating, and lots of Italian sandwich offerings.   My favourite is always the chicken Parmesan, and the Spolumbo's special.     The staff is good at getting people in through the large lines, and the food is always fresh tasting - especially the bread.

I wish they still served chinotto !!"}
