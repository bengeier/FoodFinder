{"text":"Food is delicious. A bit on the pricy side, and if it weren't for the bread and butter (the bread is hella delicious btw) then maybe we wouldn't have left full, but I would still come back once in a blue moon for special occasions. Go some seafood fondue and filet mignon fondue, and cheese fondue, and french onion soup and escargot a la bourguignone. Everything was delicious. Waitress (which was the owner who had to come last minute because of missing staff) made a few mistakes with order and our fire kept going out, but she was super friendly and sweet and definitely is an owner worth supporting and coming back to. She said she is changing her menu soon (she changes every 8 years) and I wouldn't mind checking out her new menu soon. Great gem!"}
{"text":"St Anne continues to deliver!! This restaurant is not only blessed by a perfect river view and delicately balanced fondue, but also genuinely kind hospitality. The owner (Susan) takes pride in welcoming each customer as if this place was her own home.

Perfect romantic date location any day if the year!! 

Great value for a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Always an amazing experience when we go here. I just went two nights ago and already want to go back. The owner Suzanne is the funniest, nicest lady ever. Can't wait to go back!"}
