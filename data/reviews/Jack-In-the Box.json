{"text":"Dec. 18th ordered 3 sourdough burgers all tasted like they were made 2 hrs prior to being bagged for us. $15.00. Use to go every now and then... Not again."}
{"text":"Dining room a mess! No coke in coke machine. Long wait time when I am only one in restaurant. I ordered a small cup and was given a small. The lady behind me ordered the same thing and was upsized for free. I gave a look like that's not really fair and was told she is a regular,  so she gets special deals. I said thank you to the girl who brought my food and in no way did she acknowledge me. Do not go here!"}
{"text":"Quick, courteous and tasty, this Jack in the Crack delivers every time. Courtney at the drive through window is always pleasant and excited to provide the delicious goods, and with the best menu variety in the fast-food game, you can always find something to please the palate and the pocketbook. Never been disappointed going to this location and after yet another successful trip tonight, I doubt I ever will. Solid 4 stars, which ain't bad at all considering it is the restaurant known in the 90s for killing all those kids with E. Coli."}
{"text":"Tried to get some food, it took forever, all the employees could say was the owner short staffs so much, new faces all the time. Can't go back ever"}
{"text":"So sick of this Jack in the box they need new management or something I understand your not in the best area but don't you think you can make your damn food better or maybe get the orders right! Plus this location the lettuce always tastes like soap hmmm maybe don't wash the lettuce out in the wash sink that has soap in the lines.... change a lot or please hand the keys over to someone else"}
{"text":"This place is filthy.  The store smells like urine. Homeless people hanging out in the bathroom. A customer, who's apparently a regular, groping all over one of the crew members backside.  Girl behind the counter is helping prepare food after handling money. People coughing all over the food... The company should be embarrassed and afraid of making someone sick.  Their employees hygiene is terrible.  Go and see for yourself."}
{"text":"The first time I had Jack in the Box was in Dallas Texas and it was pretty decent. So when I got here I was happy to see one. Unfortunately this location is a huge let down. I've only gone about 3 or 4 times in the 2 years I've been here. The drive thru is never busy unlike Mcdonalds which is a few feet away. Now I like McDonalds as much as the next American, but I despise long lines more than the average American. I'd much rather wait there than breeze through Jack in the Box's drive thru though. 

On to the meal that prompted this review. As I mentioned before I've come here a few times and was always disappointed with the food. The only reason I came this time was because my co-worker was driving and I had no other choice. Anyhoo, the curly fries were extremely cold and my soda was flat. I got my hopes up when I saw the picture for the bacon insider burger that promised a lot of bacony goodness. I expected my taste buds to be assaulted (in a good way) with a burger that had bacon bits inside the patty, bacon mayo and bacon strips. Sounds like bacon heaven right? Wrong!!! I tasted no difference from any other run of the mill bacon burger. Oh well, the next time I'm in the position of eating jacks or starving, I think I'll just starve."}
{"text":"I guess if you go through the drive thru really late at night the employees are just nasty rude even though its a 24 hr drive thru, so young fella Marquet, at least that was his name on the receipt, should maybe get a little nicer or stop agreeing to do the over night shifts."}
{"text":"I'm sure many of you are thinking 5 stars, she has lost her mind! However, I have to admit my favorite 'pick me up' food is a Jumbo jack with cheese with curly fries and an oreo shake. i went this past Sunday, and I on this particular day I opted for an iced coffee instead of the shake, and the food was served fast and fresh with friendly service.  Nothing exceptional, but it satisfied me.

So why the 5 stars? This is particular location is in a 'sketchy' area, (19th Ave/Bell) and I have to say the manager was dealing with some very 'ghetto' patrons, they said everthing on their order was wrong; they asked for extra cheese, lettuce and tomatoes and the manager had to put more in the bag. The customers made comments about how they always get it wrong. Let's face it, Fast Food restaurants charge for everything - these folks were clearly giving the manager a hard time and trying to get stuff for free and the manager served them what they needed with a smile. I had to wait while a little bit while she took care of them, but I give this gal a lot of respect for serving me with same smile and professionalism. And when they left, she didn't roll her eyes and say anything negative, she just took care of me."}
{"text":"This is the worst Jack in the Box around.  The customer service at this place is consistently terrible, to the point that I stopped going long ago.  Half the issue is having employees whose English is unintelligible.  If you can't understand English - which is the language of this land (last time I checked, anyway), how is a person reasonably expected to be able to correctly take an order?  One time I was there, I asked for 2 Jumbo Jacks, hold the mayo.  I had to repeat myself 4 times to the attendant before they finally understood.  When I got home, the burgers were slathered with mayonnaise.  
Another time I got 2 regular burgers instead of the sandwich I had ordered.
Another time, apparently it was a shift change and I stood there for several minutes, waiting for someone to help me. All of the employees were RIGHT there, completely ignoring customers at the counter.  
The last time I went, I again requested no mayo.  This time, however, when they handed me my bag full of food, I opened it up and laid it all out on the counter and then began opening each item (I was buying for 4 teenagers besides myself, I had a lot of food there).  My burgers were again slathered with mayo.  I called the manager of this store a couple of times hoping they might be able to get this place in order, but that dream never materialized.  I no longer go to this Jack in the Box and go to the one at 24th Street and Baseline instead (MUCH better service there with people that actually speak English!)."}
{"text":"Horrible service horrible people that work there well I don't want to say people the drive thru lady was very rude a real b**** if you know what I mean! I don't recommend this location I even called the manager because of the way she was toward me and my husband. . It's not like we're getting our food free we pay for this stuff.. All I have to say if you don't like your job and what the hell are you doing there... rude lady!!... Besides all that she didn't even get my order right.."}
{"text":"Worthless. Drive thru anout half hour ago...and waiting at drive thru speaker several min...waited for line to go down and thinking maybe its my turn....no hello no responce...and me a man that goes here daily well go here for convenience fast food.... As i go to the window this enourmous female wants to jus smile at me. Np drive to van buren location where never had one issue thru out the years. At least that jack in the box nice friendly best part is the results i was looking for food!! Guess good help is hard to find i do understand that (calm cool collective) Love wasting time and energy...which is why im done w this location."}
{"text":"Came here late night but they're always so efficient they get you in and out extremely fast they will help you find the meal that you want help you find any discounts are possible they're always smiling I love because of smoking weed and have fun like me but definitely great place hit this place up anytime you have that munchies.  Jeremy is the mother f****** truth he listens and get you in and out fast"}
{"text":"They would get a much lower score if possible. If you are looking to visit a JITB, drive another mile and go to another one. I was appalled at the lack of service and the inaccuracy of the order. Sauces were left off a burrito, food was burned, incorrect condiments given, SLOW service, and a group of workers that could not get their act together. It is a dirty store outside (I went through the drive through). When I complained to JITB through their survey, they couldn't even get that right! Never again!"}
{"text":"I am giving a 1 because i can not give a zero.

Last night me and my fiance visited for food after seeing a concert. It took 3x to get our order right via the box before getting to the window. Then when we got there he tried to charge us for another order that was double ours. All while yelling over/through my car to someone else in their giant cargo truck!! We finally got our correct order... or so I thought. My sandwich that was supposed to have sausage added (and i was charged for!!) was missing sausage entirely. If that wasnt bad enough my croissant was partially BURNED. Not over done but BLACK.

I said whatever and figured i would call and address this in the morning. I called and asked for a manager. Apparently one is not there on the weekends. I was at least offered a team lead. \"Ok, at least this can get addressed\"

Nope. I was greeting with a shouting \"what do you need?\" Not so much as a \"how do you do?\"

Corporate will hear about this. I will also NEVER come back to this place either. Your restaurant and employees give fast food chains a bad name. Shame shame... 

Feel free me directly should you choose, i would love to discuss this and maybe be assured this will be resolved as i would rather not drive an extra mile or so to another one (which has always been A+ by the way)"}
{"text":"YUMMY!!!

These guys rock. I love the Classic Buttery Jack. 
OMG
One negative.. they NEVER have sour cream for the bacon and cheddar potato wedges"}
{"text":"Never come here ever unless you want food poisoning and mysterious charges made that you didn't ask for I stopped by to get lunch today and left she didn't hand me my receipt but threw it in the bag I pulled it out and saw an extra charge for some antenna ball that I never ordered or got for that matter when I tried to call they hung up on me twice"}
{"text":"The service took forever. They asked me to park out front, which I didn't mind. But after a few minutes of questioning if the teenagers in the back even remembered I was out there, I got pretty fed up. All I ordered was a few nuggets and fries... Then I get home and find hair in my food! Seriously!? When you're coming home from a long day, you don't want shitty service and shitty food! I get that it's not a five-star restaurant, but at least have the decency to get your customers out of there at a reasonable hour and give them food worth waiting for! Disgusting. Disgusting food and terrible service."}
{"text":"I am tired of going to this location and getting incorrect food. I ordered a spicy sriracha burger and literally received a patty, a bun, lettuce, and a sparing amount of sriracha spread over it. They could at least make an attempt once in a while. Terrible service and I will not be back."}
{"text":"I spent $17 for crap and a shit service. I asked for a rice bowl and I was given the response \"we're out of rice. Want something else?\" No apology, nothing. I always have a back up because sadly, this happens more often than it should. I ordered a breakfast sandwich & egg rolls, while my boyfriend tried the brewhouse & fries. The egg on my sandwich was old and hard on the bottom, and had half a piece of bacon, the egg rolls were fresh, the brewhouse had the onions on it that we requested not to have, had half a piece of bacon & was way over sauced, and the fries were WAAAAAYYYY over salted. Mind you, we waited a good 6 mins to receive our food and the only thing fresh was the egg rolls. Ricky was our order taker and served us at the window. He rushed me through my order as I ordered it, and sounded like I was interrupting what he was doing. There were also NO customers in front of me. I even think he is a manager and that's sad. I was a manager in fast food for many years and let me just say, you're doing it wrong. Had I been given a receipt, I would've given a review there, but I think Ricky knew he wasn't doing his job."}
{"text":"I will not go back to this Jack in the Box, this is the closest location to my work and I went here often. Every time I go  the place is dirty smells like a bathroom and quiet often I receive very un-friendly service (very unusual for Scottsdale). Depending on the day I never know if my food will be up to par. On multiple occasions I have seen employee's kids running around and messing with the soda machine. I almost always get water when I eat out but their water is yellow at tastes terrible.

Don't get me wrong I like Jack in the Box as a fast food restaurant but at this location I rarely get quality food. Skip this location and go to the next closest on Shea Blvd."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both go to Jack in the Box late at night after work in old town and look forward to seeing Shane!! Every time we go to order and hear Shane's voice over the intercom it makes our night, he's the mannn!"}
{"text":"I ordered #5 and it supposed to be a double burger. When I hold the sandwich the bread started breaking down to small pieces, it look the bread is very old and dry."}
{"text":"The drive thru staff were absolutely kind and considerate. The most professional fast food I have been to in a while. I looked at the stars after ordering and I was perplexed. The food was very fresh. I've worked in fast food years ago as a manger and this team of employees surprised me with their elegance. I'm sure if someone is unhappy, they'll make it right. They truly know customer service."}
{"text":"Michael is the best employee ever! Always nice and welcoming no matter what time of the day or night it is! Jack in the box are lucky to have a guy like Michael."}
{"text":"Truly a poor level of service...yes it was 2AM...but regardless...take pride in what you do. Step your game up...change the WHOLE direction you are going in at this location Jack...do better."}
{"text":"Avoid the late night guy crew at the drive through. They are too weird and silly and not focused on work, just trying to flirt with customers. It's embarrassing. Also, the cinnabon iced coffee was horrible."}
{"text":"I was craving SOMETHING at 3AM and didn't have any food at home. Living in Scottsdale, hardly anything was open at this time of the night. Jack in the box saved the day. My brother, who used to work for Jack in the Box, had recommended that I try the bacon ultimate cheeseburger with their signature bun. The burger tasted fresh but the fries were definitely out for a little bit. I went through the drive-thru to order, so I had only a short experience with the staff. However, I didn't have anything negative to say. Ultimately, it wasn't a horrible alternative to my situation but definitely not comparable to my usual gourmet burgers."}
{"text":"I had to come here, it's a West Coast tradition right? I was more excited to visit Phoenix for the food than to go to the Blackhawks vs. Coyotes game. I was biased based on my In-N-Out Burger experience, it has been on my wish list for YEARS. We passed a Jack-In-the Box and figured why not? This place is kind of like a Wendy's mated with a McDonald's but with the quality of a Burger King. There are a decent amount of options, enough to please even the pickiest of eaters (or someone who just has no idea what they want, story of my life). I went with just a plain chicken sandwich, after maxing on In-N-Out Animal Style can you really blame me? It was good, consistent, and not too greasy. The fries weren't mushy, which I appreciate. Nothing is worse that a gushy, mushy fry. On the way to the airport, this place was the perfect stop. The service was fast and efficient. I'm not sure if I would make the conscious decision to eat here again, but I'll try anything once!"}
{"text":"Food was good and the service was great - I appreciate when the service is outstanding especially when fast food.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I HATE JACK IN THE CRACK...the only time I can eat here is if I've been drinking and everyone in the car is craving it. Not like I got a say I never drink and drive :) so when we all pull up my drunken ass orders something. 

THIS PARTICULAR jack just is horrible!!!! The past 3 times!!! Drinks get mixed up...fries are missing...tomatos are there when they shouldn't...foods cold...forget my sauce for the eggrolls :( ya don't judge i tried the eggrolls and they were horrible and dry. And it's really hard to make eggrolls taste bad ,but jack in the box sure was able to do it."}
{"text":"OK, So maybe I'm biased. My wife and I both worked in this store in 1983 when we were in High School. We kept the dining room spotless in those days. This was for less than $4 an hour, and now they want $15? Hah.

We ate there this afternoon. Table edges were grungy dirty and the chairs were filthy. Makes you wonder how the kitchen is being kept. 
Food was stale.

\"If you have time to lean, you have time to clean\".

Clean it up, toss the old stuff in the bin after 15 min.

Closed as of June 24, 2018. Saw a filiberto's truck in the lot loading/unloading."}
{"text":"I wish I could leave zero stars. They always get our order wrong. Cooked a hair through my brother's burger. Acted like it was no big deal and was shocked I wanted my money back. Lied and said I had to wait a few days for a refund but when I demanded my money back somehow she managed to figure out how to refund me money. The tacos they serve are always broken in several pieces and empty or over cooked. My last trip I ordered tacos and a burger. They read the order back to me correctly, I get home and they didn't give me my burger. I called them up and they said I never ordered a burger just tacos and refused to help me out even though it had been less than 10 minutes. 
They act bothered if you ask for more than 8 packets of hot sauce for an order of 24 tacos and refuse to give you enough. They act like the sauce is coming out of their paychecks or something. 
Couple months I went through the drive thru and they told me they were no longer able to serve food even though it was clearly still marked as open. 
Don't waste of time or money going to this location. Worst jack in the box I've ever been to. 
Left a voicemail for their district manager but never got a call back."}
{"text":"Some lady named Rosa is just plain RUDE!! I've called  to make a complaint on her twice already because she absolutely does not know how to deal with customers.  And did I mention she yells at the staff to hurry up with total disregard that she's making a fool out of herself. Whatever you do, do not ask her a question about the ingredients in a salad because she will flip out on you!! Horrible service...breakfast hours"}
{"text":"Drive thru chick named Kylie wouldn't take my order because I wanted two separate orders at 1 am. Both very small and simple, with one car in the drive thru other than myself. What a joke."}
{"text":"When I inquired about a menu item that clearly came with coffee i was told that they would charge me additionally for the coffee.  In Arizona this is CONSUMER FRAUD!  The employee had the gall to argue that they are permitted to charge a different price than the one that is shown to the public when they collect it for their cash register.  Dispicable people.  Avoid like the plague!  I'd recommend Carl's Jr at 35th and Bell if you are looking for healthy food and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Took over 20 minutes to get my food at one point I took a picture of the monitor showing over 19 minutes, and I was still waiting."}
{"text":"Just went through this location in the drive thru young man work in the window by the name of Antoine the last few times I've gone through there he's been working always has a smile great service very respectful asset to that location his manager should be very proud keep up the good work"}
{"text":"This Jack in the Box is one of the most ghetto in the city.  In my experience, the employees and food are all ok and on par with what you'd expect from a Jack in the Box.  The problem is that there is almost always some raunchy homeless/government supported characters hanging around and pestering folks for money and attention.  Today there was a nasty smelly homeless guy sleeping at a table with his shoes off stinking up half the restaurant (nothing but an empty water cup on his table).  On a previous visit, a couple of hustlers came through the restaurant asking everyone if they wanted to buy some counterfeit cologne (then they left).  I regularly see thugs get off the bus stop nearby and come through the restaurant looking for some free stuff (when none is found, they leave).  Unfortunately these folks aren't the down-on-your-luck type of bums - instead, they tend toward the rude-addicted-mentally deranged type.  In retrospect, this is what I'd expect from a fast food joint that takes EBT Cards.  For that reason I can't recommend that people visit the restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the best Jack In The Boxes that I have ever been to. The employees are very friendly and quick. If there's a problem they take the extra steps to help you out and to help make it a better experience. This one is not like the others at all."}
{"text":"Got a combo meal but the fries was1/2 full, very greasy, stale.  The chickn sandwich w/bacon wasn't tasty or fresh.  Had the food been sitting for a long time?  Got 2 tacos at a different S'Dale JackinBox-saturated in grease, NOT hot. Heat the oil first!  Do the owners not know what is going on? Complained. Not a fan of many fast foods anyway."}
{"text":"If i could rate -0 stars i would. @JackInTheBox....Terrible service, went through the drive thru at 4 o'clock in the morning, and the manager wouldn't let us place 2 orders for a car. On our second run the manager over charged my friend for a simple egg and cheese sandwich. Not to be too salty, but the fries weren't salted... my buddy and I ordered the same exact sandwich. And I've worked in a fast food restaurant and I know what a patty that has been reheated tastes like. And my sandwich wasn't in comparison to my friends sandwich. I didn't know jack in the box sells jerky. Never will I go to this store again and I highly highly do not recommend going to this store. After typing this review. My reheated sandwich is cold and tastes like garbage. Store number 0145"}
{"text":"This was probably the best Jack experience I've had.

It is a tradition I have with one of my girlfriends to grab a couple tacos after a show or some drinking. Basically, just a late night.

We pulled up at something like 3:30am.

The guy at the drive through was ridiculously nice. I'm still talking about how nice he was 3 days later!

They still had their shake machines running. They ran out of whipped cream for my friend's shake so he asked if she wanted extra ice cream or cherries on top. We said go for it! Gosh, we got extra ice cream & like, 6 or 7 cherries lol

Oh yeah, & the taco's? Fresh. Stuffed. Hot. Greasy. GOOD! Why do we like these mini coronary inducers? Guilty pleasure. My friend & I agreed, these were better than other Jack tacos we've had."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and always receive very good service. They are a little slow on delivering the food, but I think this is due to the fact that they make most things to order.

I went through the drive-thru today and was the only person in line. I STILL had to wait several minutes for my order. The girl working the window, Nicolle, was very friendly and polite.

The food was good and just as ordered.

I am sure I will go back to this location and I recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Shane is the man. My favorite jbox in the valley 
I can't stress enough how awesome Shane is!!!!!! I look forward to seeing him every weekend."}
{"text":"I don't like leaving reviews for fast food places but I don't think this place deserves the two star average it has, it seems low! 
I don't eat at jack in the box very much - but I ordered two tacos & an egg roll (yeah, I know, it's weird). The tacos were gross in the best way which was to be expected. I was worried about the egg roll but I dipped it in sweet & sour and I was pretty happy about it! I'd get one again. 

 The person who took our order/handed us the food was really sweet as well. It was probably a 3 minute process from order to food in hand.

Now, the food isn't why I'm giving 4 stars. The food is 3 stars. However, my bf's sriacha burger was given to him WITHOUT jalapenos when it's supposed to have them on it. This wouldn't be so aggravating if it wasn't the third time it's happened to him. I called and explained to the woman working what happened. She was SO kind and apologetic. She offered a \"remake\" next time he comes in. All we have to do is keep the receipt. I was expecting the typical \"oh, well you could just come back\" that most fast-food places do. But this was a really refreshing and good experience. Mistakes aren't a problem when they're handled appropriately.  I really appreciated it. :)"}
{"text":"One of the better Jack in the Boxs I've been to.  Cool staff, okay drive through and the price is generally right whatever your budget.  I am just sorry they scrapped he eat and earn program."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 total times and the first time was a great experience. My order was fast and correct and the little girl working that night was very friendly and professional. She did such a good job that although I had a bad experience at a different location using mold ham on my sandwich, this girl had me change my mind about hating the place.

However I wish she would have been there the other times because my order was super screwed up there after.  The second time while placing my order the guy taking it just quit talking to me mid sentence. I sat there a minute wondering if I should pull forward or wait.  I pull forward after a while and give order at the window. They bring out something else and I hand the bag back and tell them the order isn't right. They add more items in the bag. At first I think awesome free stuff!!!! Until I realize hey they charged me for everything. That includes the multitude of burgers I never ordered. Never an offer to refund me or something else.

The only reason I gave this place an extra star is the lovely girl whom helped me the first time.  But now I'm sorry jack, I just can't return here anymore."}
{"text":"Perhaps it was just a very bad shift...   we walked in and several ppl were already, obviously 'waiting too long' for their food. The cashier however was pleasant enough (maybe new?) and took our order quickly.  We got drinks and sat. Refilled our drinks and sat...   A black SUV pulls up and an angry fella comes storming in, obviously a mistake I guess. A number is called and a man who'd been waiting as we walked in finally got his food.  After truly 15 minutes, I went up to the counter. Nobody gives me eye contact!!!  I finally ask the -no name badge- kid just standing in front of the overflowing pass through if perhaps some of that food was our. He looks at me, then just stands there scanning the screen. I ask again and point out how long it's been per the time on my receipt. The cashier is now arguing with an older lady about you can/you can't make changes to a sandwich.  Omg, 3rd time- I WANT MY FOOD! He slowly, as if unsure, put it in front of me. Missing 2 tacos. He says snarkily \"you didn't order 2 more tacos\", yes we did, no you didn't...   Well then it's a mistake cause we def ordered four tacos!  \"Then you need to get back in line!\" Seriously, going on 20 min and you want me back in (a very long) line? I ask (well shout) to the manager to help out- She comes over and drops two tacos on my tray!  Good I guess, but no explanation or apology about her rude employee or terribly slow service.  I ask the kid \"what's your name\", and I tell him \"that he's very unprofessional\" - he literally screams \"I don't care what you think, my name is eeseedrow (sp) and you can call the damn corporate office, for all I care!\"  He turns around and mutters 'F'n dick' under his breath...   YIKES! 
So our food was actually ok, fries a bit cold, but no biggie. As we ate, the circus continued. As we leave we notice that these guys are hiring managers, asset managers and crew! I hope that works out, and fast!  If you need a job...   lol
All a shame cuz I love me some Jack. I'll just steer clear of 43rd and Peoria.

{"text":"The short manager was upset about something and when I asked him how long my food would be since it was on 13 minutes he yelled at me to hold on.

{"text":"Quick service, clean remodled store. 

I had a breakfast burrito and I swear they are better then the 'berto' places.

Nothing to complain about here!"}
{"text":"Ordered a sourdough jack, paid an extra 15 cents for lettuce. When I got home to eat my burger I noticed that they forgot the meat. I went back because who forgets to put meat in a burger,right? The team leader Brandon looked at me as though I was lying and did not even say sorry for the mistake they had done. I asked him for corporates number and he lied and said it was on the receipt. Horrible customer service. If you really want Jack I would recommend you go to a different location."}
{"text":"I just came to jack in the box and after reading the previous reviews my expectations were set pretty low. Sometimes yelp works in mysterious ways because I actually had an awesome experience and they exceeded my expectations. The person taking my order was friendly and concise and the both at the window were nice and I had your typical fast food experience."}
{"text":"Good fast service . No waiting an hour for your order.. the food was hot and fresh . The servers at the Windows where happy and in a good moody . Awesome people"}
{"text":"Systems down wouldn't take an order at 11:30PM. Unkempt outer appearance. Unfriendly staff when interacting for the short period of time. Overall, it's not the best location and really should be re-evaluated."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times (both in the Dining Room and Drive- thru) over the years (since 2005). The food and the service as been all over the map.

Neither I, nor any member of my family, have gotten food poisoning here, as Sean H said. But..

Several times, my order was wrong (I don't mind getting more than I paid for, but certainly not less). And, since it was the drive-thru, it's difficult to confirm, until after you get home.

Usually, I go there on Saturdays and the food HAD always been good (even on the wrong orders). But, the last 4 or 5 times, we found dried out meat and room temperature fries about 5:00 P.M. (a lazy cook, I think), 

So, I started to go inside to get my order. Once, they got my order wrong and were able to correct it. But twice, the Dining Room was CLOSED! And, the last time it happened (1/9/16), there wasn't even a sign on the door warning customers. :(

So, it was good-bye to this JitB, and hello to the King.

Will I go back. Probably. But, on a Saturday? Probably not."}
{"text":"One of my 'go to' spots for a quick lunch.  Most of the time I go through the drive thru, but I occasionally dine in.  The restaurant is very clean and has a lot of space.  If there's a long line at the drive thru, I recommend parking and going inside.

Most of the time I order the Big Cheeseburger, which is only $1.59.  When I'm really hungry, I'll get the Ultimate Cheeseburger and Fries.  When they have the Bonus Jack available (it's a limited time specialty item), I'll order that.  It's fast food, so it's not a gourmet taste experience.

During one visit, it took them too long to make my order, so they decided to throw in a Taco for me as a bonus item...I think their Tacos are gross.  There was a homeless guy sitting in the restaurant taking a break from the summer heat, so I gave it to him....he was really appreciative of it.

{"text":"I came here early on Sunday morning, about 9 o'clock, assuming it's her breakfast would be fresh. I ordered a meat lovers burrito, and when I got home, there was no bacon on it, and maybe one egg. The tortilla was wrapped around itself three times because it was nothing inside. I'm highly disappointed. This was way too expensive to get not be happy with the product. I do not suggest this place"}
{"text":"I don't recommend eating here. I have had food poisoning twice from this location twice in the last six months!"}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience at this place. We waited in the drive thru for at least 20 minutes before the line moved. We finally got up to the speaker to order and the lady there had the worst attitude. We ended up just leaving and going to another location."}
{"text":"First of all this is a fast food restaurant. It delivers anything and everything other fast food places do, so no surprise here. Nice, crunchy onion rings. The chicken stripes were a bit mushy and greasy. The salad was fresh and the dressing tasted OK. Well, you know how those condiments taste right? All together an average fast food meal. As I said before, no surprises here."}
{"text":"Worst night time service ever. Couldn't even take our order.TERRIBLE. Shouldn't even have a job."}
{"text":"Yes, I was craving a burger at 10 in the morning. I went to the McDonalds across the street first just becaused I was heading east. When the gentleman came over the intercom I could hear some snickering and laughter; that made me happy. I like people to enjoy their job. When I ordered a burger he told me they weren't serving lunch yet. I said \"okay, thanks then\" but as I drove past the window I felt stared at like \"who wants a burger at 10am?\" Young punk... I crossed the street, and at the JITB intercom I asked, \"Can I get a burger right now?\" The man responded, \"You can have whatever you like.\" I ordered, and when I pulled up to the window was greeted by a genuine smile and he asked me. \"How was your service today?\" Awesome. I will never go back to McDonald's."}
{"text":"This review is based on fast Great Service in the drive-thru but mostly because of the Garlic Cheddar Buttery Jack which is as my man Daym Drops puts it, \"FIVE ALL DAY SON!!!!!\"   This burger can beat most Burgers I have had most anywhere! Only only one place that even comes close is \"The Burger Shop\", this burger is Off Da Chain!!!!!"}
{"text":"This Jack in the Box location has the worst service & food that I have found in the Phoenix metro area. Every time I have gone through the drive through there my order has either been wrong or inedible - how hard is it to make a taco without frying it into oblivion? The wait times are consistently more than 5 minutes...I think I will be spending that 5 minutes driving to another location, just to get the correct order & food that is properly prepared."}
{"text":"Was in a hurry for breakfast stopped by Jack's. The light was on, there was someone on the speaker system, nobody home as far as brains. 
Their server was down, so instead of being closed, lights out, they decided to open and tell people we can't accept orders. The kid argued with me about being open. If you can't take my order, you're closed. McDonald's is across the street, their loss."}
{"text":"closed - shut down 6/30/2018

{"text":"Place never fails to get my order wrong. I always always ask for Swiss cheese on my hamburger, they repeat my order, then when I get my order it's always wrong. Manager is rude."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast there by going thru the drive through.  I work on the road so I unfortunately go through drive thru's a lot more then I want to admit but wow, horrible service and the drive thur lady was so very very rude."}
{"text":"I asked them twice for a straw for my milkshake and they didn't give me one. They told me to move along and have a nice day.. the employees need to be more careful and more polite. This was the rudest service I Have ever received"}
{"text":"This is a terrible spot. I will only speak about my latest visit which set a bad mood for the rest of my day. I pull up and saw the three cheese and hashbrown burrito and got extremely happy that it was back. I begin my order and when I get to my favorite burrito i am told they no longer have it, but I am looking at it on the menu. When I  asked about it I am told that their sign flew away and they no longer carry it. I ask \"So it is false advertisement?\"  And the response without any care or concern \"Yes it is.\"... So I had them make it for me anyway ordering egg, cheese and hashbrown wrapped in a tortilla. If you go to this location do not trust the menu. If it is not a regular item chances are they do not have it. Check a menu before you arrive, so you are not disappointed."}
{"text":"This particular Jack is sketchy very ghetto-ish Wouldn't recommended getting off n eating there. If you must, drive thru please... Employees are friendly n helpful but the customers... Just iffy"}
{"text":"Quickly and accurate service, this location was generous with the ketchup & taco sauce :-) I hate getting 2 ketchups with a fry order, having to practically beg for more!"}
{"text":"So, yesterday morning, I actually had a prego craving.  I was in the mood for a smoothie for breakfast.  My traditional early morning oatmeal or yogurt breakfast was not going to do.  Baby wanted something else.  

I head on over to this Jack-in-the Box, which is close to work.  I pull up, order my strawberry banana smoothie, and am promptly told that the \"machine is broken\".  Uh...well that sucks!  I pull up to the window and the person tells me that the machine is leaking (at least I think that's what he said).  But would be about 10 minutes and it would be up and running.  

Now knowing the smoothie issues I had this morning, I dont think that the machine was broken.  The product just wasnt ready yet."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with this Jack in the Box. Orders are correct and they are always friendly when we go. Right down the street from my house."}
{"text":"Okay so it was late and everything else was closed, haha.  Normally I am not a fast food person so it would have been hard to rate them more than 3 stars but I tried 2 orders of their 2 tacos for 99 cents and I don't know if the meat was real or if anything at all in the taco was real but it was very tasty in a dirty satisfying way lol.  I actually will probably return after another long night of drinking."}
{"text":"i love their greasy tacos...always yummy and of course the jalapeno poppers"}
{"text":"I'm reasonalby sure that Jack puts crack in those tacos.  99 cents for two tacos is crazy!  And yes, I know they are kind of greasy and they don't use the most amazing ingrediants but there is something about them.....
My other favorite item is the chicken fajita pita.  It's a great option if you don't want a burger.  The fries are decent and they have a nice variety of options to choose from. And I must admit Jack's commercials are funny. Thanks Jack!"}
{"text":"Jack in the box is very similar to Burger King quality for probably a much cheaper price.  The fries, very much like BK, were actually delicious, but the burger was probably the worst fast food burger I've ever had.  There were also a few homeless people hanging out inside this restaurant and trying to hit us up for change."}
{"text":"just ordered a shit ton of food after a long plane ride - no one else in the line, ordered a side salad, the lettuce was so brown and stinky, one piece had gooewy brown stuff on it. such incompetence, and working at jack in the box at that. thanks guys def going on the fuck that list"}
{"text":"You would think Jack would train his helpers to hang change to the drive up window without dropping it on the ground and say .. I'm sorry .. the should give one the change and get off thier lazy fat teenage ass n retrieve it off the ground .."}
{"text":"Double Check your order, usually correct but have had to take in a few items. 

Not Bad and Super close"}
{"text":"You suck Jack In The Box! It's Phoenix. It's Summer. It's 100+ degrees and you dont have shake mix? Lazy freaking employees that's what you really have! If you are too lazy to make it than don't have it on your menu."}
{"text":"One of the better JITBs. The employees at this one are all extremely nice and helpful."}
{"text":"So I placed an order and when I pulled up to the window they forget to give me the hot sauce I asked for. The burger was very good anyway and the employee was nice."}
{"text":"I went this time because I needed to eat quick before an event, no time to cook, and only because I had coupon (mailer), for Buy 1 get 1 free Buttery Jack.  I selected triple bacon Buttery Jack.  Burger was a far cry from the photo on menu and in the ad for coupon.  Hardly any bacon.  Small sandwich, and not worth the 2 for 1 $5.49 + tax that I paid.   I like Carls Jr 2 for 1 better.   I feel it has more value.  The Buttery Jack was ick, dry, and the employee could not tell me why this burger was called \"Buttery\".   She told me no one in the restaurant would have a clue (they only work there).  I realized that it is not in her job description to answer my questions about what Buttery means, and she said her manager was in a meeting.  Don't want \"Buttery jack\" even for free.   This was 3 days ago and I still have not eaten my second burger.  When I do I think I will put tomato and lettuce and lotsas onions in it, and toast the bun, all to make it taste better."}
{"text":"Rudeness, incompetence and bad attitude abound.  Ordered a coffee with cream and sugar.  No cream, no sugar, no communication.  Not a great way to start the day."}
