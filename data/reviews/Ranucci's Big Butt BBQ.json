   I don't get any opportunity to get catering. If I do, I'm coming straight to you!! Butt what do we do without our regular bbq \"fix\"?? 
   We love you guys!!! Good luck!!! And we hope to see you (and eat some of your DELICIOUS BBQ) soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"The Southern Philly Sandwich was so good that I had to come back to the truck and get the Porkasorus. This crew is producing a really great true smoke flavor in their food. Next event I need catered I'm going to call them."}
{"text":"The best BBQ in NC and the friendliest service.  A wonderful family serving families in the Carolinas."}
{"text":"I visited their food truck to see if their food was better or worse than their catering. And nothing has changed! Great service, great food, and great people. I got their Texas Reuben since we had their pulled pork and chicken at our wedding. The Brisket was delicious, and the jalape√±o slaw had a little bit of heat but the slaw definitely keeps it cool. The fries were delicious too. They were made fresh and seasoned just right (not too salty). Definite recommend. They will be at food truck Friday on April 3rd, so be sure to visit them!"}
{"text":"Ranucci's Big Butt BBQ catered a community BBQ this past weekend. The whole hog dressed was the star of the show. The neighbors loved the whole thing from taking pictures to eating the goods. Alex was terrific to work with. I highly recommend their catering and will definitely be using them again in the future. Looking forward to visiting the food truck sooner than later."}
