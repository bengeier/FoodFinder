{"text":"Top place to enjoy your lunch or dinner! The family who owns this restaurant are such great people! Me and my coworker have been there many many times and everytime we eat very well! Meat is the best you can find in Toronto, feeling like to eat at home...i am iItalian and i know about food!"}
{"text":"Pretty good overall. Service was good and pretty quick. Not more than 2 other patrons at the time we weee there at 7 pm on a Saturday night.
The ranch homemade burger, and banquet homemade burger were juicy and tasty. $59 includes food for family of 4 and taxes. 3 homemade burgers, a souvlaki on a bun, small Greek salad, fries and a poutine, no drinks ordered. 
Friendly place, drove by many times and it was worth it. 
The poutine and fries can be shared by 2 people each. They are not a huge order but fine to share. 
Place is outdated but clean."}
{"text":"Great little place for a nice breakfast or a good burger for lunch. Does not have the outrageous prices of many of todays burger chains but has all of the good home made taste. I used to bring my kids when they were younger and hope to bring my grandkids one day."}
{"text":"Maybe standards are lower in the suburb or that people are too nice to rate this hard working family restaurant what it truly is, a two star restaurant.

My friends and I were going to a special event in the area and figure we would ball out and get the two most expensive dishes on the menu, the rib and steak. Both major disappointments! Steak was small and too cooked. Rib was cold. They had to reheat it and didn't charge us for it. 

My other friend had the burger and said it was that good. The cokes were flat and service was slow because a sports team came in. Nice owners here but truth is the food and experience was not good. Definitely not a four star restaurant!

{"text":"Step back in time to a place that looks like a diner in the '70's. While some places decorate to look that way, this is authentic. 

However, I remember food of that era tasting better. They have 2 burger menus, the regular and the home style, home style being made on premises using fresh beef, and not from frozen pucks. That was my choice. I ordered the Texas bacon cheeseburger. 

This burger patty was fairly dry, even crunchy at the edges, salty and on a moderately dry bun. I suspect they were not having a good day. I'll go for another chance..."}
{"text":"Although the restaurant could use some updating, don't let that distract from the fact the food is very good.

A group of 4 went here one night as we decided to try something new. Two of us ordered ribs, one a chicken dish the other a steak. We were not disappointed.

Portion size is good (you will not leave hungry) and the food was very flavourful. Cost was in line with what you order and is not unreasonable.

Try it out...you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I grew up down the street of this restaurant and never went to it for some reason. Now that I am 26 I went there for the first time. For a burger and breakfast place it is GREAT! Reasonable prices, great portions, good food, nice people. NO pretentious frills. NO fiber based soy latte frou frou vegan* expensive turd tasting dishes. Just good food. Good prices. Just a nice place to go for a reasonable meal in a nice rustic restaurant.

*Note: I like eating good tasting vegan and vegetarian food, and LOVE Field Roast vegan products. I just hate most vegan and vegetarian places because their food is usually way over priced and is presented as being pretentious. If you're vegetarian or vegan this isn't the place for you. However, it is still a great restaurant."}
{"text":"The Texas it has been one of my all time favorites I hadn't been there in a couple of years and had breakfast just last week I'm fortunately I found it now overpriced and to be honest the quality of the breakfast is not there any longer there a lot better breakfast house is offering a better tasting product"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I've only been in once, but I have driven past it hundreds of times and wanted to go in. It looks like one of those little one-off restaurants that you normally find in small towns, not in Vaughan, that's for sure!
I had a cheeseburger and fries, and they were really quite good. Their prices were great and while it was a little outdated inside, it didn't really matter because it still felt inviting and home-y. 
I'd like to go back and try their breakfast....who doesn't like a good breakfast! :)"}
