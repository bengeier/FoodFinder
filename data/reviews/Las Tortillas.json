{"text":"ARRRRIBA!  Las Tortillas is delicious!  They have fresh, homemade tacos to die for.  It's a family run place and they definitely know what they are doing.    I've been there a couple times when the person serving me wasn't the friendliest person, but we all have bad days.    The food is fresh, full of flavor and it's authentic.  It is fantastic!  I love Mexican food and I've had a lot of it - this place makes good food.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's temporary, but a hand written note on Las Tortillas door said as of July 6th tacos will be served at a restaurant just down the street called Oro Azul. We made our way to a cute and clean little restaurant, decorated in a Mexican theme. We sat down and a few minutes later were asked what we'd like to eat. We learned from the 14 year old girl who was serving us ( owner's daughter, I assume) that there is no menu, they only offer what was on the chalk board up front near the till.  We ordered a couple shrimp tacos, two steak tacos, one chicken taco and a chicken tamale.  The corn tacos are small in size, so it's nice that you can order a few or a lot. The steak was a bit tough, but the guacamole was amazing. Lots of cilantro and not too much citrus, which I prefer. The chicken tamale was mushy and bland. The best was the shrimp tacos. The shrimp were large and perfectly cooked, served with melted cheese over top and a red sauce with a bit of spice. I could have eaten a truck load of these alone. I think with a few more items on the menu and maybe an actual menu a well, this place could be even better. . . But I'm still confused as to of this will be the permanent spot that you'll find las tortillas tacos or not . . . Hmmmm. . . Maybe a few more details on the sign would have been good."}
{"text":"Great little family run establishment and judging by how many stack of tortillas they make it's obviously a hit with the local Mexican community.  Their hot tacos you eat on the spot are very good considering how difficult it is to get the right and fresh ingredients.  A pack of take home tortillas are a great deal and much better than anything you could get at the supermarket.  Makes a very easy and healthy dinner.  I doubt it would compare to anything in the US but this is a whole different ballgame up here and I congratulate them in trying their best.  They even import their own corn flour up here to get as authentic as possible."}
{"text":"Im new to the city and its very important to me that I can have tasty Tacos to put into my face whenever I need them. I was honestly a little anxious when I moved to Calgary that I would have a hard time finding the right spot for me. Well fear no more, this place is legit. REAL tacos. 10 out of 10, would taco again."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome. As a taco expert (I ate millions when I lived in texas) I can definitively say this is the best in Calgary. Prepare to have a real taco experience. Get the Tacos al Pastor or the Carne Asada tacos. Awesome awesome awesome. I needed this to come to Calgary."}
{"text":"I finally found a convenient time to try Las Tortillas after weeks, maybe even months, of craving REAL tacos. The small restaurant is tucked away in a small strip mall just north of Marlborough Mall. Don't expect to have a gourmet sit-down experience. Most people who come here take their tacos to go, or they gather around the small table in the middle of the room that seats 6 people comfortably. About 60% of the space is the kitchen, and the rest is the roaming area for guests like me.  The menu is simply a letterhead of about 8 different items to choose from. I was here to the tacos, so I tried the beef and the shrimp. The prices have not changed (they are still $3-4 a piece) and let me tell you, it was well worth it! I tastes like the ones you would get at a street vendor in Mexico, except with more stuff! It was very flavourful, spicy, meaty, and well balanced.   Although my experience lasted maybe 10 minutes, it left a lasting impression. The small shop was showing what looked like a Spanish soap opera on TV, and the staff was very attentive and friendly. I didn't feel like a stranger at all. I'm happy to confirm that Las Tortillas DOES have the best tacos in the city!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me that the tacos at Las Tortillas were very good. I went tonight. I thought I was going to a take out restaurant. Instead Las Tortillas is more of a Mexican grocery. After seeing the interior of the store I wondered if it was even a legitimate business. Since my friend enjoyed the tacos so much I decided to stay.   I ordered two tacos. The shrimp and the chorizo. Both were very tasty. I was quite impressed as the tacos were very authentic. In fact they are by far the best tacos I've had in Calgary. I would definitely recommend Las Tortillas."}
{"text":"Came here based on the reviews, hoping for the authentic Mexican taco i had heard so much about.   Located in a strip mall in Marlborough, from the outside this place doesn't look like much. Inside it has a table, maybe 2, and the front portion of this small store contains half empty shelves with Mexican products. I saw a kind of hot sauce that we had picked up in Mexico, it was nice to know it's there.  I ordered 2 tacos: barbacoa and pastor. The lady at the till asked if I wanted them \"Lebanese style\". I've never heard of that so I asked about it, she said it means they come with cilantro and onion. That sounds like how a taco should be, but what the heck do I know.   (NOTE: I actually did some googling about this and it turns out that the pastor style tacos are actually considered a Mexican middle eastern adaption brought by immigrants from Lebanon to Mexico. Which means I was right about not knowing anything - ha ha ha!)  The meat seemed microwaved and each taco was covered in a generous helping of salsa, red salsa on one taco and green salsa on another. I prefer to put my own salsa on but I figured what the heck. It turned didn't care for the salsa and was disappointed that there was so much on it. As for meat, it seemed as if it was microwaved or reheated and the flavour just wasn't there for me.  What I did love here was the corn tortillas. Those were bang on and so yum. I will most certainly be back for those."}
{"text":"Las Tortillas is a great family run place to go to pick up tacos for lunch and a kilogram of corn tortillas for home.  Generally they have pork, chicken and beef tacos every day around lunch time.  They are an excellent value at $3.  There is one big table if you want to \"dine in\".  It's fun to watch the tortilla machine churn out awesome corn tortillas."}
{"text":"I may have to agree with Dan and Andrew here.. Las Tortillas has the best tacos in the city!   After my Mexican food revelation in San Francisco, where I realized what I had been missing all these years of my Canadian life, I must say I am pretty happy I tried out Las Tortillas and their tacos yesterday. This is exactly how a taco should be... flavourful, meaty, and reasonably priced. At $3 or $4 a piece, you cannot go wrong. I tried the beef, chicken and the shrimp yesterday. It takes a while for them to give you your food, but its worth it. I was jubilant yesterday. Since I absolutely refuse to eat the bland skimpy mess that the Calgary institutions put out, calling it 'tacos', I thought I was doomed to depriving myself of all kinds of Mexican food in Calgary... but it doesnt have to be that way anymore! I have found my fix!  Total win. I have already declared my decision to come get some tacos here every time I am in the NE.   6/30"}
{"text":"This is the only Mexican place I've been to in Calgary that captures some of the spirit of the places I've been to in California (but I haven't tried the taco truck yet).  They've got the imported bottled Coke, it's a bit rough around the edges, they serve tongue, and the tacos taste good.  There's only one round table (seats 5 or so) in there, so plan on eating outside, in your car, or standing up."}
{"text":"The small tortillas are made of corn flour and the minute you walk in the door you can smell the corn tortillas.     One of the nice touches was a sign on the wall that told us during Lent the Shrimp Tortillas were $3.00 apeice.     We wanted to try the Chirozo tortilla but they were out tonight.  They were out of pork, too.     So we had chicken beef and shrimp tortillas with 'everything' on them     Spicy, tasty fillling in small soft handmade tortilla shells were all about the taste and freshness.  About 4\" in diameter  were enough to tease the palate but in order to feel full my guys would have needed 3 but budget conscious hubby ordreed 2 for each of us.    There is a table in the middle of the waiting area, but we chose to take ours home.  These are not the kind of 'loaded'  8\"  toritillas you can expect from a chain restaurant, they are much smaller and with delicately balance flavour for each meat.  There is no extra cheese or jalapenoi pepper, just home made little pockets of very good food!  But beware the parking lot!   Some of those pot holes and a few of the drivers are pretty scary!"}
{"text":"Las Tortillas provides the absolute best corn tortillas available in Calgary,and best of all they are much cheaper than you can get from the supermarket. I have asked my COOP store manager to carry them. You can also buy them at Salsista's which is near my home in the NW.  Their homemade family style tacos are comparable to any traditional ones found in Southern California. Since I truly enjoy authentic tacos, their lingua  rates right up at the top as maybe the best I have ever had anywhere, including SoCal or Mexico. The shrimp tacos are an extra dollar and are worth every penny.  The pork tacos should be tried by those that just want some great Mexican flavors, and then the chicken and beef... Oh and be sure to try their tamales with their grand mother's special sauce!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten there but partner got takeout a while back. Best tacos I have had in Canada!"}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say! This place gives people a taste of what real tacos should be! In my opinion, the best Mexican in Calgary ! It may only be tacos but trust me quality over quantity, and as far as Mexican restaurants go as a general rule of the thumb, the more items there are on the menu the crappier the food....  It gave me such a great feeling to see such a humble operation produce something that's authentic. It's pure and honest food made by people who care and who use the right ingriedients cooked the right way!  It's a home operation,they make tortillas from scratch and they sell them, they have a small grocery section to. To be honest the place looks like its falling apart but it adds to the charm in this case! Like I said before, it's a humble operation!   I have been waiting all my life for Calgary to have a place that makes it the right way lets talk about... Pork, beef, chicken, shrimp, tongue... Each topped in a flavorful  unique sauce(depending on the protein) and little condiments , sitting on two FRESH tortillas , just roll and enjoy!. So simple so delicious !   I have been to Mexico countless times and each time I go I eat REAL tacos! And now I can also get REAL tacos in my own city!! when I have a grumbly tummy itchin for some taco love I now have a place to go for a hug!   18/30"}
{"text":"As background I spend a fair bit of time in Texas and California where there are a lot of Mexican/Hispanic street vendors and nothing beats a good street taco for a quick snack.  A few of them and you've got yourself a damn fine meal.    So when I was in the neighborhood the other day thought it would be a great opportunity to finally check out Las torillas and boy am I happy I did.  The cook (and i would assume the owner) was very friendly and while I watched him putting together my order it put a smile on my face to see that he took pride in his product and restaurant.  I went with the beef, pork, chicken and tongue.  All were served with a unique salsa...from memory I believe the chicken was with salsa verde, the beef was with salsa taquera, the pork with the salsa roja (the pork and beef might have been vise versa with the salsas) and the tongue had a sort of mushy salsa fresca.  Regardless of the meat/salsa combo ALL were wonderfully flavorful.  Each different where you could pick up the unique tastes of each meat and the salsas.  Nothing was over powering or too spicy (don't get me wrong, some did have a definite kick).  Of my four selections its honestly difficult to pick a favorite.  All were great.  Only warning I'll provide is the tongue well, it looks like tongue.  The other meats are shredded but the tongue is just a nice thick slice of meat with all the little funky taste-buds in full view.  If you're a little squeamish about your food you might want to pass.    Also have to give props for the tortillas sold in bulk.  I picked up a package and made a great batch of huevos rancheros for the girlfriend and I for breakfast this morning.   Las Tortillas is really a great reminder of why it pays to go off beaten path and in particular to try the little Mom & Pop shops.  Awesome food and great service by people who care."}
{"text":"Hands down best tacos in the city!  Fresh homemade tortillas blanketing your choice of beef, chicken, pork, shrimp or tongue at $3 a piece!  I will take 6 thank you!  The shrimp was my favorite but the other options are no slouches either.  Take style place and home to the most authentic tasting tacos I have had in a while!  Loves it!"}
{"text":"This is the place.  It has been a long and fruitless search for some good tacos in Calgary, and finally, this is the place.  At $3 or $4 apiece, these little tacos pack a wallop of flavour. Your options are generally beef, chicken, pork, chorizo, shrimp, and of course ... tongue.  Of that list, I have only had the first 4 (so far) but I definitely plan to taste the other two next time I go back! Each taco is unique and each one, delicious. In fact, I was going to try to pick one as my favourite, but I recommend getting all of them.  Even though this review is mostly about their tacos, I should point out that their main operation is simply ... Las Tortillas.  You can see rows and rows of these corn-based wonders laid out behind the counter, ready for consumption.  The tortillas can be purchased in bulk quantities from 1 kilo to 15(!) kilos and they are for sure the best I've found in these parts.  The location of this lovely tortilla factory is small, dimly lit and a little bit stinky! Which makes it particularly exciting that the owner told me that in a few months he is opening another location (near the Petro Canada by Marlboro Mall?) to focus more on the tacos and other dishes. The tortilla factory will remain, but this will be more of an eatery.  Absolutely can't WAIT for that!"}
