{"text":"Great food and service! Came here for a special occasion. Large variety of food on the menu! Will come again :)"}
{"text":"Their sushi is very nice and the decor of the restaurant is interior is simple with the white and beige two tone scheme and the black wood seating arrangements are very nice."}
{"text":"This place is pretty delicious! I like that it comes with sashimi too and I really like their rolls so far!! Win win situation for me ! Can't wait to come back for another dinner with the family !!"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi! Clean, pretty, and their staff was friendly. The sushi was also good quality. Will be coming again."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Was way over priced compared to other places in the area.  Ordered spring roll and was supposed to be 2 ended up getting one cut up into pieces.  Small amounts of food for higher prices. Left hungry and with a high bill. They need to check the competition out on price and quantity."}
{"text":"The volcano roll is so good! 
The staff is really friendly and all of the food tastes fresh and delicious. Definitely coming back and would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I usually don't review places unless they are overall exceptional or extremely bad.... This one was overly disappointing. Me, my wife and 8 year old daughter came here for lunch around noon. The place was empty the whole time we were there. Now the service was ok. Our waitress was attentive but forgot a few items that we ordered. Usually that would annoy me but the food was so bad I was actually thankful of her forgetfulness. Majority of the Nigiri we ordered the fish tasted bitter. Not exactly the flavor profile I would expect from raw fish. The Uni was very dark that left a bad taste in my mouth even after several helpings of ginger.... And I hate ginger with a passion. So to use that to cleanse my palette is saying a lot. I cannot convey my dissatisfaction of Gorilla Sushi because words haven't been created in the English language that would equal my feelings of disgust...."}
{"text":"FRESH WASABI!  ... and it was great. My wife and I enjoyed everything we had and we were impressed by the real crab in a couple of the rolls.  My only knock is the poke salad was a bit heavy handed.  Is wasn't bad - it just wasn't great. I prefer the poke salad from Whole Foods. Still not enough to take off even a half-star.

Also the dining room was very clean and they had Canadian football on one of the tv's. Win win win."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of the sushi at Gorilla Sushi. The staff is friendly and the food is out of this world. Mega Bucks is my favorite roll. If you go you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi place with really nice staff! The waiter and waitress were both very prompt with taking orders when we were done, as well as removing dirty plates. Our chef was Eddie, and he was amazing. Super friendly and talkative, he made a good experience great. Would definitely recommend coming by!"}
{"text":"I came here during their grand opening for their 50% off all you can eat special. I thought that the food was good. Some of the rolls were a little messy but they were very busy so I understand. The wait was around 30 minutes and it was a little annoying because there's not much waiting space inside so we had to wait outside, in the heat, for most of the time. The service from our waitress was not great because we would have to wait so long for her to take our order for more rolls, but she was nice and it was understandable because of the amount of people she was helping. Overall I liked the food and the service was okay, but I think it will get better with time and when they're less busy."}
{"text":"The place is clean and the servers are very nice.  The sushi has great flavors and the sashimi was fresh and tasty. Good place for dining with friends and family."}
{"text":"It was ok have had better All you can eat sushi but some dishes were still good each had its own mix some went well some didn't match but it is a good service and Nigiri was good just the specialty rolls hit my taste buds wrong could of been better than it was"}
{"text":"I was referred to come here and wow! Can't wait to come back.... 
the no rice choices are a plenty and service is great. I have favorites already....
My work is not far from here.... can't wait for my dessert to come... sounds sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Wow, I loved it. My experience was lovely, due to the BOGO on the alcohol. Food was good, staff was friendly."}
{"text":"This place is by far one of the best AYCE sushi spots.   The service is top notch and fast.  The sushi is fresh and amazing.  I enjoyed my experience here... I'll definitely be back.."}
{"text":"The waiter Jay was very friendly and fast. He explained everything and built up enthusiasm for a nice meal. The \"all you can eat\" idea seemed interesting for a sushi place. Unfortunately, the quality of the different menu items just wasn't what we hoped for."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. I just discovered this place two days ago and been here both days. Great place, great price and most importantly sushi is amazingly good! I recommend. Service is great as well."}
{"text":"I found another my go to spot sushi restaurant ! 

I usually go to sushi twister....
And I've tried sooooo many different of sushi AYCE restaurant in Las Vegas . But everywhere same and everywhere have something I don't like . 

First I like this restaurant because it's very clean ! 
This is very important for me cuz I eat food and especially sushi ! 

Food was very good ! 
I eat nigiri and appetizer so I don't know special rolls .... 
but nigiri was fresh and tasty also they have many variety of appetizer n I didn't disappoint in nothing .... 

Of course service was nothing bad ! 
Everybody Nice ! 

And it was no too busy ...
So service fast and I can take time and enjoy my sushi ! I will 100% come back !"}
{"text":"The food is ok and the service .but my major complain is that one of the sushi chef went to the restroom and he did not wash his hands with soap the reason i know this is because i went after him and not a single drop of soap in the dispenser"}
{"text":"I moved from Vegas to Portland OR about five years ago and have been missing quality sushi.  Came back for a visit last weekend and tried out Gorilla Sushi.  It was amazing!  $20 for AYCE lunch and it was beautiful.  Tried sashimi, nigiri, and some specialty rolls. They let us try half rolls, which I love because you can try more things.  That screaming orgasm though!  So dang good.  Topped off the amazing meal with strawberry mochi.  The staff were super nice and attentive.  I will definitely be coming to Gorilla Sushi the next time I'm in town.  It's our new favorite!"}
{"text":"One of the most affordable sushi spot near UNLV. You can have some sushi here and go next door for  billiards!"}
{"text":"Been to quite a few all you can eat sushi places in Vegas, but this one topped them all.   Everything tasted so fresh and not all the rolls tasted the same like other places.   Service was fast and very friendly.   We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Our service was timely and professional. Brian was a great host!  I would definitely recommend anybody in the area."}
{"text":"Great place for eating sushi, service is good and the location is also very convenient for UNLV students, not far from the campus."}
{"text":"Brand New sushi place that opened not long ago
Very clean and fresh fish that they serve.
Nice staffs, good interior design with great sushi man."}
{"text":"This is first time to visit here. This is a new restaurant with new interior. Price is cheaper than other all you can eat restaurants. People serve food quickly. Servers are really nice. It is really nice place to go with friends."}
{"text":"The food at Gorilla Sushi is so delicious!My husband and I went to eat dinner tonite for our 32nd wedding anniversary.The workers are always so very friendly and the place is very clean.We've eaten there several times now and are always happy with the excellent service that we receive.I highly recommend Gorilla Sushi."}
{"text":"We ordered a large variety of items off the menu and each and everyone was delicious. There was plenty of food for the price and the quality was good. The only thing that could have been better was the wasabi (not hot) and we needed more ginger which can be corrected by request next time.  Thank you Gorilla Sushi , An Alaskan Vacationer"}
{"text":"Second time coming here,  the first time was 1 week after they opened.  I make it appoint to try new places. It's important to support local small business. I was pleasantly surprised at the service and quality of fish.  I loved the whole experience. The service his friendly and professional, and the chefs were pleasant and quick."}
{"text":"This has been our go to sushi spot when we're in Vegas. It's all you can eat and they have a large selection. You have to try the Gorilla Dream."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh sushi! Great service and atmosphere! My new \"must go\" for Friday nights."}
{"text":"I went with a group of people and typically I don't like sushi, but the food was good. Even with it being a sushi restaurant they had a number of options for those of us that don't necessarily like seafood. Not to mention the restaurant was really modern and servers were nice. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and did not even attempt to order anything. As soon as I sat down I noticed a bunch of customers sitting around me waiting for their food. There were only two sushi chefs working and one of them was apparently a new hire who was struggling to keep up with the orders. I felt right away that service would be slow and so I asked the waitress and she agreed. It's a shame because the menu had a lot of interesting items I wanted to try but not at the expense of waiting half a day for my food to come out. I left and drove to another AYCE sushi spot with faster service."}
{"text":"The service was excellent, the food was amazing. Everything was fresh and incredibly good. Be sure to try, and it will end with what you so long wanted."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but was incredibly cold and soggy when we received it. 

I placed an advance order online to be delivered three hours later. Apparently their procedure is to cook the food when the order is placed then have it sit for hours until the scheduled delivery time. Horrible practice.

The food would probably be good if they didn't let it sit for three hours before delivering it."}
{"text":"Trying a new Sushi place. Menu looks great, selection looks good too. Food taste good. 
Staff is friendly but service is slow and have to repeatedly remind staff for the things we asked for 5-10 min ago. (I.e. Napkins, fork, water, etc)
Service got better though but it took a little bit. Food continued to be excellent!
I would definitely come back her again."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the sushi. The dessert that you can have after your meal was weird. I ordered honey toast, I was expecting at least like a few pieces not the whole thing of course,(I have had honey toast before at other cafes/restaurants) I received a toasted dinner roll with a scoop of ice cream and a drizzle of honey, it was off putting."}
{"text":"This is literally the best small,  little window place you've never heard of. If you were to google top sushi spots in Las Vegas, this place definitely needs to be in the top 10! Gorilla sushi is awesome and the quality of the fish is amazing, very very close comparison to those places with 5-6 times the cost. I've found my favorite spot from now on, will be coming quite often as a big woman for a long long day lol she was a little too busy and we all had the best time for the day she said yes yes woman you can do that for sure. I used my center tab to write that, but seriously if you love sushi Gorilla is a must! Come see NICK! That's literally his name (heart and everything) on his name tag.. you can't miss it because they are lit up bright as shit. This whole place is LIT and i love it! NICK is great! And I'm not saying that for the free , who doesn't love free . I genuinely mean it, thanks for the experience guys! Mario A Guerra aka The doctor, I'm out! (Mic drop) 
P.S. I will always remember you NICK and no I'm not drunk."}
{"text":"Great sushi. We'll definitely will come again. Really good quality and the sushi chef is very nice :) All of the food is very good and the dessert is great too. The waitress is friendly."}
{"text":"My son and I happened upon this place and had a late lunch there. It was fantastic. I had the AYCE dinner which included sashimi options. He had the AYCE lunch. The food was fresh, the serving sizes were generous and the service was excellent. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Well worth the drive from the strip. Fresh food, friendly service. Must try the Mexican Fiesta if you like a little spicy. 

Super reasonable pricing for the AYCE. Buy 2 get 1 beer on Sunday. 

Great job !"}
{"text":"Clean. Casual. Service excellent. They said \"yes\" to all my requests. Did all you can eat and left totally satisfied. Price was right. Quality of fish and product very good. Enjoy! Tell them you found them on Yelp and check in. They might give you a free drink. They did for me."}
{"text":"waiter was suuuuuper nice and the sushi was the bomb dot com!!!! i love this spot. it's also super spacious and pretty on the inside. :D"}
{"text":"Had a great time here! Based on some older reviews, I can definitely tell this place has improved a lot!
We had 2 servers, Vicky and - I believe - Jay. They were both very attentive and took very good care of us. They were always around, made sure we got all rolls that were ordered, and refilled our drinks when needed. Mr. Alex checked on us towards the end of our meal and helped servers running food when they got busier. That says a lot about management.
We had many rolls, as there were 4 AYCE, sashimi, garlic edamame, agedashi tofu, and moshi ice cream for desert. The fish were fresh, and the amount of rice on the rolls was appropriate. Everything tasted great, and we'll go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Truly A-Ok. 
Nothing less; nothing more.
(One exception; our server, Jay was awesome!)

Everything that we tried was fine. Nothing that we had blew us away.
I kept waiting and hoping for the OMG moment, but it never came. 

My very handsome date and I tried a wide variety of nigiri, sashimi, apps, and rolls. 
My favorite was the Caterpillar Roll. The Eel sauce was not too too sweet or overwhelming. 
He liked the uni (Sea Urchin) nigiri sushi - which is fine. He can have mine.

We both agreed that the rice was good.

Minor complaint; the music was a bit boisterous and loud for us - but we're a couple of 50-year-old guys who like to converse and gaze adoringly into each other's eyes while we dine. This was a bit more of a college party atmosphere than we tend to enjoy. But that's just us.

With so many great AYCE sushi places in town, Gorilla will either have to get more creative or up the overall food quality for this to be a regular stop for us."}
{"text":"I went back to this restaurant with my boyfriend after my previous 5 star review and the waitress was a complete idiot and we were told they could not sit us because they were understaffed but there were plenty of chefs to prepare our food and 4 empty booths!! Not sure if this place will stay open if they treat returning customers like that!"}
{"text":"This place used to have great service and sushi/sashimi AYCE but then they lost their great chef and some of their staff and the place has just gone downhill. We had a bad experience after they changed their head chef and were told by the manager we could have a comp for one of our meals the next time we came in. We told her we travel to Vegas about 3 times a year. She said \"no problem\" and took our information. So, tonight we went to give Gorilla Sushi another try. The owner did not care about our previous experience nor would he honor what his previous manager told us. He treated us like he did not care for our happiness. We will never go back."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. It took over 25min to get a California roll and some appetizers. The food was ok. The vegetable fried rice had no taste. We waited over 2hours for an order of pork belly and it came with 3 small pieces. No, the place wasn't that busy. There were a lot of empty tables. The reason they said our food was taking so long was because of phone orders. Apparently orders over the phone are more important than physical customers."}
{"text":"Consistently EXCELLENT!! Great service, extensive AYCE menu and always a good choice day or night. Try the Gorilla Dream roll and Popcorn Lobster :) :)"}
{"text":"A recently opened new sushi place by UNLV area which has a special of 50% off AYCE during the first week. Heard from a friend who went there earlier today for lunch so decided to try it out for dinner 

Outside reminds me of Kabuto, a high end omakase style only restaurant in town. Simplistic plain, white walls with narrow windows.... except it all changes when u go inside. Very conflicted decor. Lol. Ceiling had a nice design with the varying height lighting. the sushi bar and the wall behind looked nice with the layered acoustic sound dampening foam lookin like design wall (i dont know how to describe it) Then... u have the cheap bar chairs that look like they are from hawaii, and tables with benches that remind me im in a food court. see? conflicted.....

We were sat at a table fairly quickly and had our drink orders taken. And that was that. Lol. One of my friends had written down our nigiri order on a napkin and handed it to the waitress. It took one or two more servers to ask us before we had actually even received our waters. 

Food came out periodically. Fairly slowly. Actually quite slow considering they seemed to have a fully staffed sushi bar with 3 chefs and a restaurant barely half full, if that. The dining room staff was very attentive in repeatedly asking us if everything was ok, by multiple people... but nothing ever came out quicker than expected after telling them we were waiting for our orders. 

Fish to rice ratio was pretty decent but fish slice size were definitely inconsistent. Fish slices varied in thickness. Some quite thin. Some quite thick. Their sexy salmon nigiri was essentially a salmon nigiri with a slice of avocado on top, slice of lime without the peel but WITH the seeds, some spicy thousand island-like sauce, and a small spot of sriracha. Quite inconvenient to eat when u have to eventually pull out the seed from the cut slice of lime. Nigiri overall were ok. The most weird one was probably the Ikura. Never had i seen such \"ugly\" ikura. Quite the few were \"deflated\" and \"flat\". Some seemed \"mushed up\". Color seemed a bit off too. Rice was a bit weird in combination with the ikura. Rice seemed mushy in this order. The rice, itself, in the nigiri was ok but would have preferred a little more vinegar taste but seemed to vary in quality over the course of the night. Some was soft, some seemed like it sat out for a while..... 

Our 2nd order essentially disappeared, despite being placed to the manager himself. Order was checked on by the servers and eventually the manager. We had ordered the Gorilla tuna, salmon, and yellowtail sashimi as well as some hand rolls and appetizers. Tuna sashimi had some cajun spice on top. Salmon sashimi had some weird sweet sauce on it and cut weirdly.. Yellowtail with ponzu but fairly \"normal\" in that aspect. I had ordered a salmon avocado handroll and a salmon skin hand roll. When the handrolls came, the manager was like, \"oh i had the chef put more fish in the handrolls for you since it took so long\". To be honest, i dont feel like it was larger than how any other restaurant would have done it. Also, my salmon skin handroll became a salmon handroll, with less salmon than my salmon avocado handroll. Lol Friend's agedashi appetizer came before the sashimi's but my green mussels were no where to be found

As mentioned previously, food came out slowly. probably a good 15 minutes or longer between each dish. 

We had originally arrived at 8... by the time we got thru our 2 orders... they were asking for last call by 1030. We decided to just give up and go for dessert. Something outside of the sushi chef's realm. It was a choice of either ice cream, mochi, or tempura ice cream. With tempura ice cream, we had a choice of what ice cream, so each of us ordered one as well as other things. The server later came back soon after taking our order and told us they were out of all tempura ice creams and asked if we'd like to order any other ones in addition to what we had before. So we did. When the desserts came out, the ice creams had chocolate syrup drizzled on top. Normally it wouldnt be weird to have this happen but who in their right minds would drizzle chocolate syrup on top of green tea ice cream.... another weird combination by gorilla sushi ! ! 

Price wise WITH the 50% off is a great deal but you must allocate quite the amount of time to eat. After about 2.5 hours, we still left not really full. Would have loved to order more but they were so slow in fulfilling their orders, who knows when we'd get it... IMAGINE how much worse it can get when the restaurant is actually full."}
{"text":"At here for the first time recently, and was so impressed! The food was great, and the service was amazing. Someone was constantly ready to take our next AYCE order, and everything came out super fast and yummy! 
Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"This place has some amazing special rolls! It was honestly hard to choose, but everything we got was delicious. The staff and the restaurant were also very nice. I had the Korean BBQ roll and the baked green mussels, and my friend got the Mexican and the sunset rolls, which we'd both highly recommend."}
{"text":"Took my fiance here for his birthday lunch on a Sunday and we awkwardly walked in to a completely empty place. Don't get me wrong, I understand if places are not always packed but for literally an hour, we were the only ones inside. 

The customer service was awesome! Servers and sushi chefs were very accommodating and friendly. We had a server-in-training and she did well. I guess I'm giving 3 stars for the food itself. Nothing really wowed us except for the takoyaki, which we ordered several times.

With so many other sushi places in town, Gorilla Sushi just didn't hit the spot for us as much as we thought it would. It was a drive to come here too and I'm still debating if it's worth the drive to try again. I give them 3.5 stars. Maybe I'll come back.. maybe."}
{"text":"Seriously awesome!!!
Lance and I had an amazing dinner.
If you're looking for sushi near the strip, this is a great option. All you can eat includes sashimi, awesome apps and you can order half rolls. 
Hell yeah! Doesn't get better than this especially for an unassuming sushi place in Vegas. Go. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"We went for their grand opening special. The food was pretty good. The decoration is pretty bland.. just plain white walls lol. Their nigiri is really good ( maybe I just like garlic tuna anywhere I go) and there rolls were good ( from what we got lol) our first order took awhile to come out.. we went at 230 so it was starting to get busy I guess. They forgot a few rolls too. The one guy who helped serve us looked really awkward and didn't know any of the rolls he was giving us lol. But the food was really good otherwise. We made a 2nd order.m and they forgot to put it in or something and they retook our order 30min later. They brought it out quick lol. They're really good at refilling waters. I would go back to this place on a normal day, and I'd rate it the same or better than kaya haha. Besides the slow service lol"}
{"text":"The Best ! Nice Service Nice food ! Definitely gonna come back for more 
ohh again the food is amazingggg !"}
{"text":"The staff was so friendly and nice from beginning to end. I enjoyed my food so much I took some to go"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very nice Ambience our food came out fast and was carefully prepared I love the attitude of the waitress and it's all you can eat and it's really good food. We ordered a lot of different items and lived every morsel."}
{"text":"My friend Neli T loves to find great restaurants I haven't been to- it can be a challenge, but she's good at it. I'd driven by here several times and hadn't taken notice, but she invited me for an early dinner and we were both pretty impressed!

Location is clean, service from Austin was super friendly, but more importantly, the fish was hella fresh! The apps alone were worth it for me, with ample starter portions of one-limit items like sashimi salad rather than a couple of tablespoons in a tiny bowl. They also offer a couple of dinner-only sashimi options. The poke and salad were solid, but the seafood nachos and stuffed tomato (crab + avocado wrapped in tuna) were better. Their version of the classic riceless Rock N Roll was better than almost any other version I've tried. I did not partake but their dessert menu is larger than other AYCE options, which is a plus.

I will be coming back- apps and rolls are extensive, but they stand out with their fresh and thick cuts of fish."}
{"text":"Eveything is soooooo delicious! Like the clean and modern interior. Sevice is great as well."}
{"text":"This is a upcoming and modern place, it's actually not bad just not me.  The sushi was ok.  The cooked food was amazing.  Like ALL the appetizers, are awesome.  The environment is loud and service is ok.  But a reason I would come back to this place is the liquor and the cooked food."}
{"text":"Gorilla Sushi is still very new, so I understand that service may not be the best, but... woo. I came with two of my friends on the last day of their half off special and around 6pm, which unfortunately seemed to be the peak dinner rush, as we walked inside to a completely full line. One of the servers kept returning to the front to take names down for a waiting list, and it reached a point where some people were warned of a two hour wait and people waited outside to be called in. It took my friends and I roughly an hour to be seated, but even then, people who came after us were seated first and it seemed they had lost our name on the list (rip). When we mentioned it the server, he immediately seated us at an open table, where we sat for another 10 or 15 minutes before flagging down a different server for a few waters. She was very kind and immediately took our order, and my friends and I decided to order quite a lot because we expected them to be done slowly due to the high volume of people in the restaurant. 

We never had one specific server attending to us - we ending up interacting with each one, but usually to ask about the status of our other orders or to request more food, because our first server never came back until the end of our meal. They didn't seem to have assigned tables to specific servers, which may have furthered the confusion when trying to deliver orders. All of the servers were very nice and tried to make sure we were getting our orders, and one was sweating terribly from continuously running around, so I never felt irritated by the service even though it wasn't great. In the end, a decent chunk of our orders never arrived, we received a few wrong orders for different tables, and we never got any water refills (we never asked for any, but I assumed it would be done automatically?). They had run out of a few items by the time we were able to order - sea urchin, most of the mochi ice creams, and fried ice cream - but it wasn't a big deal to us. Ultimately, we spent 4 hours trying to get all of our orders, and our friend who mainly came for appetizers (not much of a sushi fan) left still a bit hungry because those came out the slowest. They also apparently closed early, as they were turning away customers while my table and 3/4ths of the restaurant was still eating around 9.

Side notes on a few memorable dishes:
- Takoyaki costs $4.50, comes with only TWO balls, and an incredibly small piece of octopus inside. Highway robbery if you're ordering that for a la carte. 
- The deep fried rolls have a very thin layer of batter on the outside, so if you love ordering it for the crunch that gives, you may be disappointed. 
- Bulgogi was super tender! I think this might be a Korean owned place, because there was \"spicy rice cake\" available, which I was fairly certain meant ddeokbokki. I haven't seen that at other sushi places before, but I also don't go out for sushi that often. 

Objectively, the conflicting service was two stars because of the multiple mix-ups and forgetting portions of each of our four orders. Interior decor and the fact that they're still new gets them another, because I didn't leave unhappy - they definitely need to improve their system though. The only items I loved were a few appetizers - namely the gyoza, shumai, and bulgogi - while everything else didn't quite stand out to me. Personally, I wouldn't come again just because there wasn't much I was crazy for from what I tried."}
{"text":"I've never had a better sushi experience. The staff were friendly the food was good, and I thought $20 is pretty good for the quality. The atmosphere is very nice, don't be fooled by the exterior."}
{"text":"So yummy and so fresh! Definently my new favorite late night spot! Great service also"}
{"text":"YUM! Gorilla is located is not located in the most visible place or the most fancy neighborhood but their interior is beautiful! Their sushi is fresh and yummy and owners are super cute! Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe. The ambiance is really nice and the staff is super cool. They continued to check on us and make sure that our experience was the best possible. Not to mention the prices are great for Vegas!!"}
{"text":"So I'm basing this review on a two day experience. 
Day 1: The grand opening we were there when they just opened. Our server was Steven and he seemed like a nice guy but often felt like our table was forgotten. We wanted appetizers first to start and we wanted the Hawaiian Kalbi, the pork belly, Gyoza, and bulgogi with rice. We never got the Kalbi or the pork belly because they were out of it and I'm wondering how because it's day one for them and we were literally one of the first customers. The Gyoza is good and the bulgogi is good. The sushi is decent but there was a weird taste to the crunch rolls. It got busier and what became frustrating is that my table was not getting the service we wanted. What started off as Steven as our server became every server taking our orders getting super confused and then the servers are confused because there's like 4 servers trying to help us and couldn't get our food on time. It was a really long wait to get food. We thought to ourselves not a very good first impression but we will come back when they fixed the kinks.

Day 2: we went yesterday Thursday a day before the final day for 50% off. Just me and my girlfriend this time and we had a table fit for two and we had a guy as our server I don't recall his name but I noticed had like 3 tables two of those tables was me and my girlfriend and another couple sitting next to us. The other table was like a party of 3. Our server was a bit better than last time because he initially took care of us but as the time progressed he forgot about us a lot and I watched him help the other tables back and forth and look at me but would forget to come back and so many times would forget our order and have to remind him three times. 

The positive that made me and my girlfriend experience there better was this girl who was working the tables at the other side of the restaurant she was in charge of the tables party of 10, 7, and like 8. She was hustling. Her name is Almira and she walked all the way over to us and asked if we were taken care of and we let her know that we thought but we've been waiting. She decided to help us out even though she had those tables with a huge party when she took our order she got our food in time, she refilled our waters on time which by the way I've been waiting to get refilled if it wasn't for Almira. We got more food and she made sure it got to us. We finally tried the Kalbi and pork belly and it's actually very good. She was a very hard worker and regardless how busy, her customer service stayed on point. We got our desserts on time. The original guy came back and asked if we're okay we told him yes because Almira has been helping us and we really want our check so we can leave now. He said ok be right back and he never came back and we waited 15 more minutes and Almira comes back and asks what we are still doing here because she thought after desserts we would have paid and leave and we told her the situation and she got us our check in not even a minute. So explain that please Gorilla. 

Me and my girlfriend were so pleased with how amazing Almiras customer service was and he ability to work under pressure and still be on top of her game. She deserves to be a lead and show everyone else how it's done. The full five stars is respectively for Almira. Thanks from me and my girlfriend for turning our frown upside down.

TIP: ask for Almira next time to serve you, try the Hawaiian Kalbi and pork belly and the sexy salmon nigiri."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! Just had some sushi DELIVERED to my hotel here in Vegas and omg...it was SOOOO DELICIOUS!!!! We loved everything and left no container with a drop of sauce or food! I highly recommend this place; it was incredible! Also the fact that they deliver is a HUGE plus!!! I definitely will be ordering again the next time we're in town! 
-Also just a side note the prices are so great!! We ordered four rolls, one soup, and an app all for barely $50 minus tip!! Thanks Gorilla Sushi for a scrumptious meal!!"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite place to eat sushi! Good quality sush and Claire is such an amazing server! I love this place!"}
{"text":"i took my wife here for a dinner and The service was Nice, The food was amazing ! she loved it and i did too ! Definitely Coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious!!! Servers was good, but good took a lil longer than what I wanted."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite AYCE sushi place! I live in the Southwest area of Las Vegas, but will always willingly make the drive to come here. Such a large variety of things to choose from and the inclusion of some Korean dishes also make this AYCE sushi unique from the rest! The customer service is outstanding - waiters constantly check on you and the friendliness of the staff (including chefs) is very welcoming! 10/10 recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We waited a bit outside because they were swamped for lunch. They were closed and reopened about 6:30, even though there were still guests inside. I don't think they realized unexpectedly closing and reopening for dinner with a huge group can cause more problems than keeping it open. The chefs get swamped and servers run around trying to get everything done at once for every seat that had just been sat.  They apologised for the delay (a lot). Luckily, the servers were nice and the food was pretty good. I was disappointed that the food ran a bit slow (like I said, reopening and letting everyone in at once is like opening a flood gate), our second set of orders finally came through about a little over an hour after sitting, (30 minutes after our last of the first order came in) and a lot of options started running out. Other than that, the food was really delicious and the place has a ton of potential. I had some water spilled all over me, which wasn't a big deal, since our server was probably a little nervous. I just wish the manager had re-seated, instead of me having to ask while I stood waiting for them to finish mopping around me. Also, like I said, a lot of apologies. They should take pride in their work, not feel sorry. It's okay. Spilled water is spilled water. Apologize once, re-seat your guests,  and thank them for understanding. Overall, it was a pretty great place. But I do have to say, the lobster roll was a bit of a turn off. Glad that was the last part of the meal!  Will definitely come back and change  the reviews. :)"}
{"text":"The sushi here is so good. As a sushi lover I would definitely recommend coming here and I would for sure come back. The selection of sushi is large and it just keeps coming. Plus the dessert was delicious."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh fish, FAST service, truly a wonderful spot, give these guys a chance, very very good food!"}
{"text":"Took husband and a few friends here for his birthday a couple of months ago and we really enjoyed ourselves. 

The service was really good and we were checked on frequently. The rolls were HUGE so come with an appetite! Some rolls took a lot longer to come out than others, but that was explained to us beforehand so we knew what to expect.

Only complaint is that the seating was uncomfortable and stiff. Would have been nice to have a cushion to sit on or something.

Overall, I really liked it and I would go back."}
{"text":"All you can eat is a sweet deal!  Fish is fresh.  Service is very fast and friendly. Came for lunch and sampled sushi, rolls and several of the chefs specials."}
{"text":"This place is amazing great service and food love it the all you can eat is a great deal and cheap beer"}
{"text":"Awesome place if you are looking to kill that sushi craving. The food is delicious and they have a great variety to choose from.
Nice atmosphere, nice and helpful staff, good for kids too. You have to check this place out."}
{"text":"Hmm.  Disappointed in the high reviews. Great and friendly service. Can't say anything was wrong with the meal, but I can't say that I had a favorite or would go back.  However, a friend has taken my hubby twice and they love it.  I think wanting there to be good sushi on the eastside May play a factor.  But everyone else seemed to agree it was \"good\"."}
{"text":"This is 2nd time for us & both of times we are satisfied customers!!
They are cerebrating 1st year anniversary so we got 1 house sake for $1  Can't beat that! Plus yelp check in customer 15% off"}
{"text":"After careful consideration decided to go here today for our traditional sushi Thanksgiving and it couldn't have been a better choice! The whole experience was exceptional and I look forward to returning many times. Bomb! Check em out!"}
{"text":"First time eating at Gorilla Sushi and for a Sushi lover, this establishment is legit! 
We came for lunch and we decided on the all you can eat special. The price for the all you can eat lunch menu is very reasonable. The price of it with the amount of selections on the menu that you may have, bottomless, is cheap. 
The two chefs who served us made our Sashimis and Sushi rolls fresh and with just the correct amount of rice under and inside of them.
Claire, our hostess was very attentive and kind. She gave us great service and for first timers, she was very attentive and patient. 
All the Sahimi and rolls that we ordered were all type A and delicious. Even the sauces that they drizzled our food with were yummy and refreshing. Who says that about sushi? Refreshing! 
This place, I recommend to everyone, locals and out of towners alike. I will definitely bring my family from San Diego on their next soon visit as they too, are sushi lovers! See you soon Gorilla Sushi!"}
{"text":"Took 35 minutes to make 3 rolls with 5 people at this place. Crappy sushi at best. Waist of time and money. I ordered my meal for take out and watched them feed people that came after me and other deliveries as I watched them waist my time. Once they got my money... game was over. Good luck!!!"}
{"text":"This place was a great deal. The service wasnt great but to be fair we were a party of 10 and only one server"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Quality of food is excellent. Fresh, safe, appealing. We went for the all you can eat.  

Food quality: 

Affogato was a dessert new to me - espresso shot in vanilla ice cream. 

Chicken teriyaki was healthy, without artificial stuff which is great!!  Edamame beans with garlic is unique - can't find that elsewhere.

Atmosphere: 

Trendy, a little loud with some guests there cleArly for a party. Probably usually ok otherwise.

Staff:

Servers were busy but very attentive, so great staff.

Overall, Great sushi place - definitely worthy plvisit again."}
{"text":"I'd say more like 3.5 stars. I had high hopes for this place.. Customer service is excellent when my wife and I went for the first time.. Ambiance is good (though location could be better). Now the food.. mostly fresh but BLAND. Oddly-shaped nigiris have way too little rice. I had salmon and yellowtail nigiris = bland. I liked the charred eel nigiri but it was overcooked = dry. Gorilla special handroll was bland. Their uni nigiri was the worst I've had by far. Not fresh and very fishy.... and BLAND! I would say this place is more of a korean-japanese fusion. Their Korean dishes are way tastier than their Japanese food offerings. The sushi chefs were all Koreans (figured). Don't be fooled by the pictures posted in Yelp. Food will come to you in a lot smaller fashion.

Our experience wasn't really bad. Just very very average. Will I go back?Probably not. 

Dinner AYCE of $25.95 is standard but you're better off with Sakana (best AYCE sushi by far in my book) or Yama Sushi (the only place with $23.95 AYCE dinner price)."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi for a great price. The all you can eat is fantastic and the service is attentive and considerate. The restaurant is clean and has a nice atmosphere. I will definitely be back and bring friends with me!"}
{"text":"I expected a pretty whatever experience but it honestly was quite the opposite. The staff is very kind and well mannered. The food actually went beyond my expectations. Today was the grand opening so everything was fresh. Plus it was half off today. I think it's half off AYCE for the rest of the week so maybe stop by."}
{"text":"Their sushi chiefs are master, I have never try a great Japanese sushi like this and it's really close to the Unlv campus. Will go there again sometime."}
{"text":"What a score! I use Yelp frequently for places to eat. I am usually not disappointed. Once again, a hit! First of all, it was great to get off the Vegas Strip and eat someplace not so glorified, over priced and yuck. Neighborhood wasn't the greatest but parking was close. Service was exceptional from \"Brian\". He was very welcoming and knew his job well. He recommended and was available for questions. Tempura was out fast and was nice. We have an allergy to sesame seeds and they were more than happy to accommodate. The rolls were awesome! I had a McCarran Airport and the wife had a Megabucks. They were so good, we went back for a Hello Monkey to finish us off. This was a weird combo but we were down to try it! (Deep fried banana with soft shell crab)  it was surprisingly amazing and paired together well! Definitely will be back here every time we visit Vegas. They've only been open a year but this place will have a hard time keeping empty seats before too long. Do it! You'll be satisfied!"}
{"text":"If you love sushi , you will love this place 
Excellent service , the quality of the sushi is fresh and superb 
There is all you can eat sushi for20 dollars .... DELICIOUS ! Portions are generous!!!
Would have posted pics if I hadn t already eaten everything!!!!
totally worth getting an Uber ride ,and getting  away from the Strip"}
{"text":"Bomb sushi in Las Vegas. Ordered multiple rolls, udon, and was able to get free sake as part of the yelp promotion. The meal was actually filling, reasonably priced for sushi, and delicious. Can't recall everything I ordered, but the Spider Roll was flavorful and had great texture/freshness. Rainbow roll and Hollywood Roll were both top notch. The udon was not the most flavorful, but the portion size was good and we purposefully wanted something that was more light tasting. Didn't have any complaints about the service or atmosphere, and would go again in a heartbeat if I lived in the city! I liked that there was a ton of variety in the menu. Would love to try more things here."}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi in Vegas. Service was flawless food was fresh & the options were endless."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good. Fresh sushi, quick service and clean restaurant. It's also not outrageous in pricing which is nice. Definitely recommend the Mexican roll"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with my co-worker and arrived 4 minutes before they started serving lunch and was almost turned around. We said can we just wait and he said ok. The AYCE is $20.95 but not worth it as the server only comes by like twice unless you call him. Service for food is extremely slow which if you only have an hour it only allows you to order twice. Food is bland and nothing special or memorable. Won't be back."}
{"text":"First time here and came in a big group of friends and we were seated immediately. The interior and decor gave off the hot and juicy vibe with the bench seats which was nice and relaxing. The waiter however wasn't as pleasant as the food, he was kind of pissy while taking our order. He also didn't allow me to put my take out order until HE was ready to take it at the end of our meal, which was really annoying."}
{"text":"Not a fan of gorilla sushi. The use dark meat chicken which has a chew texture. Now i did get a roll (Baked Gorilla Roll) and that was very good but the fried rice and chicken platter was not up to par."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal,drinks is cheap and the servers are accommodating in short feel at home."}
{"text":"Super clean fresh modern , great service and atmosphere! Come here before it gets too popular! Great deals on sushi and the cutest ceramics for the sake and tea."}
{"text":"Really good, affordable sushi. Right by Pinball Hall Of Fame, so it was an easy choice for post pinball munchies."}
{"text":"Great accommodations with rolls. I really enjoyed my screaming O roll, it's one of my favorites and it was the perfect appetizer size!"}
{"text":"by far the best sushi bar in Las Vegas!!!
this is the only sushi bar you should go when youre visiting the Sin City
their food so fresh and tasteful that I dont want to go to any other sushi place anymore."}
{"text":"Incredible.  Claire. Food was amazing and customer service was better. Worth the trip off the strip. What I wouldn't do to have an AYCE sushi restaurant of this quality back home!"}
{"text":"This place was suggested by my son and one day we tried it out.  Now we are hooked!!  When we want sushi fix we always know where to go.  
Not just food are great but all the staff are awesome!!"}
{"text":"Incrível , gostei muito de tudo , atendimento , cardápio bem variado ,tem rodízio , os preços também são bons e o principal a comida rs é muitoooooo boa.
Super recomendo !
Perfect !!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in Vegas!  All of their food is very high quality.  I recommend doing the AYCE dinner because you can get Uni and salmon collar.  The dinner menu is only $5 more but it is worth it."}
{"text":"I come here semi often after work. There is never wait, I am always greeted immediately at get top notch service. Everyone is extremely kind & accommodating. The menu has a few vegan options and everything I've had is amazing. Keep it up guys"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Food is delicious. It is a good place to come with friends. I recommend their dessert. That is really nice."}
{"text":"Here for CES and we found this place. Friendly and great service from Alex and Joe.  I love my ass, Mexican, Crispy rice on spicy tuna, Salmon Ass and many more were all absolutely DELICIOUS! A must try. We will certainly spread the word and be back next year."}
{"text":"Tonight we decided to try a New sushi place with my gf and I. We love AYCE sushi. As we approached the door we were welcomed in by having someone open the door for us. Place was very clean and welcoming. Our waiter Jay was very attentive and very friendly! My favorites out of the menu were Bulgogi and rice as an appetizer baked salmon roll and for dessert the strawberry shave ice! Defiantly will come back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Whoa oh oh oh. Sally, whew. That girl. Sally \"heart\" damn yelp don't let us post emojis, but that's what her name tag said, was awesome 5 stars for sure! Just saying. She took care of us from start to finish, as soon as we walked through the door. She was very friendly and did her job very well. I'd be back for sure. Oh I was suppose to review the Gorilla Sushi. Ok fine. 

Let's start again. I like Gorilla Sushi. The one thing really going for them is the quality of their seafood. Its excellent. The nigiris have the perfect fish to rice ratio, huge nice cuts of fish and less rice. The garlic tuna, salmon, and hamachi were my favs and would recommend. I believe they offer only an order of sashimi for their AYCE and its only for dinner. I liked the salmon skin salad, screaming orgasm, and white orgasm were all tasty just don't wear a white shirt. They also have a lots of appetizers not just sushi like kalbi, bulgogi, soups, spicy fried chicken. For desserts they're only one order person but they have a good selection like the green tea cheese cake, mochi ice, snowflake which is shaved ice with condensed milk and some flavors chocolate and red bean, affogato, and a few more. The rolls were good couldn't remember them as I ate a lot of different ones. You can order half rolls for a lot of them.

They did forget to make a few items that may or may not have been ordered but no biggy everyone has that problem keeping up with my appetite. Just placed another order then all good. I'd definitely be back though."}
{"text":"It is a really nice sushi place to dine out, the location is little far away from the strip, but worth to try"}
{"text":"I wish they would get red bean mochi but their green tea and strawberry was good! I had the tastes like your ex girlfriend roll and it was so incredibly filling and luckily didn't taste like anyone's ex... 

Super quick and friendly service, very salted edamame, yummy miso soup and a great Yelp discount!!"}
{"text":"Grand opening today!  Was great. Service was actually very professional and sushi was great! I'm sure it'll only get better from there! 
Plus after you eat you can just head right next door and chill/play some pool or computer games right after,from their other business gorilla cafe!"}
{"text":"We have learned that finding places to eat off strip are a good idea. This is place is great. The quality of fish is quite good. The service is excellent. We'll definitely be going back upon our return to Vegas..."}
{"text":"Started with the white orgasm and three sashimi. I must say that the fish is very fresh and is perfectly seasoned. I will be coming back for their wide variety of appetizers! YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I was really excited to come to this place due to the half off promotion they were having for their opening week. 

My group arrived at 5pm expecting some kind of wait only to be greeted with a sign that said \"reopening at 630pm\" which forced us to find something else to do for another hour and a half which we didn't mind because we understood that the might have needed some time to replenish for the next crowd.

My group of 8 were the first to be seated at 630pm, all starving and ready to eat AYCE sushi. The waitress immediately served us drinks and grabbed our first order. Seemed like a good start!
 
The first round came out after 30 mins consisting of 3 rolls and about 15 orders of appetizers. 10 mins after demolishing that, we ordered again, then another 42 mins for the second order. So far still good considering how many people were there. 

AND THEN ... close to an hour later, the waitress comes back and says that our third and fourth orders were coming. 20 mins after that, still nothing. I think they completely forgot about our orders! To my friends annoyance,  he asked her again if the food was even coming and when she came back after checking on it and said \"almost\". He just asked for the check so my group can leave. The only time someone would come to our table was to give us more water and more napkins (which we didn't need because we weren't eating anything). 

We were in there a total of 3+ hours and I don't think I even ate a whole roll of sushi because we were all sharing the ones that came to our table. Despite their cheap prices, they were clearly understaffed for this promotion and their service was slow. It almost seemed like they didn't expect to be busy. I definitely would have been more understanding if the staff were ALL busy but I saw some hanging around this podium and just waiting for people to make eye contact with them. No sense of urgency for a place that was so busy. 

As for the food, order the Starbux roll. That was the only one I liked because that was the only one I got to taste."}
{"text":"Absolutely my go to AYCE sushi place! I purely judge restruants by their food, service, and ambience. My friends and I were playing pool at the Gorilla Cafe and we were told that a new sushi place just opened up a month ago. So  I definitely had to try it out because I eat sushi often and it was also my friends first time so I had to be their \"Sushi Guide.\" Let me tell you.. The sushi was AMAZING. Not very heavy on the sauce, which I like, and the common special rolls like the Dragon, Caterpillar, and the Lisa Lisa was really on top of its game compared to some other places. My friends said it was a great first experience eating sushi and we were glad it had to be that place. Expect us every other week to eat there and play pool at the cafe. 

I recommend Edamame and Gyoza to get started. The rolls I definitely recommend are the Philadelphia, Lisa Lisa, Caterpillar, Dragon, Mexican Fiesta, and nigiri would hands down be the Paprika Salmon."}
{"text":"I give this place a solid 3.5 stars. I've eaten at plenty of AYCE sushi places and this one was just okay for me. The inside was very stylish and clean. Their color scheme was black and light colored wood. There was plenty of seating, mostly booths which I liked and a nice little bar you can sit at. Service was great! Everything came out to us pretty fast and we were getting checked up on every now and then. They were not hoovering over us and they weren't ignoring us either. 

The sushi was good. We like getting a lot of the cooked rolls to be honest, they were good rolls, but they were somewhat drenched in the eel sauce. Don't get me wrong, eel sauce is good.. but I don't like my rolls swimming in it :( The appetizer selection was huge, I liked the different variations of cucumber salads they had. I also enjoy having a sushi menu that has symbols for spicy sushi rolls and symbols for raw sushi. It makes picking out food so much easier! I might be back here again, depending if I am around that side of town! This place is worth trying out though! :)"}
{"text":"This place is new and very clean. I went there with my classmates for all you can eat. The sushi has great flavors and the sashimi was fresh and tasty. They also gave us free desserts. Definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"The sushi was good, but the wait was terrible! After we took our orders, it took long to have our sushi. Also, the waiter gave out our orders one by one, not all together. (Don't order the fried rice) They tend to forget our orders. One of my cousins asked to get water, it never came until she asked the third time. And we repeatedly asked when our order would come. They have very slow service."}
{"text":"Gave this place another try! Omg amazing!! Love their selection rolls came out better quality. Service was amazing came late night. One of the best sushi places now. Must try. Good drink specials."}
{"text":"First time. Wide variety of rolls. 3 types of sashimi. We'll be back. Attentive service."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. Great hours. Perfect price for AYCE. Friendly service. Excellent selection. Streaming StarCraft? Woah. I'm definitely coming back here next time I'm in Vegas!

Update: I did! Just as good as I remembered it, plus they treated us to the best fatty tuna I've had this side of the Pacific."}
{"text":"The sushi is great quality and the management was welcoming. The environment was family friendly, and the decor was appealing. I had a great experience."}
{"text":"We saw this sushi restaurant while driving on Tropicana and decided to try it. We were greeted as we entered and seated fairly quickly. 
My husband and I did the AYCE dinner. Their menu is easy to read and they had lots of choices for their AYCE food. Their wait staff are really nice & very hospitable. We got our orders in a timely manner and everything came out delicious. My husband especially loved that they do half rolls. We'll definitely be back again to have sushi here. And we even got a punch card, our 11th AYCE lunch/dinner is free!"}
{"text":"It's okay...

I had high hopes for this place due to all of the high ratings it's gotten but sadly, I wasn't convinced

Service was great. Both the server and owner (I'm assuming she's the owner since she was dressed in casual clothes) were very attentive.

The sushi chefs were great. One of them was chugging a Rockstar in between making sushi rolls. I thought that was pretty badass lol

The rolls were good. Quality of the fish was great. But unfortunately, I wasn't blown away by any of them."}
{"text":"For some weird reason I've been avoiding this place and was very skeptical. Finally decided to give it a shot and now it's my favorite sushi joint hands down. FISH WAS SUPER FRESH AND ICE COLD. It seriously made me realize how low quality my former go to places are. Seriously. The uni was the best I've had in a very long time and most definitely best uni in a ayce spot. All rolls were pretty diverse and weren't basically the same thing. I was overall very impressed. Also the customer service was awesome, super friendly and didn't have that fake vibe, actually seemed like some cool people."}
{"text":"Loved this place but today sucked. Amy is the best but the waitress today was horrible. I ordered 3 rolls and only got 1 roll been sitting here for an hour. Will not return."}
{"text":"We love our sushi in this place with some of the best we've had in a long time. Though the place is not fancy the sushi was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Discovered this place when we happened to be near the area and wanted to eat some sushi. 

My family loves sushi and we have our usual go to places that we have been loyal to for years.

The shopping complex is not the most enticing at night and really has no appeal during the day. We live quite a distance from this place but this has been our favorite spot recently. 

What's appealing is they have different dishes compared to most places. It might be the Korean-Japanese fusion which they found a nice balance on most of their specialties.

Service has always been reliable as well.

We love this place that Im about to walk in this place right now!"}
{"text":"We were craving sushi late one night and came across this place... it did not disappoint! Love that they are open late! Great customer service... everyone always has a smile on their face!! They offer an AYCE punch card to keep you coming back!!!"}
{"text":"For a sushi spot that isn't in the best area, it's such a good spot. I'm a big fan of the baked sushi and this place does it right. Great place for AYCE with a cool atmosphere and TVs all around if you want to watch stuff while eating. Almost always on sports so I certainly do not complain 
Great place for lunch any day of the week"}
{"text":"We came here after a show...we aren't used to how they do things here, slightly different from Cali.  They make you order individually even for AYCE.  At first we were confused and hungry. Food came out and it was sooooooooo good! They have different unusual things, like the fiesta has mango, gorilla dream has fried banana, salmon pizza, carpaccichio, that were DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to go here because it was open til 11:30 after a paint party. The scenery was nice, cool, and relaxing. The music was great. We did the ayce  $25, there were a lot of options.  My faves were boom boom,  grand canyon,  and the calamari. Our waitress was Sarah she was super cool and very helpful. I'll definitely be back the food was great!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite sushi restaurant in the area. The aesthetic of the restaurant is very good, clean and minimal with a comfortable vibe.  We ordered the Gorilla boat, which was a mix of rolls and nigiri.  Everything was exceptionally fresh, and the presentation was marvelous.  The service was quite good, fast and friendly.  I will be back again."}
{"text":"Gorilla Sushi has a very good atmosphere. The food was great with a variation of sushi options from raw to cooked. The service they provided was excellent the servers helped recommend several cooked rolls. I will definitely return for the AYCE!!"}
{"text":"I have SO much to review and, unfortunately, it's not very pleasant. Needless to say, we all know that this place had its grand opening only a couple days ago and are offering half off AYCE sushi. I thought I'd wait until the hype had died down, but was given a chance to come tonight. A couple friends and I came here tonight (Tuesday night) a little before 7pm, apparently right after a party of 25 came in.

Entrance : you enter through unmarked regular doors and come upon a wall straight in front of you. There, you wait for someone to seat you when they see you(Fortunately for us, my friend was seated and we didn't have to wait there, but we saw many people standing awkwardly for a while until someone approached them). 

Decor: white walls over, chic wood looking benches/seats, sushi bar to the left, and a colored and lit DJ/Bar looking area to the back. Very clean 

Service: Servers are super nice. Devi was amazing, and always checked up on us, as well as tried to get our orders going along. However the service time was Ridiculously long. We waited an hour after we ordered, to get our food from the bar. (we were able to snack on \"appetizers\" that were able to be made in the back, such as edamame). They spent all of their time waiting on the group of 25, that we could see that our table as well as 5 others around us weren't being served anything. The 3 sushi chefs (found out that one had called out) were filling orders only for that table, and no other tables were served. When they were finally serving good to other tables, lots of rolls were being run to the wrong tables. However, you could tell everyone on staff plus the man who we believe may have been the owner or MOD at the time was frantically trying to figure it out. Effort was great, execution was not. Definitely needed to fix their system. 

Food: after waiting an hour (1 hr and 4 min actually) for our first roll from the actual bar, it was just subpar. You could tell at this point that they just needed to get orders out. It was made a bit sloppier, with a tad too much sauce on a couple of the rolls, but the quality of some of the fish was actually pretty good. (Fatty, large pieces of salmon nigiri was great). Unfortunately we didn't get to try all the rolls we ordered because they missed about 3 rolls. (1 order would be missing out of 4 that we would ask for per ticket). 
**if you do go in the future, order the dessert type roll. (gorilla roll?) It has mango, banana, and strawberry and was pretty good. Even decided to order vanilla ice cream with it. 

Honestly, I believe this has largely to do with them being open for such a short amount of time and most likely not being prepared for large crowds/large parties. We left 2.5 hours later at 9:30, not full and not very satisfied. We even felt bad for the table that came in not too long after us that had barely gotten any food. If it wasn't for how wonderful and sympathetic our server was as well as the the decor, this place would have 1 star. 

My suggestion is to stay away from this place until at least a couple weeks after the grand opening and come during slower hours. :) the half off was not worth it."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was pretty bad. Our party informed our server before we started placing our orders that we'd like separate checks. The server agreed and said he'd take care of that at the end of our meal. Food came out quickly and everyone was happy. I had to leave the party early so I asked the server to please charge me for my AYCE. HE CHARGED ME FOR THE ENTIRE GROUP'S MEAL! It came out to be about $300. I am the type of person that doesn't like to complain and usually just brush stuff off. But I did feel the need to say something since we did tell him from the start we'd like separate checks & he seemed perfectly fine with it. When I did inform him, he became irritated, gave me a horrible attitude and basically accused me & said it was my fault. They did reverse the charge & apologized in the end. I gave it 2-stars because the food was pretty good & I did enjoy the place before the server had an attitude."}
{"text":"My new favorite all you can eat sushi restaurant. The staff was very welcoming and the chef made me a special sushi roll and it was amazing. Don't know what's the name of it but it's taste great and the presentation was fabulous! I will go back again for sure"}
{"text":"The sushi was good, but are a bit loaded with rice. Our server Jay is very quick on attending to our needs. He's friendly and give great recommendations. The place was not busy so we got out food quick and got full fast lol. The dessert are delicious, if you like shrimp. Try their amaebi roll it is fresh uncooked shrimp."}
{"text":"Pretty good and pretty fresh than most AYCE sushi in Vegas. 
Nearby the airport in a neighborhood you wouldn't expect to have fresh Sashimi (ahi and hamachi).
They stay open late until 12am. We went here around 9pm on a Thursday and there was a lot of seats available.
Service was good, they were quick and food also came out quickly.
I enjoyed the Hamachi Yuzu, Poke, Salmon Skin Salad, Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna and Volcano Roll. I liked the fried ice cream's batter but the ice cream melted right away."}
{"text":"Excellent decor delicious food and wonderful service my server Nick.  Will be returning too try more more items from the menu."}
{"text":"Taste like nothing I've ever tasted before. Ill come back here for sure. Loved the deep fried Philadelphia roll. And the teriyaki is awesome, doesn't matter what kind, they all good"}
{"text":"I came here during grand opening week. It was $26 overall for my boyfriend and I's dinner. Despite the good price, the sushi itself isn't worth coming back for. It's doesn't have the best flavor or quality. They definitely need way more help here. 3 sushi chefs and barely any waiters to provide much aid in a fairly large sushi restaurant. The service was very nice, but at one point we were waiting for 30+ minutes for our order. We ended up just asking for the check and leaving. They should have been better prepared for this grand opening!!! Turned people away saying they couldn't handle anymore people at just 8pm when they close at 10:30!"}
{"text":"The best sushi! Excellent service every time we come...this may be the best sushi spot in Las Vegas! You won't be disappointed! Try the volcano it's awesome and the calamari is really fresh and fried just the right way! Also the desserts are really wonderful and unique!"}
{"text":"Pretty sad to pay the amount they charge here and get PACKETS of soy sauce and PACKETS of ginger. For a sushi spot, I will def not order from here again. Delivery was on time and order was correct. Sushi quality was alright. Second time ordering from here and just can get into it. I don't think I've ever ordered sushi and had squeezable ginger."}
{"text":"Wanted to have some sushi buffet, and after looking at a lot of menus from other places, I decided on this one. We came with a party of 6, so we wanted variety for everybody's taste. 

There are many special items that can only be ordered once, but they're pretty good portions. The uni came with 2 pieces per order. Nice and creamy. The shrimp came with 2 pieces, the fried head was sooo fresh and good. The sushi was perfect one bite. 

We tried many different rolls, they were all created with heart. The only downside is the rolls takes a long time to come. The sushi in general took a long time. They need more sushi chefs. We got most of our order, and was told we still have like 6 rolls left. Kinda sucks because you want to eat the roll when you're most hungry to enjoy the taste. 

The sashimi allowed per person was great, I couldn't find another place that offered sashimi except here. They were cut really thinly. And we asked for a couple with no sauce to taste the freshness. It was great! 

The rock and roll was good, rice less and refreshing. 
Sashimi nachos was good, crispy with nice cold sashimi and sauce. 

Was really full near the end but still got some ice cream and mochi in the tummy.

The party was really impressed since this is their first Japanese buffet in Las Vegas.
The server was nice and friendly. Had to keep coming around so we could order again. Waters were topped up."}
{"text":"Just fair.....good price on AYCE, decent service, good selection of rolls and nigiri. Chef served aged salmon this last visit. Tuna texture was that of thawed. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi in Vegas, better than most AYCE in Los Angeles if I may say so myself.

Be sure to do AYCE here, at $25.95(Dinner), it's a steal. 1 hour limit is enough as the food came quickly.

Applause to the staff who attentively served us and the chefs that prepared our delicious food.

Best AYCE value I have ever had, I've tried many others.

Important note: No idea why gorrilla ass roll was highly praised by yelpers, it was not to our liking. Go for the raw dishes, and if you want a refreshing roll, my money is on the \"Rock N Roll\"

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Placed an order via Grubhub and it was projected at an hour. My driver sat around for an HOUR after the pickup time while I called the manager to have him tell me that they don't hand over deliveries to anyone but their driver and it would be ready in 10 minutes but they didn't have a driver (they spoke to my delivery guy who was IN THE FRONT FOR AN HOUR ALREADY READY TO GO) 

Called grubhub and they called them to find out what was going on. 10 minutes it will be ready. 

2 hours into this wonderful venture I call Grubhub after confirming their driver was still there. Grubhub calls them and cancels the order because they don't have any drivers. EVEN THOUGH GRUBHUB HAS BEEN SITTING THERE FOR 1.5 hours waiting for a 5 ITEM ORDER. 

WELP they must have gotten a transcript because after they cancelled my order they called Grubhub back to find out if I wanted my order... they could get it to me ASAP 

I told them to let the manager know he could go ---- himself. 

Probably good food. Horrible management with a complete lack of common sense."}
{"text":"Yummy Sushi that is very delicious. Lots of creative rolls. Attentive service. Sashimi included in AYCE and have a variety of desserts. Definitely will be coming back again. Great beer and sake specials."}
{"text":"Always used to drive by and wonder how good it was? No more wondering my husband and I came for dinner and was pleasantly surprised......defianetly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This Sushi is good. ALL U CAN EAT makes me so full. The restaurant is close to UNLV so It is very convenient for students to eat here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We love going to Tomo but this place is open later and has a bunch more different appetizers. It's not as busy as Tomo or Yama or anything in the area so that's great. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. Their tuna sashimi and planet Hollywood is good and their late night foods are also good too! I come here almost everyday for the spicy rice cake skewers."}
{"text":"There was a piece of plastic in my Teriyaki bowl and we never got our edamame and the server was not good at all; her name happens to be same as mine.  The Vegas roll was good and huge but I would never go to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"You can tell that they still have a few kinks to work out of the business but all in all it was a great food and great service. 

If you get a chance definitely try the tuna poke it's much more flavorful than any other poke I have tried."}
{"text":"Came by for lunch about 15 mins after they opened.  Ordered nigiri sushi, a roll, and some appetizers (sashimi salad, tempura, kalbi, etc).  The foods of particular note were: the kalbi (which I requested to cook longer than normal to make the fat crispy), unagi nigiri (which I again requested for them to broil longer than normal to make the edges crispy), uni, and sweet shrimp.  Staff was really friendly and made the dining experience memorable.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Waited until my second time to review. 1st time was ok. Figured it must be an off day because how does this spot earn 4.5 stars right? 

Today was like wtf? Got sat in a reasonable time. After that was all down hill. Had a certain amount of time to eat before a job across the street at Pinball HOF. Not usually on this side of town other than that. Took what seemed a lifetime just  to order. Literally flagging down anyone who would look our way. Finally decided to get it togo. Cash in book ready to pay for another 6 minutes. Decided to walk to the register to pay. No smiles nor thank yous. Whatevs. Don't mind long waits but I cannot stand for businesses with no passion. The only two things I ordered (two rolls) were missing from my togo. Not enough energy to go back for a refund. And cannot imagine ever going back to figure it out. Don't wish anything bad for local businesses but cannot see this spot lasting the long haul. Sad. Very sad."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great prices, servers are super nice... And the management really seems to care. Things may be a little hectic right now but i think it can only get better!"}
{"text":"One of the better sushi places I've been. Staff is excellent, and quality is great. I enjoyed the appetizers a lot, which is my biggest concern when going to a sushi ayce as it gets tiring eating sushi after sushi and need something to eat in between.

Would come here again!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and average at best. I got the bulgogi the first time and I didn't like it at all. It was dry and had no flavor. I was actually suprised at this dish because I usually enjoy it but I've never gotten it from a Japanese restaurant. The second time I got the crunch rolls, teriyaki chicken, and green tea ice cream. I thought the rolls were average and the teriyaki chicken not so good. The teriyaki didn't have enough sauce and was bland. I enjoyed the green tea ice cream but I had to go back for it because the server forgot to charge me for it and just omitted it from my order. I didn't know that I didn't pay because the bill was high enough! If you do decide to try it make sure you have all of your items before leaving since other reviewers have had a similar experience. 

Unfortunately I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Went here on a field trip for school, great sushi, lots of options. Liked it a lot."}
{"text":"This place is awesome ! Great vibes , clean and professional . I will come back again when I'm in town :)  came all the way from California."}
{"text":"Exceptional services and this Resturant was very welcoming. Ninja like skills (water was always full, plates cleared right away.)"}
{"text":"The best all you can eat sushi in Las Vegas. Reasonable price and great service. Will recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"SERVICE: Sally was our server. She was great. She was very attentive and very patient with us. My friends and I are piggies, so we kept on ordering a ton of food. Food also came out pretty quickly. Overall, service was quite excellent. 

FOOD: I've had AYCE sushi all over the valley. Woth that being said, this is one of the best places I've ever eaten at. Where do I start?? 

Appetizers - we ordered shumai (steamed), fried soft shell crab, corn cheese, baked mussels, takoyaki, shrimp tempura, bulgogu, gorilla hot dog, spicy fried chicken, and pork belly. All of our appetizers tasted very good, except the bulgogi was a bit on the tough side. 

Sushi - we had the following nigiri: garlic tuna, yuzu yellowtail, smelt roe, flying fish roe, and sexy salmon. On to the rolls: spicy yellowtail roll, gorilla dream, gorilla special handroll, hawaiian roll, lobster roll, mexican Fiesta roll, and Jay roll.

The fish to rice ratio on the nigiri was phenomenal. You get a huge piece of fish and a small ball of rice. The garlic tuna and yuzu yellowtail was out of bounds good!! All of the rolls tasted good as well, but the nigiri were the star of the show!! 

Dessert - green tea cheese cake and a snowflake. Green tea cheesecake was so good!! 

I will definitely be back and highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"We keep coming back, so they must be doing something right- because I'm a sushi snob! Sexy Girl and Monster are 2 of our favorite rolls, but lots still to try. Not a great neighborhood, but worth the trip."}
{"text":"We tried AYCE for $25.95. They offered 15% discount with Yelp check in even with AYCE.  :O   They also had $1 hot sake Mon-Thu until 11.30.17.  Hope they continue the special.  4 hot sake, 2 AYCE with the 15% discount, our bill was only $51.45.  

Pro:  Everything we had were very good & fresh. 2 of us ate enough for 10 people. Lol.  Wanted to try everything!  They offer traditional sushi & many Korean dishes. Dish such as Bossam is not offered at other AYCE. 
Menu is extensive & all very good.  

Con:  The sauces that came with shrimp tempura & salmon Kama (collar) didn't taste like the sauces I had in japan.

Over all, my experience was amazing. Sauce was not large enough factor for me the take away a star as the food quality was so good. And so was the service."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place twice before composing a review. I just didn't want to profess this and regret it later but I dont see that happening...I love this place! We did the AYCE lunch and it was worth every penny.  I ordered 3 different rolls.  Hubby ordered 4. It was a sushi feast! Their baked rolls are so tasty. So many different rolls to indulge in. Option to do half rolls if the roll is 8pcs.  Friendly service. I'm ready for my next visit!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Good food, good vibes. I would definitely come here again. Love the spicy yellowtail rolls and salmon skin salad."}
{"text":"First time here come at 10pm on Saturday wasn't packed at all nice atmosphere good music......started with garlic edamame, shrimp tempura, baked green mussel and dynamite all very good then we started on the rolls we tried alot them but my favorite was Just for the Halibut....only thing wasn't to happy about was the sell drinks like soda out of a can and charge 1.99 for one can no refills need to invest in a soda machine."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason this place has more than 3 stars at best is because they offer a free beer/sake/soda for proof of a 5 star review. 

We walked in and were the only guests inside (bad sign #1) the smell that hit your face was not pleasant nor appetizing (#2) and then our seat at the bar had a washed but still dirty dish and a hair drawn across the napkin (#3). We could've have just left then but we felt obligated and stuck so we ordered anyway. No teasers (edamame or cucumber salad) and no offer of ginger/wasabi (#4) Rolls were OKAY. Sushi chef was awkward but really nice and owner was a helicopter in a creepy way. We left with our fingers crossed to not have food poisoning. We were just fine but that's not really what you want to have to be hoping for after 3 rolls and a $40 bill. Not good enough to return."}
{"text":"** EDIT: they made a BUNCH of their AYCE apps \"one per customer\" and got rid of some of their best ones... totally lame... reasoning or not, it's going to dissuade me from coming here as often.** I love this place for it's diverse menu... we sometimes have a group of friends wanting to grab dinner and not everyone likes raw fish. The appetizer menu is extensive and I haven't ordered anything bad. As far as sushi goes: Great list of rolls, fresh nigiri, and I am addicted to the stuffed tomato! It's delicious! Service is good, atmosphere is good... all around great AYCE sushi place!"}
{"text":"I normally don't provide reviews, whether I'm lazy or indifferent but WOW! Gorilla Sushi has quality sushi at the lowest cost you can imagine. The food is great, I'm an out of towner and this is my 2nd night in a row. $19.95 all you can eat promotion (usually $24.95)."}
{"text":"The food was great and the customer service was 6/5 the staff was very very friendly and helpful. The place was clean and all the food arrived in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Probably top worst sushi buffet I've ever been to. The sushi was drenched in sauces and sodium. We couldn't even finish the two rolls we ordered because of how much mayo and sodium it had. The \"poke salad \" was so salty we couldn't finish that either. Service was extremely slow too which makes the one hour time limit extremely slow. Had to flag down the server for our check even. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic quality and variety and freshness.  Felt like being back in Japan.  Really impressed with the uniqueness of some of the recipes.  So many rolls you will have to come back again and again to try them all.  Tourist or local you need to come check this place out.  My new #1 fav sushi spot in vegas"}
{"text":"The sushi is just OK, we are from Los Angels and this would be considered low end sushi, but on the plus side the service was great."}
{"text":"Will reference the time I went for next time. Sushi and service were great, I've only been eating sushi for few months and this is only the third place I've tried but way better than my second experience, will be coming again the service was so friendly the waiter(not sure that's what you'd call em when it's sushi) was pretty cool even talked a bit about our watches while we were at it"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and great sushi. One of the very few places in town where there is a sashimi on the all you can eat menu. Great selection of Japanese and Korean appetizers from the kitchen. Try the Korean fried chicken."}
{"text":"Pros: 
I love how the whole menu was \"all you can eat\". And everything was reasonably priced and perfectly portioned for very tasteful sushi. I would definitely eat here again and again. 
Cons: 
YOU ONLY HAVE 1 HOUR TIME LIMIT FOR ALL YOU CAN EAT (?_´)?"}
{"text":"I liked the all you can eat option and they have a beer and saki special. Sushi was fresh. There seemed to be a lot of tempura type rolls on the menu which I am not a big fan of fried foods.  There was enough of a selection that I did not go hungry"}
{"text":"Gorilla Sushi is new and really good. Their sushi is really good and you can tell that their ingredients are fresh. They have beautiful decor and the people are friendly. The sushi rolls are different but very good! The location of Gorilla Sushi is in the middle of town and a good place to go if you want to stay central.

Definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed. They have really large portions but it was sloppily made and the sushi did not hold togrther at all. The rice to sushi ratio was very off, it was like ordering a ball of rice with a small cube of fish. I would not recommend. I went with a large group so there may have been some issues because if this but I would not recommend not be going back."}
{"text":"So I'm afraid nobody knows about this sushi place because there is no way anyone who has eaten here isn't coming back regularly. It looks brand new, on a Saturday night tons of seating. Does that slow down there service? Nope, full speed ahead. I was sat down immediately, and before I sat down the waitress asked me if I was all you can eat and what type of fish do I like. Moments later, the chef whipped up some of my favorites. Sexy Girl, Orange roll, Just for the Halibut (yeah... they have halibut there!) and you know how you don't think you can do a whole roll, you can get a half roll. Great fresh food, clean restaurant, great service. Go there!"}
{"text":"The AYCE menu is impressive. They have a great variety of items. The service is excellent. The ambiance is updated. The rolls are a good size and not overly heavy on the rice."}
{"text":"I still love it as a go to for my BIG beef teriyaki bowl, but I tried the nigiris and they weren't that good. I always get salmon and I'm not sure what it was but the salmon here tasted weird"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my time at Gorilla Sushi was quite poor. I enjoyed what food I got, but the amount of time we waited, and the fact they ran out of: Salmon, Kalbi, Uni, Sweet Shrimp, Tempura Ice Cream, Salmon Collar, and Unagi were simply unacceptable even in a soft opening situation. We spent 3.5 hours here, the first full hour of which no sushi dishes came out. The staff was apologetic and I didn't really feel any need to blame them, but there aren't enough sushi chefs and they don't apparently work particularly fast. Another problem is that there are only 3 working during a full dinner evening. They have a lengthy sushi bar, and the fact that they have to take sushi orders from patrons at the bar while falling dramatically behind is flawed.

We made 4 orders on the night. None of them were ever completely filled. The 2nd order came out almost fully before the 1st, and the 1st basically never got filled at all, except for a couple of the rolls. We tried to reorder most of it in the 3rd but by then all the salmon was gone. That meant the three orders of salmon sashimi, five orders of salmon, and three salmon hand rolls *that we had ordered at 7:15pm* never came out. This is probably 9pm by now. And soon after that, they had run out of another 3 common items. We were never informed that they didn't have uni, but I don't think they ever had that, nor the sweet shrimp.

Still, the staff made an effort to apologize and their hands were clearly tied since they simply had run out of stuff. But to run out of Salmon and Unagi at a sushi restaurant? Pretty bad supply management.

As for things that were good - the sushi rice has a decent flavor. The fish quality was adequate to good for an AYCE. While nothing to rave about, their cooked dishes were okay to good. In fact, cooked dishes and ice cream were extremely prompt in delivery. Just not the sushi. And considering the relatively attentive service, I settled on two stars rather than one.

I'm sure they'll iron out the details but I'm not sure we found anything unique or enticing enough to return. The promo they are running during the first week does make it so you'll always get value out of the promo, but not if you include the time invested."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place, every single thing is just amazing, but many of the things that I love is  their sexy salmon with a delicious  sauce on top, their orange crush, Hawaiian, Mexican fiesta,  surf and turf rolls,  this  extraordinary and well served sushi makes me to come over every week! Yummy"}
{"text":"Wow~ Impressive quality for the 25 dollar all you can it price. When I arrived and saw all you can it, I thought oh... it's gonna be shitty. But the sushi and sashimi was very fresh, including the uni, and their roll was really good too. Was very happy with everything I got and the servers were super friendly and knowledgeable. Highly recommend from a very satisfied customer."}
{"text":"Had a sick late night nigiri drunk food meal here last night! Waiters were super friendly and made sure I was taken care the moment I walked in! Coming back soon!"}
{"text":"First timer with my family and we absolutely loved this place. Came in for lunch (all you can eat is $19.99 and yes that's what we got) & I really liked how some of the sushi rolls were served in 4pcs so that you have more room to try everything. They had exotic sushi rolls like \"Monkey Banana\" (California on top of a fried banana) and \"Star Bucks\" that were reallly tasty!! Honestly everything we tried was super good (and I could be a picky eater sometimes) 

Also the presentation for each plate was very nice. You can tell they put a lot of love and pride in their food. The owner even asked us which rolls stood out to us the most after munching down. 

We'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"OMG!!!:-))). Amazing service!!! Amazing food !! Very accommodating to special requests!! And helping u pick what u are looking for !!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down best AYCE sushi in Las Vegas right now and HALF OFF for their grand opening special... can't beat it! The outside looks a bit \"shady\" and is not in the best neighborhood but the inside is decked out to the 9's! Staff is great and every roll we had (and we had a LOT of rolls) was fantastic. What sets these guys apart from the other AYCE places? Sashimi! Stop by and check it out for sure."}
{"text":"So child friendly and probably one of the best ayce places ive been to. Fast service. Cant wait to come back. My new ayce spot!!!"}
{"text":"Glad we tried this place, we were searching for a new sushi place to go while in Vegas. Huge rolls and you get a 1/2 roll option in ayce. Fast service!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very clean, spacious, open, and modern. The interior is very modern with a lot of tables and easy to walk around. The servers are very friendly and helpful. The chef has great skills to make our food delicious. 
My bf and I very enjoyed dining experience at Gorilla sushi. 
Unlike other AYCE, Gorilla has sashimi menu for AYCE! which is crazy. The quality of the fish is very fresh too. 
I highly recommend this place. 
:)"}
{"text":"On Monday, November 7th I ate lunch at Gorilla Sushi as part of a field trip for a Culture and Cuisine class that I am taking at UNLV!  Our menu was all predetermined so I was excited to see what they would serve us.  The first course was an appetizer plate of wontons, fried shrimp and tempura vegetables.  The veggies included zucchini and sort of a Japanese onion ring.  The batter was very light and the dipping sauces were good.  Next they brought out various plates of different kinds of sushi rolls.  There were spicy tuna rolls, spicy shrimp rolls, salmon philly rolls, some kind of an eel sauce roll rainbow rolls, and California rolls.  All were very good!  One of my classmates didn't want to eat raw fish so she ordered a few rolls that were cooked like Japanese lasagna and a cooked scallops and mushroom roll. I liked everything on the menu!  For desert they had fruit rolls with strawberry and mango and a flambe banana kind of thing.  If you are in the area or at UNLV, go to Gorilla Sushi for some all you can eat!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite sushi restaurant in Las Vegas . We've visited twice , but this trip , we took advantage of the AYCE sushi . We tried EVERYTHING we wanted . The waitress, owner , chefs and the food were all spectacular . If you're a fan of sushi , I would highly suggest you try the deep fried Vegas rolls . One thing I was also impressed with is , with the AYCE , appetizers are included ! I'm not a big eater , but this made it worth it for me !"}
{"text":"Yama sushi used to be my favorite AYCE, but their quality has gravely subsided ever since their second shop opened. 

This is the new best AYCE sushi in Vegas. It's just delicious in every way. And we tried basically everything but the rolls. The salmon collar was slightly over cooked but everything else was just delicious and had us in awe. 

Totally didn't expect to find such a hidden gem in that area but pleaseee give them a shot. They're worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!! We were driving around while I was looking in yelp for something to eat and it popped up on yelp and right in front of us. We decided to go for it even though it was a sketchy lot with a bunch of crack heads. The manager and employees were very nice! We got the all you can eat. It was about $25 which is a good price for as much as we ate. My brother and dad like more plain rolls while my mom and I like more extravagant rolls. We all enjoyed the 007 roll and got like 4 of them. We also enjoyed the shrimp fried rice and the chicken teriyaki is to die for. The fried gyoza was good and so were the egg rolls. The Lobster and Mexican roll were delicious as well. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the Korean BBQ roll. We even got dessert with the meal! If we ever are in Vegas i definitely plan to go back."}
{"text":"The food quality was good, servers were friendly and attentive. Inside the restaurant was clean. They said its new. 
It's little far from my house but if I have a chance, I would go."}
{"text":"Friendly service , welcoming atmosphere ; )
Attentive server and place is really clean when you walk in. Sushi is fresh ! We'll definitely come back"}
{"text":"Food was great! I had the shrimp fried rice. It was delicious and good portions. My meal was to go but the inside of the restaurant looked nice. It's near the airport so it's convenient when flying in/out. I'd eat there again."}
{"text":"They have redeemed themselves from their soft opening. They just changed up their menu again and I think it's even better. The sushi taste a lot fresher than last time. Their appetizers are still good and they added even more. They have Korean appetizers opinions. The wait staff has improved by a lot. They are more attentive and we received all of our order this time. The food also comes out fast and hot."}
{"text":"first visit and I am pleasantly surprised. clean fast friendly. lobster roll is now my favorite!"}
{"text":"Food was great service was pretty bad we waited at least 20mins for 3tiny pieces of pork belly.  I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Lame service. The waitresses had no ideas and manners at all. Won't com
 Back again for sure indefinitely."}
{"text":"You get free sake when you write a review, so welp, here I am. 

I usually don't eat seafood by choice so it was nice to see that their menu has lots of other stuff on it, like spicy fried chicken and cheese corn. The sashimi and sushi I tried was decent and edible by my standards. Service is fast and friendly. Not too many complaints so far. 

I must say the seats are awfully uncomfortable so there goes one whole star for that."}
{"text":"Can't wait to enjoy some great food and Sapporo! Heard it's the best sushi dive place in the area! Friendly staff, great service so far, very communicative."}
{"text":"Went here with my dad for lunch and overall I gave it 4 stars.. service was excellent and friendly and food was good"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. The sushi is always fresh and delicious. The staff is friendly and fast. Bring your hungry self here and eat up! It's all you can eat for the best price in town!! I am definitely a regular here and always take visitors here from out of town."}
{"text":"This is our new go-to sushi place in Vegas. It's down the street from UNLV. The ambiance of the place is great. The servers were very attentive and made sure that our waters were full. I love the fact that the menus contained pictures of the actual rolls. It made it easier when choosing. I prefer the no rice rolls, they are a must try! They also have plenty of specials going on, so definitely ask for that! Also, don't forget to check in for something extra! It's a little hole in the wall place, so it has never been completely crowded when we went. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Been here about 6x now. Always delicious, clean, fresh, and a good ambience. Although the booths are too far apart, you gotta sit on the edge of you seat, but besides that I've never been disappointed here!"}
{"text":"walked in off the hot street and was greeted by sever with ice cold water, everything looks and sounds great. also funny names of rolls like TASTE LIKE MY EX-GIRLFRIEND LOL. must try!!!"}
{"text":"server was nice.. place was nearly empty which is never a good sign. the food was mediocre at best ~ go somewhere else"}
{"text":"The restaurant is great! Very clean, relax and nice property. Customer service is great. I like the sushi here, taste good and they have dessert made by sweet potato which I believe you will like. 'In 
short, recommend to go there."}
{"text":"Sushi is always delicious. Hot entrees always fresh and hot. Ordered shumai, shrimp tempura, green mussels, beef teriyaki, crunch roll, MGM, red dragon roll, lobster roll, tuna sashimi."}
{"text":"Can't beat the price. Up beat vibe/ casual. SOOO many options which is great, most of them are cooked, I prefer more raw fish options. Overall, I'll stop here every time I come into Vegas for sure. Even got a roll to go for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Was here around 10ish pm and everything still fresh and delicious.  Our waitress was friendly and nice.  Here is a little diff than other ACYE places.  Here they let you order by plates or All you can eat.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Alright this review is averaging 7 visits.  Averaging all the times I have been there I would say the sushi is 5 stars A+ the Sushi Chefs always smile and never look grumpy I think they truly enjoy their jobs.  They get 4 stars for service because there has been times where we would have to wave for the wait staff or they actually brought the wrong order over it ordered it wrong from the start.  Timeliness is 4 stars because anything made from the back kitchen is slow.  I will say staff and what appears to be the manager is super friendly!  My biggest pet peeve is this-  they show videos on the tv but it's sometimes inappropriate videos and all of it is in English or Spanish - I would much rather see Asian singers such as KPop or even movies then what they have now the second pet peeve is how uncomfortable the booths are I know some places do that so people don't stay long but seriously? My mom has a back problem and literally couldn't sit for more then half hour and left hungry"}
{"text":"Don't bother. I called to ask how long their wait was bc I know they have a special going on and the person that answered the phone told me 45 minutes and that he would put me on the list as long as I came in 30 minutes to ensure my name wasn't called before I got there. I show up and I'm told my name isn't in the list and they don't take reservations. I'd recommend going to Sakana."}
{"text":"Got the all you can eat.  I think the rolls and cooked foods are the way to go.  The nigiri sushi was not that great, but the roll was excellent and the yellowtail collar very good.  People that work here are really nice.  Love hearing the greetings."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of sushi, very fresh and tasty. Some of the rolls came with a vinegary sauce that we weren't the most fond of. Service was very attentive and friendly. We felt very welcome and inviting. Definitely recommend to try the auce sushi deal. Reasonable pricing and as good of quality as the strip, at a discount."}
{"text":"This was a nice surprise.  Very clean, very good service and the food was spot on. They give discounts of $5.00 off on their website."}
{"text":"Great service, good food!

After living by China Town for years, it's hard finding good AYCE places on this side of town but I'm glad my boyfriend and I found this little hidden gem!

I must say, I love their garlic salmon & garlic tuna nigiri. Actually, just all their nigiris were really good and great portion of fish! We also tried their seared salmon (least favorite), sweet ebi, and white tuna. 

I think we overdone it with their appetizers. We tried their oyster, shrimp tempura, fried chicken, shrimp and asparagus skewer and baked green mussel, which by the way I really enjoyed and had way less cheese and cream than most AYCE places. 

And the reason why I say we over done it with the rolls is because we could barely finish the actual rolls we ordered. Not really a fan of rolls to begin with, but we decided to try three of them, Boom Boom, Gorilla lasagna and Japanese pizza. The Japanese pizza and gorilla lasagna were pretty much the same flavor, so it was hard to eat both of them.


And to top it off, we ordered Mochi ice cream and Japanese cheesecake for dessert.

Overall, it was probably a 4.5, rounded up of course. The quality of the food was great and the service was also very quick!"}
{"text":"Awesome new spot! I especially like their Gorilla Dream roll- I've never eaten anything like this before. It's basically a dessert sushi stuffed with tempura mango and strawberries. Their short ribs and teriyaki salmon is the best! It's like a dream come true melting in your mouth. Tuna Poke is chibi-sized and very satisfying. And to finish it off--- you must get the Tempura Green Tea Icecream!!!!"}
{"text":"NOMZ They had me at UNI and OYSTERS! The staff is friendly and very helpful and you get a good AYCE deal for the quality."}
{"text":"This is our first here.  We'll definitely be coming back.  Fresh and A LOT of selection for a good price!  Great and attentive service.  Come hungry!  BOMB!"}
{"text":"Yummy new spot we found!! Very friendly and sushi was fresh and delish! I tried the jay roll and it hit the spot!!"}
{"text":"I've not yet eaten inside the restaurant, but I've picked up sushi rolls & appetizers to go and I have to say I love the interior; it's so clean and sleek. I'm still sore after losing Min Sok Chon in this location so many years ago, but in all of the incarnations of this business space, the consistent element is friendly, welcoming service. Calling in a pick up order is so quick and easy, and twice when I had questions over menu items, whoever took my order went out of their way to ask the chefs when they weren't 100% sure how to answer my question. That's integrity right there. The menu features lots of over-the-top rolls, but the quality of the fish is not compromised. The prices of basic rolls is obviously a steal; if you are a UNLV student and you don't know about these cheap Cali rolls, you're missing out on life. But I like the Korean dishes that are also available here - don't miss the Scallop Dynomite appetizer, mmmm. One of these days I'll come for the AYCE dinner; they also have a full bar. In the meantime, I love being able to swing in and get great food on the way home at great prices."}
{"text":"Place to eat all you can eat sushi with your friends and family. Servers were so nice and kind when they serve. Interior design is best suitable for sushi restaurant. Food comes out pretty fast."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place a long time ago and kept passing it by while driving for various ride share jobs ;-). I finally got to try this place on a Sunday Night with my wife just a couple days ago.

With that said here is my only complaint: The benches that you sit on are not padded so not very comfortable. I'm guessing they do this to make sure people stick to the 90 minute dining rule lol. 

Now, my praise: J.B. was one of the friendliest  and funniest servers we've ever experienced in a restaurant. He joked around and laughed with us like we were just eating in his house. We ordered \"The Boom Boom\" and right after the song \"Boom Boom\" came on and he came over and pointed it out and then just laughed about it! LOL

The names on some of the sushi dishes had me cracking up! Viagra, Who's Your Daddy, Who's Your Ex-Wife, Taste Like My Ex-Girlfriend and on and on. SO MANY TO CHOOSE FROM!!!! The ones we had were so awesome! The sauce that they put on many of the dishes was making me melt in my not so comfortable seat. I don't know what kind of sauce it was but it was brown and drizzled on a lot of different dishes. I had The Baked Gorilla, Surf & Turf (Highly recommend), Who's Your Ex-Wife (Deep fried spicy tuna, spicy crab mix in a jalapeno w/spicy mayo & eel sauce) OHHHHH EMMMMMM GEEEEEEE!!!!!!! SOOOOOOOO FRICKEN GOOD!!!! I think it was that eel sauce that I couldn't get enough of! If you like spicy you have to get the \"Who's Your Ex Wife\"! but lete it sit for a minute because they bake it and it comes to your table HOT as in temperature hot, not just spicy hot.

This isn't a fancy spot but they have very nice and friendly servers and the food is good. K-Pop is playing on the TV and the place is clean! If you love sushi you HAVE to try Gorilla Sushi! I'm definitely going back...but not too often. I need to lose some damn weight!"}
{"text":"I am new to Las Vegas. I was looking for good sushi and good vibes. I found it here.  Very clean and the staff is friendly. There is also All You Can Eat sushi here for $25.95 which you cannot beat! Good saki and beer to go along with your meal! I definitely will return. New fav in Vegas."}
{"text":"Gorilla sushi is my go-to. I'm a student at UNLV and absolutely love the convenience and great service. Claire is the best! It's always a quality meal here and you can't beat the prices!"}
{"text":"First time here, it was not busy and we were seated right away. If you like nigiri they have great sized portions. It took a few minutes for it to come out, but we did order a lot. The roll selection is quite large and is comparable to many other locations. All in all it was pleasurable and I would come back again"}
{"text":"This is an excellent sushi restaurant.  All kind of sashimi was fresh. I love the tuna most."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for a church conference, and my pastor and I wanted quality food other than the passable buffets at the hotel where we were staying.  He and I love good food, so I found Gorilla Sushi through Yelp.  The place is in a shopping strip.  We walked in found it quite lovely.  We ordered just about everything except the Bulgogi beef.  The service was excellent as well.  I recommend it!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi restaurant in urban Las Vegas.

All you can eat is offered for about $20 a person. I went for lunch. The menu included appetizers, sashimi, sushi rolls, and specialty rolls. They do offer half rolls for the specialty rolls which is great so you can try more.

The waitstaff was very attentive and come by every few minutes to see if you want more food. The sushi was fresh and delicious. I definitely got my money's worth. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical about checking this place out because the comments were flagged as fraudulent, but I decided to check it out anyways because it's close to my where I live. It turned out to be amazing! The food was delicious and the staff was friendly. The prices were good too! All you can eat sushi for 25! To top it off, I got lucky and they didn't charge me to take home the left overs (they usually do though)."}
{"text":"Yummy sushi and great presentation of food! Friendly staff and clean environment. Great place to come with friends and family."}
{"text":"Many variety of appetizers, nigiri, and rolls to choose from. Service is on the spot as well. Have been here couple times already, the food quality is consistent. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi spot!! They have a large variety of choices for all you can eat. They also have very unique rolls and appetizer options that make them stand out compared to the typical sushi restaurant. They also allow you to order half rolls!"}
{"text":"The sushi was good.  The serving sizes were small on the appetizers, so you could try a little of everything.  The interior of the restaurant is nice, very energetic.  K-pop music videos on a tv screen, along with sports gave it a fun feel.  The service would've won the fifth star, but they were preoccupied with the FIFA soccer, and the water pitcher came around for refills with no ice.  Otherwise, the food was good.  I put up the menu in pics so anyone interested can see what they have."}
{"text":"Place is neat and clean. Erica was awesome and very attentive and her name tag is pretty cool too."}
{"text":"Loved this place, the AYCE was incredible. Fresh sushi and not heavily packed with too much rice like other places. They make the app portions smaller so you can try more items. The waitresses are so accommodating and they have these adorable LED name tags! The atmosphere was awesome playing music videos and the Winter Olympics at the same time. The whole family loved it and we will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I usually like eating at gorilla sushi when I'm around the area, so I decided to eat here during lunchtime with friends and family. So we walk in and we were immediately seated, asked what we wanted to drink. The server then disappeared into the kitchen and took her time to bring out drinks. It also took awhile for us to be able to order, (though there were only 2 people out of 4 at our table, so I don't completely blame the delay in being able to put in an order).
After some time, we were able to order. Sweet. 
The rest of my party comes, and everything is pretty okay, we ordered some more. Time passes and eventually the customer service deteriorates. We ordered our last round of food and a dessert for one person.  While waiting for the food, a check hits the table. Uhhh sorry we didn't say we were done yet? We just ordered more food!! It's as if we were being rushed out. We were a little bit over the \"time limit,\" but it was not busy at all, there were only 3 other tables so I doubt that it was being reinforced. If the server was concerning us with the time limit, she could've told us that we were overstaying our welcome. Anyways, the food came and we ordered dessert for the rest of the party. Mind you, we were still not done eating so we didn't pay attention to putting the payment in the check yet. (Not like it's our fault). All of a sudden the check is being taken away with an insincere \"thank you.\" The server thought that we were ready to pay, but my mom told them that there isn't anything in the check. Lol. You think this is the worst of it all? No it gets worse. My mom decides to tip in cash, and sets it to the side. She was actually planning to put it in the check so she can personally hand it to the server. A couple seconds later, that tip was snatched right off of the table. Wtf? Rude?? I'm a server at another restaurant,,,and its common knowledge that it's courteous to not touch the tip (let alone snatch it off the table lol) or the signed check until the customer has left. Food was alright today, but only it was because they stood on the bar area for long periods of time (8-10 minutes) because of incompetence. Customer service was just a miss today. It's usually great, especially with server Jay. I was hoping that he was working today but unfortunately he wasn't. Too bad. This business is lucky for getting a 3 star from me despite the \"service\" from lunchtime today.

PS, it was \"Connie\""}
{"text":"New to this area had to check out this sushi spot. From the service to the food..SPOT ON!! Definitely bringing the family here. I came alone to test it out lol 
Great food."}
{"text":"My favorite spot!! Food is always good and the service is on point!! I'd come here everyday if I could!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and service. Very fresh and healthy portions. 
Would definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I definitely give this restaurant a sold 3.5 stars. Sushi or Japanese, in general, is probably one of my most favorite things to eat. I have eaten in a lot of AYCE sushi restaurants and I believe that Gorilla Sushi is good but is still lacking.

Food: The sushi was good in terms of flavor but I would sometimes get sushi that was dry and not cold enough. Don't get me wrong but isn't fresh, raw fish supposed to cold? Yes, it is. The sushi that I got was warm. Consistency is definitely the key. Other than that, there are a lot of different sushi to choose from and some of them are really good such as the Red Snapper and the dragon roll. 

Service: The service was really good. The servers were really nice and catered to our needs well. I didn't even have to ask for a refill once when I needed one. They are all very kind.

Overall, I left this restaurant with a good impression but not a great one. I understand that they are still new and have a lot of improvements to be made. It was still worth a try and I would definitely come back if I'm in the area and need a sushi fix fast."}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi in town! If we want ayce sushi we come here. Garlic tuna, albacore carpaccio with crispy onions, tako yaki... and so many more appetizers were all good. They also have great deals on sake and beer! Didn't get to try a lot of the dishes because there's a lot to choose from. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Great food and great service. I know there are a lot of sushi places in town but I assure you this place is one of the best.  Go check it out! Great for dine in and take out."}
{"text":"You cannot get a better sushi deal!

Not the best sushi ever but absolutely decent and fresh and nicely prepared. The real advantage here is that is not just sushi/nigiri as with many similar places. Usually they want you to fill up on rice and not expensive fish flesh. Not the case here. Sashimi and hand rolls and essentially everything on their menu is up for grabs. That includes all the apps too! Gyoza, pork belly, tataki, seaweed salads, soups...

All for $20!!!

I have to stress this not a 5 star review because of straight up sushi quality but rather a perfect combination of quality to quantity to price. 

You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Very delicious sushi. I highly recommend all you can eat option. Also comes with deserts."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! The fish is fresh and tastes like they are catching it out their back door.  They do not load their rolls with rice, just yummy fish and sauce combinations.   Don't forget to order the Spicy Edamame they are finger lickin good!!!"}
{"text":"Check this place out! I was apprehensive at it being slow on a Friday during dinner but we ended up finishing our dinner before a huge rush came in. It is well worth it. We did ayce and enjoyed the different things they offered. I have never had a sexy salmon anywhere else and it was delicious. The love roll was probably the favorite of the night. Great nigiri and rolls. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I think this is the best sushi i have had for the right price!!!! My brother was bragging about this place! Visited from chicago it s awesome! Definately a great sushi recommandation!!! Give them a chance u eill not be dissapointed!!!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here, first time was on promotion $20 per person, but now price went up
To $25.95, but still worth it because of the buy 2 get 1 free drink, sushi are fresh, appetizer are hot and fresh, service is good, will come back for sure !"}
{"text":"This place is super good , staff is usually very attentive. Fish is fresh and super good portions I love they don't give you super thin slivers .the only thing i dislike is you can only have 1 desert"}
{"text":"The sushi here is better than Yama there is normally no wait to get in! Which is awesome! It's not my favorite sushi place in Las Vegas but it is good for an all-you-can-eat sushi place. Keep doing what you're doing Gorilla Sushi!"}
{"text":"A detour on lunch break choices lead me and a co-worker to this great find. Located in a tight strip mall plaza, I was pleasantly surprised how modern and clean it was inside. We were greeted right away and was seated even though we were planning on getting our food to go. 

The dining area was open and spacious. The ceiling had an interesting lighting which brightened up the room quite well. There were 3 chefs at the bar area, which I thought about sitting over there as it was welcoming. Also because it was not the super high table tops I have encountered before at other restaurants. The waitress, Claire, was very friendly and took our orders. Since I couldn't decide, Claire asked me what roll I liked best and I said super white is usually my go to and she recommended the I Love My A** Roll. The menu said it was spicy, but I went for it. Also ordered the Japanese Lasagna, honey toast, spicy ramen, Washington Roll, and Alaska Roll.  Ice cold water was brought out as we waited for our food. The manager, Amy, went above and beyond my expectation. She checked on us as we waited and offered some fried gyoza because she knew we were on lunch and must be hungry! How thoughtful! There is also an AYCE lunch special available, so I will be sure to keep that in mind.

All the food was neatly packaged and I wished I had more time to dine inside, since service was solid. The honey toast was delicious. The Japanese Lasagna was a cream cheese and crab meat delight. The Love Roll was spicy, but I kept eating it anyways. The Washing and Alsaka Roll was mostly salmon based and tasted fresh. Since I didn't have the ramen myself, my coworker said was good, spicy, and had lots of mushrooms in it. I will have to give the ramen try next time. The honey toast was warm had a good honey coating that blended well with the vanilla ice cream. Not a huge portion, but it was enough to satisfy the sweet tooth after a big lunch.

All in all, I am so glad I gave this place a try. The sushi was good, the place is clean and the honey toast was as sweet as their service. Will be coming back soon to try the rest of the menu out."}
{"text":"My fave All-You-Can-Eat sushi in vegas.  The fish is wonderfully fresh.  Able to order hamachi, ahi, & salmon SASHIMI, albeit cut super-thin, but still, not so common in AYCE sushi restaurants.

We were so tired of paying $10 for beer and more than $15 for anything you eat on the strip.  This place is so worth our short Uber ride off the strip.

GOOD:
LOTS of varieties and everything was delicious.
Friendly, solid service
$1 sake and beer Mon-Thurs.  SERIOUSLY, $1!!!
$.01 sake on Tuesdays. That's NOT a typo.
Ample parking
AYCE = $26-ish?  I didnt pay attention to the exact amount.
CLEAN restaurant
AYCE includes EVERYTHING that was on the menu... apps, salad, speciality rolls, nigiri (even uni!), sashimi, dessert.

BAD: 
A little hard to find.  It's in a strip mall w/a 7-11.
Some of sushi roll names are super stupid and embarrassing to order in front of my parents (eg. 'Eat Your Ass Roll').

I will definitely be coming here again and again."}
{"text":"The sushi here is good, I am addicted to their Watermelon Soju  too bad that this place is so far from my house so I only come when I'm near by."}
{"text":"Food was delicious & very fresh. Deffinetly comming back. Awesome customer service from Vickyy."}
{"text":"Not a huge sushi eater but found several items to love. Spicy crab roll, garlic chicken, Lobster roll, Popcorn Lobster roll....worth the AYCE price."}
{"text":"There are a lot of AYCE Sushi Restaurants in Vegas but I have got to say this one is the most memorable. The quality of the fish was really good. The price is the same compared to other competitors. There are a variety of sushi rolls. Most places have the same ingredients for their rolls but they change the names with different sauces but Gorilla Sushi is very original. Would definitely come back for their fresh sushi and great service."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the location, this place has top notch sushi chefs on staff.

We sat at the bar, ordered a la carte and got great service from the chefs and staff.

Salmon and tuna Nigiri was thick cut and fresh. The salmon was especially creamy. The cuts are more short and thick (traditional), vs long but still delicious.

All the rolls we had were delicious! Try the Gorilla Lasagna if you like a richer tasting roll.

For dessert we split a green tea ice cream and got a whole 2 scoops!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful group of people, they are so nice and friendly here. The food is absolutely delicious! They have so many different options, hilarious names, and great cuts for the nigiri and sahsimi. Try the sexy girl salmon if your into nigiri, and the ask for the expresso ice cream if your into coffee. (It was ahhhhmazing!"}
{"text":"Went out of the strip to find some sushi found this diamond in the rough!! AMAZING SUSHI!!! You will not be disappointed at this place! Looks like it might be iffy from the outside but as soon as you walk in you feel right at home! Great customer service, funny chefs that make the experience worth coming back. Did I mention the sushi?! I'm a guy that can pack away the sushi, but I had the all you can eat and had 3 full rolls, two yellowtail sashimi, and a sushi burrito. I left there with a full belly and a smile on my face. Next time my wife and I come to Vegas, gorilla sushi will be the first place to go to dinner at!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the chef was nice, the sushi was fresh, nice atmosphere and the names of the sushi rolls or so funny and unique,
The screaming orgasm is a must"}
{"text":"Had a great time at Gorilla Sushi.
Food was good, service was good and place was clean and comfortable, not crowded and congested. They have a huge menu with lots of different  choices, appetizers, desserts and even sashimi, you can order anything on the menu and some specialty rolls are 4-6 pieces instead of 10-12 pieces so you can order more. The thing that made me enjoy Gorilla sushi was their creative sushi that were tasty and some even without rice.
Rolls like Korean BBQ roll, Grand MGM, Baked Gorilla , Gorilla lasagna, Hello Monkey, Monkey's ass roll, Japanese pizza and Albacore Carpaccio, Bulgogi Nacho appetizer. The servers were really nice,friendly , fast, didn't even have to ask for refills on drinks. Overall good food, good service, nice place and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Got a chance to try AYCE in this new-opening restaurant. The food is pretty decent and the fish is pretty fresh. The service is good and the server promptly refill our water. The atmosphere is comfortable and stylish. If you like having sushi in a modern interior environment place, you better not miss out this place! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Food was hella good. The rice to fish ratio is pretty good! other places usually skimp out on the fish and fill you up on that rice tho, but I was super satisfied with their generosity. Waitress was hot -- nice too. Great place and definitely will be back. for the fish, and the waitresses."}
{"text":"Very attentive staff, they kept asking us if everything was ok, multiple times... but our orders never came. A minute later another person sees us sitting there so they come over and asks  if we needed anything. We let them know that we are waiting for our order...few mins later another person comes by and ask if we needed anything and we were still waiting on the same order. Few minutes later the manager comes by and asks us if we needed anything and we are still waiting for the same order.

Very attentive service and servers. Just make sure you plan \"fine dining\" time for the food to come out. Very great price for the deal. You come in during dinner and leave when the restaurant closes when your order finally comes."}
{"text":"Such a great sushi place! We were going to go to sakana and it was beyond packed so we decided to try this place which is conveniently next close to our house. The staff was amazing and super attentive. The sushi was delicious. The atmosphere was relatively upbeat, and you could go to watch a game as well. The manager even asked if we would like to switch tables because they had the space and she was worried that the sun would be in our eyes. I accidentally spilled water all over the table and they immediately had fresh towels and were super understanding about the whole thing. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi!! Very good service with excellent foods. We ordered sashimi, sushi, and rolls and they all very tasty and fresh! Oh and the sea urchin, yum!!! Highly recommended. We will definitely come back for more!!"}
{"text":"Worst costumer service EVER. Sushi twister will always be #1. Also, the food taste like it's been sitting in the fridge for weeks. SUPER unsanitary."}
{"text":"Connie gives us great service and the place is very clean. Great prices and selection"}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful! It's nice to have such a dope sushi place on this side of town. I normally have to drive across town to eat yummy sushi! 

I enjoyed the food.. if your a sashimi monster like me. I'd recommend trying the sashimi without the sauce. Even tho it was good with it. I prefer plain sashimi =) i also enjoyed having fresh Wasabi too! That made everything awesome.

Honestly, all I eat at ayce places is sashimi [Which is bomb and their nigiri is too!] and ikura with quail egg. If you're a quail egg monster... they do charge $1 per quail egg.. =/ I know alot of my friends love rolls! So I'll definitely bring my friends any family to try this place out!! 

And yes, I can't forget the staff.. they're swt and very attentive.. really cool nice people =) I'd come back! And I will!"}
{"text":"Great service. Sushi was amazing so fresh and delicious. We ordered shrimp tempura and edamame as appetizers. They would have been a 5 start except that they brought the edamame late and 2 of the rolls ordered one was late. Other than that they were super friendly and gave great service. The setting inside is very retro and relaxing and I would like to say it's a bit of a wooden look. Love that they close late. The food taste is the best and love the name of their sushi such as \"taste like my ex girlfriend\" and \"I love my Ass\" gives it a good laugh while  our looking through the menu which is enjoyable. Most definitely refer this place.  If your going on a date this is a good spot. Especially since their prices are reasonable and one of the cheapest amounts I have paid for sushi. They do have a bar and 2 big TV's. Overall love love love this place would definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for AYCE sushi. I love dinner because they offer sashimi, oysters, soft shell crab, raw shrimp night, and calamari tempura. I also come for lunch too. They have great selection when it comes to appetizers, sushi, salads, and more."}
{"text":"First time coming and did not disappoint! First off, restaurant was very clean and had multiple TVs. Everything was delicious. Fish was very fresh, presentation and fish/rice/topping/sauce ratios were perfect. Rolls weren't packed with rice like a lot of other sushi buffet places do. Also little to no AYCE restrictions with the whole menu. The sushi chef noticed we were ordering a lot of nigiri and sent yellowfin toro to our table! What a nice touch!!!! Wait staff was very attentive and pleasant, and the owner stopped by our table to greet us towards the end of the meal. 100% would recommend to a friend and will return next time in LV!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is fresh and delicious. AYCE includes the whole menu, which is great when you want soup or salad to round out your meal. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a reasonably-priced all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get AYCE sushi. For $25 dinner, price is on par with competitors, but quality here is distinct. AYCE includes: appetizers, noodle soups like udon, salads, nigiri, rolls, specialty rolls, and dessert (one per person).

Some of my favorite nigiri are: garlic tuna, cajun albacore, super white tuna, and salmon. All fresh with good rice ratio. 

I'm not really into rolls, but they have a huge selection. I tried the planet hollywood roll and that was amazing! Good thing they offer a 1/2 rolls. 

The dessert selection here is better than most places. It goes beyond ice cream and mochi. I got the green tea cheesecake and it was good. They were out of the snowflake the day I went. 

Their service is spot on and superior than most other sushi places I've been to. 

Entertainment: three big screens usually showing sports and music videos."}
{"text":"The Yellowtail was our favorite order of the night, it was delicious and fresh! The staff was very fast and friendly. My family will definitely return. Price for the AYCE is same as most places and there was a great selection to choose from."}
{"text":"Weird restaurant name but good reviews on Yelp, sounds like a place worth trying.  First of all, the restaurant has a fresh interior which is very clean and spacious.  This is a contrast to the neighborhood which is a bit on the sketchy side (Eastside of Las Vegas).  We made it out alive, so it's not that bad.

For $26, it's a few dollars more than it's AYCE peers.  Is it worth it?  There is nothing to complain about the sushi, a good rice to fish ratio, precise cuts and fish is of decent quality.  The sashimi is limited to one serving per person and it's worth it, it's a much higher grade than anticipated.  Service is pretty good, with consistent check ins to make sure we placed our orders.

The honey toast was a downer, it's just a sweet bread roll that is slightly toasted with some honey and a scoop of ice cream.  Stick with the ice cream instead

The verdict, I would say it's worth just on the sashimi itself."}
{"text":"I've been to this sushi spot 3 times & the food is amazing! I really love it here. Highly recommend this spot. Only reason I didn't give this place a 5 stars as it deserves is because of Alex the server, the place wasn't busy & we felt so rushed by him. Right off the bat when he came to get our orders he told us \"appetizers first\" he wouldn't let us order how we'd like. Out of all the things my cousin ordered 3 menu items she never received. I was really disappointed with his service. I hope I never get him as a server again. Also i wish there dessert section wasn't so limited other places let you get atleast one of each"}
{"text":"Pretty decent sushi spot located in Henderson, not sure it'll take over as king of the AYCE sushi hill, however.

What is Good?

-Halibut nigiri on the AYCE menu
-Nice sashimi plate on the AYCE menu
-Fish was fresh

What could improve?

-After about 30 minutes or so on both visits we noticed the service dramatically slow down to a point where you think it's done intentionally for you to take it as a cue to leave 
-Both times I've been here the red snapper was not fresh so it wasn't offered...perhaps remove it from the menu if this is standard

Overall, not a bad experience."}
{"text":"Gorilla sushi did not let me down. I wasn't expecting such great service and quality from an all-you-can-eat (AYCE) sushi place.

At gorilla once you order the food it starts coming out. They were so on top of it. I usually order and wait 5-10 minutes between the orders to get everything. Here it was almost instantly! Another great thing about Gorilla is that the server got about 95% of our order correct, meaning they only missed about 2 orders total! That's such good accuracy seeing how our party was a party of 8.

As for the sushi we loved it. For the price you pay you get pretty decent quality. Their sashimi was surprisingly fresh. Being in the middle of the desert, I didn't expect much. I got some good fish. It definitely wasn't the best but pretty good for AYCE. Their rolls tasted great and not cheap at all. Their nigiri has a perfect ratio. There wasn't an excess amount of rice compared to fish. The rice however didn't taste like sushi rice. I think they might have forgotten to put rice wine vinegar with it but it was okay."}
{"text":"So good!!!!excellent food very fresh fish.
There is so many good food on the menu. I loved the Sashimi and kalbi. Awesome price for the food they offer and amazing service from server. I will come definitely come back."}
{"text":"If it's AYCE sushi I'll always try it. I really like it here. There's things that stand out and things that can be improved. If you it's love rolls I think this place has one of the best varieties as far as rolls and offers more options than most spots. I love super white tuna it's basically my fave fish and that's only reason I'm giving this a 4 star. Service was fantastic and food was great the space was great. Also I'm not a big salmon lover but that sexy salmon in bomb. I'll be back for sure to eat here again"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas for a trade show and went out for a drive one night, to escape the strip.  Literally just happened to see this place off to the side of the road as we drove by.  Sushi sounded good, so I checked out the rating on Yelp.  Decided that's where we were eating and it did NOT disappoint! Boyfriend and I got the all you can eat for $25 and went through 8-1/2 rolls. (Yes, theyll do half rolls, so you can have more variety). We tried 10 different rolls and loved them all. My favorites were Tastes Like My Ex Girlfriend and Gorilla (something?) It had mango and banana in it and it was awesome.  The service was fantastic. I will definitely make a point to visit this place everytime I visit Vegas.  We also told our server at Stack, the next night, and he planned to go that night when he got off work haha!"}
{"text":"One of the best all you can eat sushi places in Vegas for sure no question. They have a pretty expansive menu with tons of rolls and a lot of variety in appetizers. Love the Mexican fiesta roll. They have beer and sake specials often and have pretty great desserts. Great value, great sushi."}
{"text":"best ayce sushi in town!! great service and excellent food! highly recommend to everyone! its also very close to unlv which makes it prefect for me!"}
{"text":"I checked it out with my classmates from UNLV, this is a sushi buffet restaurant and the quality of sushi is not bad!!! Service there is very good!"}
{"text":"Small joint, Minimal decor. I did like how the sushi bar was set up. Food was def a strong 4.6 but unfortunately the service was poor. Our whole stay was 2+ hours of ordering but more so of waiting for our orders to arrive. We asked for plates but never received them so I ended up eating in a mini soy sauce dipping saucer THE WHOLE TIME. The 2nd round that we ordered was a 35 minute wait for them to tell us they lost our order after they came to check on us twice and said they were making our food. The waiters/waitress' def need to be trained more. They were friendly but, their knowledge on their items need some improving and customer service skills as well. They were having a grand opening special for AYCE & Drink specials until friday. BUT THEY WON'T HAVE ALCOHOL UNTIL NEXT WEEK?!? I guess there won't be any drink specials #sadlife. I will say, we did damage. 11$ AYCE sushi for 2 hours. I will def be coming back for the yummy food. Hopefully next time, they will have more staff."}
{"text":"I am a big garlic tuna lover so that is usually the first thing I taste when coming into a sushi place as a first timer. I actually like it but beware that they are very generous when it comes to their garlic sauce, which could be a good thing for some and bad for others. I love garlic sauce so it did not phase me at all. Another sushi roll that stood out to me was their bulgogi roll - very good. I have tasted the basic nigiris as well and it tasted pretty fresh. It was only my friend and I in the restaurant so our orders came in quick and our server refilled our waters a lot, and checked up on us consistently. However, we did go into the AYCE mindset where everything is all you can eat including desserts (limiting mochi ice-cream like the other restaurants) and this place only lets you chose ONE dessert item per person. So if you want two scoops of green tea ice-cream, you can't. In our case we wanted to try their fried ice-cream and mochi ice-cream but we could only chose one, other sushi places offer the flexibility to have as much ice-cream scoops and misc. dessert items more than once. That was the only issue for me, I paid $20+ for AYCE when I can't even have the entire package then I might as well go to another restaurant with the same price, and better menu flexibility."}
{"text":"Umm where to begin... 
Upon arrival we were sat immediately, it wasn't busy. We arrived for lunch and was told someone would serve us soon. A good 12-15 minutes passed and people after us were being served, then finally someone asked if we had been helped...

First off the food here is good, they just need to get their shit together. I ordered Hamachi Kama, which is not on the menu but was stoked that they offered it because I LOVE HAMACHI KAMA. I ordered that shit first. After about 30 minutes, and after seeing 3 hamachi kamas go this family, I asked to check on it. Only to find out that the family got my order and they ran out. Thanks gorilla sushi for letting me down and thank you to the family for just taking my order and not refusing. 

We also ordered Udon in which our server insisted TWO TIMES, it took long because the kitchen was backed up. It's not busy at all, how long does it take make udon? Apparently 30 minutes. Come to find out they lost the order and it was ready after 3 minutes after ordering it a 3rd time...

We left not satisfied, and still missing a few dishes. Big up to the server for crediting us just one AYCE because of their fuck ups... 

HEREs the bottom line. Your food is good, you really need to re-evaluate your service. Your servers do not know which table is which, as I heard them counting. You lost points with me when my hamachi Kama, which I love so dearly was given to someone else, and you take long for service... A simple sorry will not do, our server apologized for their fuck ups like a dozen times... 

Wouldnt mind trying here again but until then, I will not returning until they get their shit together... This is what I get for a restaurant that has a grand opening with a gimmick of half off..."}
{"text":"The reasturant is clean and servers are nice! There are lots of different kind of sushi, and you can find out some Korean style food with the sushi roll! Very enjoy the dessert which is the strawberry shaved ice!"}
{"text":"I've been here on 2 occasions. When it's slow the service was great but if it ever gets packed expect a wait even while rating. I was there for 3 hours one night with my group of 7 not because we wanted to but because the service was slow and the orders took forever or were forgotten. On a different note when it isn't busy the staff has the ability to be incredibly attentive. I'm even bordering a 3 star rating but I will come again. The food is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfies favorite place to eat sushi :) reasonable price and always yummy! Our favorite is there unagi and tempura ice cream. There sushi rolls are so good too and filling. We always leave full and satisfied :)"}
{"text":"Highly disappointing birthday trip. I have been wanting to come try this place for months. I heard good things, read good things and was excited to have free AYCE on the day of my birthday. Come to find out the free AYCE is only valid with a party of 4 or more and all must be AYCE. 

Today was their one year anniversary. Their special was 50% off. Sweeeet! We arrived a little before 5PM and was seated right away. Small place but clean. Vicki was our server. She was. A bit of a airhead. I asked for a high chair for my 22 month old and she didn't know where to place it so she asked us to move to a table in the back. Totally fine with us. We wait for them to get the table cleaned. They moved our stuff. Took 5-10 mins for our new server Clair to one to our table. We patiently waited. Service once we ordered was roughly good given the fact they were a pretty much full house. 

We got the seafood nachos which was okay, got some other appetizers and only ordered 3 rolls. Yes, three rolls. We ordered the Grand Canyon, Holy Cow and Tastes like my Ex Girlfriend. Holy Cow was okay, Tastes Like my Ex GF was the best and Grand Canyon was disgusting. It was so bad it left a nasty taste in my mouth for over an hour. 

I called Clair over so we can order our dessert and she told us that due to their anniversary they would be really adamant with the hour rule. I said hays fine but 1) we haven't been here for an hour and 2) we still wanted out dessert. I got really offended as there was a table we're next to who was there prior to us and was still there eating and ordered. Um....why you kicking us out 40 mins into our visit when it took 15 mins to move us to a table and get a server to us? We didn't ask to be moved, you moved us!

I definitely won't be returning here. Place was nice and small. But even with the half off price, it was not worth it. 

Amy the owner was great, that's the only reason I'm giving 2 stars. She took care of us more than the actually servers."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at this spot! The service was excellent and the gorilla hour dog put a modern Koren twist to a corn dog!..."}
{"text":"Came here last night with some friends to take advantage of their grand opening special, which was 50% off everything, including their AYCE. AYCE dinner is around $25 per person regular price so during their special, it ends up to be $12.50 per person. That is a wonderful price. However, I can't say that everything else was wonderful. 

We got to the establishment at around 7 pm and we started to order our food at around 715 pm. We ordered some appetizers and a lot of sushi. All of our appetizers came before any of our sushi came. We waited and waited ... and waited ... and waited. The servers kept apologizing but it's really not their fault. The sushi chefs were backed up. They only had three sushi chefs that were fulfilling the whole restaurants orders. Clearly, they couldn't keep up. So we decided to put in another order because if it's going to take this long to get our first order, we might as well. So when/if our first order came, our second order should be here after we finish right? 

We decided to order more appetizers since the kitchen isn't backed up at all. We would order their galbi, soups, mussels, etc. Turns out they're out of the salmon collar or perhaps they didn't even have it to begin with. Also turns out they were out of sweet shrimp and uni, which the first server failed to inform us about. 

You know there's something wrong when your second set of sushi orders came out but your first set of sushi orders is still missing. It turns out our first sushi orders were placed somewhere and the chefs never got to it. So our second orders got to the chef first while our first order was sitting in oblivion. We had to bring up the issue about 2-3 times to the servers and to the manager. We eventually decided to put in a third order cause our first order was taking so long. Anddddd they came to let us know that they ran out of salmon and unagi. WHAT. Half of our first order had at least 20 orders of salmon. Now if they'd fulfill that first order....

For the whole night, we had about 4-5 orders and none of them were 100% completed. On top of that, our dinner took 3.5 hours, which is a ridiculous amount of time. One of our friends wasn't full but he didn't want to order anything more because we'd have to wait another half an hour. We actually joked that we'd be here waiting until the next morning. 

 The restaurant was never 100% full the whole night we were there so I'm not sure why everything took forever. Not only that but they ran out of or didn't have: uni, sweet shrimp, salmon collar, unagi, salmon, kalbi, and tempura ice cream. I have never been to a sushi restaurant where they ran out of FISH. Yes, it's their first week. Yes, they are still new. But uhm, if you're going to offer 50% off then you should be adequately prepared. 


Honestly, even with the great price, I don't think it was worth 3.5 hours of my time. I'm not sure if I'd return to the establishment for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this on yelp and decided to give it a shot. I'm a very big fan of sushi and sometimes I get bored of my same haunts. I was surprised I had never heard of this location, even though I literally lived a mile down the road for 2 years. The good thing is that the place has an amazing ambiance. Slightly dimmed lights gave it that quiet hangout feel which is awesome. I loved the multiple tv's tuned to different stations. 1 was the knight's playoff game, 1 was an E-league match, 1 was baseball, and 1 was a youtube playlist which coincidentally was their source of overhead music. The exact same 4 screens(in backwards order haha) on the opposite wall so everyone can catch whatever no matter where they sit. I love that. The table was clean, and food was tasty. If it had ended there, this place would have been perfect. The 1 fault I had was that there were 5, yes 5 wait staff who work the entire floor. Meaning every. single. 15. seconds. we were hit up with the regular, everything ok? doing alright? everything good? anything else? more drink? Anywhere else with less intensity it would have been a really great thing, but it actually ruined the meal. Pretty much every single bite or sip someone popped up to interrupt us. Dinner conversation? Not likely..... I really REALLY wanna give them the benefit of the doubt and just say ok, the place was mostly empty, which it was, they were a tad over staffed for the hour we were there, everyone was bored and trying to make themselves useful. I really want that to be the case, because they were all super polite and helpful with any questions we had, seriously much love to JD and the rest of them, but my mother was seriously annoyed and I can never bring her back here. I would definitely recommend this place, as I know for a fact it's the best sushi place in it's zip code. Nowhere within 4-5 miles that's as good quality and as comfortable as this place. But for family sushi night? I must resign myself elsewhere."}
{"text":"Staff and owners were extremely nice. Our entire class went to eat here and they handled it all so well and professionally. They did not rush us. They were very polite and helpful when it came to the menu. They quickly would pick up your plates just as you were finished to declutter your table. Food was delicious and fresh. Highly recommend. Will be returning."}
{"text":"One of the newer all you can eat sushi bars in town. I liked the fact that wether dinner or lunch the options on the menu was the same. There also was some sashimi options  
Of course 1 time only per person. They had some good roles like 

1. Starbucks
2. Surf and turf

The fish to rice ratio wasn't to bad. The service was good, it was slow when we went around 2pm. 

The appetizer gyoza and pork belly was good. Sushi chef Eddie was cool and talkative. My friend and I enjoyed the lunch and we will be back"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and don't know how more people don't know about it!!! Walked in on a Sunday afternoon and it was EMPTY!! Normally one would think that's not a good sign.... but not here! I was happy that it was empty, my wife and I got superior service and even got to have a small chat with Alex the owner who told us they had only been here for 3 months! Their head chef Eddie is a delight and really knows what he's doing behind the counter, the sashimi was so fresh and seasoned so perfectly, the rolls we ordered were so damn good and had so much flavor. We've been to a lot of AYCE spots in California as well as Nevada and this place has by far been our favorite. The seating is great, I'm a big guy so very happy I was able to move the table and the booths to my liking. The beer was buy one get one free!! I love my Sapporo! Their mussels are also just a great as the rest of their food. If you're in the area and want amazing sushi off the strip i highly recommend Gorilla sushi!! Thanks to Alex the Owner, Eddie the chef, and Austin our  server for bringing forth optimum service and food!!! For the price you really can't beat it!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I LOVE this all you can eat sushi place! The employees here are all very polite and we always leave happily full! You must try the \"Bossam.\" Some times it's a little slow up at the bar but that has never stopped us from coming here. The location isn't too far from UNLV and it's clean as can be."}
{"text":"Customer service is great!! Very friendly and attentive. 

I appreciate the 12-3pm buffet they offer. 

My review on the food:
Teriyaki chicken- chewy. There was a piece of dish sponge on the chicken that turned me off so bad. 

Jungle Book roll- Bomb! 
Lobster roll too sweet
Spider rollgood but dont like teriyaki sauce in it and soy paper
eel roll Loved it!"}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here in a week. I like the decor and the atmosphere. The service is friendly too. 

 Today I am having an avocado roll, cucumber roll and a vegetable roll. Oh and a seaweed salad. This is just a quick fix snack to hold me over until dinner. 
 I've had all the above last visit and enjoy them."}
{"text":"This was our third time to this AYCE sushi spot and it's becoming a favorite really fast! 

The UNI here is by far the best I have had in a sushi spot in the valley.

The Who's your Ex-wife roll is killer, they don't skimp in the jalapeños and that's one of the best parts! 

The Gorilla special hand roll is so good we get two every time we are in there! If you add cream cheese it just kicks it up a notch.(foodie reference) 

The service is great, the last time we went they were pretty busy so we can't hold that against them. They are attentive and always there when you need something. 

The interior of this place is great; the decor is modern and clean which is always a plus. 

Bathrooms are clean. 

We will be regulars here from now on."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last week because this place is so good and close to where I live! The nigiri and sashimi are fresh and they have a few Korean dishes also included in their AYCE which are delicious.I will definitely be coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"Terrible!!!.. took forever to get our order. We ordered appetizer and our main course arrived first.  We keep ordering the same thing cause they keep forgetting what we ordered like wtf. We got full after a few orders since it took them f****ing forever. This place is not worth 28$ just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The boyfriend is enamored with sushi. He can eat sushi anything: burrito, taco, frigging ice cream if he could. Atmosphere gears towards youth/college. Spacious, with music blasting which I enjoyed.

Ordered: I LOVE MY ASS, popcorn lobster, catepillar, kbbq, bonsai, crunch roll, unagi nigiri, Cajun albacore nigiri, house salad, garlic edemame, bulgogi nachos, fried calamari, shumai and to finish off green tea fried ice cream and Affogato.

Menu full of options, but lacked variety. Rolls seem to blend with one another and felt like the same base rolls with different toppings. We were the only ones in there for awhile before a second group showed up. To be fair, EDC was in town so I won't judge and server said it was busy earlier. I did open my pallet to crab so there's that. 

Servers Jay and Leo were on top of their game and really made the difference between 3 and 4 stars. 

AYCE $24.95 dinner. HALF ORDERS available for 8pc chef specials. Plenty of appetizers in small portions."}
{"text":"At this point I've been to pretty much all the popular AYCE sushi joints in Vegas (Goyemon, Sakana, Umiya, Oyshi, Yama, Sushi Wa, etc.), and I can conclusively say Gorilla Sushi is my new favorite!! I didn't experience the subpar service the other reviewers have mentioned, so I'm assuming all of the grand opening kinks have been ironed out by now. They have a very extensive menu that has something for everyone - even vegetarians and non-fish eaters. I went in a group of four (all of us seasoned sushi vets) and everyone had a superb meal from beginning to end. Our server (female, don't remember her name) was very attentive throughout the meal, refilling our drinks without us having to ask, clearing empty plates immediately, and taking additional orders. The manager (Chung, I think his name was?) was also very attentive and friendly, taking time to stop by our (and other's) table to check-in and see how our meal/service was going. He seemed to be popular with another table, as well, as I saw them buy him some sake to drink with them. Wish people at my job would liquor me up lol

Even though this place is farther than some of the aforementioned places I used to frequent, this will definitely be my new go-to AYCE sushi spot! Don't be discouraged by the negative reviews regarding service (which seem to have been resolved); do yourself a favor and go try this place out!"}
{"text":"Really really good! Gotta get the ayce when you go here so worth it. Love how they don't give too much rice with the nigiri and offer half rolls with the ayce.

We went in around 5pm before I guess their dinner rush but honestly idk when their rushes are it's always empty when I go. I wonder why it's a great place. But because it's so empty you get you get your food really fast lol!

The only thing I'd complain about is the emptiness is off putting because it feels like all the employees are hyper focused on you while you try to eat. Like imagine every 2 minutes a different waiter is at your table asking if you want to order more. And all we could talk about at the table was \"do they actually want us to order more or are they trying to rush us? are we ordering too much maybe?\" idk weird vibes sometimes but good food."}
{"text":"Eww kind of dirty and below average sushi. Took my daughter here for the ayce and it was not good at all. Im giving one star for the customer service. Ordered there house iced green drink and it's basically green water.... yuck. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Their food is awesome, and it is very close to UNLV. 
Nice staffs, good atmosphere, and great food.
Will go again with my friends."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Vegas. My husband and I go once a week. Everything we've had is just amazing and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I came here at noon on a Saturday for AYCE and because they had just opened it wasn't too busy. Looking at the menu, I immediately saw a couple things (half rolls) I wanted to start of with so I put my order in fairly quickly after I got there but I ended up waiting and waiting. My date got two of his rolls, and still mine didn't come out. There was a couple that got there a good 10-15 minutes after I did and they were brought out 4 orders and still nothing of mine had come out. Finally, it must have been nearly 25 mins until I got my half rolls but the server left so fast I couldn't put in more orders which I wanted to do seeing as it was going to take forever. Also, my date had asked for the miso soup as an appetizer and after 3 rolls and still no miso, we had to ask for it again. 3 times we were brought incorrect rolls and once our roll was almost given to the table next to us and it would have been if we hadn't told the server that was ours. Of course we didn't take the incorrect rolls that were brought to us because we assumed they were someone else's and it wouldn't have been right, even if we were hungry and even if ours were taking forever. There was definitely some sort of miscommunication happening between the kitchen and the servers but the servers were still very nice and attentive of re-filling our drinks and aslo very apologetic when something wasn't right so I don't feel like I can knock them. There was a baked roll that I never got but I was already pretty full so no harm done. Other than this though, the food was really good and they have a lot of unique rolls. We ended up being there for over two hours and most of the time we spent waiting. I wasn't in a hurry so although the food took forever, I was a bit annoyed but not too much. If I had somewhere to be afterwards I would've been livid and probably would have asked for a discount. Maybe they were just having a rough start that day. I would still give this place another shot and try some of their other rolls. Hopefully next time will be better though."}
{"text":"This place is PHENOMENAL!!! Amazing flavors, huge servings & the sushi chef doesn't skimp on anything! Will most definitely be back. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this establishment. I have heard nothing but great things. I'm pretty excited about it.. I'm always interested in a new place close to home.
Ordered several rolls and appetizers. Everything is great so far. Very friendly staff and accommodating."}
{"text":"Came for the grand opening special, half off ayce! We waited an hour to be seated which I was totally understanding towards. We sat down to find out that most of the fish was sold out and not available which again, I was understanding towards.

I wasn't mad until we started ordering our food. Not only did it take so long to come out but our service was not good either. They kept forgetting what we ordered and i still never got my gyoza after asking twice.. 

I was so hungry waiting for my food and I am definitely not leaving full. Usually I would overlook my experience considering it was half off, and they just opened a few days ago but I'm super disappointed. Their sushi and service was not good enough for me to want to come back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They have Will come back here again for sushi and drinks. Service always fast. Good food, good drinks."}
{"text":"Tried this place out based on Yelp reviews. Went for AYCE on Sunday afternoon, it wasn't busy at all. Food was good, service was excellent though it took awhile to get our check. Ordered pretty much everything spicy on the menu, but never found the spice. Still, food was fresh and I liked the ratio of rice to fish so much better than other places. Not sure I would give up Sakana or Twister for it though."}
{"text":"Friendly service and a reasonable selection of items on the menu. However, the quality of fish and prep just isn't there.. 
Even the \" $26 all you can eat \" just isn't worth it when there are better sushi options available in the area..
I would recommend giving this place a pass.."}
{"text":"Low-key, friendly staff, fresh fish, and proper sushi rice. Made a quick lunch stop here before heading to the airport. We picked out a few things on the menu and when we were about to order the waitress asked \"all you can eat?\". Didn't realize that there was all you can each lunch for around $20. Only catch is that it's within an hour but still leaves you with plenty of time. If you're prepared to eat a good amount of food, it's a great option. Even if you're going ala carte it's still fairly priced. The food and portions of each item were plenty and the dishes kept coming out. There's a nice mix of Japanese and Korean choices. Favorites were the Korean BBQ roll, garlic tuna sashimi, and banana dreams roll (dessert). Really enjoyed our experience here.

-Smile when you order"}
{"text":"Great all you can eat sushi with a lot of options . Delicious food freshly prepared. Service was exceptional."}
{"text":"My first time visiting this restaurant and I am really impressed with the raw wasabi. I prefer the raw wasabi for now on"}
{"text":"Refreshing and fresh. Came from CA to celebrate our 25 year anniversary and birthday. Was very excited to find a quaint AYCE sushi restaurant. Selection is unbelievably large. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. Definitely will be back. Features a free birthday special. Req's 4 people minimum with a valid NV id."}
{"text":"Gorilla sushi is clean and well maintained despite the grungier lot they are in. The owners care about quality and good service. 

The all you can eat options are very good as well. They don't drop anything off the menu like some places do. when I went they were prompt with service and quick to clear the many empty plates from the table. The quality was good as well and were awesome about some special requests we had as well. I suggest getting the pork belly but telling them to really grill it to the point where it's crispy."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant in Vegas, good value and service for the price. Gimmicky sushi name but the fish quality is fresh and the service is top notch! Not bad for an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend that is price-sensitive and looking for a value."}
{"text":"I love it!!! That says a lot. The service was great. The place looks fabulous. 
#sushi #Yummers #foodie #bulgogi #udon #gyoza #kalbi #yakitori #nigiri #unagi  #full #uni #sofull  all were delish. I especially love the kalbi and salmon sashimi. I saw the other reviews and was wondering if our service would be the same, but it was not. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot in town. Very peaceful setting and perfect for loners like myself. Sit at the sushi bar and get hooked up. Every time the chef makes something special for me. I absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"Gorilla and Sushi? Does Gorillas even eat meat, or fish for that matter? I have read articles stating due to climate change and affects on the seasons, grizzly bears are opting for elderberries instead of salmon. So I suppose gorillas could adapt to a sushi diet if they move closer to the sea.

And in the Planet of the Ape universe, maybe they have evolved to consume a wider range of items for sustenance.  Not really sure, plus I have not even watched that movie yet. 

But I am absolutely sure that Gorilla Sushi, the AYCE Sushi restaurant that opened its door for business over a year ago is much better looking on the inside than their low key exterior would hint at.  

I never made it to their 50% off grand opening promo, so I never personally experienced the new restaurant hiccup they had to overcome, but on a recent group dinner outing, the Gorilla was impressive in their FOH service level and their sushi chef and kitchen staff did not miss a beat when they received our first orders (even for a group of 11, I thought it was a huge order).  After the first nigiri orders, we collectively placed another huge order just for the appetizers (Soft Shell Crab was totally worth it and served whole).  Our group didn't tackle their Sushi Roll part of their menu as much, but the selection is huge.

Here are some highlights and insights on what we ordered:

Fried Soft Shell Crab - Served whole!!! So yummy and photogenic. O R D E R   I T !!!

Three Sashimi Options to select from per person - All winners, but only offered with AYCE dinner.

Appetizers - So many choices, but if you are here for sushi, try to refrain yourself. On the other hand, it also means your non-sushi friends can come out for lunch or dinner too!

Fish to rice ratio - In favor of the customer, so don't waste the rice.

Nigiri Highlights - Salmon Roe, Salmon, Halibut.

Be organize and prepare with what you plan to order, and obviously order what your party can finish. 

Service was fantastic for our large party and on my subsequent visit. I totally look forward to going back, especially if my foodie friends ever wanted to plan a sushi night out."}
{"text":"Sushi and service here is great.  Teriyaki salmon was my favorite of the night (non sushi dish).  Everyone here was very nice and attentative.  They have a very unique and yummy dessert sushi called gorilla dream.  It has mango, deep fried banana, apple with deep fried banana and strawberry on top drizzled with sweet sauce.  

The place is very clean and bright and modern which is a great contrast from the outside where it looks dark and old.  

Dont forget to get the kalbi, it is great. Also the yakitori. Yum!"}
{"text":"Best sushi house with the best service ever- if i lived in that area i would go at least once a week especially with their quality of sushi and they even have fresh wasabi!!!"}
{"text":"First time here. The customer service was up to par very friendly and very accommodating went Friday night and they had a special going on $19 for all you can eat sushi that was a great deal. The sushi was pretty good and their apetizers were pretty good I wouldn't say it's the best sushi I have ever had but for the price it's well worth it happy yelping go check them out"}
{"text":"I love the service here and food quality. We were greeted soon as we entered. The food was quick and server attended to our every need. The restaurant was clean including bathroom. The sushi was plentiful and delicious. We will definitely come again. It's on the opposite side of town from me that's why I rarely check in here."}
{"text":"Ayce is $25 dinner. Clean place, very nice waitress, and great selection of sushi and appetizers. Their menu is great because they have pictures to see. The reason why only four stars is that you can only have one dessert and some of their appetizers and sushi selections are one time order only."}
{"text":"Okay this place is quite different from other sushi places that I have visited here in Las Vegas. One reason that their actually dress in the traditional Japanese kimono and they look fantastic. Not only do they dress well but the play K-pop. If you want a fantastic desert definitely get the affogato ice cream that is on point"}
