{"text":"Our food had pieces of a broken plate in it. The owner came by and was unconcerned as \"these things happen\", The food was OK, but this type of service was inexcusable. Stay away and find somewhere that cares"}
{"text":"Went there with a friend yesterday, first time after the re-opening of the place.  The food was alright, and service was great as before. The interior decor and the ambience were lovely. The food was slightly overpriced for its quality in my opinion, and my rack of lamb was a little too dry.  Also, I can't understand the policy of paying them 2$/piece of cheesecake that my friend made to celebrate a birthday. It seemed totally unnecessary and just absurd. If you do not allow consumption of food that came outside of your restaurant, why add a price tag to it? Is it like an obligatory tax?  I would've given the place 4 stars if not for this incident. What a shame."}
{"text":"The food is great, especially considering the recent deal of Mtlatable event. I did enjoy their lamb shank, the vegetable soup and the pear pairing with meat is a nice bonus. The desert is also a big plus.   Service is as nice as 2 waiters managing a full room can be. The place can get crowded and a bit loud. The tables are too close to each other. Bring your own wine is another big bonus. Overall a nice little place to enjoy some wine and good food with friends, not so much if you want a romantic evening."}
