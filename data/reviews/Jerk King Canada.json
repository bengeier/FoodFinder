{"text":"Rarely ever in this neighborhood but took a drive out to Port Union today.  Passed by several jerk places on the way and decided to pick one to try for lunch. 

We arrived at Jerk King around 11:50ish and saw people prepping inside(they open at 12pm on Sundays). So we waited...there were actually a few other would-be customers trying to get in (they open at 10:30am all other days) but left when doors were still locked. Almost lost us as customers as well since they didn't open right at 12...

When they finally opened, we ordered the half jerk chicken dinner and the jerk pork dinner. Both came with heaping amounts of rice and peas plus steamed veggies. Quantity was there but quality was lacking...both sides were overcooked. The jerk pork was definitely the better of the two mains. Flavour and heat was ok. Before we left, we decided to grab a spicy patty. So glad we did! The pastry and filling was very good. I'm pretty sure it was homemade. This is the main reason why we gave it 3 stars. We would've rated it a 2.5 otherwise. 

If we are ever in the neighborhood again, we would definitely grab a few patties to go!"}
{"text":"My go-to for the best jerk chicken.

Rice and peas are perfect, and the oxtail gravy is savory. The chicken (I usually get the quarter leg) is a little small, but its very juicy and flavorful. The coleslaw salad is great as well.

The dumplings/festivals are huge and make for a very good snack.

I'll always recommend this place."}
{"text":"I bought 3 take out Jerk Chicken dinners last week and it was the worst I've ever had.   The meat was dry and did not seem as it was even made the same day.  I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Give you pretty large portions of food. Paid ~12$ for jerk pork which can last for 2-3 meals (depending how hungry one is). I am no Jamaican food connoisseur but the jerk chicken/pork here is pretty delicious."}
{"text":"Not too much of a fan of this place, definitely not deserving of any jerk king status. Jerk chicken was mediocre...spicy but nothing memorable. They do give an abundance of rice and peas and coleslaw in the container provided however the taste is definitely lacking. Oxtail gravy was extremely clumpy and on the starchy side. They seem to have a wide variety of West Indian dishes on the menu however after ordering the jerk chicken dinner I question the quality and taste of the other dishes. There is room for improvement. Probably won't be back!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Jerk pork dinner with ox-tail gravy on the rice and peas is incredible. Fish tea is always great as well. Consistently great for the 10 years I have been coming here."}
{"text":"The wife wanted some jerk food so I checked Yelp! and based on the reviews decided to try their food. 

I ordered the jerk pork and curried chicken with roti.  First off the chicken curry is mild but flavourful.  I think next time I will sub the roti for rice.  The roti was bland and had a waxy taste.  That said, the wife liked her chicken curry. 

I had the jerk pork dinner with rice and cabbage.  I might suggest adding the on tail gravy to the rice and pork.  The portion 1 lbs of pork was generous as was the rice.  The cabbage was so-so and I might have opted for coleslaw instead.  I prefer a counter point to meal of jerk chicken or jerk pork.  

The jerk pork is very tasty and it has a kick to it.  I didn't mind the heat but the wife was thankful for a glass of milk afterwards.  

If you are craving jerk meal then this might be your fix."}
{"text":"The jerk Pork is awesome, the rice and pea was very bland and the jerk chicken was decent. But I recommend the jerk pork, seasoned to perfection."}
{"text":"I watched her make the roti, the curry chicken was sitting in a counter warmer and when she opened the lid there was a gross film over the curry. She stirred the gross film and gelatinous bits right back into the curry. I was grossed out but had already paid for it so I figured I would eat it anyway. Who knows maybe that's how they make it. The roti bread was stale and tasted like it was freezer burnt, it also had little dry crumbs that fell out of the roti."}
{"text":"Jerk king!!!

Jerk King's food is decent. It's not my favorite West Indian Resturant. I feel like that their jerk pork has more pepper than flavor. Chicken is spicy as well. I know Jerk should be spicy but it's too spicy for me.

What else can I say, it would be my last option.

If you like spicy Jerk chicken or pork, then Jerk king is the place for you.
I know people who love it but I don't."}
{"text":"In the early 2000s I worked in this part of Toronto a fair bit and would sometimes drop into No Frills as this location.  It was then that I noticed Jerk King and ever since have had nothing but consistently good food.  For years I haven't worked in the area but will make a trek to pick up some good Jerk and Chow Mein.

First off the entire order rarely deviates from:
- One half Jerk Chicken Dinner w/rice & peas; Oxtail gravy; mixed vegetables
- One half Jerk Chicken Dinner w/vegetable fried rice; Oxtail gravy; mixed vegetables
- Two orders of their Chicken Chow Mein*
- An order of plantain 

(* Chicken Chow Mein was added a few years after I started to go and we have enjoyed the quality and taste)

What I like about their dinners - selection.  You can choose between rice & peas, veg fried rice or plain rice.  Plus a sauce choice (oxtail is my choice and I cannot recall the other); plus slaw (poor) or mixed veggies.  I have been to Mr Jerk and they only would give me rice and peas and very little other selection that I recall.

Normally, for Jerk I go to Niceys (Off of Victoria Park / north of Finch) as it is on my way.  But there are times when we have a craving for Jerk King and yeah I will make the trek out to pick it up.  Heck I will drive 4 hours to go to Golden Corral in Erie PA so going 20m in the opposite direction of my home during rush hour is not  out of the question.

Prices are IMO a bit high but you need to order wisely.  Like Swiss Chalet it is better value to get the half chicken v. the quarter.  The chow mein is about $10.50 but they pack in a fair bit.  

I have had no issues and based on the consistency it is worthy of 5 stars.  (if we had the ability of half stars I would give it 4.5 due to the prices)

Washroom?  No idea.  Staff?  Always friendly."}
{"text":"Jerk Chicken Leg Lunch Special for $6.99 is such a good deal.

 I love how spicy the Jerk Chicken is: a hint of scotch bonnet. The portion is quite good with choice of rice and even veggie: topped with oxtail gravy.

Jerk King Canada is more like a takeout joint so there is no tables or chairs if you want to have your food to stay.

Service was friendly and efficient. Worth trying if you are in the area and feel like some Caribbean food."}
{"text":"Ordered the large  jerk pork dinner and boneless chicken roti. Jerk pork was excellent spicy but not too hot. Came with rice and peas and cabbage.  The curry chicken was also good not the best ever but pretty good. The 2 meals were pretty pricey at $25 but there were lots of leftovers."}
