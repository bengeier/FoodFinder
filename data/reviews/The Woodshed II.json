{"text":"Cheap drinks & food. Service is okay depending on the server. Food could've been good but my appetizer was burnt."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood dive bar in Mesa [so set your expectations accordingly] with good food and good prices. However, they do have the BESTchicken wings I have had!  I get them grilled which adds another element to the wing... and a flavor you can't find at most places.  The wait staff is always friendly too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Woodshed tonight. We've been patrons for 20 years. As I was sitting in the patio area there was a very large man being verbally & physically abusive to the woman with him. Once she tried to get away from him, he grabbed her wrists and cornered her. I discreetly called the cops. Because the woman was called a cab by the cops, the aggressive, straight out of prison man (his words) named Gilbert  was allowed to stay-per JOE the bartender b/c he had a $200 tab. We were just there to play pool. Said Gilbert man, started pointing at me (as did another woman he was with) saying they were going to eff me up. Really??? We felt in danger and very disappointed in JOE who let him stay. It's too bad you can't go there & play some pool without incident. Bad management. Drunk abusive man allowed to stay & threaten me b/c he had a $200 tab. WOW. 20 + years and will never go back. #NotSafeAtTheWoodshed"}
{"text":"There were COCKROACHES crawling ON the bar top. Multiple. And many other bugs as well. We decided to just chug our cheap beers and get the heck out of there, but service was very slow AND when we got our check, we had been charged 3$ for drinks that were posted as being $2.50 not only in the menu, but on two other signs in the restaurant. I don't know why I would have to tell a bartender how much their drinks cost, and \"Trixxxxeee\" was one of the worst bartenders I've ever been served by. I wish I could give this place no stars."}
{"text":"This bar isn't young and hip but it is a blast! Everybody is pretty friendly, especially in the smoking section.   They have awesome wing specials and their wings are the absolute best I've had in phoenix. Sounds weird but true. Their ranch must be made with the nectar of the gods because it is so god damn delicious."}
{"text":"I really did not give this bar much of a shot, but here goes my review anyway. A close internet friend of mine swears by the Saturday night karaoke here. So one Saturday night we decide to hit it up. Right away I am put off by the seating. I strongly prefer tall tables to booths for a bar setting, and most of the seating here is booths or low tables. The arrangement of the booths is very cramped and the place was really crowded so right away I was feeling a little claustrophobic.  I only ordered one drink, rum and pineapple but it tasted INCREDIBLY bad, it was somehow both too strong and too sweet. It tasted like the pinnapple equivalent of grenadine was used. Nearly undrinkable.  The karaoke host talked WAY too much in the 15 minute we were there. And 2 of the three songs we heard stopped half way through for no apparent reason.  The deciding factor in our leaving (besides the friend we were hoping to meet not being there) was the INTENSELY creepy crowd. Creeps to tolerable strangers ratio was grim, I would say 20:1, and that is being generous, I don't recall seeing any tolerable strangers but I wasn't looking that hard. A very creepy old man maintained a very one sided conversation with my poor companion on the smoking patio and a very drunk girl tipped over stone bench and fell on her ass. All this was our cue to leave. We called a cab and escaped to our regular Saturday night karaoke up Dobson to Priceless Primetime. I guess I probably will give this place another shot, when I am more sure my friend will be there to show me what is to like about this place."}
{"text":"Decent little bar close to the hotel, had late night food and pool tables. Was a ghost town when we arrived but overall was an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Great wings & great wing specials, a nice little pub, drinks are little pricier than they should be especially considering quality, but if your on a budget the beer specials will definitely get you through. Speaking of budget they have a great selection of happy hour specials at great prices and a decent variety to suite almost all taste buds. It's advertised as family friendly, but personally I wouldn't bring MY kids, this place is great for catching the game, the fights, or just wrapping up your day after catching the cubs play ( yeah- if you have a little energy left it's in walking distance from the cubs spring training)"}
{"text":"I have been a regular fixture at The Woodshed I (on Baseline and Mill) since the late '80's when my \"then-girlfriend\" introduced me to the place. The wings beat everything I had before. Shortly thereafter I began to cheat on her by going to the 'Shed alone every Sunday (and/or Monday) to spend time with my new mistress- \"Thirty Hot and Grilled\" wings.   Back then it was next to impossible to get the wings Grilled. You had to argue with the bartender to grill them after they were sauced, because they didn't want to clean the grill afterwards. What the bartender didn't realize was that grilled wings were a gold mine that kept me and a mess of other customers coming for more.   Well, 25 years later, the wings are still top notch if you have one of the bartenders who have been there a long time hook them up for you (and you don't have to argue to get them grilled anymore, just remember to let them know you want them grilled when you order-lol).   Around 2006, I discovered The Woodshed II. It has a distinctly more family oriented atmosphere, so you don't have to worry about the guy in the next booth being an obnoxious drunk.-lol If you prefer more consistent table side service, This is the place for you. Although they have some preparation inconsistencies, there are at least one to two waitresses that are very attentive even on heavy \"Game\" days.  If you prefer the no frills \"Bar\" atmosphere, then The Woodshed I is the place for you. :)"}
{"text":"Decent food at amazing prices but the worst and most unprofessional service I have ever been apart of. The guy bartender is the only good and professional one there. Service is soooo slow!"}
{"text":"Great family type of bar good ac wings white russians pool tables darts and a jukebox you can go wrong! Love this place! We come visit twice a month atleast for wing sunday! I love the honey mild wings on the grill and this place has an awesome atmosphere super cozy!"}
{"text":"I came to watch the NBA finals and it wasn't crazy busy but when I walked in I wasn't greeted by any of the staff and when I asked for a table I  was told it is open seating so I found plenty of open tables but all were dirty so I had to clear my own table. Then it took the only server in the place 10 min to get my drink order that I never got so I went to the bar and placed my order and got my drink. I only got the wings and they were great! I live in the area and I will be coming back I just hope they hire another server so service is faster so I'm not eating my meal ten minutes after the game is over. Overall food was great service need some help."}
{"text":"This is a fun neighborhood bar. A friend of mine who used to live close by it took me there for appetizers and ice tea.  We now do that at least once a month.  The Woodshed reminds me of that bar from that song .... come as you are ... I love this bar.... it is fun and homey. No snobs allowed :)  Just kidding. The food isn't excellent but good enough. The combination of the people, environment, and food all compliment each other. Fun place! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great Chili Cheese fries and plenty of sports channels to pick from. Impressive shot menu as well. We'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the obvious.  This is a dive bar with a sports theme.  Nothing wrong with that.  Late night food is a plus.  Wings and jalapeno poppers were decent.  Even the beer list was decent.  Worthy stop for a late beer!"}
{"text":"Well prepared bar food, with good specials. I've never been disappointed by their 1/2 lb burger (Tuesdays) or their meatloaf w/mashed potatoes (weekends). Guinness on tap, as well as the usual domestic brands at reasonable prices. Pleasant and efficient bartenders and cook. Music volume kept at a moderate level."}
{"text":"This is a dive bar. Expect that, and you'll have fun.   I prefer Woodshed I, however both are delightfully tacky yet unrefined. Take that Hooters. This place is the real deal that you try to mimic."}
{"text":"Service is ok drinks come faster food is great for meeting up playing pool n karaoke."}
{"text":"You would think on Sunday they would have it together but yeah right? Sunday is very busy here so I don't understand why they only have one bartender & 2 servers? It's very disappointing that you like the place but to get any kind of drinks or appetizers it takes at least 20 mins. to get anything out of them? Oh and don't forget the attitude with one of the girls- you can definitely figure out which one when your there. Regardless they make great money with the men & football/baseball gig so they wouldn't care about a few girls wanting some drinks because let's face it they will get a good tip out of the men if they pay more attention to them right? That's how they acted anyway very disappointing?"}
{"text":"Food The best wings in town... Possibly the best I have ever tasted anywhere.  The reason these wings are so amazing is that you can and should get them GRILLED AND HOT OR SUICIDE, they are amazing because of the smokey grilled flavor but not because they are really spicy (which I normally love). Come for the real flavor of wings because you will not get it elsewhere.  The beer Great selection of cheep beers so choose what you like for a good price. Red hook is a good option.  Wait staff Ask for Jaime by name, she is fun and a very attentive and personable. She makes this place great even though it is surrounded by nothing in the middle of Mesa."}
{"text":"GREAT friendly staff, mostly good food, very disappointed with the fish fry, 3 overdone pieces of fish with stale French fries...10 bucks down the drain. Won't order that again...."}
{"text":"The past couple of times I've been here service has been slow, mainly because there are only 2 servers working. The food is pretty good for reasonable prices. They also have different specials for each day of the week."}
{"text":"This place been here forever. The wings are what bring me back atmosphere is Tavern like. And the service is good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite dive bars in the area. There is sports stuff all over the walls, great drink specials and daily food specials, and some of the best wings in the valley. Rick, Jeff and the rest of the staff are all super nice and the bar has a really homey feel to it. Be aware, the bar is known to be haunted and sometimes weird things happen when you are there. Sit back, order some wings, down some beers, and try not to get attacked by a ghost."}
{"text":"I started coming here lets say probably 2009...and wondered why I didn't come sooner? I came here because I always used to see their advertisement in the ASU State Press for Burger Madness Tuesday -- Burger, fries, 20oz drink/beer for $5. SCORE! The burger is huge (1/2 lb), crinkle cut fries that are nice and crisp, and yummy iced tea/diet coke. Its not an excellent burger, but that deal makes it sooo good.   As for their wings, pretty good as well. Used to be bigger wings, kind of smaller now but the hot is hot, but not dangerously so. One of my favorite places to come for wings. I also like the various appetizers like the mushrooms, zucchini, etc. On Fridays come for the fish tacos, soooo good unexpectedly.   Drinks, beers, and their house shot \"otis\" are great as well. Overall I love this place...just walk in, grab one of the magazines, and salivate till my food arrives and gorge!"}
{"text":"Had no idea this little bar was here. Really fun environment with vintage sports items throughout (hello Phoenix Suns from the 90s?!). Great happy hour drink prices, 2.50 for a vodka with cranberry and pineapple. However, was slightly disappointed with the food. We ordered the combo potato skins, and they were overly greasy but bland.   However, I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot, given the general vibe and cheap drinks. Solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"Service sucks. We only come for the wing special but they're always so understaffed even if the place is full. Takes forever to order and get your food. Some waitresses give off the bitchy vibe. They're only nice to certain people...Maybe the people who come more often than we do."}
{"text":"Waitress was a bitch..spent most her time chatting it up w the back guys, slow, they pick n choose who they add gratuity to she knew we were not to happy w her the she slaps gratuity on our check. Shady AF! Dude in charge was the same way."}
{"text":"Fun little hole in the wall neighborhood sports bar. Reminds me of Cheers! Lol. Great wings and drinks. Servers and bartenders are always super nice and pretty fast. Karaoke night is a blast when you just want a casual place to hang with friends. Great place for football season as well. They show all the games. Would've given 5 stars but they need to update their TVs in order to watch the games better. Other than that great place!"}
{"text":"Best place to be on a Sunday or Monday, buy an order of wings, get half an order free! They're wings are amazing, ranch is homemade, French fries are seasoned with seasoning salt. It is a sports bar so I mean it's not the cleanest and it definitely can get noisy (I watch all the football games here) there's 2 pool tables, a jukebox, and some golf game. There IS a dart game but pretty much all the darts are broken. Drinks are cheap and are strong but still taste good. Waitresses are friendly and try their best (it gets packed when there's games)"}
{"text":"Was denied food at 12:15am on Monday 7/14. Grill was off. A frame sign outside says food until 1am. Let it be known."}
{"text":"Great bar. Good food. Mellow people. Offset billiards room. smoking patio. Doesn't have small dicked muscle dummies walking around mad dogging people.   NOTE TO ALL BOUNCERS: Steroids and ten dollar security T-shirt will NOT keep someone from kicking your teeth out. Be the fuck polite, you fake ass Brock Lesnar worshipping douche bags."}
{"text":"It was somewhat busy and our waitress Emilee was the only one for awhile, she is very attentive, nice, and fast."}
{"text":"Great local bar, amazing drink specials, lots of sports memorabilia, plenty of TV's and the Best wings I have had in Arizona (Get em Grilled)."}
{"text":"Solid, but not GREAT. Service was average, food was average, prices are a little high but I did like their martini selection. Weird spot for a martini layout but hey, I'll take it! I'll probably head back one of these days but not in the biggest rush. If you're looking for a dive bar, this is exactly what you're going to get!"}
{"text":"Felt like I got the typical your-not-a-regular so you can wait treatment. Fine, thats expected and surely improves after a tip or two. I'm sure there are other restrooms that people can use but the main men's restroom was being renovated and offered no privacy.   The real reason I drove 20 minutes to come here was to play pinball. Knowing the nature of bar pinball machines I called ahead and asked if it was working. The lady said yes so I drove over to play. It wasn't working when I got there.  I gave them 3 because they were surprisingly busy for a Sunday evening and for some reason I thought a 2 was harsh, though a different person would have given them a one for the pinball issue alone.  I would try this place again of they fixed their pinball!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on two occasions, a Friday night and again Monday.   Friday night: Service was a little slower than I'd have liked but they did have a birthday party going on, complete with small children running through the bar. I ordered the deep fried mushrooms and fish tacos. The mushrooms were identical to those found at any supermarket. (I have some in my freezer right now) The fish tacos - I never did find the fish. They were mostly lettuce and cheese.  Monday night: Service was a little faster with about the same number of people present as Friday. I had the wings this time. Nothing special here, in fact they were a little tough/chewy. I placed my order just before the end of Happy Hour but when the bill came; I was charged full price for my first drink. I was watching the football game with 3/4 of a beer on the table when the waitress, Alyssa B., asked me to cash out because she was going to clock out of her shift. (around 8-8:30pm). I hate this. The bar probably could have made another $10 - $15 off me had I not been given the bums rush to leave and allowed to finish watching the football game. I had just started my 2nd beer. I doubt if I'll be back."}
{"text":"I walked in with a coupon Woodshed II with a coupon that was mailed to me via advertising. They have a wing special that states \"when you buy 40 you get 60 for 27.99\". I asked for the wing special and then was informed by a purple/red headed woman that the special is for dine in only. Never mind the fact it's 11:30am and the place is empty. She then began to continue to raise her voice to explain to me that the menus state that the special is dine-in only. I explained that the advertisement they use does not say that anywhere on the ad. She continued to interrupt me and scream over me. She threw my coupon back at me and asked me to leave. The cook was very cool about the misunderstanding and miscommunication and offered the deal this one time. The woman with the purple /red hair was very rude and disrespectful.  I honestly will never return and hope I can save someone else the headache of having to deal with this establishment. The only reason I gave two stars is because the cook was a good guy in a establishment that's ran by a terrible purple /red haired woman. Thanks Woodshed."}
{"text":"This is another love letter, this time to the Cheers of Arizona. This is a REAL neighborhood bar and has a small-town type of allure. Yeah, the regulars get preferential treatment... that's part of the down-home experience you get here. You'll have a great time from your first visit if you understand the atmosphere. You want the \"Regular experience\"? Wanna be AZ Norm? Fit in, have fun, you'll build cred and feel appreciated in no time. Be warned, pretentious douchbags and high-maintenance princesses need not apply. Come on in and feel at home, the food is uncomplicated greatness.  Woodshed II is where I had my first Buffalo-style chicken wings*... back in the late '80s. Damn they were good. And they are just as DAMN GOOD now! As Ash P recently said: \"Sunday or Monday, buy an order of wings, get half an order free! Their wings are amazing, ranch is homemade...\" The Sunday-Monday deal has been in place since my first visit, almost 30 years ago. The Woodshed II is the place to be during Football season.   Everything is reasonably priced, especially the alcohol. The burgers have tremendous flavor. The fries have a tasty seasoning. If you are looking for a casual pub experience on a budget, this is your place.  * I realized during the composition of this review that my first Buffalo-style wings came from J. Munchy & Co. on the North side on Southern across from Fiesta Mall. Darcie and I definitely developed an interest in wings at Muncy's. But the Woodshed II blew Muncy's tame wings out of the water soon after, such that I nearly forgot some history.  The review ends here with: Go to the Woodshed II; get some wings and beer; thank me later.  Now I'm going to regale you with my fondest memory of the Woodshed II. Back in '91 or '92, I got a call from my brother-in-law. \"I need to talk.\" He'd been the blackhole of emotional need since he'd decided to get divorced 18 months prior. No details, but he forced a situation immediately began to regret.   So, as the extended family consiglieri, I was being called to duty, yet again, so close to the previous request only a couple days prior. Ai yi yi, patience Dale. To be fair, the statute of limitations for teary-eyed whininess over poor relationship decisions is 12 months... no longer. He'd been wearing on the whole family for quite some time. Was gonna bring him a rubber band, so he could wrap it around his head and snap out of it.  So, we met at the Woodshed II and grabbed a table by the grill. We ordered wings and a pitcher of beer, cuz that's what you do. When the wings came, Bro-in-L requested some Tabasco. Strangely, the server brought the Tabasco in a ¾ filled ramekin. Maybe they only had one Tabasco bottle available at the time. Not sure. But unbeknownst to me, this random food service decision setup the final critical-mass domino in one of the most satisfying series of events in my life. It was like I could see things unfolding 10 seconds before they actually began to happen.  I remarked: \"That's a whole lotta Tabasco.\"  Bro-in-L's clinically unchecked oneupmanship effervesced to the surface with: \"I could drink that.\" I began taking inventory of the situation as I said: \"You could drink that? All of that Tabasco?\" Bro-in-L's glass was down to less than  1/2 cm of beer... if that.  \"Yeah!\" he said, eyes blazing with practiced smugness. The pitcher had about ¾ mug of beer left in it.  I drank the rest of my beer and said: \"If you drink that whole ramekin of tabasco, the bill is on me.\"  His face lit up. \"Really?\"  \"Really. I will pay the bill.\"  Bro-in-L looked down at the Tabasco, took a deep getting-in-the-zone breath. He reached for the ramekin and looked me in the eye. Another slow deep breath.  Down it went as I was pouring the remaining beer into my glass.  He looked up at me triumphantly. Tick, tick, tick. I set the pitcher down. He took notice of his empty beer glass and the pitcher returning, also empty, to the table. I began drinking my beer, as the beads on his forehead began to run together. His ears grew crimson. His jar worked, opening and closing.  I paid the bill getting to know our server. Bro-in-L spent a lot of time in the restroom.  Truly, whenever I remember this glorious day it gives my day a boost. It's a regular story at holiday dinners."}
{"text":"First time here for a friends birthday after softball and it wasn't bad, lets just say I expected way worse. I ordered the wine, which I should have known better at a dive-y sports bar like this, just don't do it. I sent the wine back and got a beer. All the food we got was good, I mean, bar food, but no complaints. My boyfriend & I split a club sandwich with sweet potato fries, yum! There's also a 6 wing & fries meal, the crinkle fries were good & homemade ranch. MMmm! I would.. maybe be back.. or should I say, if we ended up here again, I would not complain."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been coming to this bar for 9 years. We decided to return there this past Saturday night for karaoke/Woodshed reunion. We were having blast and so were most of the other patrons. A girl friend of mine and myself decided to rap Dr. Dre's \"Forgot About Dre\". It was hilarious! However after my friend rapped a verse that contained the \"N\" word (NOT \"er\" but with \"as\") the bouncer approached us and said if we continued talking like this we would be thrown out. I'm white/Italian, my friend is Cuban and the bouncer was black. Not a single patron complained or seemed to have a problem. Plus we were not at all trying to be offensive. It was the lyrics to the song! It was not starred out or bleeped, IT WAS TYPED OUT ON THE TV FOR US AND EVERYONE ELSE TO READ! If it was not appropriate then it should not be on the list of song choices. Also, why is the \"bouncer\" inside watching karaoke? Shouldn't he be at the door checking IDs?? He made us feel like crap, like we were racists. If we were black he would have not said a word! Apparently he thinks this is the 1950's and there should be a \"black and white\" list of songs. That \"bouncer\" is the real racist. We have seen much worse situations go down at this bar and that \"bouncer\" just stand around and watch, but us 2 little girls are a serious threat to that bar. What a joke. Never again. That place is disgusting anyways. We will spend our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I used to work close to here and would stop in and have a beer and the wings 2 or 3 times a week until the wings changed. They went from a full grown chicken wing to the size of a cornish game hen. Good place for a drink and sports."}
{"text":"This is a cool little bar that is too far away from...anything really. Its a bar that most people have to drive to. Most of the regulars live within walking distance and are pretty cool, for bar regulars.   The bartenders and wait staff are excellent and make me wish that going there was easier."}
{"text":"This location is in decline starting in the parking lot. The strip mall appears ready for demolition. Once you get in the restaurant everything appears to be worn out including the customers. Food is nothing unusual and if you are not a regular the service is poor. Not certain we would have ever been waited on if the regular city next to us at the bar had not needed a refill. I would go somewhere else if you have a choice."}
{"text":"Came here for burger madness. Burger, Fries, and a Beer for $6 every tuesday. Asked for grilled onions and mushrooms on my burger.  Didn't find out till my order came that they ran out of onions,  mushrooms, lettuce and tomato. Awfully plain burger but still good, and worth the price. Waitress discounted are bill 10% for the inconvenience.  I will be returning, and I will be updating this review when that happens."}
{"text":"I went here to catch a game with a friend.  There are lots of TVs and your typical dive bar patrons.  The waitress was a bit flighty.  I ordered a tuna sandwich (brave choice).  She came back to the table to ask what type of bread.  Then came back to ask if I wanted it toasted.  And finally came back to tell me they were out of tuna.  She took my friend's drink order, then came back 5 minutes later and asked if he wanted a drink.  On the brightside, it was fairly cheap."}
{"text":"We went there on a slow Wed night, the wait time for our order was a LONG TIME.  The fries came to the table (warm NOT hot) the hamburger was dry.  The chili size was so mild even the hottest sauce didn't help it, very tasteless.  Waitress dis interested in waiting on our table (not friendly at all)... Def will not go back (save yourself $$$$ go somewhere else Please.............."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here, standard bar food and drinks. They have a big menu though, so there is something for everyone here.  It's got good happy hour specials and the bartendar usually gives a decent pour too. Everyday they have a different special, my personal fav is the Tuesday night Hamburger Madness, which is 5 bucks for a big burger, a side, and an 8oz beer (or regular soda). Watch out for the upsales though. The waitress asked us if we wanted ranch on the side and we both said yes, she charged us extra for both of them. It's wasn't much, but it was annoying."}
{"text":"Nice little dive bar on Dobson  & University.. Web site says they were the first  to introduce chicken wins to the East Valley - back in 1979. So I decided to order the hot wings. The verdict? These may be the best wings in tge valley. Ten for $7.95 and on Sunday they give a half order free?! WHAAAT?! With that, they are a better value, and definitely a better quality that other local \"wing\" establishments. Add 4 beers (beer of the month, Schlitz, Coors, and Miller High Life) for $21. Nice!"}
{"text":"Great food, no frills! We love this place and voted it the best burger in town. Always relaxed. Beer is cold food is hot and my dad loved the memorabilia on the walls. I live closer to the mill ave location but go all the way to Dobson for the green Chile on my burger yum! Don't change a thing!"}
{"text":"Exactly what you want in a dive. Various types of patrons, delicious fried food and good burgers, cheap strong drinks.   -A customers of years"}
{"text":"Quite possibly my favorite bar in the valley. Love the wings. The atmosphere. Everything. Good for groups as well as a quick beer after work. Come on Sundays for wing specials or Tuesdays for burger specials.   Love this place."}
{"text":"Holy smokes!  A 5 dollar burger special on tuesdays at lunch. And its a fresh burger not some shitty costco frozen patty"}
{"text":"Went here on a sunday, had to bus my own table..and waited 30 minutes for water which never came..finally just went to the bar for service and thankfully JOE was awesome! Food and drinks are great for the price. Worst part was the waitress who was supposed to be serving us watched us bus our own table, grab our own drinks, napkins,ect. Apparently thanks to autograt our \"server\" gave no service yet we still had to tip her (alyssa b according to our receipt) although JOE was the only staff who made us feel acknowledged and welcomed. 5 stars goes to JOE unfortunately the rest of our service was barely even a 1. Thanks Joe!"}
{"text":"Great service awesome food 6$ for a Burger choice of side and a beer can't go wrong Burger cooked perfectly rare"}
{"text":"Three stars is generous. Let's be real, we come here because we live close by. The service is sub par at best, and there's always a few Rez kids running around the dining room. Every waitress looks like they're ex drug addicts and I was told today I couldn't get two different sauces on my 15 wings \"because it depends on the cook. This one is grouchy. I can have them ordered plain and have you toss them at the table in to go boxes.\" Lol. Don't come here unless you want to taste dirty tap lines and feel like your patronage is an imposition."}
{"text":"Absolutely the Best Fish Tacos on The Planet!  (No Joke!) It's a Sports Bar With a Great Bar Tender (Nicole) Love This Place!"}
{"text":"So I came her for my last guilty pleasure meal of the year. There reuben sandwich to be exact on sourdough bread with sweet potato frys for my side. My boy friend got the sourdough cheese burger with added bacon and regular frys with three sides of ranch to go.   It Was a busy night. Took about 25mins for the food to come out not bad. When it did the ranch was missing. The server came back out with only two. There pretty good sized so I didint mind that I was still missing one. One I got home I immediately tore into my Reuben sandwich.    I could tell something was off ....... There was little to no sauerkraut/ Thousand Island dressing........ Come on now that's the most important part of a Reuben sandwich. Very dissaponting. Kinda made the sandwitch dry.   One the bright side the meat was very tender and had explosive flavors that complemented the lightly grilled sour dough bread. This part what saved the sandwich.   My boy friends cheese burger was missing the bacon and side condiments- ketchup, mustard, mayo  but still was very yumi. Oooo and there ranch is home made supper good."}
{"text":"Okay, because the Woodshed II is just that kind of place- it's not getting my traditional, organized review.  One of my friends bartends here.  If not for that, I probably never would have been there.  It's a classier version of the Vine for those of you in the ASU area and a divey-er version of Hazelwoods for those of you in the Phoenix area.    They have stupid cheep pitchers, a decent on-tap selection including Red Hook, one of my favorites.  But there is one reason to go to the Woodshed (okay two... they have naughty photo hunt) GRILLED HOT WINGS.  Ask for them grilled.  Get 20, not 10.  You'll want them all.  They serve them with homeade ranch and I don't usually like ranch and am sort of adament about blue cheese with wings.  But, it works with these wings and the dressing is well made.    You'll probably get a pretty colorful Mesa local crowd but they're loyal and it's why the bartenders and servers are so great.  They're treated well and will be sweet and accomodating as a result.    Worth it for the amazing wings, cheap beer, and nice staff."}
{"text":"If you're a cheap alcoholic, this is your new haven. Soko & Lime, 1 Bud Light, and 2 pitchers of Coors Light = $14. A Long Island was less than $4. Calm your liver down, I kid you not.   It's definitely a place where there is already an established customer base and the bartenders know their names and everyone is chum with each other. If you sit at the bar, you might feel a little uncomfortable at how out of the loop you are, but they're all a pretty friendly group of old timers.   Like others have said, nothing fancy here, but when you're downing copious amounts of alcohol like there's no tomorrow, can you really tell the difference? Food is pretty cheap, especially on burger days. Sometimes, the bartenders will give you a free shot just to spruce up your evening after a day of work.   TVs galore to watch whatever game you want along with pool tables and a Lethal Weapon 2 Pinball machine to which I have donated a blasphemous amount of quarters to. If you're here for Spring Training or just need a place to getaway while your significant other is shopping nearby, try out this dive bar. All I have left to say is that after a long week, this is a great place to unwind without breaking the bank and believe me, no one is judging you here - or at least they can't because they're way more slammed than you."}
{"text":"When you don't even acknowledge your customers after being there 10 minutes. You would rather stand at the bar and talk (not busy st all)well I just go somewhere else. Happened twice both times with the same waitress.(blond) didn't catch her name because she never came to the table. Otherwise it's usually good service. Bummer because I live right around the corner. Sometimes the service is excellent but then well sometimes there's that waitress that ignores new customers. Overall prices are pretty good. Food for the most part is excellent. But so are a lot of other places"}
{"text":"Was here at the beginning of Feb for a friend's birthday gathering. Wings? Amazing. Prices are good too. A great casual sports bar atmosphere. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"So I work in the area and decided to get some takeout. I got some of wings and their Steak sandwich (Thursday special). All in all pretty good! Ton of fries with my sandwich and the sandwich was pretty good! I will be ordering from them again. They were fast too."}
