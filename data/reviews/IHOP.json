{"text":"Eating breakfast at IHOP is a perfect way to start your day. They are having an All you can eat pancake special right now. I also love there red velvet and BM chocolate chip pancakes :)"}
{"text":"The service here, is sooo bad! We were meeting family, happened to be running behind them and when we got there they were eating already, it took the waiter 20 min just to come take our drink order, another 10 min to come with the drinks and take our order...thought we were good,WRONG! After 45 min. I asked about or food& by the time they came out, approx 5-8 min later, family started leaving, and we just began eating! I will never go there again! They were packed so I could understand a little delay, but come on! 45 min to receive a few of the simplest plates on the menu, um no."}
{"text":"Joined them for national pancake day. Walked in and was lucky enough to get a table right away. Our waitress came by to offer drinks and we ordered the free pancakes at the same time. Restaurant was full with a wait growing shortly after we got sat. We started to notice tables were walking in and getting their pancakes under 5 minutes while we sat there for 20 minutes looking around. Noticed I didn't see our waitress, stopped the waiter walking by  and asked him about our waitress, when still no one came asked another waiter Ansiem for the manager. He asked how he could help and when we asked about our waitress and our order, he went straight to the kitchen grabbed our order, delivered and apologized for her leaving without notice. He continued to check in on us and made sure we were okay. Thanks to Ansiem he made our experience the best we've  had at any ihop location."}
{"text":"I called and placed an order by phone so that I will save time, pick up the food and be on my way home. When I got there, the person whom I talked with on the phone asked me again what my orders were and just put it in the system as I was repeating it to her. Long story short, they made me wait for 30 minutes because it was so busy that day. What's the point of calling ahead if you still have to wait that long? Aside from that, the quality of food served was subpar. The fruits were not that fresh. The bananas on the pancake were already turning blackish and the strawberries were already wilted. The spinach omelette I ordered was not an omelette, it's just a fried scrambled egg with blanched spinach on it. An omelette is suppose to be a scrambled egg with all the other ingredients mixed with it, before frying it. Will never be back again. Horrible food and service. I would give a negative number of star if only it's allowed."}
{"text":"Best breakfast for the money!  Great staff, great service!!  Loved the blueberry pancakes.  ;)"}
{"text":"Ordered the breakfast sampler. It was served warn, not hot and they forgot my pancakes. The food was awful, the coffee was really weak. The service was so so. The ihop here in LA it's way better. Never eating there again when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Best service of any location I've been to. Staff is always courteous, prompt and helpful. Food is, well it's IHOP. But the staff makes up for the shortcomings of the food."}
{"text":"My family and I went to this Ihop tonight after spending a rough evening at the near by hospital with a very sick loved one. It was about 1 AM, we were tired, hungry and didn't want expensive hospital food so we decided to stop by Ihop seeing as it is a 24 hour restaurant that we frequently visit in our home town. Though the food and service were nothing like we receive at home. Our waitress took our order, brought us our drinks and was never seen again until our food was delivered nearly 25 minutes later. Following that she was not seen again until we were walking out the door. But not only was the service horrible the food also looked nothing like what I have seen before. The omelettes were sad and flat with burnt toppings and the hash browns that were asked to be crispy were pale and barely cooked. We never received refills on drinks, we never received hot syrup and we had to grab silverware from other tables to even eat. Though the worst part was when we went to pay we couldn't get anyone to help us. We watched seven employees talk, eat and even stare right at us but not even budge to ring us up. Finally we caused a small scene and said if no one would help us we were leaving, which got their attention. We told them of our complaints and all that was done is a manager was brought over to us after it took 5 minutes for them to find her and she gave us $5 off of our $85 meal. We are thouroughly disappointed and even slightly angry, but one thing is for sure we will NOT be going back there."}
{"text":"As far as an IHOP goes, this is a great one. Friendly staff and nice meals. I have had lovely experiences here many times. :)"}
{"text":"Gino (aka jean machine) is up in this piece. Rolling silverware has never been more lit. He always hooks it up. Unfortunately he's not going to be there at 2 am when I truly need him. The kids say he's the old, cool dude at The Hop. Up in this hop. I agree completely. Stay lit jean machine"}
{"text":"Had breakfast there this morning. Will not go back. Prices to high. Pancakes just OK . Bacon very greasy."}
{"text":"I was very surprised at our wait time which was quoted 15-20 minutes due to the fact that the lobby was full of about 30 people, clearly not in a large group. They got sat fairly quickly, 6 tops, 4 tops and some couples and our name was called in about 10 minutes. Kevin, our waiter was very professional and kept water in our glasses the whole morning. He told us of the promotion they're having right now which I was very interested in. He recommended the cupcake pancakes I think they are called, so I agreed. Being a younger couple, he had my boyfriend and I laughing pretty much every time he checked in on us, which was often. We waited only about 10 minutes for our food and received our check without pressure so that we could go to the front and pay whenever we are ready. As very fast eaters, we usually go out for the food not the experience. Not to put down the experience of ihop, but the main reason we go is the food and service. I would recommend the stuffed French toast if you're looking for something and have a sweet tooth, and the chocolate chip pancakes are always pleasing."}
{"text":"Ate there on August 15th at 8:30pm. Not crowded service was good and the BLT was good. Good thing I did not go to the restroom before my food. Bad sewer gas smell in the Men\"s restroom. When I mentioned it to the waitress she oh yeah it's been like that, \"i said get it fixed\"  \"yeah\" from her. Paying the bill I mentioned it and the lady said we know  \" I said call a plumber\" her response \"well it's been like that \""}
{"text":"This is the best of the IHOP restaurants in the area. This location is always clean and has the most friendly staff. On my recent trip here last weekend the restaurant was relatively packed, but I was very impressed with the excellent service I received from my server even though I know he was very busy.  I got the breakfast sampler and strawberry pancakes - everything was delicious and cooked to perfection. 

I also ordered a crispy chicken salad to take home for later. They changed the lettuce from iceburg to mixed greens making it an even better salad :) I know where I am headed the next time I have a craving for a good breakfast!"}
{"text":"Have been coming to this IHOP for years and have always experienced great service, yeah sure when they get busy your drink may not get filled as quickly as you'd like it to be, so if I'm extra thirsty I'll request a Carafe to get my thirst quenched!

Tonight our server was Lidia, she has been here for a few years and like a regular she recognizes you when you walk in the door which to me adds to the whole neighborhood restaurant!

The food order was correct, and what amazes me is she doesn't write it down she memorizes the order! The food was hot and was delicious."}
{"text":"I have been here before and the service wasn't too good. They forgot about some of the stuff we ordered, but today we were not even served. We got seated but no server and a couple that got seated 10mins after us were served before us. The place wasn't even that busy."}
{"text":"Been to this place many times because Kids Eat Free and have always gotten good service and the food is always good. It's never really busy unless it's Friday night fish fry."}
{"text":"Nada mejor que un desayuno en Ihop a las 2 am. Que este 24 hs abierto es lo que lo hace tan genial! Sin dejar de lado lacomida, increibleeeee!Y la atencion de Jamal la mejor!"}
{"text":"I went there for dinner on a Saturday night with my wife,son and one other relative. We had a well mannered male server whose service is to be commended. I got a chicken club sandwich which did not taste very good. The lettuce that was on it was likely microwaved along with the chicken. I ordered fries and should have requested them without salt,which I forgot to do. Not only was there salt on them but there was way too much salt on them. I think restaurants 
should let patrons put there own salt on there food. I usually don't put salt on my food."}
{"text":"Not the freshest smelling IHOP around. Very old and broken-down looking. The cushion in my booth had a big slash across the seat, cushion filling spilling out. 

We arrived at about 2pm, ample parking and there were 2 tables filled. There was one wait staff on the floor and one kitchen staff behind the counter. 

Orders were taken after we were seated and menus given. Service was efficient and no time wasted on frivolous things like small talk. 

Food arrived quickly. Pancakes are ok. Fluffy, but dry. Strange."}
{"text":"After some months of not eating at ihop, mt wife and I decided to give it another try. I don't know why waitresses do not write down orders, especially one like ours that has several changes included. The result of not writing it down led to 5 errors in our food.
We ordered the appetizer sampler, and that came out fine. Our drinks we also correct, except that we had to ask for straws twice.
  My order was the breakfast sampler, eggs sunny side up and pancakes were supposed to be cheesecake pancakes. My eggs came out scrambled. 
My wife had the split decision breakfast. Here eggs were supposed to be egg whites with cheese, they were not. She asked for a side of dry toast...it was loaded with butter. Here pancakes were supposed to have banana and cream cheese drizzle, and they were plain. But after getting all that corrected, and now half our food cold, my wife started to eat here eggs and pulled a long black hair out of it...she has light brown hair. 
  All these errors lead to being aggravated and eating cold food. 
Why won't they just write down the order? And get it right the first time?"}
{"text":"I haven't been to an IHOP in a long time since, generally, I think their food is meh and breakfast is so easy to do at home. We stopped here (by-passing Big View Diner-which turned out to be a mistake!) and waited the 20 minutes, short for a Sunday after church on Easter. We were seated at a table that hadn't been wiped, no biggie, they were in a rush. Then I had a dirty coffee cup. Nothing was going to stop me from having a nice brunch, asked for a clean one and got it. A different server brought us our omelets and as she reached across the table, spilled an entire large glass of OJ on my husband and daughter. Cleanup ensued, with the manager apologizing and offering us extra napkins. We ate our luke-warm omelets and asked for our sides of hashbrowns which had been forgotten in the drama. After getting our full bill and being asked how our breakfast was, we recounted the trouble to be told we had \"an exciting breakfast.\" Hmmm, for the typical IHOP bland offerings, I will not go here again. I don't need the \"excitement\" and they clearly don't care enough to make sure I come back."}
{"text":"Me and my mom went to IHOP tonight Bernadette was very accurate great customer service our order was accurate food was hot fast service"}
{"text":"These are not good people the manger Johnathan smokes weed. Most of the employees are on drugs. The service is slow because most people who work there are hight drunk an don't care. They had good work that they got rid of. This isn't a family friendly place. All they want is your money an tips. You will get bad service an not so good food don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Worst Service:
We were there for lunch today. It was very crowded as it is easter Sunday. But the staff was definitely not able to manage the crowd. The person at the counter looked new. He wasn't even nice to the customers. He did not bother to ask our name for waiting list. We had to ask him for everything. We felt it was the worst service. We are regular customers here. But never had such a bad service. They should be better prepared for Holidays or Sundays. We are enjoying our lunch in another restaurant now :-)"}
{"text":"Okay, let's get the not-so-good part over with. Yes, driving along the highway you do not get the sense you are in an upscale neighborhood. Yes, the place needs to be refurbished. Yes, the rest rooms need some TLC. But, and this is a big but (one \"t\" folks!) the attitude, friendliness, and attentiveness of the staff we encountered more than made up for the buts. Our server, Chris, did an excellent job and made our morning with his cheerfulness. The manager, Chymia, obviously practices my old philosophy, MBWA. For the uninitiated, this means Management By Walking Around. Get off your butt (two \"t\"s) and see what is going on.

If you are in the area, be sure to give this place a try. It was quite an experience."}
{"text":"This Ihop is the best. We go in after 10 pm at least once a week and the server Clayton is fantastic."}
{"text":"horrible service. Bad attitudes from the waitresses. No one helped us we had to raise our hands. Didn't get orders right. Very rude. Waiting for such a long time for only drinks. Never coming back. Would not recommend this IHOP."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant this morning arriving at 633am. Sign on the door says they open at 6am.  Everything locked up, no one answered the phone.  As I was leaving, a worker walked up from the leaking lot and apologized.  She had been there since 530a waiting but still no manager to open up.  Ridiculous!  So I ended up at Waffle House!"}
{"text":"The staff were good and paid attention to the tables. It took awhile for the food to get here but that was expected on a Sunday morning. However two of the orders at my table were messed up I asked for the banana foster brioche and got a couple slices of banana. So that was kind of upsetting. And we asked for cheese on hash browns and the first time didn't get it. The second time they put it on the eggs. And finally on the third time we got it right."}
{"text":"The food is awfully made. My French toast was poorly made and soggy. I feel like this is a disgrace to all breakfast restaurant. OH.. did I include the waiter was taking her time delivering our food. I do not recommend this place for you breakfast lovers. It did not reach my satisfaction. The chicken strips was very disappointing and especially cold because our waiter totally forgot about us. It wasn't busy and they still didn't have the audacity to apologize. She also did not give us the check so we were waiting for hours. I don't think I would come back here."}
{"text":".Horrible service. It was  if they were doing us a favor
Don't  they understand we are paying their salary."}
{"text":"This is by far, my favorite location.  Although I have moved into the far north-valley, I still make a trip here several times a month.  The service is great, the food is consistently good, and I am always treated as a valued guest with each visit."}
{"text":"I've only been here after 2AM, but the food and service has always been great!  The late-night staff is definitely the main reason why we come here."}
{"text":"Excellent server, excellent food, clean.  My complaint is with the manager, corporate and poor communication.

Received the annual free birthday breakfast email and looked forward to the Rooty Tooty Fresh and Fruity breakfast that I have had for years.  Hubby goes with and orders the same thing plus we order coffee and juice, so we pay for 3 drinks & 1 breakfast.

It is our fault for not noticing that they had changed the offer to the Rooty Pancakes, I admit.  We didn't bother to look at the menu (which had changed, of course).  We just told our server we would have \"two of these\", showing her the birthday offer.

When the food arrived, it was four pancakes (which I would never order) topped with blueberry for me and peach for hubby.  When that was all that arrived, we asked our server and she said they had changed and this is what they provide as they no longer have the RTFF on the menu.  She was sweet, but didn't offer to make any changes.

Imagine our shock when the bill arrived and it was almost $25!  The four pancakes with a scoop of cooked fruit topping was $7.59 for each plate, our coffees were $2.29 each and hubby's orange juice was $2.79.  Of course, they took off one of the $7.59 charges as it was the birthday special.  However, if we had ordered the senior menu which did have the rooty tooty fresh & fruity, we would have gotten what we expected and paid a total of $17.

I asked the manager and her only comment was that she was sorry and they had changed the birthday offer about 6 months ago.

My suggestion to both corporate, to this manager and possibly the wait staff.  Take the extra step to try to let your special customers know that the offer has changed.  If that happened, we would still be rating IHOP with a 5, instead of a 3.

To our family and friends that know that my love for IHOP has been legendary for almost 60 years, I still love IHOP, but encourage you to not assume that things are the same and just read the menus!  :)"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday real busy got seated right away got our order taken right away great food real friendly staff we will come back."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE AND MANAGEMENT!!!! We waited for over an hour to get our food and when we did it was cold. The manager said that comping our meal would be unreasonable."}
{"text":"BEST RESTAURANT EVER. The time limit for waiting for the food is incredible, especially for drinks, you order it and they bring it out 2 seconds. Order any food you want for low price and deliciousness. I love IHOP!!!"}
{"text":"Lunch on 12/31 at 2:15 pm.  I was seated promptly......and that was the highlight.  Waited 20 yes TWENTY minutes before anyone came to my table. What does the waitress ask me? You ready to order?!?!. Excuse me no one has even taken my beverage request. Her response: 'sorry. You ready to order?' It was NOT busy in the restaurant but overall their customer service has declined significantly in the past year.  No suggestions, no going over the specials, soups of the day or anything.  At this point I am too angry and hungry to spend my money here.  I settle on a hash brown and smoked sausage.  I decided not to bother with a meal or entree. I deserved better service and refused to invest into a full meal considering the staff wasnt interested in actually serving customers that day."}
{"text":"IHOP is a national pancake chain, serving pretty much exactly what you would expect. None of the food is outstanding, but I've never had bad food there either. I usually get either the buttermilk pancakes or the strawberry banana pancakes. The hash browns are typically crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, which is why I keep coming back. I could make the pancakes, but I have never been able to get my hash browns right.

They also serve lunch and dinner food, but I've never had any urge to have it. If you want diner food, there are better places.

My biggest fault with this IHOP is the service. I don't expect anything spectacular, but I sat almost 5 minutes before the waitress came to get my drink order. Then she never checked on me after bringing my food. Again, nothing major, which is why I'm still giving them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow in the beginning but food came out fast and server was super friendly.  Will go back!"}
{"text":"I've never had a problem with the in restaurant service. BUT if you are looking to do a to go order prepare to wait a ridiculous amount of time. 30+ minutes AFTER placing your order, I've already been waiting 38 minutes after being told over the phone that the order would be ready in 10 minutes. When I arrived they hadn't even started making my food. I like this location but I would NEVER order to go service and I definitely wouldn't recommend it anyone else."}
{"text":"Look somewhere els . This is not the right ihop branch  have your breakfast or dinner in. Wake up ihop ."}
{"text":"Generally, I like IHOP for a quick, generous, plain meal. 

Not this branch.  It advertises right up front: \"Family owned and operated.  No coupons or discounts accepted.\"  That sets the tone. 

Once your server has taken your order and (maybe) delivered it correctly, you're on your own if you want to attract her attention again -- even through the place is usually three-quarters empty.  Surly, unpleasant, uncaring attitude from the top down.

At other IHOPs, I sub extra salsa for sour cream on my southwestern-style omelets.  Never a problem.  Here, they hit you an extra charge.   

No point complaining to the manager.  It's \"family owned,\" remember? You think they're going to fire mom or sis? Dream on. 

Better yet, stay away.  There are PLENTY of other restaurants in that area, and every one of them is better."}
{"text":"Sort of a stale aroma when you first walk in. The service staff seems only mildly interested in being there. Have invariably been welcomed to a wet and semi-sticky table-top on every visit. Be ready for some serious calories here."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with my girl and it was nice, i had a great server who wasnt shy to smile and joke which i can appreciate being a fellow positive minded human being, the food was decent no different than most i hops i guess it might have been served quicker than most cause it was pretty hot but i enjoyed this visit."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant.  Management and service is outstanding.  Food is very well prepared. I recommend this IHOP."}
{"text":"I went there for breakfast yesterday.  I ordered bacon and eggs with crisp hashbrowns.  Apparently  they do not know what crisp means. But orders were not crispy
The bacon was not cooked as ordered
  I spent $14.00 on was should have been a 2.99 or 3.99 breakfast.  This was terrible needless to say I will not be returning. Many other places with much better food AT MUCH BETTER PRICES."}
{"text":"Finally, a pancake place to fill the gap left by The Original Pancake House after they left the Hilldale area."}
{"text":"Food came late, and my pancake ended up having a hair in it. The waiter took it back got me new ones with new utensils, however the fork was very dirty. No other accommodations were made."}

food was too good 
service was friendly
again the food was AMAZING!!
ill be back!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a waffle and lingonberry sauce.  The waffle came out lukewarm at best, and the lingonberry \"sauce\" was just lingonberries in a nearly frozen piece of butter.  This came after waiting nearly 40 minutes.  We were served coffee and juice quickly, but then it was 40 minutes before we saw any food."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this location due to previous low ratings however I was pleasantly surprised. It was a bit crowded which is expected for a Saturday afternoon but we were seated within 5 mins. Server was prompt and friendly. The food came out fast and was good especially the red potatoes. They were seasoned to perfection. Dont let the ratings fool you try it for yourself. Will be back again!!"}
{"text":"We came here to eat breakfast. Me & My sister family. Everything was good. The waitress was  friendly. The food was great. Right when we where we're going to pay at the register. The cashier check out lady name Melissa just had the worst service. She would talk like a robot. Like if she didn't like her job. I didn't even wanna leave a tip anymore. But it was not the waitress fault. So o still left a tip"}
{"text":"This place is trash, waiter 30 minutes for our order to be taken then waited another hour and the waiter came to our table and said. The cook told me to tell you that we are going to do the smaller tables first so it's going to be a little bit. This was after waiting an hour."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service from the manager Apolinar and the waitress Maria !! Very unpleasant experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast at this location today. The wait was reasonable and we got seated in a decent amount of time. Service was fine however I had to ask multiple times for refills as my sever was really busy and kept forgetting. Not her fault as I have been there before too but I paid $2.50 for a Pepsi and got only one glass and a bunch of ice. The food came out in a decent amount of time as well but it wasn't anything to rave about. The bad part was when it came time to pay the check. You have to walk to the front and take care of the bill yourself, which isn't too much of a hassle, however there was no cashier and the line was about 6 people long. Took me 10 minutes just to pay what I owed and get out of there. Overall there wasn't anything too bad, but nothing too good either, and that is why I'm only giving 3 stars."}
{"text":"Service: 
Excellent and efficient. We arrived at lunch time and were seated right away, even with a full restaurant! Our waitress brought our drinks and took our order within a few minutes. Great service!

Food: 
Delicious! I had the garden omelette (must try!) and one of their famous pancakes (also great, even if I'm not a pancake lover). 

Price: 
Reasonable. 

Ambiance: 
Family, cozy, homey."}
{"text":"It was nice and quiet when we arrived at 9:30am on Sunday.  We were seated promptly at the booth by the window with no wait at all.  Place seems clean and calm, with no music playing.  Perfect to start a peaceful Sunday breakfast.  We ordered the Strawberry Banana French toast and harsh brown/eggs/sausage links combo with pancakes.  It took a while for the food to come out although it didn't seem busy.  I have no complain though since we were simply enjoying the quiet time.  There are Starbucks price of coffee, however gas station coffee quality, simply says overpriced.  When we left at 10ish, the place was already packed, and wait line had already formed."}
{"text":"Worst IHOP in the state of Arizona!!!! If you want to eat food with HAIR in it and deal with a rude incompetent mgr....then this is the place for you. I'm DONE!"}
{"text":"Best place in Gilbert for breakfast.  Food was great and service was superior.  Thanks"}
{"text":"Great food, great people.   I always have special orders and they made it just right.  Pancakes were fluffy and tasted perfect.   Staff was friendly and helpful.  For a brand new location it was perfect."}
{"text":"Place smelled like smoke was very dirty even though there was only 3 seated tables . A long wait to be seated and pay ticket only ate two bites of my omelet and found a Chunk of wood the omelet tasted like a smokers mouth my coffee jar was cold and stale. -10 stars"}
{"text":"I love ihop food but just not this location the bathrooms smell disgusting you can smell them all the way out, service a little slow!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon and was surprised that it was not busy...went with husband and 2 grandkids. First... the coffee me and my husband ordered and received was terrible! I had to dose it with a lot of sugar to make it drinkable. The kids enjoyed their chocolate milk and juice though which is a good thing. Second... the wait was long for our food and the food was not anything I would come back for but once again the kids didn't complain and seemed to enjoy it! As we headed to the register to pay I noticed they charged us for the kids which is supposed to be free. But they deducted the price once I brought it to their attention. But as we patiently waited to pay I observed how grimy the floors were and how disarray and dirty the register and front kitchen area was. I now understand why it doesn't get busy there. As we received our new bill I was still amazed that it was still a lot of money for what we thought the meals were not worth the price but the grandkids still enjoyed it. I do have to say that our waitress was friendly but lacked to refresh our coffee and kids drinks."}
{"text":"IHOP is very inefficient when it comes to ordering to go orders. First, while ordering on the phone, I had to speak to 3 different people before I could place an order. The person on the phone took my number down when my order was placed and I was given an arrival time. Upon arrival there was no evidence of an order being placed after speaking to a few more people. The manager at the time did not offer an apology nor did they try to accommodate me in making my order any easier. The customer service at this IHOP is poor and there needs to be more training involved when employing managers and other workers."}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast at 4pm with family! According to my mom, this is one of the better branches of IHOP in the north. 

When we arrived, it was practically empty; perhaps only two other tables seated. Food tasted great, which I was worried about prior to our visit, since my last experience at a different IHOP was an average one. 

Service here was exceptional. Our server was extremely helpful and friendly! A really sweet older gentleman... My cousin arrived a bit late, and he kept offering to reheat his food since it came out early. 

Overall atmosphere was good. I don't like crowded places, especially loud ones when trying to eat, so I enjoyed the emptiness (maybe since it was 4pm?). It was also very clean here. They played older 50-80's music in the background, so it was pretty relaxing and brought a few laughs to our table.

I don't really like breakfast family restaurants, since I usually enjoy cooking this kind of food at home, but I definitely recommend this place if you just want to get out of the house and still have a great breakfast. Five stars to this IHOP!"}
{"text":"The other reviews for this branch aren't that great, but I had a generally positive experience eating breakfast here this afternoon. 

I usually just go with one of the breakfast combos, because I like a little bit of everything. Today I got a belgian waffle combo with scrambled eggs, sausage links, and buttered toast. The waffle was great and the toast was really yummy. The rest were pretty standard. The last time I ate here, I got pancakes and they were a bit gross. 

No major complaints about the service. There was only one server, and not many customers so I didn't notice any long waits.

The only thing that bothered me was the water. It was disgusting. I have a thing against restaurants that serve nasty water, making me wonder where they even get it from.

I've been here a couple times within the last few years, so my feelings here are a bit mixed. Today was the best experience of them all, so I was glad for the slight improvement. 

There are better IHOPs around town, but I'll give four stars for my pleasant experience today."}
{"text":"Awesome waitress late night. Memorized our order... Got it down to a T.. And super nice."}
{"text":"When I walked into the building, I was expecting great food, friendly waiters/waitresses and and friendly atmosphere, and when I walked out, I was happy, full and in a very good mood. It went far beyond my expectations. It was everything I had expected and more. It was a very friendly, comfortable atmosphere. Everything felt exceptionally friendly and comfortable inside of the restaurant. I had the smokehouse, and the sausage was phenomenal and full of flavor. The pancakes were also very good and fluffy, just the way I like them. Our waitress was very friendly and constantly checking up on us, catering to our every need. I'll admit, it was a bit on the pricey side.... okay, it was VERY PRICEY (each breakfast costs more than $10 a piece), but I think it was worth it. I wouldn't come here every day at such high prices, but I think it would be fine as an occasional stop (celebrations, random lazy mornings.) If you are ever visiting here, like I am, or if you live here and are looking for a quick bite to eat, full of flavor, I would definitely suggest eating here. My compliments to the chef!"}

{"text":"I just realized why we haven't eaten in this place for a while.  For a very slow Saturday night, the service was less than stellar as well as the meals served.  My husband's meal had hair, my son's order was wrong and so was mine.  The manager came over and apologized, gave us a discount.  However, my husband had lost his appetite then and we just wanted to get done and leave.  We will not dine in this IHOP again.  Disappointing!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst dining experience I've had in a long time. My soup came out cold, our server forgot our drinks, and they just microwaved it to warm it up and it literally over cooked everything in the soup. Never going back but hey I guess that's what I get for not ordering pancakes."}
{"text":"I had the Toasted Marshmallow Hot Chocolate and Roasted Chicken Noodle Soup. Weird combination, I know. Both were excellent."}
{"text":"It  Only Took About 15~20 MIns To be Seated for 4 people  even though the Place was Packed like Sardeines . Well We were seated and were ignoerd for about 5~10 Mins than the waitress came took the Drink Orders Then never came back for like 5~10 min than the assisant manager was walking by FAST we said Politely \" Excuse us we R Ready to Order . and Totaly IGNORE like she Pressed A Facebook Button . Than The Prices were like going to A fancy Restrant .than after 15~20 Mins we decide to get up and get GOING than right from rising they come with the drinks and when we walked away They gave the rudest Smurk and i forgot the head waitress rolled her eyes after telling her we were ready to Order  this was after one of the 2 assisant Managers IGNORED US ! Well every one was starring at us in Suprize or something and the 2nd assiant manager and the Manager/ Boss Whatever came to us and said we r sorry we will knock off 50% your Bill . Well a few of my family members said NO . Thanks and walked out . Thats the story ! :) :("}
{"text":"It takes awhile to get a seat, even if it's not busy. And every time I go there I pay with debit and on top of the tip I leave them they take an extra 10%, no matter how large the bill is."}
{"text":"this restaurant doesn't even deserve one star. I had the worst customer service I have ever had today. one of the host shoved my friend out of the at didn't even say sorry or excuse me. our waiter was so rude. she came to check on us once maybe twice. our drinks were refilled one time when she could've came and done it many times. when we called to complain about our service, we had asks to speak to the manager & he was so rude to us also. I haven't never had management be so rude to me over the phone. I do not recommend going to this place if you want good customer service."}
{"text":"Came here lit af just wanted some pancakes. Open 24 hours from Friday to Sunday it's 1:37 am Friday explain this to me. Free gucci"}
{"text":"Great service. Food was to order, hot and delicious.  Place was clean. The only reason it didn't warrant five stars is price.  No one wants to spend $30 for a breakfast for two unless it's at a vacation destination.  IHOP on Independence in Charlotte doesn't qualify."}
{"text":"Poor service, cold food. We went late mothers day. They seem to have issues with retaining quality staff. We looked at dirty tables through our entire meal. My girlfriend finally picked up the crayons on the floor before someone slipped on them. They claimed to be busy but including our table there were only 6 tables occupied. My guess is just lack of experience and disorganized staff. They did not seem to be worried that we were using a 20 dollar coupon from a previous bad experience. I will say the food was acceptable but got cold fast as they keep the restaurant quite cool. Were not expecting a lot from  chain operation but it needs improvement on the service side. It took a good five minutes to wave down someone to bring me maple syrup for my french toast, I was working on eggs and hash browns but by the time I received the maple syrup the french toast was cold, hoping the warm syrup would help it just did not matter I was hungry and ate cold french toast. My girlfriend was pleased with her meal she had a dinner selection and a salad. When you are hungry and it's late you end up going in not expecting much."}
{"text":"Disorganized. They do kit seat people as they come in. Rude. Better to go to Mcdonalds."}
{"text":"We went  around 2ish in the afternoon place was dead, and the service was so bad.....  he was inordinately slow and never checked back I had to get up and go find him to get our check. I know the food is standard corporate hard to mess up but it was bad. Sloppily prepared, missing the fries just no attention. Management needs to step up their game."}
{"text":"When I come with my friend for early morning breakfast and meeting, we are greeted by the sweetest waitress who really takes good care of us and we joke with her like good friends. The food is great and we are regulars here."}
{"text":"IHOP is the best and one of the few places to eat after 11. Staff is always friendly. The place is always clean and I've never had a problem with the food. One time I ordered an omelet and because i didn't care to read the description I didn't realize there was ham in it. I can't eat ham so I apologized a thousand times and ordered it without ham fully expecting to pay for both omelets. To my surprise they were very nice and understanding about the whole thing, they gave me the new omelet for free. Needless to say I left a well deserved generous tip."}
{"text":"For starters the soda was served straight outta a two liter bottle.I had the crepes which were spongy and i had to keep asking the waitress for our missing food. Very disappointing I will not recommend or be coming back to any ihop."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and was leery, but we had a gift card to use and not many Ihops in our area. Went at breakfast time and it was very busy. Hostess sat us quickly. Server was very pleasant and efficient. Our breakfasts came quickly. Classic breakfast crepes were good, while the Pumpkin pancakes were excellent."}
{"text":"Probably the worst managed establishment I have ever been too. The manager was rude And mean because of the number of people our group had. We came after a practice to grab breakfast. You would think she would be happy we brought so much business.  The red head manager immediately got upset that we did not \"call ahead\" even though we were the only people in the restaurant. My bad, I didn't think I had to make a reservation for IHOP. After we were seated she continued being rude and making faces while mumbling under her breath. The only waiter working was awful. He yelled over all of us when trying to figure out his own mistakes. Some food was right but most had one problem or another. A few didn't get food until everyone else was done and leaving. Honestly I have never been so appalled at an establishment in my life. Maybe if this place got a new manager and staff it would be okay. But for now I'm never returning. I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Don't come here at night! They take to long. The eggs were watery and the bacon undercook. Also dont be here around 6-8am they take forever and forget your food!! Worse service ever."}
{"text":"Very tasty food.  Extremely pleasant employees.  Great check-ins through the meal and the drinks didn't go dry."}
{"text":"OK food. Inexpensive. Always a breakfast crowd.   Service is horrible.  Or at least our server was.

We were eventually helped by a different server and Rose was awesome!"}
{"text":"4 stars BC it's better than the other rundown ed IHOP. Plus the server Alli was very quick and helpful. I wish there were more like this. Even the restroom was clean and new. It was busy Christmas eve."}
{"text":"Great place for food .. i lived in calif and moved here a year ago . They are better than ihop i use to go to there.."}
{"text":"screaming/wild children running thru isles causing safety concerns for other guests. what the hell happened to parental discipline???  if u like being at a zoo this is for u.  never will i go there again!!!"}
{"text":"BEST IHOP I HAVE EVER BEEN TO by far. Candi, our server, was amazing. I asked for water with lemon ( I love extra lemons) I didn't even have to ask and she put at least two in each glass that she promptly refilled just before I needed it. She didn't seem irritated one bit by the fact that we took a while to look over the menu. Candi was all around a great server.The greeter/host which I'm assuming was the manager by the way he was dressed was very friendly and welcoming as was the rest of the staff. GREAT service, especially for an Ihop at one in the morning. Will be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"I am very familiar with this area, and although it is the not the best, I like this IHOP ok. My food in the morning tends to be fresher than at night for dinner. Since breakfast is my meal of choice, I almost always order breakfast. Not to fond of their dinner choices, although that would be an unfair judgement since I rarely order it. I didn't like the fact that when I went in for an early morning breakfast, the waiter charged me for my coffee, but when I was in their the week prior the waitress didn't. That was bothersome to me, however didn't warrant me making a comment about it until now. I do not have a problem paying for my coffee, but if that's the case, charge me for it every time or not at all. As far as the service goes, the waiters and waitresses rarely communicate with you and you are pretty much left to fend for yourself. They are not friendly at all, no matter how friendly you are to them. Then again I go there to eat, not make friends. They could all benefit from a good seminar to teach them about customer service. Overall, it was an ok experience, but the food is definitely better than the service."}
{"text":"Shame on me for going back to this place.  I have had nice servers, but horrible service 5 out of 5 times now.  This is the last time. This afternoon we walked in and waited to be seated.  The hostess just stared at us (no greeting, no hello) until a server came and told her to seat us at a table.  She then takes us the room that's in the front by the patio and proceeds to seat us at a dirty table. She starts to walk away and I have to ask her to clean the table.  How is it ever ok to seat a customer at a table that has food and syrup all over it???  We would have just moved to a clean table, but every single table in there was filthy except the one that someone was actually eating at.  Our server came immediately for drink orders.  He was very friendly.  We knew what we wanted to so we ordered drinks and food.  He takes our order and leaves for 30 minutes until he brought the food.  We had to ask for our drinks that we ordered and never got, cutlery, napkins, ketchup and hot sauce.  Then he left never to be seen again.  No offer for iced tea refills or check to see if we are ok, just the check when I can manage to flag him down.  The food was hot (thank goodness or I would have lost it) and edible.  However, corporate at IHOP really, really, really needs to work on this location or just shut it down.  All of my 5 experiences have been this bad.  The place was not even busy. Where is the manager?  Why is he/she not bussing tables and helping out?  We just cannot go back."}
{"text":"I ordered the sampler and did not receive half of the meat. When I called I Hop to inform them of their mishap they stated that they would send a gift card. I have yet to receive the gift card and will not return to this location."}
{"text":"I am giving this place NO STAR NOT ONE STAR not for the food but for the service.   The food is ok.  I love Ihop. They have always been my place for breakfast.   But this location SUCKS!!!  Management needs to understand that their customers come here  to eat their breakfast in peace.  Not to listen to screaming kids running around them.  Much less parents not taken responsibility for their children.   I can understand if it is a one time deal.  But it has happened on multiple occasion.  I have children of my own and they were shocked and upset that the noise was so loud that we left in the middle of our meal.  When we our getting crawled on by other children while we eat,I draw the line and management should of as well.  I would hope management would realize you are going to lose customers if you continue this practice."}
{"text":"My dad and I went here for his birthday (his choice lol!) on 5/11, arriving around 9pm. Every time I eat at this Ihop the servers have been polite and courteous, while the food is always what you expect from a quality Ihop (believe me, not all Ihop's are of good quality!). This review is mainly to speak highly of our server, I believe her name was Crystal. On this particular night her performance alone warranted a highly positive review. She was really the only one working the front and it was getting busy but her customer service was friendly and outstanding throughout. One simple instance was when my dad asked one of the guys who worked there for the wifi password so he can log on with his iPad. I don't know if the guy was actually supposed to be a server or just cleaning tables, but he didn't know the password and said he would go get it for my dad. But for the next few minutes as he went back and forth from the kitchen area to front, he would only look at my dad without saying anything. All we could think of was \"What's his problem?\" Lol! My dad gave up on him. But the next time Crystal was able to come by our table, right away she was able to tell my dad what the password was! Unfortunately it turned out there was a party of four young people who went in planning to eat and leave without paying. It was 3 males and a female, all probably late teens-young adult, sitting at the booth closest to the exit. The female left as soon as she was done eating, apparently to start the car. After a while all I could hear was Crystal saying loudly that she's going to call the cops. When I looked up and over to the exit, I saw Crystal follow the 3 males as they started running out the door. She went outside apparently to get a look at their car's license plate # (great job Crystal!).  When I asked her, she told me that she did get the plates and was able to inform the police. 
This young lady Crystal exemplified everything you want in a worker."}
{"text":"Went to eat some pancakes this morning and of course being a Sunday it was very busy. We had to sit outside because they had called our name and we didn't show so longer wait. We sit outside, order drinks and food but it took about 30 minutes to get our food. Our food finally arrives but they forget my husbands food. We thought maybe they're still making it but they forgot because we asked what was taking so long and turns out his food was just sitting there. Very frustrating. Didn't bring us syrup or ranch for my food until very late. Our waiter was very bad charged us wrong and wouldn't let us settle the ticket up at the front desk. Never going there again honestly I'll just stick to Denny's."}
{"text":"Do NOT eat here. Just don't. The place was filthy, and not just bc they had been busy. The WALLS were streaked with dried food and syrup from sticky fingers, there was a dessicated fry in the seat crack of my booth that had been there for at least several days, and the floor was...gross. The vinyl on the seats was all cracked and sticky, too.

Service was REALLY slow. We missed my niece's vball tournament bc we couldn't get good service. And the food was subpar: undercooked onion rings, overcooked burger, soggy fish sandwich. And did I mention it was filthy. Go eat at McD's"}
{"text":"It took forever to get a waiter, we had to get silverware ourselves. The food arrived late and was cold."}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service. You won't be greeted when you come in. You catch attitude as if it's not their job to serve you. The food was just okay. Don't waste your time"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places! The staff is always so nice and the food is great especially the stuffed French toast!"}
{"text":"Very slow service, even though the place was not busy. I expect average food when I go IHOP, but when average food is served cold, it is below average. And we waited a long time for it.  Our waiter completely disappeared so when we needed more water halfway through the meal we didn't get it. This was our second visit to this location in the last year with a similar experiences.  We will be scratching this IHOP location off our list."}
{"text":"If you want super slow service, Luke warm food, forgetful waitress, bugs in your water....you've found your restaurant!"}
{"text":"Was just in there for 15 minutes without even getting someone at our table to ask us for drinks. There were other tables being taken care of but we just kept getting overlooked. Horrible service won't go back."}
{"text":"Walked in to no music playing....have to create a vibe guys!  Restroom facilities dated. Friendly service, hot coffee, good food."}
{"text":"Jammed up in here. Sat us immediately with a booth. Made all substitutions and hot coffee! Lady had a finger condom on...well played!"}
{"text":"This is 2nd time have went there and out of the 2 Tim's had same thing happen
No managers visited the table, they ask that on the site
Both times wasn't busy
The waitress booth barely came around, this time we asked for refills and had to ask again when she came back and didn't have them
People that came in 20+min after us got food at same time, we're the cooks out back smoking weed
Some of food was cold
Last time when made a complaint they sent me a gift card and expected it would have been the amount of money we wasted there but was bout half, 2nd time bill being over $40 and if they going to send something I hope it's not another gift card for half the cost of what as spent"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed.  We went for a late night dinner around 10pm.  My husband and I split the combo breakfast with an English muffin on the side.  The eggs and hashbrowns were ok. We ordered sausage and got bacon.  My husband decided to keep the bacon.  The bacon was way over done as if it had been sitting around a while. Definitely not freshly made. The pancakes didn't taste right. They looked golden brown on the outside, but, after eating half, I realized I was tasting raw pancake batter.  The English muffin seemed like it was not toasted. It was hard and rubbery like it was stale.  To top it all off, the orange juice my husband ordered was watered down...a lot.  Not sure if it is the night crew that has the problem, but we will definitely NOT be going back at any time."}
{"text":"I WAS ROBBED, and not at gunpoint but rather at the register. Steer clear of this place if you have children. They just charged me $29 for breakfast for one adult, child and infant. I wanted to run out without paying my bill. They are crooks. I asked for the kids French toast and could they substitute the bowl of fruit instead if bacon and sausage, she could not. There are no prices on kids menu, so I said to add a bowl of fruit. The tiny bowl of fruit with half an orange and 4 bits of cantaloupe was same price as kids meal. My children did not like the pulpy orange juice, in tiny cups which came to $4. The only reason I gave one star is due to the bacon omelet was good and they made a substitution for spinach. It was also 90+ degrees while we ate, I was sweating. When I complained to staff...nothing was done. Horrible...if you want to get robbed...go to IHOP"}
{"text":"Efrain was great.  I got yelp just to leave this review because he was working his butt off."}
{"text":"No communication, no management, no hospitality, no common sense. A madhouse filled with disappointment. 

Don't bother with the horrible service. Me and my boyfriend arrived around 1130 sat morning. We were seated immediately. It took quite a while for anyone to great us after that. One lady took our drink order, and left. Another lady tried to take our drink order, but we said someone had already helped us. Lady one came back with our beverages, as lady two showed up at our table again. With drinks in front of us, she looked us dead in the eyes and asked us what we would like to drink. We both looked at her surprised, but she shook it off as an accident, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt. 

After two rounds of refills were consumed, the waitress told us our food was coming right out. Another 30 mins later, four people had been seated afterwards, and they had all gotten their orders, and we had still yet to have ours. 

We left, without eating, ignored, and dissatisfied. I don't recommend that place to anyone."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!! No matter how busy they are they always give great service!"}
{"text":"I have been here a total of three times and every time it has been a bad experience. The first time I got the wrong order and the ticket time was an hour and a half. The correct meal finally came out to me a half an hour later. I gave them the benefit of the doubt because it was a bit busy. The second time the waitress took my order, gave me my drink, and walked past me several times. My food was taking longer then it should of have been, my waitress ignored me, and I noticed costumers who where seated after me where getting their food. I sat there for about 45 minuets before I went to ask my waitress when my food was going to be ready. With a blank stare on her face she said, \"It should of been out already.\" Then she looked at her tickets. Turns out she forgot all about my food. I left, because not only did she ignore me, but no apology was issued. I decided to give this restaurant one last chance. My waiter was unprofessional and inattentive. There where only two other tables for him to tend to and I rarely saw him at any of them. Almost an hour passes, so I ask about my food and he tells me it is coming right out. another 30 minutes go by, I ask again, same response. I then hear a plate break in the kitchen. He then comes out and tells me its going to take a little longer because there was an accident in the kitchen. I should of left right there and then, but I decided to stay due to good company. Another 25 minutes pass and I finally see my food. The food here isn't bad, well except my last meal. (My soup tasted awful. Expired.) It's the staff that makes this restaurant what it is, a horrible dinning experience! The staff is inattentive, unprofessional, and well, they just don't care. The few times I have been to this restaurant it was dirty. (Floors, tables, and bathrooms.) The wait time was poor, the food was over priced, and there where no mangers on shift to address any of the issues. Save yourself the headache and the trouble, just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Three adults and three kids. All got breakfast food and it took 35 minutes for the food to come out. When we ordered there were only three tables that were ahead of us and two were already eating. Seems like there is no manager that we can see and the waitresses appear to be having a great conversation because that's all there pretty much doing. Sorry to say once every three years is our limit. Wish we would have looked at yelp before we stopped!"}
{"text":"I went into this location today and I have never had an omelette as delicious as the one I got here. My server was absolutely adorable and had amazing customer service skills. If you love IHOP and want a great experience definitely go to this location. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Very very very slow!!!!!  

Had to call twice to make an order for pickup, and when finally got through waited on the phone for 15-30 mins. before hanging up!

Is inexcusable how slow and trifling this branch is!"}
{"text":"I've never felt the need to write a review but I have to now. We came in this morning for breakfast, as I'm looking through the menu there is a dead dried up bug stuck to the page. 
I went to the front and asked the hostess for a new menu and their response was that's disgusting. 
No manager approached our table even after telling our server there was a lipstick stain on my boyfriends coffee cup. 
While we're eating I'm watching servers leave clean silverware sets on top of the booth railings then placing them on newly cleaned tables, I doubt that's up to health code standards. 
Will never return to this place."}
{"text":"Yikes. Got suckered in to going for dinner by my 5 year old as a special treat but they were severely understaffed up front and in back (almost 30 minutes to get pancakes, dirty dishes on empty tables throughout the restaurant), they were out of a few ingredients for the seasonal menu options, one staffer didn't know how to split a check at the register, the disgusting oranges on my salad honestly tasted like they were fermenting and the salad might have had more dressing than lettuce. (Okay - totally my fault there for ordering a salad at an IHOP...I take full responsibility for that lapse in judgement). Sadly, I think IHOP just fell off of our list of options moving forward."}
{"text":"The service was not great despite the place being almost empty (which should've been a sign since it is next to a hotel; you'd think it would have been more crowded), the food was decent, and our server was quite obviously under the influence of some sort of substance that shouldn't be used during work hours. Last, but not least, we were asked, by our server, to expedite things by stacking our own dishes before leaving the table. NOT RECOMMENDED- Charlotte is a big city. Eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very unprofessional. I walked in and waited to be seated by the person standing in the front. She twisted up her face and said \"I mean I ain't even on the clock right now.\" She then proceeded to call someone else who was a food server to seat me and my guest. 
* when your not working don't stand in the front ."}
{"text":"Still here at this ihop location and not off to a good start. It seems that no one wants to clean tables coz there's so many dirty tables. It seems none of the staff is interested in cleaning tables. Service is not so good. Water is room temperature because their ice maker is busted. What??? That couldn't just happen! My last visit here definitely."}
{"text":"No greeting when walked in the door they just looked at us after placing order the waiter left and didn't come back had to go find employees sitting down to get mayo and water then again to get a straw... They came when wasn't even done eating to see if I needed a to go box... Had to ask for a menu for dessert since it wasn't offered! Employees in the back laughing and giggling after asking for menu while making the sunday! I was furious didn't even want to eat now have to call them over for check and again for a to go box!! Very poor customer service and only noise in restraunt is hispanic music which I don't mind just think there sold be a better vibe and way better customer service!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, food not much better! Came in on a busy Sunday. Waited as can be expected for a busy day. Was seated before two other tables. Had to waive someone down to order drinks, at which time we ordered food as well. Never received our drinks while the other two tables seated after us did. No silverware. My sister and I both ordered build your own omelets which were completely wrong. Didn't have time to have them fixed as we had already waited long enough to get seated and place our orders and had to drop her off at the airport. Was then charged for items not included in the actual omelets. Had to try to get this changed which ended up only taking a dollar off which wasn't worth the fight in the first place. Go else where if you have the choice. Service was enough to never return to this establishment."}
{"text":"We waited 5-10 minutes to be seated. After 10 minutes of sitting there without seeing a waitress or waiter  we packed up and left. Congratulations IHOP, you successfully avoided a review on your food because you service was so bad that we didn't have these patience to try it. Never again!

One star was way too high of a rating for them but I had no other option."}
{"text":"The area is very busy so certain hours will result in long wait times. The customer service is great based on the few times we visited and the food service was always satisfactory."}
{"text":"$30 for breakfast for 2. Not a good value. Ordered omelette with pancakes. I only ate half of it. Didn't taste good. Pancakes suppose to be fluffy. Felt sick to my stomach afterward because it's so expensive and tastes bad."}
{"text":"These undercooked biscuits were atrocious! Incredibly salty alone and chewing on them was like biting into the Pilsbury doughboy! I'm sure this isn't a common occurrence however, this review is based off of my experience at this location for this visit only. Our server was freakin amazing and he was so nice to every table. I hope IHOP appreciates him and I wish I can say his name in this revue, but it violates yelps terms. Long story short, the restaurant smells like sewer gas occasionally, my blueberry cheesecake waffles were perfect and delicious."}
{"text":"We sat for over an hour and a half waiting for our food. We were told that our food was coming out next for 49 minutes straight. There were a total of 8 tables in the restaurant, so it's not like it was slammed. The manager offered a discount but after an hour and half of waiting. Still no sign of our food. Inexcusable service."}
{"text":"First i come in and the table is a hot mess i understand it is Christmas  BULL SHIT it just a excuse  to be lazy and not clean  we come in before the people that behind use they took there drink order first we r here waiting we r ready our food alredy and still  no one to ask it been 10 mins well they come and ask finallu for out drinks get they got mad because  we alredy order our food because  we had to stop  someone  to help  us it's  sad that this is going to be the worse place i ever got service  from i will never come to this getto  hood rat infested  place again."}
{"text":"Went here on Memorial Day. The place was jumping so I expected I might get my order wrong.  What I didn't expect was a cold waffle, under cooked runny eggs and dried out sausage.  I eat at IHOP frequently and I was shocked.  I did complain about the eggs and I had a deduction off of my bill so kudos for the good service.  Terrible day though for my food.  I don't understand, the waiter came back quickly with my order yet everything was cold and dry except the undercooked eggs.  It was a different waiter who took my order who brought the food.  The first waiter only came back to bring the check.   Won't be back here since I had a better breakfast at the Good Egg near by.  I believe I will stick with the Good Egg."}
{"text":"My son and I love going to IHOP for breakfast. Well this was our first attempt at this location and it was below expectations. The restaurant had about 10 tables empty and we still had to wait 20 mins to be seated. My guess is they were understaffed. 

Once we did get seated, service was slow and really bad. I had to ask 4 times for silverware, 3 times for a straw for my sons cup, and the food just wasn't that good. My plate was dirty. My son asked for strawberries on his pancakes and they had blueberry syrup on them - I wonder who's plate they scraped them off of. 

Oh and the straw came as we were paying. Not our best IHOP experience."}
{"text":"I was completely unhappy with my dinning experience. As I walked up to the front desk to be sat the hostess seriously looked at me for 5 min in complete amazement, like she had never seeing a human being before.   I was sat, and was left there to sit for 10 min without any acknowledgment from anyone.  They were keep movin busy, but not out of control busy. When the waitress tried to wave to me and tell me that it would be a minute more she smacked me with the check holder. It was still another 5 min before she got my drink order, and ignored my food order, even though I had known what I wanted for over 10 min.... some one else brought me my drink, and still a long wait before I was able to give her my food order. My food was cold when I received it. She also never came back to see how it was.  And the bathroom was about the grossest thing I have ever seen!"}
{"text":"Waited to get in which was understandable on a Saturday morning. However the following wasn't ok:
-they never wiped our table
- dropped cutlery off on end of table without any acknowledgement of us
- waited forever for service
- mostly empty coffee urn
- took the sugar away
- slow food service
- mediocre food
No mas for me."}

No one was at the front desk or host stand when I arrived. 

They told me that they have no record of my order. 

The \"Acting\" Manager could careless. 

A group of employees were standing around outside doing nothing.

Over heard an employee state \"when the manger is not there, people don't work.\"

Was never offered an apology, but was offered a chance to order. REALLY?"}
{"text":"Not bad the reservation line 10 min packed wait weekend...good environment friendly great service, food wait just up 10 min too."}
{"text":"After ordering a $10.99 special felt like I was going puke. The bacon was salty and dripping with grease. The eggs were powdered and hash-browns were like plastic."}
{"text":"We wait 15 min, no one come and no water. We wait another 10 min after we have the food, because no folk and spoon and no waiter again."}
{"text":"Went on midnight, took 1 hr to be seated. 1 hr to take orders and half hr just waiting for the check. I think this is the worst ihop I ever been to."}
{"text":"Mary put me on hold for ten minutes twice  while attempting to place a to go order I wanted to make a pick up but she seems pretty incompetent I may not be her fault but this ihop def needs to do better. Guess I'm goin to Denny's or somethin"}
{"text":"Would not reccommend. Out of alot of the items on menu. The staff is more worried about talking to each other. Crum fell from the ceiling onto our table. Dirty sticky menus. Slow service."}
{"text":"Dirty and food was not good. My mother and I had to rush home...bathroom!
IHOP's what is going on! Go back to closing at 9/10 p.m. so you can clean your better."}
{"text":"IHOP (Centennial) what's going on!

We really enjoy eating at your restaurant and have been for years...but please do some serious cleaning. When a person visit the restrooms and some seating areas we can see in the kitchen. The floors and the women's restroom needs some attention. Sorry to say the food is slipping we are trying to hang-in with you. Maybe we will try you in a few months, have to get over the last visit. Dirty and Bad food-can't spend my hard earned money with you."}
{"text":"The International House of Pancakes is where I get my brunch on. I used to go to Denny's, but one of the kids selling newspapers up front was constantly pressuring me to buy a copy, so I stopped going there cause I felt like I had to pay a toll to enter. Sometimes, the kid even tested my knowledge.

Kid: Did you know that mining still exists in Nevada?
Me: *pretending to not know, but I know because I'm old* Oh...really? You don't say...
Kid: Yeah,  learned about it in the newspaper. *holds one up and points to it*
Me: *thinking to myself* I just wanna eat pancakes!

At IHOP, none of that happens. I just walk in, tell them my name, and they usually lead me to a table right away. I like their chocolate chip pancakes, which aren't bad, and I usually order them as part of a combo with bacon, eggs, and hash browns... that are freaking delicious. Other international offerings that I've tried are the German crepes and Harvest Grain pancakes, those are all right.

The servers are always on their A-Game. I had one who was well-spoken and relaxed. I like to think he teaches mediation on the side. Too bad I don't remember his name and have only seen him once. Maybe he went to go teach meditation full-time. 

Is there anything that sucks about this IHOP? Yes. It's busy on the weekends, but at least I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a table to open up. Another thing that sucks is if the main waiting area is full, you'll have to wait in the secluded waiting room by the entry. Makes me feel like a second-rate citizen."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. This placed was packed, and the hostess said they were slow. They are the second busiest IHOP, with Anaheim, CA being the #1."}
{"text":"Awful experience tonight and management sucks...  Apparently there is an illegal coupon floating around but when I told my server I had a coupon she didn't ask to see it... I ordered the two drinks that the coupon stipulated I do... Again when I said that she didn't ask to see coupon... When check is brought she asked to see coupon then preceeded to get management which I thought was to verify...  Management says no I can not take this coupon and basically to bad..  So now I'm paying for a meal I didn't expect to and two drinks I never would of ordered..  And the management says Owell. . Great customer service.... Will not be back. ."}
{"text":"We had breakfast before starting our shopping marathon. It's located close to the premium outlet. And the pancakes are good like always.
The service was ok but not the quickest."}
{"text":"Went here this morning not really craving breakfast. Ordered a Philly Cheesesteak Stacker with Onion Rings. 5 minutes later the waiter comes back to tell me they are out of onion rings. I told him fries was ok. He brings the order and I ask for a side of ranch dressing. He tells me they are out of ranch dressing. And they proceeds to say \"they\" are doing them bad this week.

My question is how can you be out of something predominant on your lunch menu and then be out of something as simple as a dressing. Their manager can't run to Costco to load up until \"they\" eventually deliver the order?

Seems like every time we have been here they are out of aomething. So sadml."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this a zero!  The day after Christmas, our party of 12 were sat within 10 minutes and it went downhill from there.  The restaraunt was not busy (less, than 30 people total) and after 15 minutes, our server finally came to the table to take drink order and it was another 15 minutes before we received them.  90 minutes later and two conversations with the general manager, our food FINALLY started coming out in waves.  Making matters worse, some of the meals were wrong, under-cooked, over-cooked or cold.  The same holds true for the patrons at the next two tables.  Everyone's order was delayed or wrong. This includes the man and woman who were each dining alone.  It wasn't until I asked for the district manager's name did the general manager move to action.  Someone suggested he may have been in the kitchen cooking as he kept disappearing for lengthy periods of time.  He finally apologized for the horrible service saying we didn't have to pay the bill.  He also gave us two - $25 certificates to use at that location; which will NEVER happen."}
{"text":"Ok...have been to this location a few time, but after today no more . Place was not that busy it took 35 to 40 to get food, ran out of coffee and only saw the waitress twice. Took food to go cause it came out as we where leaving to pay for drinks. Staff didn't seem to care or management.  It will be a long time tell we try IHOP again."}
{"text":"I love this place. The waitress's on dinner shift are so nice and attentive. The service was fast and friendly. I will definitely be going back. the bathrooms were clean and same with the entire resturant. The manager lynn i met at the register was very cool."}
{"text":"Had dinner this evening. My Server was pleasant and tried to Fix bad cooking. I got Chicken Parmesan with Penne. Very little cheese on meat. Extra cheese sent in a cup, grated! Wow !! And it was Cold !!
It was bad and getting worse."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre. I ordered unlimited pancakes and individual potatoes. Never received potatoes had to wait ten mins before waiter seen I needed more pancakes. 4pm not a busy hour.  I'm really being nice by giving 3 stars"}
{"text":"This meal was horrible...over priced for the service received waited up front for seating and the one man who was visible politely ignored not only us, the people behind us but also the patrons attempting to pay. At least the food could have been good. My son ordered Dr. Pepper and received Pepsi...my sisters toast was burned and she was not even offered butter."}
{"text":"This morning me my dad mom and cousin had breakfast here.  The service was good as was the food, then we went to pay.  My dad paid with his credit card, the tip was left on the table in cash.  After my dad signed the receipt the young kid at the register says to my dad.....\"are you going to leave a tip?\"   Are you kidding me...this young punk ass kid soliciting a tip from my dad, who is 83!!!  FUCK YOU!!  First of all it's none of his damn business if a tip is left!  2nd who the hell is he to solicit a tip!  I should have asked for the manager immediately but just wanted to leave because the longer I stayed the better chance I would have beat his ass!!  So let's see if IHOP higher ups give a damn about what is written on Yelp and how their guests are treated.  I will never be back after the way this punk ass kid talked to my dad!! Only reason you got 2 stars is because the service was good."}
{"text":"Food ok, all serves look like robots, the only normal people that we saw was Erika the host and our waitress Aurora super nice people, the rest are just Ghetto and look desperate for the tips, acting like dogs waiting for piece of food...so sad.
Our waittress Aurora was super nice and helped us with everything we needed, always with an smile and she is super funny and cute, totally different then the rest, we will only comeback if we have the same server."}
{"text":"Love Ihop but this one has the worst wait time. Servers are usually pleasant but you just wait and wait and wait."}
{"text":"Food was typical of ihop. Average. Good sized portions for the price. Staff helpful. AC was broken so was very hot inside. Problem was no enforcement of handicapped spots. Young, healthy college students parked in spaces without penalty. I told hostess, she asked them to move, they didn't. Manager was told. It ended there. Nothing further was done. Very frustrating for handicapped to watch healthy people take spots reserved for them and have management aware but do nothing."}
{"text":"My Mom & I were out running errands, when we decided to stop and have a little breakfast. We happened to stop in just at the right time, we only had to wait about 5 minutes before we were seated. We did not have to wait long to before the waitress came by & took our drink and breakfast order. Our meal was delivered hot, which is always a bonus. Breakfast was good and I am sure we will go back in the future."}
{"text":"We had a great visit at this IHOP, staff is always working to help each other!! Great food and fast service"}
{"text":"As far as the service goes, I was pretty pleased by this one. We went at 6:30 on a Tuesday and it wasn't very busy. It's very clean and has a nice new look to both the interior and exterior. Had the pancakes (why would you get anything else?) and a ham cheese omlette. Both were of good quality."}
{"text":"I ordered the turkey dinner because of how good it looks in the picture and on TV.  When I got my food, the turkey looked like ground turkey.  It wasn't in slices like the picture or TV showed.  Don't know if it's just this location or if the cooks were just having a bad day.  My waitress agreed how bad it looked and I sent it back for something else."}
{"text":"Worst IHOP I've been to. Took 35 minutes to get our food. When we finally got our after not being checked on once, it came out over done. The food was also incredibly low quality. Our fruit and veggies were all soggy, and our eggs were brown. My utensils were dirty,  and the entire place needed a hard scrub. There's no way they could be making money with all the discounts they have to give for the bad food and long wait. When we told them what was wrong the manager had a bad attitude. We got 20 percent off but I still wouldn't go back. The entire staff obviously doesn't care about what they're doing at this restaurant. At one point our waitress was standing in the back eating crackers or something. I don't think they even are trying to keep this place open. I won't be sad if they do close."}
{"text":"Josh is awesome!! Great server. Get the ayce pancakes. Yum!"}
{"text":"Last time i will go to any!!! Ihopagain,.tried it again and must be stupid to go to ihop, breakfast last time was horrible and this location is the worst!! Cold coffee, bacon that was served almost raw, its nothing more then inside fast food dining in the worst way!"}
{"text":"the manager sat us on top of another table. The man that was sitting there had gone to the restroom, the manager sat us on his table. The place was not busy. It took over 40minutes to get our food. The manager did not come and apologize for either of the mishaps. horrible experience. I remember why I dont dine at Ihop now."}
{"text":"I went to ihop for saint Patrick's day since they had a promotion (free pancakes if you're wearing green). I walked in around 1:50 and they waited a while to sit us down even though the place was nearly empty. When we sat down we told the guy that we were just there for free pancakes. He said \"sorry that's only till 2 pm today\" it was 2:04. Assholes."}
{"text":"Very poor service, couldn't get clean silverware to save my soul. Food was fair."}
{"text":"Worst place ever, came in to eat and they say me and my son in a dirty table they even gave me a disgusting high chair like really I'm not sitting my son in a dirty chair. The floor was filthy and the waiter ignored us for awhile, I just got up and left."}
{"text":"Can I give a negative rating? ?? If you are in the mood to be aggravated,  want slow and rude service the IHOP in Bedford is the place for you. We went there to buy time and there were maybe 7 people in the entire place. I had to clear my throat to be seated. We sat down and sat for no lie 10 mins and the waitress STILL had not taken our drink order. Then she was rude to this older woman who came in asked for a booth.  She said and I quote \"they are all dirty and I've been busy\" ...???.. Really?? Clearly it's packed with imaginary people. Needless to say we walked out."}
{"text":"IHOP doesn't make a pretensions of being something it is not, but I'm always disappointed when I go there since I know that I could have had better food if I just stayed home.  Probably the biggest piece of this is that their pancakes have a nappy taste to them which could probably be characterized as \"slightly off dairy\".  Steak N' Shake's pancakes suffer from this as well but they don't have the word 'pancake' in their name.  As well, their bottles of artifically flavoered corn syrup? Yuck.

Anyway, I did love the coffee carafe that they would drop off, I wish more places would steal that idea."}
{"text":"Clean and quiet environment. Friendly and quick service. Food was good. Eggs cooked the way we wanted. Solid breakfast"}
{"text":"Me, and my family were coming back home from a vacation out of town and we decided to stop in at IHOP for breakfast. Our server Nathan didn't know where any of the menu items were and he seemed stiff and nervous.  When the food finally came, all of ours was good except my daughter's. She is 12 years old and she doesn't order off of the kids menu anymore, and besides the guy should've known that she is almost a teenager and probably doesn't order off the kids menu...anyways, she ordered the chicken and waffles. It was supposed to come with 4 chicken strips and a whole waffle, instead she got half a waffle and two chicken strips which is obviously not a full meal for a 12 year old, so I told Nathan and then he said he accidentally typed in the kids chicken and waffles. Overall, it was good, but it could have been better if we had a different waiter/waitress."}
{"text":"It's disgusting. Should be called the International House of Poop. The one's in Philly are better."}
{"text":"The food is good, consistent and cheap. The service depends on who you get. Expect to wait awhile while they try and figure out who's gonna wait on you. Open 24 hours so it's not very clean. Everything is sticky all the time."}
{"text":"Bailey was the best server ever. Came in with my girlfriend and she got the breakfast sampler and I got the quesadilla. The food was really tasty and came out fast. Bailey was very attentive and paid close attention to our special requests. Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"While I can't speak to earlier service when iHop first opened I can say that my experience was good. Our server, Ciara, was attentive and cheerful. Our food came fast and was tasty. I made sure to write into corporate and compliment their service, something I encourage people to do for chains. These folks always hear about how badly they're doing, seldom about how good.

I rate the food as a three star but the service as a four."}
{"text":"Keep moving, do not eat here , serving cold food and not serving what's on the menu, bacon cheeseburger comes with red onions she brung out old white onions, fried onion rings old and greasy, soda machine taste dirty ewwwww, keep moving have lunch at naked pizza!"}
{"text":"I enjoy a sickeningly sweet pancake meal as much as anybody. This Ihop is pretty nice! I almost ate myself sick on nutella crepes this morning. Good way to start the day!"}
{"text":"Hi, I just visited this location with my friend for breakfast. We're from Chicago and I am a bartender and server myself and I just received the worst service I've probably ever had. Our server Chris, took over 15 minutes to even greet us. But we weren't greeted in the slightest as he approached our table by starting with \"what can I get you.\" So as we were exhaling our order it seemed odd that he didn't write anything down, but I've done that before serving also, hoping he'd be on top of his game and have a good memory. But that was exact opposite. My friend never got asked what she wanted to drink either. When we received the order her eggs weren't how she ordered them, I was missing my French toast, etc. The food runner was very nice and got what we were missing without asking. If you're wondering why your kitchen is having problems it's probably because Chris isn't writing anything down when he should be.

Throughout our experience we saw Chris greeting other tables nicely and writing down their orders. Out of the two times he actually made it back to our table he never really stopped to ask us how things were or if we had something to say we wouldn't have time to say it cause he slipped past our table every time. Once we got our check we just left left the money on the table. 

This was a terrible experience and I rarely write yelp reviews but I have never felt this way while dining somewhere. I felt very unwelcomed because of our server. 

On the other hand, your hostess was a sweetie and I would have rather have had her serve us. I didn't catch her name but she had short black hair and cute black rimmed glasses. 

Thanks Ohio IHOP, but no thanks.
Ps the two stars is cause of the hostess, otherwise you guys would be getting none."}
{"text":"The service here was an absolute joke. My husband and I wanted to grab a quick dinner. We saw our server twice the whole time we were there, once to take our order and once after my husband brought his empty glass over to the kitchen and asked for a refill. She basically stayed in the kitchen the entire time. We didn't even bother trying to flag her down for our check. The only reason I gave them two stars instead of one is because the food was quick, even though the order was wrong.."}
{"text":"This last time I went the employees were very rude and we had terrible waiters 4 empty water cups and forgot to bring out half of our food. They were very unprofessional."}
{"text":"We liked, it but when we ordered our food it tooled to long to come and the kids got impatient just because they are kids. Once the food came we really enjoyed it but if your looking for a healthy place to go I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Really crappy service.  And it took 4 attempts by the overwhelmed waitress to deduct the salad ( which we never received) from our tab.  She kept apologizing but just didn't get that we weren't satisfied by a simple apology.  By the time we left we just found the whole episode comical.  The restaurant looked like it was being run by a bunch of slackers.   Generally like IHOP food particularly because they include the calorie count but service has always been inconsistent.  You take your chances.  We lost this time."}
{"text":"After traveling from Memphis to Vegas we decided to grab a bite to eat. The manager on duty told us the cook was struggling and was not able to serve the 12 of us in a timely manner. There was two other customers in the restaurant. It was 3AM!! Needless to say we left and went to Denny's the next exit down. I've never known a restaurant to turn down business. I wish I could give them ZERO stars."}
{"text":"came here for breakfast but only got a headache and a pile of crusty dusty waffles. undercooked! sad!"}
{"text":"I got there around midnight and waited for a couple min at the front. I finally see the waitress, but the waitress saw me and just went back to work and disappeared. I saw the cook too, but the cook also just stared at me for a second and went back to do whatever in the back...I continued to wait for another few minutes before I just said, screw this I'm leaving. The end"}
{"text":"I probably shouldn't have ordered a burger from IHOP... Seeing as it stands for the International House Of Pancakes.... Maybe the quality is not up to par because of the location of the establishment..."}
{"text":"Mediocre experience both times I came to this location.  I was told this location is \"different\" compared to the others in the area.  They do not carry several condiments common to most IHOPs and they lack getting your order correct.  On both occasions, mistakes were made because the waitress didn't write down the order and typed it in wrong.   They were quick to fix it after words and brought out the correct food."}
{"text":"The waitresses here are very rude!! if they're not serving your table don't expect them to even bother with looking your way. As my husband and I were sitting at our booth along with our children we wanted to ask for some butter and didn't see our server so as another one was passing by my husband said \"excuse me ma'am\" but she just ignored him and kept walking than another woman walked by I'm not sure if she was a server or hostess but I know she definetly was employed there and my husband says the same thing! Very nicely and loud enough for her to hear, mind you this place is small and the tables are very close together so when people walk by they're literally almost touching your table as they pass and she also just walks past finally our server comes back we ask her for the butter and for the last meal that wasn't brought to our table which was one of my daughters and she says she thought it was already brought out! She goes to the back to check on her meal and when she comes back she apologizes and says she thought someone had brought it out but it must of went to another table so she gave my daughter her fruit and said she would have the meal out ASAP!  Anyways the food was OK but what's good food without good service?"}
{"text":"Filthiest restaurant I have ever walked into. Entry carpet is black with dirt, entire place smells of mold, it's so dirty we walked right out."}
{"text":"I finally ordered the crepes here.  Not sure why I waited so long but it was Sooooooo good.  I had mine with Strawberry along with scrambled eggs and turkey bacon.

I fed my whole family here and everyone finished feeling satisfied with a smile.  We ordered French toast to your basic kid's breakfast.  Better than Denny's but I love breakfast for dinner any day if the week!  

I'm hungry again lol"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I've had at a restaurant to date... 
20 minutes to get coffee...1st round (refills?... hahaha! You must be joking!) 
Then our food came (40 minutes later)
The biscuits and gravy were cold
The waffle was cold
The bacon was undercooked... took my chances on getting that fixed, but when I asked the server for fully cooked bacon, she took mine back and threw it in the microwave (not what I had in mind) when I got that chance to ask for new, fully cooked bacon what I got was burnt to a crisp (apparently the staff here has a sense of humor) oh and I was charged again for the replacement. 
It just sucks to go in somewhere without much expectation and still be disappointed... I wouldn't waste your time if you're thinking about this location."}
{"text":"Took too long to be seated, if it weren't for another waitress who took our drink order im sure we'd still be waiting for them to figure out what tables they have. The sad part is they aren't busy. Well, I have a discount for this meal so I can't really complain to much, it is the only reason I am here. At least the waitress is reasonably pleasant. Hopefully the food is up to par. Slow service at this time of night so be prepared. Nice people though. Food decent but good staff"}
{"text":"Although we started this visit on the poor foot, our actual waitress \"Cassie\" restored faith and prevented me from looking at a single star.  The initial start was very poor as my expected for a first impression, no greeter/seater and Victoria tried to squeeze an adult party if 5 in a booth when clearly all other patrons had been seated 2 per booth.  

Cassie presented herself professionally and restored face for this IHOP.  The food was as expected with no issues. Delicious. Thumbs up Cassie."}
{"text":"I came here with my grandparents. At the start a waiter took our drink over and then a waitress did the same thing. Once the guy brought our drinks we ended up with the female and she served us the rest of the time. Her name was Brenda. Nice girl and polite manners, but she could have spoken up more.

After our drinks were brought, I needed more time to decide. It was about 15 minutes before she came back.

I ordered the banana and nutella crepes. They were different from the way they made the other crepes. The bananas and nutella were on top of the crepes. There was nothing on the inside, occasionally leaving a bland taste in my mouth. Personal opinion here, but maybe put bananas and nutella inside the crepe as well. Needed more banana in general. It was decently good I guess.

I'll restate this though. Despite the 15 minute between drinks and ordering, it was a good place and Brenda was nice--but she should speak up a bit."}
{"text":"We were surprised there was a short wait since the parking lot was empty, but I think a lot of people walk here from the casinos. We waited maybe 5 min and Jimmy took us right to our seat and took our order. Friendly guy with a nice smile. Food was good, i think we waited maybe 5 min for our food too and it was nice and hot. We'll visit again next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I love ihop so on Tuesday morning my sister and I went to get breakfast. To start off our experience there was no one to greet us and I had to wait until they realized there was a line. Also, our server was so rude but I didn't let it bother me so I order eggs with hash browns and pancakes. Right when we got out food our server came by once to ask if everything was okay and right when we got our food she brought the check and didn't bother to ask if we were paying together or not so I went on and ate my eggs and they tasted different but I continued to eat them so then I thought it was me so I went to eat my pancakes and my pancakes were under cooked and I also didn't say anything. One because our server was rude and because I had already eaten more than half of it. I didn't finish my eggs and pancakes and thought I just wasted my money. When our server came by I told her we were going to pay separately and her answer was \"well you didn't say anything\" and took the check so rudely and we didn't say anything because she didn't give us the chance to ask. Right when I paid I had to use the restroom and I knew then the food didn't sit well. I went on my day and later that day my stomach started hurting sooo much. Woke up the next morning with my stomach still hurting come to find out I have food poising. It's been a very painful day and this is why I'm giving this location one star not ihop but this location. The whole experience was there terrible and I will not be going back and I don't recommend anyone to go there."}
{"text":"It's what you'd expect from an IHOP, pancakes for everyone's taste. Although in the maryvale area (hood); I like that its always busy which translates to fresh food. Always a wait but worth it for cheap pancakes and a balloon artist for the kids. Forego the hashbrowns for the country potatoes; crispy seasoned yummness.

Dress code: it's ihop so anything goes; even pajamas"}
{"text":"Overall, service was courteous. However, it takes forever to order and get your food-25 minutes! Lost my appetite. There were more managers than waiters. At the end, the waiter gave us the wrong bill."}
{"text":"For real. I just gave Ihop five stars. Yes, the food is about what you'd expect...similar to Dennys. However, our waitress Sonya (or Sonja) was excellent. Fast, efficient, friendly, and was always one step ahead with ketchup, water, syrup, etc.  She was well worth the 30% tip.  Exactly what I want on a busy weekend."}
{"text":"We've been here many times and it's never been great but last night was by far the worst.
We were seated promptly and our waitress came to take our drink orders right away. 
That's where it gets iffy..
My daughter asked if the iced coffee was bottomless.. The waitress said \"no\". Then we looked at the menu and saw that yes it was bottomless and we told the waitress so. She was not happy.
She brought our drinks and took our food order.
At this time we noticed an older couple being seated..
We waited for our food.. And waited.. And waited.. We ordered breakfast for gawds sake.
We watched the older couple get their food and eat and we were still waiting.. 
Almost an hour later, they were getting up and we were just receiving our food.
The food.. It was cold when we got it, obviously it'd been sitting waiting for our waitress to pick it up for awhile.
After finishing our breakfast, I excused myself to the restroom. On my way almost bumping into our waitress, she gave me such a look.
Until this point she had not bothered to check on us, no refills on drinks, no ketchup that we'd asked for, we even had to snag silverware and salt from another table.
She finally came over while I was gone to ask if we needed anything.. My daughter got us refills on our drinks.
The waitress didn't even bother to bring me the check!
Suffice it to say I did not leave a tip.. Which I never do as I've worked in the food industry and understand how much tips count towards a wait person's income. But the lack of service was so extreme.. 
It wasn't even busy, 4 table's occupied in the whole restaurant when we arrived.
Management needs to either train their staff better or be replaced themselves.
Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast... It hit the spot... Very good service and the food came out quick... Our server McKayla was very attentive and nice... We never had to ask for a refill... We will be coming here again... Definitely worth 5 stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"Waited at least 20 minutes before having to speak to the manager. Another gentlemen came in 5 minutes after we did and he was helped first. Poor customer service. The food was overall good."}
{"text":"I wish I could say that I had a great experience at this restaurant. Breakfast restaurants and diners are some of my favorite places to eat. Unfortunately, this was one of the worst meals I have ever had. The server we had was very kind and helpful. After finding multiple hairs in our food she requested that the manager come over to help. The manager was very rude and gave us attitude because we were teens. I will never go back to this awful place after experiencing this discrimination. I do not like to complain about restaurants because I, myself, work in one and understand how tough it is to keep everyone extremely satisfied.

However, the management of this restaurant needs to be fixed, and they need to clean up their kitchen! Take necessary precautions so that customers do not find flies and hairs in their food!"}
{"text":"Went here today, and will never be going back there or any other IHOP again for the rest of my life!


In order, this is what happened:

I went there with my mom and gran and I ordered the grilled chicken salad.  Got my plate and the slad was swimming in water.  I wanted to complian but didn't because my gran was treating.  So I just thought i'd suck it up and eat the watered down salad that Gordon Ramsey would have complained about.

Because we were seated right next to the kitchen, I heard another waitress cursing to Carlos incredibly loud, whom I am guessing was the cook and she comes out looking like she was on a rampage over this guy.

Our waitress gave my mom her cheeseburger and said \"oh yeah, they forgot to put the cheese on it do ya want me to take it back or take the cheese off the check?\" My mom just accepted her cheeseless cheeseburger with no condiments..  the waitress never gave that to us either.

Suddenly as I was eating I got something pretty chewy in my mouth, thought it was bacon so I keep chewing... not going down, I spit it out and see it was a huge piece of plastic!

I tell the waitress and all she can say is \"ya the cook gets excited sometimes and doesn't pay attention when he is cooking.\"

...Never coming back"}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Took 30 mins for the waitress to bring our drinks. And another 30 to take our order.. We got our food 20 mins after ordering. Our table wasnt properly set for the number of people we had... Had to ask for extra silverware. Also when we got our drinks the soda was tasteless. Dont go to this ihop.. Next time we'll be having dinner at Denny's!"}
{"text":"Worst IHOP ever. Fries burnt, waffle burnt, I had to chase my waitress around the whole place just to get my coffee creamer. Never got my second drink. Put the bill right on the napkins we were using, face up and taped it multiple times to make sure we saw it. The only saving grace that keeps me from giving one star was the buser. He was more helpful then two servers."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place, we waited 40 minutes for our food and our serve only came to check on us once. IHOP is one of my favorite breakfast place, but we'll probably won't be coming back to this one. I suggest you guys work on building a better consumer service."}
{"text":"This place is always busy. The wait is not worth it at all. the food is not well prepared. It's as if the cooks are so busy that they dont care if they overcook or undercook. The last time i was there the eggs had way too much oil/butter and the has browns where undercooked. Just go somewhere else. Vegas is full of places to eat, this is the worst."}
{"text":"I have a gift certificate...I need to use it...service good...food ok....pancakes...not bad at all..Turkey bacon...could've Been a bit crisper..."}
{"text":"Not a very friendly welcome. Our waiter was excellent. Restaurant very small and crowded. Ask for the specials they are much cheaper than regular menu."}
{"text":"The services suck, my friend and I when there a week ago, after talking our orders we never saw our waitress again, she never check on us to see how we where doing if we needed drink, napkins.. etc.  Worse customer service ever.."}
{"text":"Been in Gilbert for 12 years and have come here many times. Good service until this past year when things have gotten sketchy and tonight was the final straw. I'm not sure if management has changed or what but we walked in and stood at the front counter for five minutes and no one came to seat us. I walked out the door and in again thinking maybe there's a bell or something that didn't trigger. We waited another five minutes that felt like another ten minutes. (Yes it was a real five minutes measured by the stopwatch on my phone) So total time waiting to be greeted or seated was 10 minutes! So we walk in to seat ourselves and there's a server (Sheyanne) leaning up against a wall chatting away with another server. She says \"I didn't hear you come in\" and looks at us like we're intruding. How dare we seat ourselves after being ignored for ten minutes. We were supposed to get frustrated and just leave so she wouldn't have to work. Basically she was too busy blabbing away and neglecting her job. We order and eat. She then plops the check on our table and says \"Really appreciate if you pay this right away because we have to close our register.\" So I set out my credit card. For ten minutes she doesn't pick up the check. I said to her \"I thought you wanted me to pay this right away.\" She says \"Yes you have to go up front and pay.\" What?! We weren't ready to leave yet. If she wanted it paid she could have picked up the check. I know you usually pay up front when you leave but I've also had servers there pick up the check for me from my table many times. If she was in a hurry to have it paid why wouldn't she offer to take it for me? Anyway, the check gets paid and then she tells us she's leaving and another server on the opposite side of the restaurant is available if we need anything else. Bingo! OMGosh, what she wanted was her tip before she left! For the next 30 mins we are never checked on and made to feel like we are imposing. So much so we think maybe they're closing until about a dozen new people walk in to the restaurant. Who, by the way, were all made to gather at the front waiting to be seated just like we waited. Arrggh! Fail! 

Please, avoid Sheyanne and this place, drive two miles east on Warner Rd and go to Denny's. Really, multiple bad experiences at this IHOP in the last nine months."}
{"text":"Worst service in town. After been seated there was over 30 minutes and all we got was coffee and then all waitresses disappeared. Not even the Manager came by and explained delays. There was a family next to us with 3 kids that were seated before us with nothing coming by. We got up and went to cashier to pay for coffee and we also have to wait. Not sure how this franchise location still open."}
{"text":"So disappointed, know it was a holiday today but the restaurant was not that busy for the poor service we got. First impression were tables left full of dirty dishes, never bussed the whole time we were there. Our waiter took forever to get to us and then bring us our drinks, then forgot our salad and us after bringing our food, told him three times that we needed refills, oh I almost forgot there was no silverware on the table, I had to go find some on a table that was not covered in food from the previous diner. Food was not awful but not great either."}
{"text":"Minus 5 stars way over price, wi fi turned off.  $11.00 or higher for an olmlet but they'll toss free hash browns BFD and any add on will cost you even more.  IHop used to be a fun place to have a meal no longer offers you that joy.  I would say don't waste your time eating at a IHop it's a wasteof money and your time.  There are better places that will cost you less.  I ordered the egg and pancakes the pancakes were cold the butter was still frozen and the over medium were so done they were like eating rubber gloves."}
{"text":"Crazy busy but really good service.

Breakfast/brunch places are usually very busy and IHOP was no different. There's a really small parking lot at this one which makes it hard to find parking, but if you wait a while someone usually leaves!

There's a very broad selection here, from waffles, pancakes, omelettes, and potato dishes. Something for everyone.

The waitresses were friendly despite being super busy. Food came out promptly, the beef tri-tips were a little under seasoned but a nice way to start the day. Pancakes excellent!!"}
{"text":"Just left and am not happy. Food not bad but train your people before they hit the floor. Waiter gave me a filthy coffee cup (no idea how he didnt see the brown smudges around the top of the mug) and trying to pay our bill was impossible.. line was long and the girl kept walking away so the third time she did we left our money and receipt on the counter. No acknowledgement to the long line of people waiting by her to say hey im sorry, i'll be with you shortly. Just plain rude on their part."}
{"text":"Told myself i would never go back to ihop, but this one is the worst in service, went there for breakfast and waited 15 min before the hostess that seated me asked me if i had been helped!! Bad management, i am done with I dump!"}
{"text":"The worst service ans the food is always undercooked! Sat there waiting to be seated and people that walked in after me got seated first!  Management is horribe!
The food is horrible,  my 6 year old can make better pancakes which are not even cooked well,you can taste the batter,the bacon is always soggy and undercooked!!
Would never go back to any ihop , any location, when you respond to corporate via email, they never return the message,they know the food and service is lousy, thats why!!"}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here yesterday for Mothers Day. The food was less than acceptable. Eggs were really overcooked. Ham was overcooked and really tough. Even the bacon wasn't right. I mean, how can someone mess up bacon? Coffee was barely warm in the pot they bring you out.
The only reason I'm giving two stars is because despite the quality of the food, the servers were doing the best they could. And they were friendly.
I realize that it was mothers day and they were busy, but it's a restaurant. There's no excuse for the food to be bad regardless of how busy they get."}
{"text":"Food was ok, and actually came out at a decent speed. Aside from that, the service was embarrassingly slow. Took 20 minutes just for a waitress to take our drink order, in a mostly empty restaurant. After we received our food, we were never checked on, then it took another 20 minutes just to get a to-go box. But I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Servers in this place are awesome but the manager on duty (T) is a snob!! not friendly at all she doesn't deserve to be manager. First time we came here she looked at my husband from up and down (not in a nice way) 2nd time my kids said bye to her and didn't even bother to say bye and ignored my kids! Very rude!! but we still like ihop!! ;)"}
{"text":"The WORST IHOP I've ever been to! We were a party of 2. Beware being seated ALLLLLLL the way in the back by the Emergency Exit door-you WILL be forgotten about. It took 20 minutes to get an omelette because they only have one omelette station yet that's a basic item on the Menu. We found it interesting that by the time we asked for the Manager, our orders miraculously appeared. The Manager was attentive and apologetic and our Server wasn't bad. The KITCHEN however needs to get its shit together.. -__-"}
{"text":"This place is gross.  Everything is loaded with sugary toppings.  My husband's meal had a huge hair in it.  They gave us a $35 coupon to come back again.  We're never going back."}
{"text":"Very impressed!  This is the best IHOP experience we ever had. When we first walked in, there were a lot of people waiting. It did not take long before we were seated.  Cesar, CJ, was our server. He belongs in an upscale restaurant, because this guy was awesome! He was extremely attentive and very friendly. The food came out perfect. This experience could not have been any better!"}
{"text":"My clue should have been the empty parking lot on a Saturday night around 8 pm in Robinson Twp.  My husband and I were seated as we walked in.  Menus were given and drink orders were taken...nice!  Or so I thought.  My husband asked for a fresh cup of decaf. The waitress said she would brew a fresh supply of decaf.  In record time, a carafe was brought out...but with cold bitter coffee.  Asked again for fresh coffee.  Waitress did not take the full cup of nasty coffee away.  We had to ask for creamer so many times. I got a carafe of regular coffee, but when I put the creamer in, it turned a gray color. \"Old coffee!\"  We had no silverware. We had to ask twice for the silverware so we could eat.  After 45 minutes, my husband's breakfast was cold and eggs were snotty. He was afraid to send it back for fear of what they might do to it. But the  bacon was great!  My side salad came out.  I had asked for soup for my 1 side, but was told there was none...that they would have to cook some and it would take awhile. My meal never came out.  My son's order to go was wrong. My waitress was in the back door of the kitchen and kept peeking her head out, but she rarely came out despite my saying \"Excuse Me\" and moving my arm.  I asked for my meal I ordered.  They said your meal was the side salad.  I asked for the manager. I said I am not paying for a meal I did not receive.  She said she would take care of the bill and personally get my coffee and meal.  Begged for ice water. They finally brought my meal out.  I was starving at this point. My husband finished his cold meal long ago.  Cold mashed potatoes...the rest was ok.  Well we are now leaving...still no coffee...and to top it off, I was handed a bill with only my meal removed but was charged $4.00 for a salad that should have been my 1 side with my dinner.  I handed my waitress my bill, said the manager would take care of the entire check, which she didn't.  I never received my promised cup of coffee.  When I mentioned that, there was no apology...just \"do you want a cup to go?\"  NO, i wanted it with my meal!  As we left, the parking lot was still empty...maybe 3-4 cars.  Empty parking lot at IHOP on a Saturday night...BEWARE!"}
{"text":"Breakfast at IHOP is the best. I love pancakes with strawberry and the fabulous french toast..jummy. Coffee is very good an the service was great and friendly. I will be back next year. Greetings from germany"}
{"text":"The service was fast and our waiter was very nice, had a great attitude and treated us like we were first priority. Our servers name chujor and I hope next time my family goes to IHOP that we get him again. Chujor is a very bright young man and he kept a smile on his face the whole time. Looking around it seemed that every table chujor waited on, he always had a good attitude even if someone gave him grief, which shows a lot about him because some people were very rude. Over all chujor was a great waiter for us and my family and I appreciate him."}
{"text":"not happy with the service here at all. our waitress was ClaudiaA who disappeared and didn't come back for 20 minute increments which led our food to come out cold and 20 minutes apart. I will not recommend this place to any friends or family visiting in the area."}
{"text":"My family and I go to IHOP, but we always request for SEAN!!! Hostess says he's always requested and that's because he makes your day and welcomes you like family. He calls my son muscle man and my son always enjoy remember him. I have the same thing all the time and Sean already knows it. So long as he's there and my server we will continue going. Wish there were more awesome people like him!!!"}
{"text":"this Ihop location is really dirty and always has a musty wet floor smell. went there for breakfast and was seated at the very back near the restrooms when the place wasnt even crowded.. and had a horrible waitress who seemed to be rushing me and always left our table in a hurry. and also there was something going on- I don't know if they were going to be inspected, but a manager was lecturing the staff about the coffee machine being dirty and the waiters were cleaning it while serving other people at the same time. the staff was cleaning like they haven't ever before?! my booth had syrup on the back of the chair that hadn't been cleaned. I saw how dirty their rags were when wiping down syrups in the back! where we were seated was right next to the opening of the kitchen. don't waste your time going to this ihop.. gross gross gross!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to this location on a whim today. The restaurant was full but there was no waiting. I ordered their seasonal special which was pumpkin pancakes.  Katie ordered the cheeseburgers off the kids menu.  When our food came out Katie got the adult cheeseburger and not the kids size. Ok I can deal with that. The problem was that Katie ordered pickles as a topping. They brought out pickle wedges. No knife to cut them up into slices or asking a cook to cut them up. \"That's all we have\" could've done more to help the situation."}
{"text":"The server was rude didn't return my thank you or please. While we were there another table complained about their food and my pancakes weren't fully cooked"}
{"text":"Worse IHOP EVER!!! We have tried several times and each time they were significantly under staffed which means not getting your food in a decent time. Not an IHOP issue but a management issue.

Tonight was the nail in the coffin! There was two tables seated, two servers and apparently the mgr who was the cook, yes the only cook. 

Took five minutes to get seated, 10 minutes to get our order taken at which we were told it would be a bit long because there was a large table (1 of the other 2) who would get their food first. Two more tables were sat and everyone got their food but us.... After an hour!

With three kids and it being 8:30pm, figured Denny's would be a better choice. 

Don't go here unless you hate decent service and want to wait an hour for your food. 

Very sad!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this iHop has bad reviews. They were totally awesome! Our waiter was the coolest dude ever and even gave us extra food for free! The place was nice and quiet, relaxed, clean. Food was great! I got the vanilla strawberry stuffed French toast and it was soooo good! Would definitely recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town!  Love love the pancakes!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible, took an hour for us to get our food, I served has come to check on us once"}
{"text":"This is the busiest I have ever seen an IHOP ever! Surprisingly,  the service was great.  Our server Stephenie was awesome... Attentive and did everything she said she would do. The food on the other hand left much to be desired. The temp was like it had been sitting,  the portion size was mini and it wasn't prepared how I wanted. Like I said,  it was uber busy.  Maybe next time I can offer a better review."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed going to Ihop. Something about pancakes taste better when not made at home. The food is always seasoned to taste. I seldom find reason to add salt or pepper. The portions are nice size and I usually don't eat the entire meal.  The meal was prepared as ordered. 
I must say the staff at this Ihop verses the one back home were much more friendlier. The service was great. They didn't let our drinks get empty before they brought more. They frequently checked with us to make sure all was well.
The place is clean and well organized. Plus it was cool and pleasant to sit and enjoy my meal.
I definitely will return to this Ihop in the future."}
{"text":"I came to this IHOP with my family while on vacation. I ordered the Rooty Tooty Fresh \"N Fruity Pancakes. 
The Pancakes were cold and had some sort of black stuff on the bottom. I asked the waitress if she could bring me another order and explained the problem. She was very accommodating and brought me a free Orange Juice with my corrected order.
I immediately lifted the Pancakes to make sure that they weren't just reheated. Sure enough, that's exactly what they were, same Pancakes just heated. 
I told her that this was the same order and that I didn't want anything else. 

We all got up before my family's orders came and decided to go across the street to Denny's. Everything was great over there."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the healthy grain n nut pancakes!! By far my favorite as well as the butter pecan syrup lol Hits the spot!! :D"}
{"text":"Kids fav place! Swedish pancakes!!"}
{"text":"Slow service. We have been waiting for our food for 30 mins now. The manager is unfair as well because we were the first ones who got at the restaurant, but the manager let some other people grab a table. I DONT RECOMMEND THIS IHOP."}
{"text":"I asked for medium well steak tips and I got raw. And when I say raw I mean it was cold and purple in the big pieces. I should have taken a pic but I was too disgusted. 

You'd think I'd get a new plate, nope brought me out same steak I had cut in partial half and put back on my plate with now cold hash browns and cold eggs

You'd also think I'd get I don't know discount(I didn't ask) but nope full price on this meal. 

I know it's I hop so wasn't expecting fancy meal but make an effort so I don't have non cooked food then cold food."}
{"text":"You'll be lucky to get a decent meal here.
The consistency with the food is very off. 
For reasonable service, be sure to go during the day."}
{"text":"If you are lucky enough to get mama Paula, you will have a mountain top moment. Food always a great value. I thought I'd posted this month's ago. Oh well, I'm sure if Paula is still there it's still great!"}
{"text":"It's pretty true about this location.  Went on a Sunday and waited 5 minutes at my tables with servers walking by and ignoring me, no offer of water, no greeting nothing.i finally just ordered something to go. The place wasn't even that busy."}
{"text":"Worst IHOP and worst service. We went to IHOP to get our pancake fix and thinking we will get our food fast for being 1:00 am in the morning with seven waiters working. But no. We ordered waters which we never got. The employees standing around fighting on who is going to take a table of 8. We had a view of the kitchen and saw our food sitting there for 15 minutes with our waiter MIA. What's even worse is the employee who opened a gallon of milk tab with her MOUTH. The only good experience we had was talking to the manager who straightened her childish staff right away and gave us our meal for free. Still didn't get our waters though."}
{"text":"There wasnt but a few customers in here tonight. Maybe like 4 tables ....Total.
We ordered water with no ice got iced water. 
Ordered a chicken quesadilla and asked for extra salsa...... NEVER GOT IT.!!
Ordered a mushroom cheese burger.... It came out swimming in grease and oil . It was soooo bad that the bottom of the burger was soo soggy that when you picked it up your fingers woukd go through the bun.
Sat with empty water glasses for 20 min. With no refills.
Ordered a ham cheese and egg sandwich with onion rings.... Got drench fries. 
Had to ask for condiments 2 or more times.
:(
Not good 
Food was ehhh. 
Service was bad."}
{"text":"Great service and staff is so so friendly. Food is also very good especially the crepes. Even on a busy day, the wait for your food is not a long time."}
{"text":"Pretty brutal service as far as IHOPs go. You can usually depend on an IHOP for a very quick, decent meal. 

The service here was terrible. The server only had 3 tables, and she was openly complaining about how busy she was. She spilled coffee all over our table, and didn't clean it up. It took her about an hour to enter our order.  Drink refills were next to impossible to come by. Our friends showed up after we were seated (at a separate table), and they ordered, ate, and left before our food showed up. A two hour meal is somewhat unheard of at these places. I'd say it was really the server that caused the issue. 

Food was the same as you would expect at any IHOP, consistent."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Good pancakes. Good tasting water. Nothing else to say at this time. (Wait. Who puts cheese sauce on their omelettes? Yuk!)"}
{"text":"I love ihop! Pancakes are delish! Everytime I go I order the (Kids silver 5 w/Grits &Toast! It's only $4.27 ) it's a great place to eat! My favorite waitress is mrs. Paula she makes me feel at home, she knows exactly what I want! I love her to death!  Ihop is awesome for there pancakes and surveys for a free short stack!"}
{"text":"We waited no less than 45 mins for food. However, everyone at this location seemed very nice. Our server was wonderful and attentive. The management staff might just need more training at this location."}
{"text":"My family and I expected a long wait time because it was a busy Saturday afternoon. 15 minutes seemed reasonable so we waited. We did not expect unprofessional service by IHOP's staff. Our server was dismissive and unfriendly. She barely greeted us, complained about how busy she was, generally had a bad attitude, interrupted us as we ordered, and got portions of our order wrong. She dropped things off so quickly, we barely had time to ask for missing items before she rushed away. We were ignored by the server and other staff throughout the meal. At one point the hostess came back to check on the tables in our area, but skipped our table. We had to call after her as she walked away. We were rushed through the meal the few times someone did check on us. The most unprofessional part was probably having to ask for silverware and napkins after the food was dropped off. We then waited quite awhile to receive those items while our food sat on the table in front of us. When we received the silverware, the server was short 2 pairs but didn't seem to notice or care.

My family was patient and polite even as we received terrible service. I've worked in restaurants before so I know how hard it can be, especially on busy days. I'm also aware that the restaurant industry is about flipping tables by getting as many people in and out as quickly as possible. I get it and respect how difficult the work is. However, I've worked at and dined in places where customers were still treated with courteous service even when the restaurant was very busy. 

I called the manager about 20 minutes after we left. She was very polite, took my complaints seriously, and assured me she would address the matter. It was the best service I received during my entire visit to IHOP, so I'm certain this location is capable of doing better."}
{"text":"I'm debating between giving a 1 or 2 star rating. Of course when we went to this location it was busy, but we actually got seated pretty quickly. However my rating is solely based on service here. Although we got seated quickly, no server came to our table for over 20 minutes. We didn't even have water. When we finally saw a server coming around to tables near by we thought she was going to come to our table but she didn't. I saw one server look over at us probably 3 or 4 times but continued on. Don't worry we finally got served but just ordered everything right then so we wouldn't have to wait longer. 

Another issue was that a couple servers and a manager were chatting about customers near our table and were bad mouthing a lady who was sitting by herself. The service here was just horrible too bad it's the only IHOP in this area. Might just do take out next time."}
{"text":"It was good. We got seated right away. Ot ordered quickly and got food fast. Food was good. It was good."}
{"text":"Came in on 4/20/17 and nobody seemed to know that I was waiting to get a table. I didn't see very many customers. Valentino, one of the servers, came from outside and helped me out and I was very pleased with this because even he seemed surprised that nobody had helped me. He got me a booth fast and set me up with a drink and soon I got my food. I was very pleased with Valentino's service how ever I did not like that nobody working in the restaurant seemed to notice me standing there."}
{"text":"0mg ..everything sucked ...server...food was wrong ....bread was old ...didn't separate checks ....took forever to get food ... Wasn't busy"}
{"text":"Server was good- we were happy again w speed of service & efficacy of order

Karina was gone already by late in the afternoon when we arrived- hope to request her next time as our server!"}
{"text":"I love coming to this IHOP. It doesn't matter what time you come in. Always get the best customer service. I'm here at all different hours and I'm just pleased with the service"}
{"text":"This location is family owned. Friendly service. Yummy food. I love that they have hazelnut coffee creamer for my coffee and serve Pepsi too. It's kid-friendly place because my toddler can wander a little bit & the staff is okay with talking with him as I return him to our table. We are semi-regulars here. I only return to places with good service & good food."}
{"text":"Decent place. I've been here a few times with family and the crepes and pancakes are always great! (That's all I get) Sometimes the wait for the food is too long. Last time we went, we waited almost 20 minutes after ordering for our food to arrive. But I guess it was worth it."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, it took like 45 minutes to get our food after we ordered. And the order didn't even come out correctly. It took us about 20 minutes just to order. This place was just remodeled, so you think the service would have been a little better."}
{"text":"Lousy service. They didn't have soup, provolone cheese, tomatoes or egg whites. When we said they had eggs they could make eggwhites the waitress said they were too busy to make them. They kept forgetting to bring drinks. Asked for jelly. Toast was cold by the time jelly arrived. Butter never came. Had to hunt the down waitress to pay. Many other. Customers around us very upset too."}
{"text":"I wish I could give our experience zero stars because that what it was. We sat there for over an hour waiting for our food to come out! We ordered drinks and our breakfast within the first 10 minutes of being there, than we proceeded to wait an hour for our food to come out. Mind you all we are waiting for is pancakes with scramble eggs and sausage and French toast with eggs and bacon; finally we gave up and just left, well actually we were honest enough to pay for our drinks since we did have coffee and juice. This isn't the first time we have gone to this location and had a poor experience, but it's safe to say this will be the last time."}
{"text":"Came to IHOP craving a bunch of onion rings and my last one was undercooked and full of raw bread crumbs, who does this ? Very disappointed not come back"}
{"text":"3rd time we have gotten up and walked out of this ihop! The wait staff is horrible your server will look at you and walk pass your table multiple times all the while serving every other table around you even the one that gets sat after you! Needless to say we will NEVER be going back to this ihop ever again"}
{"text":"This is a newer IHoP, so you would think it'd be a nicer one. It isn't. This location is close to my house, but my daughter and I drive all the way to Power and Baseline because it's so much better than this one. Every time we come to this location the tables are icky and there are always flies. In fact, my daughter and I call this location FLYHOP."}
{"text":"IHOP Update- Hey Yelpers, you know that wild night in Vegas when you wake up feeling like, who is this next to me? And where is my cash?  Here's a good one. So I took my family to IHOP because I wanted Pancakes after work.

I ordered the NY Cheese Cake Pancakes with scrambled eggs and sausage. Overall the Bill was about $54.00 for 4 people. That's right, Pancakes, eggs, sausage with a drink will hit each person about 11 dollars each. Again, it reminded me of a wild night in Vegas.

Touched by a stranger."}
{"text":"5 Stars for service & value. My server Holly was outstanding - friendly, & responsive! The manager also stopped by the table to make sure everything was to my liking! Food was serves quickly which was great because I was on a short lunch break. The menu was what you would expect from an IHOP and the food was good (ham& cheese omelette ). The restaurant was also very clean."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I actually had to rate this location if it was up to me I would have given it a no stars. My job requires me to travel I stopped by this location which I have a couple times before to have a meal around 9:30  last night and could not believe what I heard coming from the kitchen. I don't know what was going on in there it was so loud even the tables around me were in disbelief. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service, even when there are only a small handful of tables being occupied on a weekday evening. Unless you absolutely must have something only IHOP can provide, there are ten other breakfast places in the surrounding area that are much better in terms of quality, cost, and service. Our family of four ordered pancakes and eggs that took 40 minutes to arrive. We thought we had been forgotten. Once there, the hash browns and eggs were cold, the pancakes fresh. Clearly they have a major timing problem in the kitchen. It was also a humid evening and there were box fans blowing in various parts of the room. Why would a brand new building like theirs not have properly functioning air conditioning?  Strange visit all around."}
{"text":"The service was terrible and my cakes were cold as a winter day in Canada. When I sat down there was syrup all over the table and it got all over my pants. You could say I was in a real sticky situation! #jokes #cool"}
{"text":"it's about what you'd expect for an IHOP. I've never had a complaint about the food.  the best waitress is LINDA. she is *awesome*.  I always try to sit in her section."}
{"text":"The best advice I can give is to tell you to request LINDA as your waitress !!!"}
{"text":"I could have gotten past the fact that the staff and servers have the charm and charisma of postal workers, but I could not get past the fact that we waited for 25 minutes with no food and no server came by. This was the second time this place is made me wait a ridiculously long amount of time for very average food. Unless you have a half a day to spend, I do not recommend this location. Always lousy service."}
{"text":"Embarrassing. If I could give half or no stars I would.  As a national chain, IHOP should have some set of minimum standards in terms of service and cleanliness. Understandably, this is not gourmet dining. However, I would take the greasy waffle house or any number of fast food restaurants over this particular establishment. Avoid."}
{"text":"Worst IHOP I've ever been to.  It smelled like sewer, even though they had a scented Plug-In.  I figured once at the table, I wouldn't smell it.  Dee seemed nice but at the same time it seemed painful.  Our food was fine.  What bothered me was when my kids needed to go to the restroom...So we left the table.  Plates were still full.  Got back to the table to find that it was cleared out.  No apologies.  Dee didn't even bother to find a solution...She didn't even talk to me.  I went to pay thinking about everyone needs a paycheck.  Anyway, I asked for the free kid's discount. The cashier/hostess couldn't figure it out.  She went to Dee and I could hear Dee yelling at the hostess that she didn't want to give it to me.  After awhile, the hostess just walked away from Dee and she figured it out on the register on her own.  I don't know why I didn't complain or even paid and even tipped double tax.  I was having a bad day and it just didn't cross my mind how bad the whole experience was until I got home.  Never going to this location ever.  It really smells...BAD!!!"}
{"text":"Waiter was rude and was not friendly at all. It was also really packed and it took awhile for us to be seated. We ended up leaving because of the waiter's attitude. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"I will never go to another over priced IHOP again. This place is terrible. I thought that they are supose to be the king of breakfeast but instead it was the complete oppisit. 

My Family and I waited for almost 1 1/2 hours to eat here and finaly when we sat down and was handed our menus and saw the exciting picutres of amazing looking dishes we all just couldnt wait to dig in! But the waitress which I can not remember her name anyway she took 20 min to just bring us our drinks, I'm not kidding. yeah the place was packed but really are you serruios I have 3 kids one under the age of 7 that has been waiting already for over 1 1/2 to even be seated but to get a stupid apple juice it took 20 min. I could go on and on about how bad the service was here but I'm not. I want to really dig into the food.

They say a picture can tell you a 1000 words, but let me tell you this. The pictures on there menus were completely wrong. Our food was cold and dryed out when we finaly got it. The over cooked hash browns felt like I was eating potato chips with no flavor. The tiny eggs looked undercooked and honeslty I couldnt bring myself to eat them so now on to there famus pancakes. What a disapointment. They looked like yesterdays special and just was not completly impressed with them. I went with the chesecake pancakes, I thouhgt mmmm sweet yummy chessecake. It was more like I need to go to the bathroom and puke. 

We should have just stayed home and cooked it up like I typicaly do on a weekend morning. I do not recomend this place and next time maybe I will just go to Dennys at least there I wont spend a forutne to get a half way decent breakfeast."}
{"text":"This is the worst IHOP i have even been to.  Absolute no service used to eat here all the time now I will never come back.  Last time I was here waited 15 min and no service.  I walked out.  I also spoke to the manager no apology no nothing.  I was angry at him and did used some bad language and instead of trying to calm me down and apology he threw me out.  Will never go to this IHOP again go to Akron way better service."}
{"text":"2nd time I've been here recently. Last time was a to-go order that they gave me a 5 minute wait time for, so I showed up after 15 minutes and they hadn't started it yet. Second time was a dine in. Took several minutes to see our waitress, which can be overlooked. Ordered our food right away with our drinks. 38 minutes later we finally got our two orders pancakes and eggs. Which is mind boggling. Then the strawberries on top were still frozen solid, as was the butter, and one order of the eggs was over easy when ordered to be well cooked. The waitress then turned very unpleasant that I didn't want to drink my eggs and requested only that item be removed, as I didn't want I wait another 40 minutes for the replacement, which I politely kept to myself. Needless to say, less than impressed."}

Solo por mencionar algo. Informamos que íbamos a fumar afuera y cuando regresamos nuestra mesa estaba ocupada. No sugiero que vengan acá"}
{"text":"I will start by saying the food was fine. Nothing too bad; just standard IHOP food. The service, however, was the worst I have ever received at an IHOP or at almost any restaurant I've ever been to. The restaurant itself was unpleasant. It was freezing cold inside, the bathrooms were close to our table and they smelled bad enough that the dining room had a funky urine smell, the syrup bottles were sticky with dried clumps of syrup 
made the syrup difficult to pour, and the 3 tables next to us were filthy from the moment we got there until our food came out. Then the service from the employees was appalling. Our waitress was lackluster to say the least and never offered to refill our drinks. We saw our food sitting on the counter waiting for 10 minutes before the manager finally came over and explained (never apologized) that the cook made regular bacon and sausage so he 'had to fix it' and brought me turkey bacon and sausage. But when I told the manager that the cook was right I asked for regular, not turkey, he told me to just try it and he'd get me what I asked for if I didn't like the turkey bacon. As if that wasn't bad enough he could tell that my boyfriend and I were visibly upset and he took it upon himself to sneakily get his phone out and started taking pictures of us probably thinking we weren't going to pay (we did pay, though). Needless to say we will never be returning to this IHOP location, nor do we recommend anyone ever go there."}
{"text":"After a night of clubbing, who doesn't want some comfort food? Us girls of SinityBounty went with friends after Plush BBW Nightclub. It was close to the strip without being ON the strip. 

It seems to be \"The Place\" to go after a night of clubbing. Awesome. Plenty of comrades in arms (albeit skinny ones)

Food was excellent, but it took forever to get to us. Two servers on a Saturday night? Really? It looked as though the place was regularly frequented by after party people. You can't accommodate for that? 

We weren't even asked if we wanted drinks until a half hour after we were seated. terrible service.

Pros: Good food, good location, big-butt-friendly
Cons: SLOW, SLOW, SLOW and \"I don't wanna be here\" attitude from server.

Elexia, Sierra, and Calypso"}
{"text":"After going to this location over 100 times over 8 years they finally did it. Made a bad enough experience for us to never go back.

Service was good, but it did take a long time to get our food(25mins) for not having every seat filled. Only waited that long for food here once before.

Iced tea was old and tasted bad. 
Correction: I was told they were gonna make more. They didn't and I drank water. Must have served the rest of it to customers that didn't say anything.

Stuffed french toast was made with stale bread
Correction: Manager that rang us up told us that they sometimes put stale bread in by accident. No comp, just \"I'm sorry\" 5 times.

Bacon was a joke, thin and fatty. Didn't complain because thats just the crap they serve everyone.

Should have just went to Bill Johnsons across the street. Bacon is better and of all things, the pancakes are better.

See ya IHOP"}
{"text":"This location is a mess they have full empty tables and outside are many people waiting to be seat. I talk to the person in charge and she say to need to catch up with the kitchen. To me look like no enough employees to take care of costumers.
We finally got a set but still waiting for food already pass 20 minutes."}

{"text":"This place is a train wreck. We waited at least 10 minutes (maybe 15) for a server to come to our table.  Finally I got out of our booth and flagged him down. His name is Lance and he is without a doubt one of the most obnoxious jerks I have ever come across. When I complained about the wait he essentially said that they were short handed and if I didn't like it we should leave. Naturally I walk to the front and asked for the manager. I was told by the hostess that she wasn't there (big surprise). She did give me her card.  I called and left a message but no return call. I will never go to any IHOP ever again. Absolutely pathetic."}
{"text":"It's IHOP...the food is pretty much the same wherever you go.  But our server was awesome--super fast, super helpful, and very friendly.  This is my favorite Vegas location, by far."}
{"text":"What can I say about the worst breakfast experience I've ever had in the 45 or so years I remember eating out. For example food was brought without silverware while the toast had no or very little butter on bread that didn't quite qualify as toast.The eggs ordered over medium were seared with brown. Hash browns were hardly eatable while being  nearly warm and with no flavor or texture. My wife ordered the Colorado omelet and received the Country instead. I won't even go into what the Country Omelet is as I love eggs and this is not what I would call eggs. Waitress said she was sorry but that was the end of it. The highlight of our journey was the balloon guy who was the best ballon guy I've ever seen. He made the neatest Minion that resembled the cartoon  movie more than I thought was possible. I will absolutely never eat at this IHOP again. The Good Egg, Denny's or the Waffle House far exceed the quality and experience of dinning at this dive. If you want the coolest ballon animals ever seen and you don't care about the food then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Came here with my family and our experience was 100% with service. Our server Angel was really impressive. She was professional and was efficient with all her tables. Angel your extremely invaluable! Thank you for your tremendous service!"}
{"text":"This is the most awful cruddy inadequate restaurant I have ever been to. I say here 10 minutes before asking what I want to drink, after taking my order I did not receive my drink till 20 minutes later. It's not that's hard to have costumer service and if you can't fucking do you're fucking job then don't work there. This is the worst dining experience I have ever had"}
{"text":"It's IHOP, and it is what you would expect from a greasy spoon chain. You get what you pay for. Not loving it. 
Next time I want breakfast food, I'm going to Original Pancake House!"}
{"text":"Pros: The place looks old from the outside but decent inside. The host had good customer service and our waitress too. Cons: It took awhile for the food to come out for my wife's order and they ran out of mayo for my fries. And we ordered sausage not bacon for with our pancakes."}
{"text":"Came to have breakfast for dinner this evening. There were 2 other tables in our area and the restaurant was quite empty. However we waited for an hour and never got our food. We got up and left with the other table that was there. At that point the waiter who never checked on us for the hour rushed out and said its almost ready. Needless to say we didn't believe him and we left. Extremely disappointed in our service!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. My husband and I went there for breakfast and were told there was a 15-20 min wait. There were no available seats inside, so we sat outside (I'm in my 7th mo of pregnancy and didn't feel like standing). 20 min later, a host came out and asked another party of 2 (who got there after us) if they'd like to sit outside, and if so, they could seat them immediately. They never came out with that offer for us. 20 minutes after that, we were still waiting. Meanwhile, the multiple parties who arrived 5-15 minutes of us all got seated. I'll never go to this iHop again."}
{"text":"In town for business, went to IHOP for a quick breakfast. Ordered one of the breakfast combos with scrambled eggs. Once the food came out the eggs were sunny side up. Usually not a big deal so I let our server know I had ordered scrambled. She proceeded to scoop the two sunny side up eggs off of my plate onto a smaller dish flicking food onto my lap. I have NEVER seen a server scoop food off of someone's plate at a table. If you got the order wrong either take the plate back to fix it or bring out the correct item."}
{"text":"This is the worst ihop location I have ever been to. We definitely not be returning. The servers suck the food takes forever. Servers can't communicate with each other. It took 55 mins to get two orders to us because our sever left & no one put in our order. Worst ihop ever! If you are in a hurry don't come here you'll be stuck for a minimum of a two hours."}
{"text":"This place is very dirty,the food was swimming in oil,the staff are young and not well trained at all.....Denny's is up the street,I suggest you go there!!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I did not have to even leave one star! 
Do not waste your time or money!!! The service was fair however when I asked to have my turkey sausage cooked on the well done side I was given a shock!!!! I ordered a side of hash browns and because I wanted well done sausage the cook decided to pluck a hair from god knows where and place it inside my hash browns..... The follicle on the hair was still attached!!!!! So it was intentionally pulled from his body and placed inside my food. Glad I inspect my food before I eat it! .....to the waitress that served us and gave my kids the yogurt,thank you for your great service and to the cook....Carma is a B*$%H!"}
{"text":"Bad experience!! Be careful cause the servers would overcharge the tip! I left $8 on Cash on a $30 check and he added $10 on my credit card. Try to get in touch with the GM and he was very careless and showed no interest on my problem, then he said was gonna check and be in touch with me to solve the issue and still haven't heard from him. Stop by at the restaurant and he was gone, I called him and he was OFF , tried again and they put me on hold for 35min. Definitely not coming back to that location worst customer service ever!!"}
{"text":"It's a waste of time coming here they ignore you and get mad when you tell them your order is wrong. Needs new mgt and better servers!!!!"}
{"text":"Do not stop here! If no stars was an option, I'd rate it that way. Had a tranny for a server, no big deal, some are great people, this one was lazy and service was poor. Worst Ihop experience ever.  Food was crappy, no silverware, the hostess brought our drinks and food since the idiot waiter/ress couldn't.  Checkout time came, tried to use 2 gift cards I purchased in Ohio, 1 worked, 1 allegedly did not. Get back home to check and the balance is miraculously zero. So not only was the service crappy in the hood of charlotte,  but the dumb asses ripped off me and my family. Save yourself and drive a little while longer. Cant say you'll have better luck in charlotte, but hopefully you'll save yourself the nightmare of this rathole"}
{"text":"What ever happen to good service?? Went to ihop and the girl I had did not seem happy, I asked for a hamburger and she did not seem like she knew what I was talking about and kept saying you want a cheeseburger. When I got my check she charged me for a cheeseburger but I clearly had a burger with no cheese. It's not worth even telling her to change it, I guess no tip for her. I always thought when you worked in a restaurant and you get tips you will do your best to get a good tip. Will not eat at this Ihop again."}
{"text":"I wanted some ice cream so I got the sundae. Our waitress brought out the food and then 10 mins later brought my ice cream. Within my ice cream is a pile of turd looking \"hot fudge\". I was disappointed. My chocolate should have been drizzled not in a pile down the side of the bowl"}
{"text":"Good food, yet poor service... During my last and other recent visits the food is good, yet the service really sucks! Last night, I had watched a customer who repeatedly got up from the back of the restaurant and headed to the servers station asking for their beverage, a change in beverage( due to server error, remind you I know this because I was sitting close to the server stations.  Now my experience was not that great either.  We were seated immediately and of course asked what beverage would me and my guest like whilst In the process of sitting. This just shows me the manager was in a hurry. Our server came and greeted me and my company and politely introduced herself.  That's a plus!! Upon delivering our beverages.. The server was rushing and  kind of slammed our drink a on the table.. I thought nothing of it.. Now it took a while before our order was taken, we had no table settings, I can understand that, I did not have my meal yet.  Now, we placed our order, and we waited, we patiently waited and my company had finished her beverage.. It took her a while before she could get a refill.. :( still no settings.. Food was cooked And I see it was delivered up on the cooks window.. No server to deliver our food.. Minutes passed... Food finally delivered. Server delivered our food in haste, not giving me time to ask for settings.. Minutes later.. I got the manager's attention.. Finally.. Settings.. Refill, an hour later. I'm not exaggerating here. The quality of service desperately needs attention!"}
{"text":"The worst.  Breakfast is always served cold or lukewarm.  Happens all the time.  Always disappoint never satisfied with the food"}
{"text":"The absolute worse meal of my LIFE! Soggy cold bacon and black specks in my scrambled eggs. The fruit looked like it was from an old can left over from the 80's! I feel like I am going to PUKE"}
{"text":"Place was packed at 9am on a Saturday morning but I like that kind of atmosphere. Folks out enjoying a good breakfast! Our waitress was new so while that's understanding, she didn't seem to eager to learn. I ordered the raspberry and white chocolate pancakes and while they didn't look much like the picture on the menu, they were good (but small). But most disappointing of all was their lack of a gluten free menu. Be aware that they put flour in their omelettes too! Not many options if you need a gluten free diet."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Paul W.'s comment. Red Robin was a 40 minute wait, so we went to IHOP. Big mistake. I talked to the GM so I won't say anything else on here. Avoid for now until things turn around."}
{"text":"Super crowded. Finally seated after 20 minutes. The host/hostess at the front were yelling names SO loud that it made it very unpleasant. When my food was served the extra plate I asked for, it had caked on egg yolk. Then, to top it off I found a hair under my pancakes. GROSS. The manager was nice and didn't charge me for my meal but no one at the table had an appetite anyways, so I think they should have just not charged us for anything. I will never go to IHOP again. Doesn't seem they even have simple cleaning under control. Disgusting."}
{"text":"I normally don't go to this IHOP and I won't return. They messed my food up, sent it back. Brought it out the second time, still wasn't right. The hash browns were so hard I couldn't eat them. The bathroom was flooded and only one stall open, but with water all over the floor. The manager offered me 10% off my bill. My mom stepped in and said, no! Hers should be free. Poor management!"}
{"text":"The foodin this ihop is fantastic, the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the lines in this ihop is extraordinarily long so theres always a 15-30 minute wait"}
{"text":"I have been sitting here waiting for basic breakfast food for nearly an hour. Why am I still here?  Well, it's just shy of midnight and I'm hungry!  I want to leave, but I'm afraid my choices at this point are limited and I can't risk having to start waiting all over again somewhere new.  Hmmm...just heard the waitress tell the guests at the table near mine that the kitchen messed up their order and asked if the wanted to take the food to go.  I also noticed that one guest at that table had his food while the other waited. They were here before me. Did I mention that I'm hungry?  I am starting to wonder if I might die from starvation in an IHOP!  I feel like the biggest idiot for sitting here waiting. Better be some awesome eggs in my future..."}
{"text":"It was like a collusion amongst the whole restaurant to be as slow as possible. It took 15 minutes just to get our order taken and about 30 minutes to get our food.  They are very disorganized. The only thing that was the fastest was when we got the check and them running the credit card....that's ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Ok. Its an old IHOP on the strip near the Sahara. I eate here a few times during my stay and I'm pleased that within 5 minutes we had our table - no matter how busy they were.  Food was consistent every time and the staff does what they are here to do - sling hot cakes at a small busy old IHOP."}
{"text":"I do not know if it was the fault of our server or the cook can't read, but I had the Country Omelet and asked for American Cheese on the inside only and when it came the cheese was on the outside.  I sent it back, and the server said they were remaking it, but all they did was scratch off the cheese and sour cream and put sour cream back on.  Omelet was room temp at best.  We asked for well done English Muffins, and they came out hardly toasted.  My husband at the Sampler and asked for all the meat to be cooked, bason crisp, sausage well done, and ham grilled.  Bacon was limp, sausage seared on one side and the ham was cold.  The first time we visited this IHOP, my husband asked for dry toast and it was drenched in butter.  But we decided to give it another chance.  This will be the last time we eat at this particular IHOP in particular, and will think twice before we go to another IHOP.  The IHOP in Casa Grande, AZ also has major problems with cooking the order the way it is ordered, and we had high hopes for this one because we had moved and thought it had to be different.  We were wrong."}
{"text":"Save yourself some grief and just run away... water tates like chlorine so in case you eat here drink lots of water... it may stop food poisoning. ... the french toast had a soggy wet egg taste and texture."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I love ordering take out from iHOP to eat for breakfast but its so disappointing when we order and they hand it to us and we get to work and open up the bag and half of the order is missing especially when I asked to verify that that was all of it! They need to learn how to manage their orders."}
{"text":"Always go with the family. We get seated relatively quickly and the servers are very nice and accommodating. 

Food is acceptable just like other IHOPs. Still trying to figure out if their pancakes are frozen or not....sometimes the tops just come right off."}
{"text":"I've been here three times. All employees are very nice and inviting. However, they are very unorganized. The last time I visited I left with no food. I ordered over the phone and was told the food would be ready in 20 minutes. I got there 30 minutes  after i called and I waited another 30 minutes just to find out my order was never put in.  It's going to be hard to get me back in this place."}
{"text":"Diana was amazing thanks for the wonderful service it's my number one pet peeve and she rocked it =) food was great and fast we had kids and diana handled it well."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying I never go into IHOP or any similar restaurant with super high expectations.  However, when I'm usually not too disappointed in the food or customer service.  This occasion has me saying \" I will never go to IHOP again.\" When I arrived it was packed, I was seated quickly and so I was not to worried. I saw they had a ton of staff, at least a 1-3 person ratio, and 4 red shirted bussers and hostess. So again i wasn't worried. After sitting there over 15 minutes, someone finally asked us what we would like to drink, i asked if he was our server, he said yes, I told him we were ready to order. It took him another 5 minutes to get our Ice Teas, then he disappeared and did not come back. Here is where it got really bad, The tea tasted soooo gross i spit it back into the glass. My husband and I could only handle the one sip. It tasted like it has sat out over night or something, so i flagged him down and told him they were disgusting we will take two waters. He was a little quicker with the water, dropped them off and ran off again. My water had coffee grounds? floating in it. I said....GREAT. I grabbed another waiter seeing as ours was MIA, asked for another glass. After he took our order, we sat for another 30-40 minutes and finally said \"Done!\". Grabbed our stuff and left. It was busy I get that, but 3 different tables got served before us even though they came after us. We did not order a ton of food. I will never go to IHOP again, this has forever burned my opinion of them. I felt bad we left with our order being made, I hate wasting food. But, I am glad I did not stay, seeing as the tea was bad the water was dirty. I ended up going to country boys, and it was AMAZING. I say avoid this IHOP at all cost."}
{"text":"I do not believe I have ever wanted and almost did dine and dash on IHOP tonight. Perhaps breakfast is much better than their dinner. If I wanted instant mashed potatoes (that needed more water) and Kraft mac n cheese...I could have simply made this from home. Almost 3.00 for black coffee, that was rip number 2. The food was simply horrible and the prices were ridiculous. Seriously a quick cheeseburger from anywhere and a coke would have been much more satisfying and a fraction of the cost. Never again..."}
{"text":"IHOP is always good. Been to several and this is my favorite location. They have plenty of parking, and no busy street or traffic to fight. I've been here several times. Yeah sometimes service is slow, sometimes it takes awhile to get a table, but overall service is good, food is good and the prices are not to bad. At my recent trip, we sat down quickly bacause we asked to sit outside ( TIP alert - they will usually seat you right away if your ok with sitting on their patio) It was late in the morning, hadn't eaten a thing despite having been up since 5. Ordered the  fajita omelet. It came quickly, and hit the spot. Will I come back? Could be there now."}
{"text":"Second time we went and they were not making things listed on their menu.  Went specifically for their heavily promoted Crepe Cake, but they didn't feel like making it that day.  Won't go back to be disappointed again."}
{"text":"Good service early in the morning plus food was hot right off the grill no wait time wow"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. My boyfriend and I came in around 7:30 and the waitress was nothing but rude. She rolled her eyes at me and raised her voice when I asked her if I could get steamed broccoli instead of hash browns. Um, rude much? And the food came out about 30-40 minutes after we placed our order and it came out incorrect! I told our waitress and she again, rolled her eyes and gave me attitude! Never coming back here again. Save your money and go to somewhere else like Mickie's Dairy Bar and Denny's."}
{"text":"I called numerous times over the course of 30 mins to place a to go order and nobody answered the phone. How do you not answer the phone for 30 mins? So ridiculous."}
{"text":"Just got back from a \"meal\" of steak and eggs here and I'm still not sure it's not going to burst thru my chest and attack me... AGAIN!

HORRIBLE FOOD.  GREAT WAITSTAFF. GAHHH"}
{"text":"Food is always great, usually have a pretty good wait, servers are hit and miss here."}
{"text":"My family and I were craving breakfast so we decided to come to IHOP tonight. I'm so happy we came here because every staff member was beyond pleasant to us! Tyler greeted us with the sweetest smile & Kim V was absolutely the best waitress we've ever had! She not only was personable & kind but also served us with a sense of urgency. We never had to ask for refills on our drinks because she would refill them before they got completely empty. Even the busser Jose S was so nice to us. If you want great food & even better service come to this IHOP :) we'll def be back soon."}
{"text":"Very Good breakfast !! Nothing to impress me!! Always IHOP  is the best, my server JUAN !! Very kind and attentive!!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to the opposite side of the 101 and after trying the ones by my new home I have realized that coming to this IHOP is worth the drive. I have not only had some excellent service when I go (for an IHOP) but the food has been consistently good. Never burned and I never waited more than I should to receive my meal. Also have had management interaction here just stopping by to check on us, which is unusual for me, they make me feel valued. Keep it up."}
{"text":"iHop is good but this one sucks! They won't allow any type of substitutions causing you to buy another combo meal to get the side item you want is ridiculous.  BS"}
{"text":"So Ihop is a run-of-the-mill pancake house, but it's still a nice cheap place to have a sit down meal. I think their menu has improved, more selections at least. The hot chocolate is pretty darn divine for such a place. And this location is as good as an Ihop gets. I've been multiple times but the last time was great because our waiter was so friendly. He was a big guy with a dry sense of humor that made us chuckle. Admittedly he had a tough time because some school dance had taken place that night, and he was 1 of only 2 waiters working the unexpected crowd. But, he still tried to apologize and did his best. We appreciated the effort and I got to satisfy my craving for crepes. No matter what one might think, Ihop has the best crepes near me. The swedish lingonberry ones are soooo gooood, I always order them."}
{"text":"Bad service, even worse food. Everything looks dirty. Food was under cooked. Area is horrible and staff gossip all day next to your table due to tiny environment."}
{"text":"Wow, shaking my head. Last night was the worst experience I've ever received at a restaurant. First, our table was 'clean' and yet IT.WAS.NOT. It was still sticky, and food crumbs remained. Then my iced tea tasted like when you can tell the pot hasn't been cleaned in a while, you know, that 'stale' taste. Then we put in an order of mozz sticks. They came, the waiter said 'we're just waiting on the marinara sauce'. We sat there for about 10-15mins and decided, well, we should just eat them as it. Oh, and did I mention we never received our plates, napkins or silverware?!?! The waiter never came back to take our 'regular' order. Oh, and can I say the smell of weed was all around us !! It would become more potent at times, someone had to have had a blunt hidden or something. My friend and I said that place was like when the teacher is out sick and the classroom is pure chaos cuz the substitute doesn't give a fudge. And the wait staff had their coats on !! Were they trying to disquise themselves as customers??There seemed to be no one in charge there !! Oh and the ladies room was FOUL !! Every stall was n-a-s-t-y !!!
I am just so sad because I love Ihop."}
{"text":"When me and my boyfriend walked into ihop, there was a baby playin in the middle of the walkway,  which it also didnt smell that great, I'm assuming because of the baby's diaper. .which to start off isn't very mouth watering when you walk into a restaurant. Secondly, we stood at the host stand, in front of what she looked like to be \"the manager,\" and a server. They were talking maybe 4 mins before she said to the server,  \"go ahead and seat them.\" No Hello, no Welcom to ihop, nothing. Then the server starts to get the menus but is taking awhile so another server comes in front of him and starts get them.  Then the guy server asks a older server that's walking by if she wants to take us and she goes \"noooo\" & then the girl that has the menus turns around to the guy server that was talking to the manager when we walked in,  and he goes \"i dont want them\" and walked away and the girl looks up at us and kinda sighs in disbelief and says \" i guess ill take you guys, right this way.\" She was good, but new, food was great. But by far the wierdest experience at ihop. Like what the hell"}
{"text":"Horrible! Never order pick up!!! They fuck it up every time. Even after you tell them to please make sure it's done right because you've had issues in the pass where it was wrong. My husband placed his order at 8:20. He arrives and pays at 8:43. He he notices that his country fried steak has the gravy on top, which he ordered on the side. So he informed the cashier and she stated we can remake it. At this point my husband was like whatever I don't want to because other food would get cold. So he gets in to his car and he checks the whole order just to make sure. Sure and be  behold the kids meal was wrong. So he goes back into IHOP and has them fix the whole order. He waits other 10 min. The cashier gives him back the order and assured everything was in there. At no point while he was waiting did a manager ever talk to him. To even offer a apology for the inconvenience. 

So he arrives at the house 9:15 he starts giving everybody the food and to find out that they didn't give us the full stack of pancakes we ordered. So now obviously he's livid. So I call IHOP and speak to a manager and tell what happened and that's it's not the first time. I told her I wanted a refund and she says that they don't do refunds. I told her I wanted to return everything and a refund. She told me the only thing she could do was give me two free entrées and next time when I call  to asked to speak to a manager and put in my order with them to make sure it was done right. That's sad that I have to talk to a manager to maybe ensure that my order comes out right. I told her I didn't want that I just wanted to return everything. She's like the two free entrées it's like it's $16 I  started to laugh and say OK but I paid more than that. How is that helping me. We didn't even eat the food. Because by now the foods cold waiting to see if I could to to a manager to return. So, now I'm out of food and money. I will NEVER go to this location again. I'm going to contact the general manager because this is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"It amazes me that, after reading the comments here, that this iHop is still open. The location must be the key. Their third and final chance came and went without me getting so much as coffee. I was seated and given a menu, and that is where it ended. FIFTEEN minutes later, I walked out the door, as NO ONE came to the table. The waitress who was supposed to wait on me was talking to someone she knew, having a conversation peppered heavily with 'F' this and 'F' that, and so on. I will not give iHop corporate the time of day on this one, as they have BS'd me twice, in that they said they would handle the situation. This place was refurbished not long a go, and it already looks like it did before. Dirty. Broken. There is nothing here for anyone, unless they want to spend a lot of money for terrible food and poor service, served in a health code violation."}
{"text":"Today was my second time visiting IHOP. Both times with my mother and we had a great experiance. Eggs were a little brown, but that was the only thing. Everything else was good."}
{"text":"Decent food and service- hey, it's a diner- if you want flawless food & service go elsewhere and pay $50. plus. Great breakfast menu!!! Will be back!!"}
{"text":"We moved to the eastside from the westside two years ago. IHOP is always a favorite with the kids. I have given this restaurant several chances. They have been hiring since we moved here. They are always understaffed and the service is slow. Even if the service is slow, you can still have an attentive server. NOT true here. The food is mediocre at best, and my daughter was ACTUALLY given frozen Mac n cheese once, which I had to send back, the waitress disappeared for 20 minutes, while everyone else at our table was well into eating their meal, my poor daughter was still waiting (we all gave her some of our food), waitress reappears WITHOUT the Mac n cheese, asks if we want refills, when I again remind her of the mac n cheese. She apologizes, goes and gets the Mac n cheese...which at that point was dry and hard. I have been there probably 10 times. ONE time out of the ten visits was a positive experience with the food being good as well as the service. I'm over giving this place chances. We will just spend the extra money and go to Bob Evans."}
{"text":"I took my family here for a late breakfast and was seated pretty quickly. The waitress also came by soon after that and took our orders. We had to wait over 40 mins to get our food..... I had three kids under 12 with me and they were very frustrated and antsy to say the least. After complaining to our waitress she said, \"I've already told the manager and I'm mad about your food being late too!\" Well the manager NEVER came over to say anything to us, not even an apology or small discount! Poor , horrible service! Never going back!"}
{"text":"yummy food, surprisingly good service considering it was really crowded, even provided me with a telephone book.  ihop will always rule over denny's!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I ordered pancakes ,eggs, and bacon. It was pretty good and I liked it. But it was kind of dirty. Food was good, service was good, and was a good place but was just a little dirty"}
{"text":"I went, they said it will take 10 mins to get seated. I went after 10 mins,they said 5 or 10 mins, i said 5 or 10 mins. she said 10 more mins, so overall i have to wait 20 mins then why dont you tell me on the first place itself. Really bad experience. Please do better service in future and get some automated system."}
{"text":"I come here because of the coffee and service. But for some reason the service getting slower everyday. The price is pretty reasonable and my boyfriend loves the unlimited pancakes.
It's best to come here midnight . It's not crowded and service is quick. Thank goodness they're open 24hrs...lol... and they have 55+ so I will definitely bring my 55+ friends and relatives at IHOP. Can't go wrong with that price.
So long story short. This place is good when your hungry and in the budget. Don't forget the delicious coffee."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I go there almost every weekend with my mom and sisters. The staff is always friendly and the wait is never too long even though it's usually pretty busy."}
{"text":"Burn French toast long time to bring us our food pancakes to small ham pieces shrink little bit of hashbrown not going back to that place it used to be pretty good I wonder what happens"}
{"text":"Service wasn't that great, and the french toast wasn't really much more than literally toasted bread with no flavor."}
{"text":"We went here as a second option to Dennys down the street which had to long if a wait. The waiter was nice but the service was a bit slow and the food was no bueno! I've been to a few ihops here and there and they are usually good for a quick stack of pancakes and some eggs and such. This one however was not to usual quality that I've experienced at other location. For $38 (with tip) for two people I would expect better. I'd pass if I was you..."}
{"text":"Ok I've gone to IHOP for years all over the country but today changed all that for me not only was the service horrible the food was less than microwave quality I will never ever go to this IHOP again. The manager should be fired as well as the entire staff. I know these are strong statements but that's how bad it was my fiance tipped only out of obligation."}
{"text":"For about 6 years I would frequent this particular ihop. Its closest to my parties homes thus convenient. The last time I went we where seated quickly and all was normal until our waitress told us the manager had left 2 hours ago and no one had heard from him,she also said it was confusing since this was her first day. Confusing but decided to just be patient. Got out food in a tomimely manner and began eating, food was a bit over done on my half then my friend picks up her Burger takes a few bites only to then notice a bug on her plate. It would have not been so bad if we hadn't noticed the bug had been cooled with her food. Haven't gone back to that particular ihop since I'll deal with a longer drive for cleaner service."}
{"text":"Usually like to dine in during late hours. Ordered the appetizer sampler numerous of times and was always dry and burnt. Service is slow. Asked for a side of honey mustard and the waitress returned 10 minutes later. There were only 2 other table at the time. I had always come hungry. Never left happy :("}
{"text":"Worst food I've had from and IHOP ever. I got half the amount of toast, the hash browns weren't even remotely the size in the picture and the eggs were over cooked. I've gotten better food at a Waffle House on a bad day."}
{"text":"Always have a great experience here. Never bad service and the food is perfect every time. Don't really know why it has such bad reviews on yelp. My boyfriend and I have been going out of our way to go here for 3-4 years. The one in Elyria is the one you want to avoid."}
{"text":"Great eggs and turkey sausage! I always seem to have a problem at this location with getting a light and fluffy waffle.....is that too much to ask? Nevertheless, the staff tries hard to make things right."}
{"text":"I come here time to time and every time customer service is on point. Even tho when I order my food to go, I wait about 10-15 mins. Food is good and on point. The servers check up constantly to make sure everything is good."}
{"text":"First of all, I love Ihop and I don't have one in my hometown, so everytime I'm on the road I have to hit up an IHOP. This place was Crazy on a Saturday morning at 9:30 (poor timing on my part), But regardless, our server was very friendly and accomidating, I got stuffed french toast, the hubby got a chicken fajita omlet and the tot got a chocolate funny face pancake. I think the pancake was the best. It tasted like a partially cooked chocolate chip cookie! mmmm. It was kidda close quarters in the dining area, but all in all, was not that bad."}
{"text":"I can't get enough IHOP (This is probably because I don't have one where I live...) Everytime I'm out of town I make sure to find an IHOP. (I have driven 30 miles out of where I am to get it) 

This one was clean and the food was good. The server was a little lax in the service. After a 2 hour drive me and my fellow adventurer just wanted a restroom, and it took them 30 minutes to clean it... 

Probably number 2 IHOP on my list."}
{"text":"I gave then 1 star because its not possible to leave 0  stars. I orders a to go order so it would be faster and i waited there for 1 hour and 15 min. That is unacceptable.  I kept seeing people that came in after me to dine in leave before me! How is that possible! 
 Not only that but i payed 3 dollars for them to give me a half full cup of hot chocolate.  That is ridiculous.  I will not be coming back here. 
Customer service was not good either the manager was yelling at the workers left and right making the workers act in a hurry and give poor service."}
{"text":"Pretty bad!!! I know this restaurant is new, so hopefully it will improve over time. The service was terrible. It looks like the average age of the servers is about 18, and I don't think any of them have waited tables before or had any restaurant experience. We waited about 30 minutes for our food. My husband ordered the pablano omelet and it was ok, although it wasn't hot when he got it. I ordered the country fried steak. BIG MISTAKE. It was fried to the point of shoe leather, just a huge overfried mess on the plate. We had to ask for silverware, I had to ask for the hash browns that come with the breakfast, and I had to ask for butter to put on the cold toast. Our server just didn't get it at all.  Then when I was paying the check, I had the pleasure of witnessing two of the female servers get into an argument! This place either needs to close its doors and retrain EVERYONE, or get some EXPERIENCED servers and cooks in there to mentor and oversee things for awhile."}
{"text":"Can't actually review this place because I was never acknowledge or seated.  I went here with my wife on 25 Nov 2017 at around 10pm.  We waited for 10 minutes to be seated or even acknowledged but that never happened.  So we left and went to Denny's where we were promptly acknowledged and seated.  IHOP if ur going to be in the business of feeding people then u ought to feed them or at the very least acknowledge them!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was Tanya R, she was very rude and when i showed her the hair in my food, she said \"what do you want me to do about it\" with an attitude. I told her she should be more nice, and she just gave a very rude look and said \"I'll cash you out when you are done\" and left the table. Not only did she get our order wrong, but she was so rude and had no concern for the hair in our food, watch out for this horrible waiter!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and we are trying out the local IHOP. Pretty steady crowd for a Wednesday morning. After we ordered, it took 30 minutes to get our food. Our waitress Jeanne didn't seem concerned. She said, your ticket is next. I asked how long is next. She said idk and walked away. Food finally comes and there is no apology for it being late. Even if it's the norm, you should still have great service. 

Probably first and last time here."}
{"text":"First time eating at this IHOP and it was a very nice experience. The service was great and the food was hot and delicious. We ordered the Double Dipped French toast special with scrambled eggs and hash browns and a Chicken Citrus Pecan Salad. We both left happy! This is a new restaurant and it is clean and beautiful. We will be back. Mia was our server and she did an awesome job."}
{"text":"I had not been here for many, many years but we had a 2 for 1 coupon and were looking for some late night breakfast for dinner so we decided to try it. I was sorely disappointed that we did, even with the coupon.  I had the ham, onion and bell pepper omelet and pancakes.  The cheese was not melted on top and I tried to push the cheese underneath the omelet so that it would melt; the eggs in the omelet were not light and fluffy; the pancakes were okay but by no means as good as Stoney's in the same parking lot as IHOP. I used the old fashioned syrup it was of Log Cabin quality however the remaining flavored syrups had a very artificial taste.  My hubby got a stack breakfast, I think it was an english muffin, egg, hollandaise and it had fresh spinach which was a plus, however, the \"crispy\" bacon as stated in the menu was more like \"super limp' bacon. He asked the waitress if there was anyway that they could crisp it up and she retorted \"they make it fresh\" I am still confused how that explains limp bacon.... nonetheless she took it away and I could hear her call back to the kitchen. The replacement back was better, but not by much. He also ordered iced tea, I realize that the price of drinks has gone up, but I was surprised that ice tea at ihop would cost $3. The hash browns were clearly frozen, although again I realize that most breakfast places here use frozen hash browns.  With a coupon we paid $20.  Coupon or not we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I came here tonight at 10 pm, and the resteraunt was full of a bunch of panzy, animal like, horizon high school kids. Now I know that sounds mean, but they were literally standing up and yelling, throwing things, screaming across the reateraunt....and not being polite or respectful to other quests. The thing that bothered me the most is that I told multiple waiters to get a manager to ask them to act like humans, and that never happend!!! The food was good, and our waitress was sweet...but management needs some help, if they are allowing this behavior. I was informed by multiple employees that these kids come every Friday night so I would avoid this location!!! I Won't Come Back, I Don't Have Enough BOTTLES Of advil To Handle That, nor do I Have the patience."}
{"text":"Ok so we all know that when it comes to chain restaurants, the food is pretty much the same everywhere. However, that doesn't mean reviews aren't important and I just ha to write one for this location.

First, the restaurant is very bright and clean and seems very well maintained. I've been here when it's been extremely busy as well as nearly empty, and regardless the food always comes quickly. 

The nicest thing about this particular IHOP though is how friendly and wonderful the staff is. So kind and welcoming and it makes a typical breakfast experience really enjoyable.

Make sure to tip these employees well because they rock!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have ate at this location once before and it was ok. But we visited for breakfast Saturday morning and were seated at a dirty table and had to ask twice to get it wiped down. Both orders placed were exactly the same and when they finally arrived one had scrambled eggs instead of over easy medium. My eggs were not over medium but raw in the center where the white was actually clear and very under cooked. It all ran into the rest of the food on the plate which made it all unedible for me. The toast was cold and hard and the bacon strips which consisted of one and three quarters slices was the only edible thing since it was on the edge of the plate.. The manager did take my meal off the bill but this was the worse breakfast I have been served from any dining establishment. I won't get into the waitstaff but it was mediocre at best. This location won't get my business again."}
{"text":"FYI about yelp check-ins at IHOP. I checked in for breakfast today. I ordered my usual, egg white veggie omelette. If you check in on yelp & order an omelette, you can't redeem the free order of hash browns unless it's printed out!!!! Why bother??? :/"}
{"text":"Wow came here on sat at 12 pm we did get seated right away .10 min later the waitress got our drink order didn't ask if we were ready to order we were! Another ten min goes by no drinks no order. My son was very thirsty so I asked another waiter if we could get his apple juice .He said yes and then I saw him talking to our waitress. A thew min later we got our drinks and she took our order this took like 20 min. She never gave us silverware so we got it off another table. She never came back except to bring the check I asked for a to go cup. we paid  the bill $42. I am a waitress too so I left a $10 tip. Then we sat a waited 10 mins for my to go cup. Got home and none of the food sat well with us. Never again will I go to Ihop"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was AWFUL. I have never felt more shooed out of a restaurant in my life. I was having breakfast with my father who I hadn't seen in a year and our waiter Brandon basically completely ignored us until we were done. Once we had finished our meal, he came every 4-5 minutes to ask us if we had any plates or kept asking if we had paid our check, which he was aware we had as we asked how we would pay it and after he answered our question he saw my father walk up to the register. I am appalled with the way we were treated. I have always loved IHOP but I will not be coming back to this one."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Service was very good.  Restaurant is in dire need of a remodel, and the music was so loud that we had to raise our voices to be heard.  But we would return because of the staff and food.  I was on a business trip for a week,  and had the best eggs of my trip here."}
{"text":"Ordered poached eggs, was served hard boiled eggs.
Pointed this out to waitress, cashier/manager.
Had no time to wait to be disappointed again.
Never again at this dump!"}
{"text":"Terrible, just terrible. The hamburgers were sitting under the heat lamps the entire 20 minutes we waited to be seated before we walked out. Entire staff count 4. That included 2 cooks. One waitress was so slow she just kept walking in front of the food under the lamp and looking at it and not serving it. I wouldn't want that food that was sitting there. 

Don't go to this location, bad service before and we thought we'd give it another chance several months later. In this case, time didn't make a difference as it still was terrible. If I could give it half a star I would."}
{"text":"We were excited to go to the new ihop with our two kids, so we went for dinner tonight. Place was relatively busy, but there were quite a few open tables. 20 minutes after being seated, we still hadn't been even looked at by a server. We had no choice but to go someplace where we had a better chance of being served. Like literally anywhere else. We weren't the only ones that walked out for this reason. We will probably visit other locations in the future, but not this one."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited over an hour and sat at the table for 15 minutes before any service. Food was normal iHop quality. Walk out worthy"}
{"text":"This was a very busy IHOP. But the staff and manager was very accommodating and the service was impeccable!! Best IHOP I have gone to eat,"}
{"text":"The greeter was so friendly and welcoming. Then our waiter was also! Refreshing to see the smiles!"}
{"text":"I don't understand when I'm the only one standing out there waiting to pay and she finally does come she keeps taking people and seating them even if they're new and they just keep coming in when I've been sitting here for a long time already more than five minutes for sure that was really irritating when you're a greeter learn how to see people after you help somebody who's been waiting longer than the rest of them."}
{"text":"Jebus!
IHOP no, no this is not an IHOP it's a place where scumbags and druggies hang.

I love ihop, but this is a location that you would think would keep clean, have friendly staff BUT let me stress the clean part because this place was far from it.

There was some very suspect people in the booth at the other corner of the place that well, can anyone say drug deal????

many people who visit Vegas tent to stick to the \"pretty\" places, but i like to venture out and see what a place is really like...

Vegas is a city on the grow, and thats why this kinda crap needs to be cut short..wanna deal go home deal from ya house.

As for the location this is just south of the strat and on the same side, its right near a tattoo parlor which if you want to get a bit of ink and wanna sit in the window on show while they do it, thats the place to go.


IHOP!
NO JUST PLAIN HOP PASS THIS PLACE!

DON'T GO THERE!"}
{"text":"Ate there the other day and the service was ridiculously slow and when the three of us got our food it was cold, the buns for our burgers were dry and the meat was dry and old."}
{"text":"I saw the commercial for the blackberry pancakes and I just had to have them. Long story made short the service was bad and the pancakes were super small. I was so disappointed! They didnt taste bad but the eggs, bacon, and sausage that came with it was horrible! Never again!"}
{"text":"So I was here 20 min ago the waiter was really rude all I asked was for plain crepes and his answer was \"I can't sell that to you\"  excuse me I come here all the time and the 2 waiters that are always here are always so nice this guy was so rude to me saying that I had to pick something from the menu I am pregnant and all I wanted was plain crepes with some fruit ! Armando is his name he got me some super hot crepes with a big as bowl of fruit excuse me I didn't ask for this, if you don't like ur job what are you doing there ! I called him back and told him that's not what I asked for and that I didn't want that I didn't even touch the plate and he said... \" you still have to pay for it\" i got up paid for something I didn't even eat and I left really bad experience I don't recommend you eating in here with this guy Armando ! Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Terribly slow!! Omg! It took 15 minutes for them to come and get our order and 40 minutes more to serve the order!! The iHop at the Strip next to Stratosphere is way more busier and yet the service is exceptionally super fast. So unless you have like 70-90 mins to spend at an iHop, do not attempt to visit this outlet."}
{"text":"I'm so irritated with this place. You definitely can't get served in a timely manner and when you do it's usually wrong. I'll not be coming back and suggest others to be wary as well. (review written on a Sunday night where the restaurant has only 24 people in it - in other words DEAD)."}
{"text":"Been to many ihop's including this one .. But THIS PLACE SUCKS NOW!! You dont feel welcomed at all when walking in.. The waitress sucked. She didnt even offer us water!!!!! She was slow,& not freindely. I feel like we knew more about the menu & stuff the her! The coffee& tea wasnt even hott. CUSTOMER SERVICE & SERVICE IS EVERYTHHING!! But this place has NONE!!!!!!!  Other ihops ive been too are amazing. The people make u feel at home and thats how it should be!

GET UR DAM ACT TOGETHER!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming for over ten years and the past couple of years the service is ok but seeing other customers receiving service was neglected.  If it were me I would've gotten up and walked out.  There was a couple sitting across from me waiting for their food almost 30 minutes and not getting their drinks refreshed every so often.  My server was training a newbie but she was focused on a large group and my server was very nice refreshing my drink as usual.  It was my birthday and I got my pancakes and bacon fine but I had to wait a little for the SF syrup I requested.  There are different servers here now but it seems there is only maybe one or two cooks back there so I could tell the food was a little backed up.  I'm not complaining that I got my bacon and iced tea free along with my pancakes, I just felt bad for the couple sitting across from me still waiting....I was finished with my meal in less than an hour.  I hope other patrons didn't have to wait as long as they did.  Too many servers walking around....not enough cooks to serve the customers, food good.  Sad!"}
{"text":"We walked in and were ignored from the word go. There was a customer at the counter to dispute a discount that should have been given to her, and immediately the cashier and the manager began arguing about it. The argument continued to escalate until I made a comment out loud about arguing in front of new customers. Then both the manager and the cashier made rude comments. I also observed that tables had not been bussed and the overall appearance was dirty. We turned and left as well as the couple that walked in behind us. If the rating system allowed negative stars this place is a negative 2. You don't fight with customers. Don't even consider eating here."}
{"text":"dirty place, restrooms smell like is never been clean, they need to fix A/C i know weather is hot but when i arrive to a restaurant i expecting to cool off i little from the outside high temperatures, terrible service, food was good."}
{"text":"Like others, I should have judged by the empty parking lot and gone to Denny's or Crackle Barrel instead.  This is IHOP right?  International House of PANCAKES????  So I order chocolate chip pancakes.  The menu shows them as filled with luscious chocolate chips.  What I got was two buttermilk pancakes with about a tablespoon of chocolate chips in the center and a dab of whipped cream.  I was sorely disappointed.  My husband ordered a side of biscuits and gravy.  There were four half dollar hard little biscuits on a side dish (like overcooked cheap Pillsbury) will about a tablespoon of gravy per biscuit.  Other restaurants have delicious sausage crumbles in their white gravy that is poured all over the biscuits - but not at IHOP.
The waitress was a young gal who really needed some mentoring, but she managed to get our food out in a reasonable time.  As far as cleanliness... the table next to us had at least 10 carafes of old coffee and other assorted items all over it - not sure if they were storing things there or what...
Overall, the food is mostly ho-hum, and the pancakes for a pancake house put a shame to the name.
I did write to the company to let them know how poorly this location was representing IHOP - and no one ever bothered to contact me.  I don't really want free food, but good customer service would be to call and tell me how they planned to fix the issues and to coax me back.
IHOP remains silent - which tells me they really don't care."}
{"text":"We came to Cleveland for a last minute get away for my boyfriends birthday, and we're looking for somewhere close by to go to breakfast before a busy day in the city. We were sat at a table that had been cleaned off, but not wiped off. Not wanting to make a big deal, we just sat at seats on the clean portion of the table. Our waitress came after a few minutes and apologized for taking so long, she had just gotten \"like 5 tables at a time\" and apparently didn't notice us. We ordered, and after sitting and watching everyone around us get food for 40 minutes, our waitress came back over to inform us they \"lost our ticket\" and our food hadn't even been started yet. 40 minutes!! She didn't notice that she was serving tables that came after us for 40 minutes! She came back to say they had just started our food and they would make it on the fly, so it would be no more than 5 minutes. Then, she asked what we got (so how had they already started it?) and she assured us it was not HER fault the ticket was lost. So, 10-15 minutes later, my boyfriends waffles came out and my eggs came out. I was told my French toast would take just one minute longer. After my boyfriend had finished his sub-par waffles, my over-battered, underdone French toast came out. I've been a waitress, a hostess, and a cook. I understand getting busy fast, but I also expect the service to pick up when the amount of guests do. You don't \"forget\" a table (twice) and then say it isn't YOUR fault. Moral of this story, this is the worst ihop of the chain, don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Like so many others have said, this IHOP is a pleasant surprise in central Phoenix.  It is a chain, but offers superior food for the business type, and efficient, pleasant service.  The interior is newly remodeled and clean.  

The menu is pancake-ish, but has many diner-ish, Denny's-ish favorites too.  And it's surprisingly edible.  I had a chicken-fried steak, and it was crispy, peppery, meaty, gravy and not too greasy.  A breakfast here was cooked properly and served hot.  Coffee tasted good.  Place is clean.  Service is fast and responsive - the staff really hustles.  

I wish I'd found this earlier, that I wouldn't have wasted time and money on overpriced mediocre breakfast places in the area (Good Egg, First Watch, Coco's).  IHOPs (and Village Inns) are a couple bucks cheaper than the food at other places in the area."}
{"text":"This is the best IHOP! The staff are always very friendly and give great service. Our server was Jy-Jy she was EXCELLENT made great conversation. She had my family and I laughing the whole night throughout our dinner. We will always come back to this IHOP!"}
{"text":"Fast service but absolutely horrible. Order wasn't correct had to continuously call server over to get corrections and tell her to clear the table of cups and plates we were clearly done with. Server acted like she wasn't listening at all responded with okay to everything yet everything came wrong. When paying the bill to leave the cashier asked how everything was and when I said bad she didn't follow up at all just took my money. Will not be going back to this location at all."}
{"text":"We were hungry and had to have a brunch before heading out to the airport. This was the only place close to where we stayed. The wait was not bad, only 5-10 minutes. We ordered Garden Omlette and Swedish Crepes. Both were OK, the omlette could have been made better, the edge of the omlettes were crispy. I have had better omlettes in other IHOPs. The swedish crepes was way too sweet. When we left we saw at-least 20 people waiting in line."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today.  Awful, awful service, we were seated and watched for 45 minutes while everyone that was seated after us got their food.  Our waiter was missing the entire 45 minutes, at one point asking another wait staff to get our waiter since we did not have any coffee, he never came out, just sent a message saying that someone else took our order.  We even had to track him down to get our bill.  Will not return to this place."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for National Pancake Day around 9:30 am and had a wait of about 20 minutes, which was to be expected. Aside from that, we didn't experience any of the long waits mentioned in other reviews, but we did go on a more unusual day. Once seated, our drink orders were taken pretty quickly, but the waiter swept away before we could say anything else. The wait for the drinks was a little long, but understandable considering how busy it was. I got a hot chocolate, which filled about 2/3 of a tiny mug. The rest was whipped cream. The chocolate wasn't bad, but the amount was a little disappointing. The waiter had disappeared to deliver some drinks to other tables but came back soon after to take our order. Even though he must have been busy and stressed, he was welcoming and friendly toward us. The food--3 pancakes each and some sausage for my boyfriend--came not long after, and someone else came by to check on us. IHOP pancakes are always good, and I love experimenting with the syrups. To my dismay, we had two containers of butter pecan and no boysenberry, but I didn't really mind that much. However, our table was also missing sugar. My boyfriend didn't want to bother anyone so he just added extra cream to his coffee. We received the check as we were finishing up."}
{"text":"This was the first time I have ever been in & out of a restaurant so fast. My mom ordered sliders w/fries but was brought hash browns, which the waitress argued that my mom said hash browns but my mom ordered fries for the reason to share with my baby. I ordered the t-bone w/mash potatoes but was brought diced potatoes, which the waitress blamed on the cooks for the mistake. I work in the food industry so when I get food from cooks, I always check to make sure it matches the check, which obviously the waitress didn't but I didn't point that out. My steak was cooked wrong & bland, the mash potatoes tasted like it was instant. My mom thought the waitress was high, but to me, she acted like she was protesting on being overworked...even though there was only 1 other table w/people that I saw. I used to love eating here when I was younger, but I wont be back"}
{"text":"I came here because of my grandkid, the server gave me an attitude when I said I didn't want anything plus to make worst the heat was not working I think they don't want to turn it on. Awful place if you don't want to turn  the heat up don't open your doors to the public."}
{"text":"very dissapointed.  silverware dirty, long wait for food server got the order wrong then sat there and argued with me about it left and will never go back to any ihop again....   went down the road to dennys MUCH better!"}
{"text":"This review is for IHOP at village center Summerlin. We ate breakfast this morning had beef omelet, international crepe w/ scrambled egg beater bacon and sausage. This not my first time to eat at  this particular location ,its near my house and church, my experience today is the egg was so dry, bacon and sausage dripping in fat and not crispy but chewy. Adding to my frustration the waitress was cold , 
she came to my table a few times to attend to our needs never seen smile on her face."}
{"text":"Overall, this is a good place. Three stars for taking and misplacing my orders two times in a row. Came for pickup and had to place the new order and stay in waiting area as my over the phone order was lost. 
Second order was not done properly. Make sure to check your bags up on pick up."}
{"text":"This is the most unsatisfactory IHOP I have ever been to. I got a simple egg and cheese sandwhich. The bread was soft, the cheese was hard, the kind of cheese that was on the sandwich wasn't even the kind I asked for. The hashbrowns were also unsatisfactory and cold. It was a disappointment considering I have been on the road traveling from Texas to Virginia, and hadn't eaten since we were in Mississippi 12 hours ago. It was after 12 a.m when we arrived at this particular IHOP. Now I am leaving pretty much on an empty stomach, and I still have another 4 and a half hours before reaching my destination in Virginia. I typically love Ihop and it's always my late night go to when nothing else is open, but if I am ever traveling, I wouldn't eat at this one again. The booth was also unclean, and I had to ask the hostess if she could please wipe the booth down."}
{"text":"The only positive things I can say about this visit were the polite and happy greeting we received when walking in, being seated immediately and our waitress Estefani who was efficient and sweet. 

As far as breakfast: the \"over easy\" eggs I ordered were more \"pan fried for 2 minutes GOO\" than egg, paired with undercooked bacon. I'm grateful the hash browns were edible. I also decided, my better judgement, to try a new item: Cinnamon Sugar twice baked French toast (or something like that). Basically regular French toast with cinnamon sugar with an added oatmeal/cornflake crust. Let me save you: don't bother. I cut into the toast and the entire middle on both pieces was mush. Not cooked AT ALL. The special \"crust\"? I might have seen one oatmeal flake. Very disappointing. I didn't eat but one bite of it and the waitress took it away without a word. Awesome. I have not been impressed with iHop even one of the 5 times I've attempted it at various locations in the last year. We get it, you're busy. PLEASE STILL COOK THE FOOD."}
{"text":"This place gets very crowded in the morning. Otherwise, the service is pretty good and the food is decent."}
{"text":"Food was nasty -hash browns not well done, asked for egg well done but wasn't, pancakes were the worst ever tasted, .. Waiter(Zulfa) tried her best with good service and offered to take of drinks from bill because my well done eggs smelt bad."}
{"text":"Good service. Healthy food :-) I got spinach and mushroom omelet. But I think the best omelet is colorado omelet."}
{"text":"Sorry to say but I will never come back to this IHOP.  Not only did my friend and I wait for over 20 mins for our meal with only 8 others in the restaurant. People that came in after us got their meals before us.  We had to ask the waitress for a status update on our dishes.  After brining it to her attention she said it will be just a few more minutes. Once we got our dishes I was checking my dish and the vegitables were still frozen on my sandwich. At that point I advised her that I didn't want the dish at all.  There was not one apology for the wait or the frozen food."}
{"text":"IHOP is a classic. Its good food after a late night and their open 24 hours so its perfect."}
{"text":"Horrible. I called in the parking lot for a to go. 330 am on a Tuesday. No one answered the phone, I went in to order. Everyone that was working was sitting on their ass. Bunch of bulll shit!! These people should be fired."}
{"text":"Had brunch here a couple weeks ago, the service was quick and pleasant. This IHOP was in good repair. A took off a star because, while I feel their food is a good value, it is mostly cheap, comfort, breakfast food. As long as thats what you are looking for you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Omg I try calling this fucken place for almost 20min at least 8times and no answer when I decided to show up thinking there where busy the employee where sitting down almost half asleep I felt sorry for the owners that there paying guys to work and there fucking around instead  of working wow what a sorry ass place to come and eat I hope the other Ihops are not this way I will be very disappointed"}
{"text":"Worst place ever never going back there waitres forget to put the order 40 minutes waiting and she pass by and she says forget to put the order can you comeback other day??? Instead or apologize she says come back another day. BAD place to go to."}
{"text":"Terrible service and terrible food! I asked this girl twice for sausage gravy and the first time she came back with the wrong one, the second time she brought back chicken broth! Food was bland and tasteless and she never bothered to fill our drinks. Never coming back again, it was such a waste of money!"}
{"text":"Nice place for casual dining. We ordered for the garden fresh omelette and spinach and mushroom omelette. The omelette was good and served with hash brown. The service was prompt too. Overall a good experience ."}
{"text":"This ihop overall is good, they ussually cook your food the way it should be however, our waiter Stacey was not so great. I wanted to make a change to my order and he walked away as I was still talking to him. I didn't appreciate his rudeness, I made one minor change and everything else was very simple. The attitude was unecessary."}
{"text":"So I LOVE iHop. I really do. I go like every week to iHop on Fridays usually for a dinner and a movie type thing with my boyfriend. I went to this one twice, the first time I remember coming and it was okay. Not good. Not bad. The second time I went I decided I will never go again. 
DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT HERE TO BASH ANYONE, BUT I AM HERE TO BE REAL AND HONEST.
This particular iHop is horrible, in a way that makes you question iHop in general. If I know someone who has never been to one, I would NOT send them to this location. (try Central Avenue or the one in Tempe) 

Review: When we arrived, we had to wait to be seated, not because of a line or anything, just because the hostess wasn't there to greet us. We finally sat down and our server came shortly after. I asked for a hot chocolate with caramel and a water, and he brought me out my drinks. He then proceeded to take my order. Finally get my order and the food looks terrible. He forgets to bring things out for us, the standard: hot sauce and hot syrup. He wasn't a good waiter, he looked like he rather be else where. He never came back to refill out drinks or ask us anything, he finally brought us the check, and we tried to cash out only waiting ten minutes for the hostess to come back again. 

This iHop isn't my favorite. I won't be returning because the experience of iHop should be a much better one. I have been to a lot of iHops around Phoenix and the too mentioned above are much better."}
{"text":"For it's position and surrounding businesses, this place supprises me.

There was no wait to be seated even though the venue was fairy busy, and within 5 minutes I had my drink and meal ordered.

While waiting I noticed the venue was very clean aswell as up-to-date, not run down, you wouldn't think you were in a lower part of town!

The food was alright, nothing I brag about, I got the original buttermilk pancakes, and they are what they are, presentation could f been improved, but the flavour and size was acceptable.

If you're really wanting IHOP then I wouldn't turn it down, but maybe go to a local buffet like samstown if you want a better value"}
{"text":"It's IHOP - I have eaten once at this location but have ordered take out  for breakfast many times.  Breakfast is breakfast not bad if you don't want to cook.  Take out orders are packed in nice take out trays.

Today I picked up dinner. Ordered basic cheeseburger with fries for my sweetie and I had the BLT with onion rings.Side of loaded baked potato soup Here's our take:

I live on the Isthmus so I had a hot/cold bag to keep the dishes warm. Worked - plates arrived warm/hot.  Cheeseburger wasn't bad, fries average. BLT wasn't too bad, onion rings were really good .  Bakes potato soup - blah! yuk! will never order that again.

Service - hostess was nice as always. I phoned in the order.  Was told it would take about 10 minutes, waited 15/20 with I got there.  Will be taking this location into consideration if I pick up breakfast of dinner again."}
{"text":"today was free pancake day which is understandable for the service to be a little under par but today was my worst IHOP experience. the waitress was not very attentive and was not really of any help at all. we ordered free pancakes but also ordered a chorizo omelet (which comes with a big dollop of sour cream on top in the picture and the description) and I was not informed on them running out of sour cream   until after I received my food and asked for sour cream. people came in and out with their free pancakes before we even got our free pancakes or the food we ordered and it got cold really fast because of this. choose another IHOP if you expect some type of good customer service cos this place is trash."}
{"text":"I have never met an IHOP I did not like. The multigrain pancakes are worth your time."}
{"text":"I came to IHOP to reminisce some of the good times ahead of the child was looking for an international Pancake such as the Swedish crepes but unfortunately I was disappointed and realize they had none of the International crepes on the menu anymore. I guess that's why they went to IHOP instead of its original name International House of Pancakes. So I had a basic breakfast scrambled eggs pancakes with maple syrup and bacon. Definitely let's cook fine and the service was helpful but again I read it at 2 because of the lack of variety and what set them apart from other Pancake House is in the past."}
{"text":"Super bland food, hash browns not crispy, how do you mess up hash browns. Even the pancakes were not great"}
{"text":"Pancakes with a PEDIGREE ..... I think not !!!!!
Its been a few years, since We have gone to this location.
Nothing memorable, about our visits through the years.

This FRANCHISEE .... does not take IHOP coupon's.

The IHOP of our choice, has been at the 101 & Raintree."}
{"text":"Service was great, Raquel went over and beyond! She was totally into me lol definitely felt welcoming in Arizona.. Thank you"}
{"text":"Well, it is finally open. We have need another good option for breakfast. Carrie P. Was our server tonight, very friendly and attentive. The food was as good as I have come to expect from IHOP. They rock Breakfast anytime of the day. Their French toast is some of the best in my opinion. We will be back here a lot."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow...kept forgetting things, forgot an entire meal for one person in our party. Every request we had took at least 5 minutes. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"I love ihop.  Not just pancakes or breakfast although they have great breakfast deal, they also have good dinners (except chicken over cooked everytime) I just stopped ordering it.  Love the coffee. Really like the steak and sirloin tips.  Really good sandwiches.  I like it alot better than applebys or perkins and even better than panera (except desserts). And the service at our brook park ihop cannot be beat.  If you havent been there go...if you havent been there in awhile go back. Youll be pleasantly surprised. Only reason not 5 stars is that the bacon and ham last visit tasted like it had dried out and put back on grill.  It was ok but everything else was perfect.  Usually bacon and ham are good too."}
{"text":"One of the better ihops I have eaten at. Food is always good and great service. If available ask for Stuart as a waiter very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Food as expected was very busy for a Monday and girl at front counter overwhelmed seating ppl n running register"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was ok, not great.  Restaurant was nearly empty and absolutely trashed inside. No one attempted to clean dirty tables, sweep the floor or anything. It made me wonder how nasty things are in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Previous Ihop frequenter, but this particular Ihop's food was bland.  The pancakes were soggy, the hash browns were soggy, and the bacon was not as crispy as I am used to. Overall, not very appetizing. I should have ate at a casino buffet for the same price."}
{"text":"Service is slow, poorly executed , sadly the food was not up to IHOP standard' 
Disappointed..."}
{"text":"---------------------CHICKEN & AWFULS---------------------------------------------------------


Please, Please,  Please for the Love of all things food related, SAVE your money and AVOID this IHOP.

Our experience was as follows:
This was our 1st time going to this IHOP. It was 8:45 pm on June 5, 2013 we had 3 members in our dinner party.

The restaurant was empty except for the staff, it was clean and our waitress  was very kind and friendly.  

We sat down and our waitress was prompt and courteous, she gets 5 stars ;)
She took our order correctly.

Two out of the three meals that were ordered were served as expected and went off without a hitch the third meal was 100% fail. All kitchen side issues.

What was ordered:
Chicken and Waffles + a House salad

What went wrong:

1.The House Salad on the menu Pictures fresh bowl of garden greens with shredded carrot , Croutons and 2ish or so red onion slices. What came to the table however was like iceberg lettuce \"salad in a bag\" style with croutons and nothing else.
(Still Ok , at this point,  still acceptable for this level of eatery despite
 the Misleading menu Images)  

2. Just so you know the IHOP menu describing chicken and waffles reads:

\"We pair up four all-white-meat golden chicken strips -- breaded and crispy-fried, with four waffle quarters (topped with whipped butter!) for a one-of-a-kind meal. Dip your strips in honey mustard sauce, or your choice of dipping sauce.\"

The waitress brought the \"Chicken\" part of the chicken and waffles, looking extremely underwhelming and pale, ALONE on a plate. Just \"Bam\" a plate of very pale chicken strips and no waffles whatsoever, or even garnish. Just Ugly Pale chicken all lonely and sad.
She then explained that the kitchen failed to cook the waffles, and that the waffles were NOT ready because they didn't even have the waffle cooker on at that point.

About 10 minutes later, still no waffle, just a nearly 9$ plate of pale sadness.
I decided to walk my pale plate of  \"Just chicken\" over to the manager. He was very busy ( No he wasn't ) chatting with a female staff member near the soda machines,  I said \"Look at my chicken and chicken, I ordered chicken and waffles and this is just chicken, Im waiting and waiting and its still just chicken, how are you going to charge me almost 9$ for this? He Was polite and said he would remove the item from my bill, I looked at the female he was talking too and said \"can you feel me here?\" and she said \"yes\".

As I was returning to my table the \"waffle\" Arrived!
However The Belgian waffle was a nasty mess (assuming it had something to do with the non-prepared waffle iron) it too, was extremely pale, soggy and 100% under cooked, when you picked it up with your finger, there was nothing crispy about it, it was just floppy and flacid.  An eggo waffle out of the freezer looks more appetizing, Words dont describe the fail of this \"chicken and awful's\" dinner.

The waitress was embarrassed, I told her She was fantastic and gave her a good tip, poor thing. 

My True and honest impression of the problem was that the manager, albeit nice, seemed like a dopey doodah who was more interested in his young female staff than what sort of food was coming out of the window.


EXTREMELY UNDERWHELMED, WONT BE GOING BACK"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places for breakfast! Today my server was Erica! She was very friendly, accommodating and fast! I was in a rush to head to the gym so I appreciated that she dropped my check as soon as she saw I was almost done eating without me having to ask for it! Definitely recommend the French toast, so yummy :)"}
{"text":"Not impressed - I ordered two meals to go and did not get the large coke I ordered, I asked the cashier where it was and she sent a guy back to get it. He returned with a cup and no straw and had to be sent back again? He returned and attempted to hand me a tiny little cup? I said that doesn't look like a large. He said \"well, I'm new, it's all I could find soooooo....???\" To which I replied \"well I paid for a large coke and that is not a large sooo...???\" So then he found a manager who was able to locate cups (?) and she gave me my coke. There was no butter in the bags, and I ordered 3 stacks of pancakes in both meals and got 2 pancakes each. I'm annoyed that they didn't get my order right, they I had to be kept waiting while they figured out where the cups were (are they hidden somewhere in a magical IHOP cupboard...?) and that they gave me whatever cup was lying around, because it's all that the new guy could find, and that's ok? I'm sorry if you are new, but ask someone if you don't know, rather than just giving customers whatever you can find!!!"}
{"text":"Best IHOP I have been to in years.  I mean, they had CLOWNS making BALLOON ANIMALS - not your average IHOP.  Good service, too.  Lots of people were waiting for tables when we got there, but the wait was still very short.  And, I had a very yummy omelet.  Great to be with family for the holidays - that just made the whole experience even better!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service !!! The waiters take 20 minutes to bring the food for one person"}
{"text":"Let's be honest I'm here late at night... Who comes to IHOP nor late at night. However Lucero, she's been amazing. Every insane request of my friends has been answered and then some. Her service has been outstanding. Not only was she attentive but she had a good sense of humor. Her service far surpasses the establishment she is in. I can only hope she is compensated to the degree for which she works."}
{"text":"Came to gilbert rd location to take my mom for her bday lunch. There was 4 of us and a 4yr old. It was Horrible from start to finish! We sat there 20 min before we were asked what we like to drink and get then another 10 min. To get them. She walked away before asking if we were ready to order so I called out to her she looked shocked we were ready to order. Really we've been there 30 min already! 
After we gave our order it literally took almost 45 min to get our food. Really there was 3 tables occupied. (Should of been our first clue since it was lunch time) Our food came and my chicken fried steak was over  well done and a nasty crispy taste, along with my two eggs with one yolk, and did I mention she forgot to bring me my pancakes. Both my daughters had one slice of their bacon that was a slice of pure fat that looked under cook. I ask my mom how was your burger she said well done (I'm embarrassed). Omg I've eaten at lots of ihop from all over the USA and always get the same thing chicken fried staek. It always taste the same no matter which ihop I'm at or which state im in! But today of all days this happen!! 
Only more thing I wanted to mention is when we were doing our order we let our waitress know it's my mom's birthday today and is therr a cake or something I could get? She said she didn't know but would ask. I never did here of it again. Oh and she never even looked up to say happy birthday! Should of left then, but we were so hungry when we got there and it takes awhile for mother to get sat down and out of car due to her walker. Seriously, we ate that food out of starvation but definitely praying we don't get sick!!
I didn't bother with complaints knowing I would write this review and never go back there agian!!!! Gilbert and Warner Location :( :("}
{"text":"Terrible service today. Waited for one and a half hours for our food. They took, 20% off our total bill.  WOOPY. The Hostess walked out, never came back, from what I heard. Three waitresses for lunch service in the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"It's a Monday night. You and your boys are out on a lap around town and decide to chow down on some breakfast food. IHOPs close; you roll there. Upon arrival you're greeted by a shifty woman. She tells you to sit anywhere you want then dips. After chillin at your selected table for like 30 minutes y'all decide to do some reconnaissance on the staff to find only one employee working.WTF managers? Learn to schedule an apt amount of employees each night! Anyways. Waiting for my food still. Been here an hour. We're the only ones here. If my bacon isn't cooked right I'll be outraged. Edits to come on if the food was dank or not.


EDIT: bacon was dope. But they screwed the pooch on my homies food. One homie didn't get correct the stuff he ordered. Another homie didn't get his side of bacon, then one other one didn't get his side of hash browns. Also refill game was straight awful."}
{"text":"The waiting game has been strong. The wait time only continued to drag on after being seated. The waiter is terns and abrubt, clearly not wanting to be at the table. I understand he may be busy with others, but he has been ignoring us in favor of a larger party that came in later than us. The manager ended up bringing out our meals and the food was lukewarm, meaning it has been sitting there for awhile. We finished and asked for the check by flagging down the manager since oir waiter remains to be unseen. Our waiter finally makes an appearance bringing out a check with just the total, making half-baked excuses. He insists on giving us another meal when we have absolutely no need for it and just tossed the new receipt at me when I requested for one with all our items listed on there. He was, once again, abrubt and tense, clearly not wanting to service us. Oh, yes, he proceeded to ask where we were from. When we said local, he asked where were we ORIGINALLY from. I am from Las Vegas thank you, I don't like what you are trying to imply there."}
{"text":"Not bad. I got Tuscan scramble and it was filled with fresh veggies. Very good and healthy. I like it that these chain restaurants have gotten the message. Usually I avoid them."}
{"text":"Easy parking, friendly staff, good food. What's not to like.  Not a great place for a salad."}
{"text":"Yesenia our server tonight was horrible. She was alone around 11 pm and there was three table filled with empty plates. She had 2 customers! The other table had to get up and tell her they were ready to order! As soon as she took their order she went took a seat and was on her phone while we needed refills. The whole time i was there she was on her phone and did not pick up a single plate at my table or the empty ones. Worst server ive been \"helped\" by."}
{"text":"Just no!!! We've been here several time and more often than not, we've had complaints. The food is just ok....
Problem is they sometimes clean with nasty dark water while people are eating!! Food comes out cold, orders are messed up and they usually don't have enough people working so the wait is long even though the food sometimes comes out cold...."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible service, at a time that wasn't even that busy. Stood at the hostess stand for several minutes before being greeted or seated. Took 10+ minutes after sitting down with our menus before someone asked if we had been helped yet, at which point we ordered two coffees. Our waitress finally came around a few minutes later asking what we wanted to drink, so we told her we had already asked for some coffee. She only brought back one cup. When I asked her if I could please have one as well, she argued with me that I didn't order it. Really? On top of that, it took over 40 minutes to get our food - eggs and pancakes - and we were surrounded by empty tables. Will not return."}
{"text":"All I can say is the cooks are fast. I've been there only 2 or 3 times and the food comes out fast. I go during off peak hours so I get fast and pretty good service. My glass stayed full and the food came fast. The last time I was there they had more people on staff than in the whole restaurant so they seem to staff appropriately."}
{"text":"went into Ihop today and it was super dead , maybe my family and 2 other family's were in there, we got horrible service waited 20 minutes for refills , our server didn't even bother to ask us if we needed anything else when we waited for our food. I asked the manager and she walked by if we can get refills and she literally just looked at me? and gave us a dirty look ? waited pretty long for our food ? it was a horrible experience // service."}
{"text":"We ordered two dishes , chicken crepes and tilapia with a good HOP 
Such a bad food I never had in life !  
IHOP -  completely hopeless"}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night to eat dinner with family (5 adults & 2 children).  The waitress who brought our drinks was pleasant & nice.  Our waiter never came to our table (we all had enough time to decide what we were going to order).  Our waiter Mike looked like he was hanging out with his friends at the next table over from us with 16 people still showing up after us and deciding on what they wanted to eat.  As he got to the people that just walked in we asked if we could order while they decided.  He rudely said that he would be with us after getting everyone's order at the other table.  We decided it would be fast to drive to the other iHOP on Power than wait for this yahoo and his friends 16 orders ahead of ours, especially since he said they only had one cook working that night.  The other location was great, good service, and no rude waiters.  That one was busier than this one (can't imagine why!).  We will never come to this one as long as Mike is a waiter.  iHOP do yourselves a favor and get rid of this guy unless you don't mind him chasing off customers who actually pay our meal plus a decent tip.  Doubt he's getting good tip from his teenager friends."}
{"text":"Why does it look like the servers had a food fight every day for the past month and vowed to never wash their aprons again?  Get it together, people!  I'm trying to eat here.  Well actually I'm not...I'm still waiting.........waiting..............................waiting..........to be served.  Really????????????????????????!"}
{"text":"Well they remodeled. It looks great! I mean it really looks fantastic. The food was hot and well prepared, as always. Service was attentive and prompt. Still never saw a shift manager. And they didn't have my creamer, not a big deal but what kind of coffee shop runs out of creamer? 

Update: 12-15-2017:  I am seated, I want to order the two eggs, 4 bacon strips, hash-browns and substitute the waffles with all the frosting, fruit and BS for plain buttermilk pancakes. 

I'm told I can't do that. I said, \"Surely the pancakes are cheaper than those waffles with all the added garbage on them?\" I'm told that it's a special and I can't make substitutions. However, I can order the 2 eggs, 2 bacon strips, hash-browns and pancakes. I said that's not the same it's missing two bacon strips. The server tells me it's the computer it won't allow changes like that. I said well I'm sorry but Im not going to let a computer dictate what I can and can't have to eat. I left, I won't be back. 

I'm not upset at the server for doing as instructed. I'm more stunned that an asinine policy was instituted to control inventory, without any method to circumvent this issue. I mean, certainly I'm not the first nor the last customer to request a substitution that seemed reasonable and likely costed the restaurant less resources to provide."}
{"text":"I have to leave one star because I got my food eventually and lots of creamer, that's why I felt begrudgingly had to leave a 1 star.  Expectedly, I came for breakfast on a Sunday so I knew I was going to wait.  20 minute wait, ok completely understandable, after 20 minutes we go to see where on the list we are.  Supposedly, they had called our name a while ago.  No, we're sitting right in front of you.  They lied. A kid seats us and forgets everything we asks for except creamer, no silverware, no water, no order taken. One hour, 5 minutes, 51 seconds later our food was cold and had to be sent back. We didn't see our server again for over another 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a negative review!! A few weeks ago I went and they said they were out of ranch but I didnt think much of it since my meal was decent. Today during my visit since I had a $5 off card for donating money to childhood cancer. It took forever to be seated which should have been a sign from above to leave and go somewhere else. Once seated our waitress told us they were out of salad, milk, cheese, lettuce etc. it didnt matter much since all I wanted was pancakes. I ended up waiting forever for my food and it was awful I couldnt even eat it. How do you mess up a pancake for being International House of Pancakes?? And to top it all off my glass had lipstick on it... Yuck! I will NOT be returning!!!!! If I were you choose a Denny's near by!!"}
{"text":"Portions minuscule, 
Decaf cold 
Servers impolite and distracted - ages to wait for the bill. Brought jam rather than butter to the table. 
The menu selections overpriced and illconceived."}
{"text":"We went last week specifically for the summer signature pancakes.  I know not to expect the real entree to look like the pictures on the menu, but when I received my peaches with raspberry sauce pancakes there were only 2 slices of peaches on top.  My mom and husband both ordered the strawberry and banana ones but one had generous toppings and fillings while the other was very sparse. Hard to believe the dishes made it out of the kitchen looking the way they did and the waitress should have been too embarrased to deliver them.  This is definitely not the first time we've left this restaurant unhappy but this was the most extreme case.   Not to mention the waitress CONSTANTLY said \"awesome\" while we were ordering.  Not very professional."}
{"text":"Server had terrible attitude had to ask for different one after first interaction. Manager took over our table. Staff and mgr are different then the previous times we have been here. Previous staff was so far above the current that it might be worth waiting for the next staff replacement before coming back. Food is ok"}
{"text":"Arrived at 1135pm Saturday May 7 and ordered food 11:50pm  it is now 12:49am still haven't received our food. There is only one server working and the chef came out to help. Still no refill on our water and no server to confirm food arrival. 

We just received food at 12:52am the food is cold and the pancakes were way smaller than usual. They usually are the size of the plate but that wasn't the case this time.

Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Good food........service not too bad.  Would probably stop in again if in the area.  Short wait to be seated.  Food arrived in a timely manner."}
{"text":"BAD SERVICE EVER!!!! I wouldn't give this place a one start, but since I don't have a choice.. 
I wouldn't recommend anyone to come here. I came here around 8pm with my boyfriend and his friends. Their was only 2 waitress working around that time. We literally sat there for 10min without any of the waitress getting our drinks. After we got done eating dinner we were suppose to go Christmas shopping. My boyfriend notice that he had left his grill (gold mouth peace) on the table wrapped around a napkin. He went back he looked through the window where we were sitting at and noticed that one of the waitress was messing around with the napkin. He ran inside and he asked her if she saw his grill wrapped around the napkin. She smiled and said no. He knew for a fact that she was lying. We also talk to the other lady that was working with her but she refuse to check her. We wait for the owner to get there, he took an hour to arrive. Once he got there he walked pass by us and didn't say a word. Suddenly another customer that had left his glasses there earlier was helped by the owner.!!! My boyfriend was trying to get his attention and the owner had shouted at him and told us to get out for no reason but, of course we stayed until we had some prove.
After waiting for 3 hours without any help from the owner we just gave up and went home.."}
{"text":"We like IHOP.  We had an incident with the kids' yogurt, apparently, they were bad, but no big deal, we just didn't eat it.   But our server was nice enough and brought a bowl of fruits for my girls... that was nice!"}
{"text":"Totally outstanding service each time I visit. GREAT FOOD. Everything comes together. Really great spot. 

Bianca was really good on two occasions, personal, professional, and good at all areas. 

My only gripe was when we paid compliments to the manager he seemed disinterested and like \"yeah, okay.. \" when it would have been nice to hear something like \"really? great to hear, I'll let her know\". Recognition is always important. 

oh, and sometimes I found dirty silverware rolled up *minus one star. kind of gross."}
{"text":"The worst of the worst! We waited 10 minutes for some one to order the food. We waited 30 minutes for the food. We waited no time for the check...... And can their waitresses wash their hair please?! I love IHOP but not this one for sure! I will wait to see when will they go out of business!"}
{"text":"This \"breakfast\" restaurant still is unable to make an omelet without browning the eggs.  My request has never worked, with any waitress.  I will still be eating here occasionally due to the preference of my co-workers.  I just have to order something that is hard to burn."}
{"text":"Hi food lovers
This place sucks
30 minutes to get seated and 30 minutes to get my food.
My French toast was cold with frozen strawberries 
Ruin my day."}
{"text":"Worst location I have ever been. I will be honest I don't usually go to IHOP. But seriously? They need to shut this place down or re hire/train the staff on better customer experience. I understand you guys are busy. But there is no need to ignore or give attitude to your customers. LILY or whatever her name maybe (she was not wearing a name tag) for example keep ignoring me when I kept asking her for her name. She was handling the cash register on Sunday around noon Nov 5th 2017. Lied to her manager about asking us how we wanted to pay right in front of us. when she never as little as attempted to make any eye contact with us or open a conversation. She didn't care about how we would want to pay. Just took it upon herself to make that decision. She seemed to be struggling. She needs to learn to control her temper, breath, slow down and relax. We (the customer) is the reason why you even have a job so I would start working on that attitude that's is if you want to keep your job. This could of been handled in a much more professional matter. But overall experience is ghetto. Ghetto staff. Ghetto service. They should really try on working on racing the IHOP standard to corporate standards. Never coming in again and encourage everyone to follow so they close this sad store. There's better locations not far from here anyways. Better places to eat too..."}
{"text":"Disgusting. They had the door to their dish room with people continuing to go in and out. We were the only ones seated in that area when others got seated in better areas of the restaurant. It smelled of a sewer every time that door opened up. Don't know why the waitress hated us that much to seat us in that area. Guess I shouldn't complain since it's free pancake day and all, but having the taste of yummy pancakes with a whiff of sewer alongside it doesn't make for a good memory of these pancakes."}
{"text":"I've lived in Charlotte for nearly half my life and have gone to this location for about a decade now. I always get the same thing The Country Omelet. Back in 2002-2006 they actually had a great manager at this location I actually knew him and think the quality of service and staff was a lot better when he was there. I think this IHOP has gone down hill over the years the staff isn't as professional as they once were and the food is just ok. However when they advertise a $4.99 special for breakfast you really shouldn't expect eggs Benedict. 

My husband and I decided to stop by the other night for dinner. My husband loves the Chicken fried chicken and we were disappointed to find out that IHOP no longer has this on their menu. I was kind of shocked because that's always been a stable go to for me. I'll also note this in the tips.
 
If you're a people watcher like me then this is the place to go to in Matthews. I noticed over the course of our 40min meal that four waitresses made themselves large cups of chocolate milk and then took breaks in their break room, which is through the double doors going into the dish washing room. Also, while the wait staff was waiting for the food to come out from the kitchen they kept yelling Happy Birthday over and over again to one of the waitresses. It was a little annoying to hear Happy Birthday every 5 seconds yelled in the kitchen but I guess I can understand that every work environment needs some morale boosting.
 
Overall the food was pretty good for the price but I've had better at IHOP. I do have to agree with Annie about the hash browns. In the country omelet you get hash browns and mine we're hardly cooked prior to going in the omelet."}
{"text":"Took a half hour for two omelettes, came out cold and the cheese was hard around my omelette. Yes I said around my omelette because they didn't put anything inside of it. My colleagues omelette also was cold and hard."}
{"text":"Although some of the patrons can be a little tactless, (such as an old man standing up and yelling things to people at random)  this place is really nice to come to early in the morning.. Its not too crowded and the service is very prompt and sufficient... However, there were not many veg options (I would have been more than happy to give 5 stars, had there been).. I did find the fruit bowl to be delightful..  The hash-browns were very good too!! I will most likely be returning.. Thanks for the great service!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great, my service was amazing.  I came here a couple years ago and had the rudest waiter. I don't remember the name of my most recent waiter, but he was very polite and checked on me frequently without disturbing my meal. Although they were under construction,  the restaurant possessed a clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"Don't know why I expected more from this chain. Breakfast was cold and tasteless. Hash browns arrived when I had almost finished my omelet and then they were undercooked. The server asked my husband if he wanted maple syrup for his pancakes. He requested the sugar free syrup. When his pancakes remained uneaten the server asked if he wanted a box and was reminded about the syrup. Never got a refill on soda and the coffee pot on the table had enough for one and a quarter cups of coffee. Can't imagine what happens when it's busy."}
{"text":"Just left there. I used to come here so many times usually weekdays just me and my son. Well made the mistake of coming weekend 7/18/15. & everything went cool 10minute wait seated. The moment my son had to use the bathroom. And I'm 5mos pregnant. We come back and someone else is sitting in our seats wtf??!! Had we dined and dashed they would of not know!! Lmao that's all I could think of. So we're standing there and she realizes what happens aplogizes. And puts us in another seat food comes right away had to get our drinks. These people will eat u alive and step all over u if I have kids I swear. Had my husband been with me I'm sure it would of not happened. I'm not gonna let my kid hold it he had to go. And I'm definitely not gonna let him go alone. Don't really trust anyone. Anyways bill took forever to come. When it did paid it. Rushed out. So I said fuck the tip they didn't even do their job correctly. In the first place gave our table to someone else. Won't be going here again. Fuck this place."}
{"text":"Just like another reviewer said, it's the late night staff that keeps my friend and I coming back. I've only been there once during the day and I don't remember anything bad about the experience, but for some reason the 2 AM crew is fantastic. It is still an IHOP, so the food is fine but not amazing, although it does seem to really hit the spot in the middle of the night. And for the price, it's hard to complain."}
{"text":"I come here most mornings for breakfast (as I work overnights) and compared to some of the other IHOP's, I have been to, this one is awesome! I always have fast friendly service ( granted it's not to busy at  4am) the servings are always good size and freshly cooked doesn't taste like microwave food, like with other late nite/early morning restaurants. Their hot chocolate is great too."}
{"text":"I ate supper at this IHOP on Monday, 11-May-2015.  It was an easy walk across the street from the hotel where I'm staying.  I ordered the Breakfast Sampler scrambled.  Kimberly (290) was very attentive and provided excellent service.

The food was great even if the bacon was a tad overcooked.  Kimberly even warmed up the maple syrup for me which made already good pancakes even better.  If this is where things stopped, I would have rated my experience a full five stars.

The only problem with the visit was the AWFUL \"music\" that was playing.  It stinks on ice!  I don't know what corporate nitwit is in charge of picking the crap that was playing, but he or she should be fired post haste.  Also, forcing locations to play whatever fodder corporate pumps out and not even giving them the option to turn down the volume is utterly stupid.  The garbage that was playing as \"music\" is unforgivable.  Play some Sinatra and Martin, Eagles and Clapton, Pink Floyd and Rush, or even something like \"The Bridge\" on SiriusXM.  I'd much prefer SILENCE over the audio excrement that was oozing from the speakers while I ate.  It was unappealing, unappetizing, and very annoying.  That alone will keep me and my wallet from coming back or recommending IHOP to friends.  Corporate stupidity sadly pulls my rating down to two stars.  That's unfair to everyone at the location.  Without the crap music, my visit rated five stars."}
{"text":"We go to Ihop a couple times a month. They currently have a senior BOGO special from 3pm to 6pm. This was written up in one of the shoppers that come in the mail like the Gold Clipper. When our server brought our bill i questioned the total. I mentioned the senior BOGO special and she said they were told not to take the discount off. It clearly states in the ad that this special runs through July and no coupon is needed. She did take the discount off for us but how many other seniors have been ripped off ?"}
{"text":"LA verdad siempre aviamos sido fans De Denny's pero una ves probamos ihop y nos encanto LA comida .no se si por q  fue LA primers vez pero me quede facinado, me gusto tanto k lo preferimos end vez De Denny's .pero cada vez q  regresamos pasa algo diferente , si LA comida se tarda bastante, q si el omelette estaba horrible ,k el servicio esta pesimo cada vez mas , no refills they take forever omg! Enverdad me enpujaron a no regresar mas  ya k el steak omelette  era mi faborito . En  fin pudo seguir siendo mi restaurante faborito pero es una lastima que lo agan cada vez peor no regresaria por la simple y sencilla razon De que ya tube suficiente del mal cervicio , alomejor tratare una nueva locasion."}
{"text":"This place is usually good when I come here in the morning, food and service wise. I would not advise coming here at night though. The food took a long time to come, about 20 minutes. When the food finally got to us it was a little cold on a couple of the items, but still good. The service was absolutely terrible! The waiter was a nice lady but her service was not very good. We had to ask for absolutely everything, like water, to go box, and the bill. Also, the restaurant was not even that busy. It wasn't just us with problems, the two booths next to us were having problems too. Once again, the food was good but I would not come at night time."}
{"text":"Door service can be improved. It took almost 7 minuets to be acknowledged for seating. Seems to be a little under staffed."}
{"text":"I like IHOP for breakfast, but if you have kids and it is Friday night this is the place to go for dinner.  They usually have kids eat free deals at dinner time, and I finally found a dinner dish that is enjoyable.  The sirloin tips at IHop are great, they have caramelized onions and come with corn and mashed potatoes.  Kids enjoy themselves and everyone can find something to eat. Imagine being able to \"relax\" on a Friday night with kids in a restaurant.  If you time it right on Friday night, it is almost like you reserved the place for yourself and your family."}
{"text":"Don't want to cook dinner, you have to tote kids but still want to relax? IHOP is the answer!
Something for everyone and a decent steak tips dinner."}
{"text":"Server is Poor personal hygene and unprofessional. He serves the glass of water holding the top of the glass where i put my mouth on it. They should schedule more one servers because one server can't handle the whole restaurant. He always in a hurry and looks like distracted all the time. Food was good though"}
{"text":"The 20 minute wait wasn't to bad.
When I ordered tomato juice the waitress looked at me as though I was speaking a foreign language. I did what every good American would do, I raised my volume, slowed my speech & pronounced every syllable with over exaggeration: TO-MA-TO JU-ICE. Still received a blank stare.  So I ordered water. Evidently this IHOP doesn't carry tomato juice.
The table we were sat at is in dire need of maintenance. It must be kin to a Weeble Wobble.
Silverware was absent from the wobbly table & had to be asked for at least twice & once after our food arrived.
My 11 year old noticed that the 2x2x2 breakfast was mathematically incorrect & should be 2+2+2, as you only get 6 items not 8.
We had to ask for maple syrup & when it finally arrived we got 2 little shot glass size containers for the table & had ask for more.
When the food arrived, one of the waitresses started to hand a plate to my wife then yanked it back from my wife's hands, refused to hand to her without setting the plate on the table first.
Not sure how the cook managed it but my 2 sunny-side up eggs were both over cooked & undercooked at the same time. One had the yoke cooked solid.
Samantha the manager was thankful for our feedback & comped our breakfast (the only reason for 2 stars & not 1).
This has been one of the worst experiences that we have had ever, at an IHOP. We will not be eating at this IHOP anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"Ive been waiting for 1hr for service. I will NEVER visit this ihop again for this racial discrimination. I will be reporting this to the attorney generals office ASAP.Remember, i help the waitresses make a living!"}
{"text":"Worst IHOP experience I think I've had.  Despite the restaurant being empty,  it took 30 minutes to get our food.  They brought the drinks right away,  but stood in the kitchen staring at empty glasses and finally the manager(?) had to bring the order.  I won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"(strawberry & banana French toast with a side of fruit) Side of fruit was old, I left it untouched. My bro & I were convinced that the grape was an olive. Strawberries on the French toast were just defrosted & mushy. French toast & bananas were okay."}
{"text":"This is the best place ever! It was poppin in the morning. The best part was when they forgot our silverware. It's almost as if the knew we ate with our hands. Quality customer service. The server was a literal genius, she memorized our order.  After the ihop you can enjoy a nice stay overnight at travelers inn and then go to ihop again the next morning."}
{"text":"My coworker, who's Native American, comes in this morning to work and tells me about his experience at this location today.  His waitress did not greet him or his kids, was not polite or friendly & was a bit rude in her demeanor. The entire service was unpleasant to him and his kids.  When a Caucasian couple came in and sat nearby, the waitress was super friendly and accomodating.  He mentioned he spoke to the manager on the way out.  Not sure how they will handle this, but I definitely will not go to this location. Blatant racial prejudice is not acceptable. And to make it worse, his young elementary school children had to experience it."}
{"text":"not open 24 hours anymore :(



I like the pancakes here, but now that it closes at 10 I don't see myself coming here much anymore.  My favorite thing used to be grabbing a book and mooching off if their unlimited pancakes and coffee through the night.  Now I have nothing."}
{"text":"I used to love coming to ihop in the night time.. Breakfast for dinner. Me and boyfriend were craving steak and eggs and pancakes so we decided ihop. We get seated and there was probably two more tables occupied and then a group of 10+ that obviously just came from a football game. 
Our waiter (didnt get his name) started to take our order and I got steak and eggs with chocolate chip pancakes. I asked for my steak rare and he interrupted me saying \"uh are you sure?\" And I said \"yes. I order my steak rare all the time so I know.\" And he just stared at me. 
He brings us our food and I cut into my steak and it's medium well done. My boyfriend hauled down another waiter and told him the steak was medium well done and I asked for rare. He takes it and gives it to our waiter. He then comes back it's going to take \"3 minutes\" to get it right. 
Ten minutes later the table behind us walked out because they didn't get served or checked up on. The table of 10+ also walked out because no one took their order and they were there for at least 20mins. The waiter then comes back with my steak and I notice it is THE SAME STEAK I had before! Just more cooked so it was really well done!! I try to get his attention but he is in the corner texting on his phone! He then comes back and I tell him the problem. He says \"the first steak was rare.\" So we were just going back and forth and then another ten minutes later a lady brings out a new steak. I cut into it and oh my gosh it was dark purple rare as like they just seared both sides for a second each. And it was cold inside. We just left. 
I can understand if this waiter was swamped with tables and tables but he wasn't. And who doesn't know how to cook a freakin steak?! Disappointing."}
{"text":"I love this place! its very clean and the staff is very helpful they even remember me and make me feel like Iam @ home! Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"I have never been so disrespected. My server was wonderful but not properly trained. Her crew leader  (Marina I believe is her name) was horrible. She was extremely rude and didn't know her menu. She yelled at me that the crepe combo doesnt come with two strawberry and cream crepes. I tried to tell her she was confused and thinking of the cream cheese crepes. That wasnt what i wanted. She just rolled her eyes and told her to get me two plain crepes with strawberries. She refused to get a menu to see what i was talking about. As you can see in the picture, it has no cream sauce. I've also included the pictures of the menu, so management can see I wasn't just a complainer. It's sad because the food tastes better than my ihop. I travel out of my way to go to this ihop. However, i will never go back. Everyone around me was getting treated bad. One guy waited 20 mins to get a drink. Another table got the wrong food. I even over heard a table say they didnt want to tip because of the service. I still tipped 40% because i felt bad for my server. It's not her fault that she is being set up to fail."}
{"text":"This place was the worst. The service was  horrible and gave us the wrong order. I wouldn't recommend this place at all and I mark my words."}
{"text":"Was just in here last week with a few friends. Our waiter came by a total of 2 times? She never checked to see if our drinks were low... Which they were. 

The worst part... Our food took over an HOUR. There were probably 4 other tables in the restaurant. I mean come on! That is ridiculous! By the way.. Our waiter never even came by to let us know that the food was going to take forever."}
{"text":"We came here on Christmas Day having traveled from Virginia.  Despite having to work on a holiday everyone was very pleasant. Our server Chrissy was attentive and cheerful.  The eggs were fluffy and light. The potatoes were crisp."}
{"text":"Bionca is the WORST server I have ever dealt with. We waited for 15 minutes to be seated in a near-empty restaurant AFTER being asked how everything was. Seriously? We hadn't even been seated.

Then, I ordered coffee and my wife ordered hot tea, but we also wanted to order something else. Bionca took off without getting the rest of our drink order. How about water? She came back with the hot drinks but did not bring creamer or spoons.

At this point I asked for a manager. I told him about the issues and he brought us napkins. WTF? Bionca finally brought the creamer. Plain. I had asked for flavored creamer. Still no spoon.

At THIS point, we requested a new server. NOPE. We were IGNORED. Since apparently we were invisible, we left. Disappointed. Will not return. Ever."}
{"text":"Perfect five. This is indeed one of my favourite eatery. No other place for a great 8 am breakfast. Great pancakes, sandwiches. Do try the French Vanilla coffee. Clean colorful and cozy. They have quite a service."}
{"text":"By far one of the worst customer service! Our waitress only took our order someone else brought our food and no one kept checking up on us table behind us was just gossiping with 2 other waitresses. Those 2 were very unprofessional cursing out loud while we can hear them. A different waitress brought out our bill and when we were leaving our original waitress decided to check up on us right when we were already leaving.. If it were up to me I would rate this a negative star!"}
{"text":"Came in not expecting much anyways, but servers were absolutely rude and not attentive to the tables they've seated. Monotone faces and stale expressions were not appealing when we were \"greeted\" either and the tables and seats were oily and couldve been wiped down more carefully and the menus were obviously uncared for. There are like 6+ servers during lunch times which should be plenty for a mediocrely busy restaraunt. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"The people were really nice and attentive my only problem was with the \"unlimited shrimp\" plate. My boyfriend ordered this plate thinking he would share with us since it was unlimited. The first plate he was served a lot of small shrimps with french fries. They asked us if we wanted a \"refill\" on the shrimp to which my boyfriend said yes so we could take home for later. The next plate we literally got probably 1/4 of the plate with no fries. They might as well not given us anything... We asked for the french fries to go as well and they told us the refills don't come with fries since the shrimp is really \"expensive\". Thats not what the menu said so we were a little embarrassed so we just didn't push it. Why offer unlimited if its too \"expensive\" for them to offer then? And we didn't initially request for the refill! Our waiter did"}
{"text":"Usually IHOP is a safe bet for breakfast. You get a delicious meal at a great price, in a timely manner. Yesterday was the exception! My family and I decided to eat at Mesa Arizona's IHOP for the first time as they just moved into the neighborhhod. We arrived at 11:23 am and were promptly seated by a curteous, and very professional hostess. So far so good. We looked over our menus for the next ten to fifteen minutes. When our waitress finally decided to show up; her appearance was something for the books! She had on more make-up than crusty the clown with bright blue eyshadow that could be seen from outterspace!!! She took our drink order and food order at the same time. We waited, and waited and about fifteen minutes later our drinks came out. Well.... we waited, and waited. The time is now 12:21 and we politely asked when our food would be ready. Our waitress came back five mins later and stated that the cooks were working on our order. In the meantime other patrons have already come and gone. At 12:47 our food finally came out  in fragments. There was gravy all over the bottom of my plate, my potates were cold, eggs were cold, and pancakes were sauggy. 

Long story short; That was the most grotegue excuse of a waitress that I have ever expirienced. My food might have been good, but I wouldnt know... I had cold leftovers!! 

I would not reccomend this IHOP to anyone! Especially when you consider there are so many other restraunts in the same parking lot!!!"}
{"text":"the food is decent.  the service is fine.  this ihop is busy at times.  I am not sure if there is a lack of competition in the area that might explain why this ihop gets a lot of customers"}
{"text":"I have stopped eating at this ihop for a long time.  the food is only ok.  the service is questionable.  I want to say their service went down since the introduction of the annual free pancake day."}
{"text":"Food was good services good cleanliness is horrible the divider glasses got food all over it the condiment station is covered in food the walls in the booth really need some cleaning just curious what the kitchen looks like"}
{"text":"The employees were awesome, i got amazing service from everyone that passed my table, but there gravy was shit!"}
{"text":"Our sever, Adrian was very attentive, apologetic when necessary, food was great. Service was excellent!   I was here for my nieces, Tamikas home warming with Karen, and her friends."}
{"text":"Ok so if you know me you must know that I'm not a breakfast person. But when your boyfriend wants pancakes well IHOP it is. We lucked out and got there before the Sunday brunch rush and only had to wait 20 min. This place has more tables than the law should allow I'm booty bumping with everyone trying to get to the bathroom smh. Ok I'm back the menu had 2 salad options one Cobb and house so I went with the Cobb. The wait for our food was minimal but as luck would have it a bug flew on the omelette so we had to send it backDeedee our waitress took care of us and had a new omelette made with no sideways looks or attitude! My Cobb salad was pretty good they had really fine bacon bits and blue cheese crumbles. For what it was my brunch was ok but I was exceptionally pleased on how our waitress provided us with awesome customer service."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. More wait staff than customers and I have to ask for coffee/service after 15 min. Not worth paying $14 dollars for an omelet."}
{"text":"IHOP Huntersville Review

Okay, now I have been traveling professionally for the past 33 years and when people ask me what my favorite restaurant is, I always say, \"my favorite health club is the International House Of Pancakes!\". This always gets a few laughs, which I enjoy.

Literally I enjoy eating at IHOP. Today I stopped at the IHOP off of exit 25 on I-77, just to celebrate an excellent job interview that I just had (looking for new job). Of course, the wait staff was incredibly friendly, as usual, and the food was fabulous, as usual (my favorite is the Country Omelette with pancakes and salsa on top!), and while eating I received a call with a job offer from the interview from an hour ago!  So it all falls into place - wonderful staff, fabulous manager, excellent food, and GOOD LUCK! Can't believe I'm sitting here at 4:30 PM eating late brunch to celebrate a fun interview, and they make me a job offer! They being Time Warner Cable...

Now if you knew me, you'd ask me, \"why are you eating at the IHOP in Huntersville when you live 5 minutes from a brand new IHOP?\" .  I live in Mooresville and yes, that IHOP is nice, but I've been visiting them both and I prefer the staff, the cleanliness, and the food at the Huntersville IHOP better than all others near me. Really enjoy coming here! One of the top 10 restaurants in the state of North Carolina, in my opinion.

So here I go, my ratings:

Pricing = 10
Food quality = 10
Cleanliness = 10
Staff friendliness & professionalism = 10 
Overall ratings = 10

Now feel free to chuckle at my ratings, that is until you eat here. Once you've visited this place you'll understand why I've given them such high ratings. Seldom do I hit all 10's!

Now, my one critique, and it's sort of not a part of the restaurant itself - the location!  When you exit off of I-77 and turn west on hwy 73, you'll see the IHOP on the north side of 73, but finding the entrance can be a PITA (Pain In The ***).  To help you get there, if you're traveling south on I-77, exit and turn left, cross the bridge over the highway, then turn left (north) on hwy 21. The first left turn lane, about a quarter mile down the road, is where you go. Once you've turned left, follow that road all the way to the end and there is IHOP.

Going north on I-77, exit and turn right but immediately get all the way over to the left lane so you can turn left (north) on hwy 21, then follow the rou.te listed above.

Mr. Richard Santorum (very nice guy) Manager, waitress today = Alexis & Brittany (wonderful, friendly, and so very nice to talk with!)"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here and the kitchen messed up my blueberry pancakes. Told the manager Luis about it. He took care of it right away & then checked on us after. He's a great manager and will definitely be back if he continues to run it the way he does."}
{"text":"Sehr leckere Pancakes. Sehr empfehlenswert! 
Die Portionen sind aber eher etwas zum teilen."}
{"text":"This ihop has some problems.  If it weren't for our substitute server eddie, the whole experience would have been a waste.  We got here around noon on a Saturday and the place was slow.  We got seated but it took 1/2 hour before anyone came to take our order.  When eddie came by, he said that he wasn't our server but that he'd take our order for drinks and food. We waited for another 45 minutes before I got up and tracked Eddie down to find out who our server was. He told me that our server was on break and that the manager sent most of the employees home or on break leaving just eddie and another lady. When our food and drinks finally came, most of the food was burned.  This place is not well managed and should be avoided. The place looks new and fancy, but I've had better food at a hole in the wall dive than this shithole."}
{"text":"We have been to IHOP many times before and enjoyed it a lot, and also we have visited this location 4-5 times before.  However this time the food wasn't as up to par as previous times.  However the service was excellent ! food came less than 30 minutes and the waitress stop by few times just to check on the kids.

I would have given 5 stars if the food was not dry.  Yes, I will visit this location again."}
{"text":"How can you mess up a breakfast dish? 
Serve it cold and with hair. 
After two failed attempts of receiving my meal I pushed the untouched food to the side. 
The waitress very kindly removed it from the tab. That's why they got one star. Never going back."}
{"text":"My niece loves IHOP and since it was her choice off we went!  I am now addicted to the turkey bacon! It is one of the best I've had and I've had a lot. Of course the pancakes are always yummy. Especially with butter pecan syrup! delicious!!"}
{"text":"Paula Cross you are one of the best servers we have ever had! For a late night dinner or breakfast for that matter, you had us laughing like we were long lost family... Ihop you have a real treasure in this beautiful lady! I have already returned to just be served by this lady and if that doesn't mean anything the 15.9 miles to drive here has to. PAULA YOU ROCK!!!"}
{"text":"Normally when I come here the service is ok. This time I received the worst service. The restaurant was not too busy but our server was very inattentive. After waiting for ten minutes we had to ask someone to get our server. Once our food came we had to hunt someone down to bring us jelly for our bread. We were never asked during the meal if we needed anything. Then when my drink ran out, not only did I ask our server for water we asked someone else and never received it.  Not a very good experience at all."}
{"text":"It hurts to give only 2 stars because our server was so sweet and pleasant. We walked in to the overwhelming smell of urine. We thought, maybe a smelly person in the waiting area.. It wasn't. When we got to a booth, the stench seemed to be everywhere. We downed our drinks we had ordered and quickly got our tab and left. We've been here before and had pleasant experience, but the smell ruined this place for us. We could still smell it on ourselves as we drove the nearest McDonald's for breakfast"}
{"text":"I wish I could give no stars since we got absolutely no service. We just left there, Thursday July 9th at 8am. We walked in at the cashier was checking out a few customers and seemed like the only one working. Not one person acknowledge us. We sat there and watched employees walk around, talk to each other. Tons of opened tables too."}
{"text":"The food was great as usual but what made this experience so much better was out server Karina ask for her. She is amazing attentive,quiet, friendly, she stays on top of everything has no attitude wish I can have  her each time I visit."}
{"text":"Service very slow!! I understand its crowded i wish waiters could have been more attentive. Once food came it was good.

Service a bit slow and biscuit/gravy cold..i understand its busy but waiter could have been more attentive."}
{"text":"My expectations for IHOP are generally low, but this one is much better than most.  I've been there 3 times in the last several weeks, and the service has been consistently quick, friendly, and accurate.  The food is good to excellent for a lower priced restaurant, and I will definitely go back.  Oh, and they honor veterans with a free meal on Veteran's Day...and not just an egg and a piece of toast for breakfast, but a full combo meal."}
{"text":"Not a good visit for us. First inkling this place was lacking, bathroom smelled like a port-a-potty. Then expecting warm syrup (like visits to other IHOP's) with our pancakes, was told we had to \"request this beforehand\". Finally, my biscuits and gravy were served cold! Not even the bottom of the plate was warm! The hostess took it to have it re-done when I asked to have it warmed up. Guess I was supposed to \"request beforehand\" to have my food served hot?"}
{"text":"Really?! We are greeted with a pointing at a \"no split check\" sign on the registers and then given a lake a butter on my pancakes and water down iced tea. Note to management...check on your night staff, most servers are awesome...but really why would you serve this?!"}
{"text":"Thank you northern IHOP for doing it right!!!!!!! Michael from 19th and Bell almost turned me off for good but you redeemed yourselves!! Thank you Randell!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to stop in at IHOP (8/7/17) on Olive for a late breakfast and our experience was not anything to brag about.
Our waiter spoke so very fast and while my wife is deaf (I listen and speak for her) I can hear quite well but this male waiter talked in such a fast paced manner that I had to asked him on more than one occasion to please repeat himself which he did.
We placed our two orders and I ordered a cup of coffee with cream and my wife ordered a glass of diet Coke. My coffee was served and it looked and tasted like it was made many hours earlier, so very bitter.
My wife's \"cheese\" omelet had cheese on it but it was not in any way melted so we politely asked if they would please warm it up to melt the cheese which they did but it was returned to my wife very hot and my wife could hardly take a bite without burning her mouth. Inside my wife's \"cheese\" omelet there was not any cheese to speak of. 
A pot of coffee was placed next to me on the table but not once did they ask my wife if she wished to have a re-fill of her diet coke.
Prior to asking us if our meals were satisfactory and given our check my wife did note how poorly her omelet was prepared and we were not required to pay for her meal. We were pleased that we were not charged for my wife's meal.
Thank you..."}
{"text":"I have been to multiple iHops across the nation, and let me tell you-- this particular  location is superb. What makes this iHop unique is the cleanliness and urgency that the servers bring to the table (pun intended)... I don't usually prefer iHops, but this one was convenient, and to my surprise, extremely efficient in all aspects of the restaurant industry. A+ !!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with co workers. Got there at 1225. Ordered at 1230. My food arrived at 115 when everyone else was done eating and we had to leave."}
{"text":"I really wanted to choose .5 or 1/4 of a star.  The table was wiped with a dirty rag or something which left the table stained with leftover food from the previous patrons. Also noticed that it was the majority of the tables that were wiped with the same rag (gross). For two orders of pancakes took 40 minutes which seemed rather long for a simple one minute meal. The waitress was nice and I'm sure nothing more could be done by her to make things better. Once the food arrived it was horrible at best and to top off this great experience the tab came to $30. All that's left is the 15 minute check out and \"WOW\" never going to ihop again :( Booooooo."}
{"text":"Well the service was better. The food was standard for the chain. Tables are still very close. If your a big person you may not fit in the booths."}
{"text":"I love IHOP, specifically crepes, cheese blintzes. But this location can't make crepes. Please fix it guys!"}
{"text":"I love I hop.. I never have problems...

The nuttella creps are to die for....  diebetic coma after though."}
{"text":"Went here today. Food was okay, but the wait for the food was ridiculous. On top of that our waitress didn't provide good customer service at all. Not coming back here."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and this IhOP is great!

This is the only restaurant in which I can say they've gotten my take out order correct 100% of the time. 

I'm dining in tonight with my son and its clean (as always), service has been quick and the food is hot and tasty.  

The price isn't bad either.  
We love the new line of pancakes they've been coming out with.  

Last time we had the Tiramasu pancakes, this time we are trying the Cinna-stack panacakes.  Outstanding!  I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Came in with large fam, the waiter was nice and paid attention to our order n checked on us a few times, nice clean place, good tbone steak, id go again :)"}
{"text":"I always enjoy the omelettes specially the big steak omelette, today our server is Ramiro, he is very friendly and he is always checking what we need. My wife love the nutella crepes.

Very good food and excelente service... When You go to the store in rainbow and spring  mountain ask for Tracy, she is the best, there is always a smile on her face and always taking care of your needs."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service waited  one hour to be seated. I ordered my food and after 20 minutes the waiter comes to the table saying they didn't have crepes if I wanted to wait it would take more than 1 hour."}
{"text":"Awful. Waited an hour, my omelette was cold, and my kids pancakes were not fully cooked (batter was still visible in places). Hope nobody gets sick!"}
{"text":"The Mexican looking hostess today when I kindly asked how long for two people rudely said one hour. Not my fault that you're stressed because it's free pancakes day. You don't have to be a bitch to me and your coworkers. Quit if it's too hard. Get over yourself. You make me not want to go back to this location. You suck. You choose your attitude and you chose wrong."}
{"text":"Just returned from IHop at 2000 Northen Ave. After a truly awful meal, cold, cold and colder, and crumby service to say the least, I can whole heartily state, never even think of wasting your money at this place!!!

Went in around 11:30 AM for a bit to eat. My wife order the deep fried tilapia with mashed potatoes. One piece of the fish was okay, the other piece was cooked to a hard, burnt rock, but it gets better, or maybe worse. She asked for some tartar  sauce and gravy for her bare potatoes. The tartar sauce finally came, but the gravy never did! The potatoes, which were not very hot to begin with, were stone cold by the time the waitress checked back with us, not bringing any gravy. 
She offered to bring a new order of potatoes and gravy, when it arrived, the gravy was the same temperature as the refrigerator it had been taken out of!! Also, the new potatoes were only kind of lukewarm at best! 

While the waitress kept apologizing for the horrible food, it never changed the results!!
Longer story short, horrible preparation of food, and extremely bad service. 

I have never written a review of a restaurant before, but you need to be warned about what a crappy experience awaits you here!!!"}
{"text":"I used to love IHOP. Until I came to this location. It's the closest to my house so I have been there twice. Never will go again. The first time I was with my girlfriend and out waitress was very inattentive. Had to wait for about 30 minutes for the bill. I figured I would give them the benefit of the doubt because maybe they were short staffed or whatnot. But the second time I went it was a lot of the same. Took forever to get out drinks, I was given the wrong order, then after 45 minutes of my correct order not coming out I left. Terrible service. I would not recommend this place to anyone. It's a shame too because I was a sucker for the NY Cheesecake Pancakes."}
{"text":"Stopped in today and had the Strawberry Crepes!OMG soooo good,and the service was wonderful."}
{"text":"Today was the worst experience ever for this ihop location. Waited 45 min for food. I had ordered a cheeseburger omelet and french toast. Mind you, I have had this omelet 3 time prior from this location and others and knew what to expect. It's so yummy. And, I had been thinking about getting one and the taste of it for days. So yes I was ready for one and couldnt wait!!! Yet I was so disappointed once it was placed in front of me after all most an hour. The omelet looked like it was slapped on the plate and was missing ingredients. On top of that my french toast was missing. So, I immediately asked for the manager. The managers customer service was food and he actually offered to make my omelet over begging me not to walk out hungry. Yes, we'll the second omelet that was brought to the table looked pretty but it tasted like it was made my someone with very wet hands as the omelet tasted soggy. And, I still had to ask for syrup 3 times before receiving any. The only thing that made me feel \"a little\" better was the manager's attempt of service recovery and not charging me for the disgrace of an omelet. Thinking I still may never return. Definitely left a sout taste in my mouth!!! 2 stars for the manager!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here way too often.  But they keep sending us those damn buy one get one free entree coupons.  I'd probably be obese if it wasn't for the fact that they are so flexible and accomodating with their menu items.  

For example, last time we were there I ordered the french toast combo - but subbed egg whites for eggs, turkey bacon for regular, and fruit for hashbrowns.  The menu says there is a $.50 charge for subbing egg whites and turkey bacon, but they've never charged us!  

The staff is always friendly, and we've always had great service.  Whether its packed on a Sunday afternoon, or almost empty at 11pm on a Tuesday, we still get treated like IHOP royalty.  I told you we go here way too much.  

Would I go to IHOP without that buy one get one entree coupon?  Can't say I have.  But with it, no doubt."}
{"text":"This place has pretty descent food and service. I appreciate the kids eat free deal, since I'm a single mom- it definitely helps!"}
{"text":"It's four stars because service was fast.  Order was correct, food was hot and it was good for ihop.   No complaints here."}
{"text":"I love IHOP. I hate this location. Service is BAD. Even the Manager doesn't care. I am not sure how you mess up mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli, but they managed. The rest of my meal is coming back up as I write."}
{"text":"Was crowded today and waitresses were ignoring us but the host Matthew came to the rescue and gave us phenomenal service"}
{"text":"Got here at 10:05pm and there was a few tables with customers. Not at all busy. But the wait was a bit long for no one really in there. Order the Banana pancakes and I can tell you if you like bananas this is amazing. The price for it was fare and the food came to us Quick. Besides the wait everything was great. I am going back again that for sure."}
{"text":"I was driving from northern AZ and stopped at the Avondale IHOP on my way west.  I was tired, I was hungry, and IHOP was there.  So...park the car, walk in...and the hostess was busy conversing with a member of the waitstaff.  So I waited...and while I waited, a couple other groups came in behind me.  And the hostess continued her conversation.  Finally, a young man came up and grabbed a handful of menus and addressed the group behind me.  I don't know what he was thinking...I don't know IF he was thinking.  But just because I'm alone doesn't mean I want to sit at the counter and it certainly doesn't mean I want to wait until the group(s) behind me have been seated.  Past that...my server was polite and attentive, the food was fine and fast.  I wouldn't warn anyone away, but I would suggest to management that they remind their greeter/hostess that she's there to greet and seat, not chat with her friends."}
{"text":"Things kept getting worse ...

My daughter had a desire for some IHOP breakfast, so we stopped there after running several errands on a Saturday morning. With the opening Illinois football game in town, rain, and a holiday weekend, we did not know what to expect.

The restaurant was crowded but we were seated quickly. Thr waiter was pleasant. Our orders seemed simple: Belgian Waffle Combo and Ham and Egg Melt Combo. So we waited ... and waited ... and waited ... As people who ordered after us got their food it became clear that something had gone wrong. Our waiter had a pained look on his face when he saw what was going on. He came to the table and apologized for the wait. He took the Belgian Waffle Combo off our bill and gave us the bill early. Good attempt at fixing the situation, I thought. Then we waited ... and waited ... and waited ... Finally our food came. I had to ask for silverware since there had been only one set at the table. My sandwich looked lopsided -- one side much more full than the other. I attempted to rectify the situation myself only to find that my Ham and Egg Melt had no ham!

I flagged down the waiter to let him know what happened. He was going to have the sandwich redone, but I said no since we had already been in there so long and the order was still not right. I asked about speaking to the manager. Our waiter went away and told us that the manager said ... get this ... that I would be charged for the price of a kid's grilled cheese sandwich! I told the waiter that I found that insulting and told him that I was not going to pay for the sandwich. He then told me (don't remember if he went back and spoke to the manager again) that he was a crew chief and he would take care of things and that I would not be charged. We finished our meal and left.

The food was unremarkable but okay. Kudos to the waiter for trying to fix things. The management response about paying for the wrong meal was laughable.

With other superior breakfast options in town, it will be a long time before I come back to this particular IHOP."}
{"text":"Started off ok, my family wanted to make it a tradition to come every other week but that's over now. Went yesterday and they got all 3 orders messed up. I ordered the waffle combo with eggs and bacon. I asked for cheese on my eggs and bacon extra crispy. No cheese, fat uncooked on bacon and a cold waffle. My husband ordered the sampler and they failed to bring the pancakes and when they did, also cold. We ordered for my little one french toast, eggs, one bacon and one sausage and they brought us a pancake. I was super disappointed as this location is close and would have been nice to make tradition coming here but that won't happen!"}
{"text":"The service was very slow. About an hour from the time we were seated to delivery of food. Not happy"}
{"text":"The takeout process is terrible. There is no assembly line or procedure for taking accurate orders. I waited an 1hr for  pankcakes to-go and the dining area was EMPTY!!"}
{"text":"It took 20 min for my waiter to show up. When he took my order he sounded half awake which is scary because I am allergic to walnuts and pork so when I told him to tell the cooks not to cross contaminate he didn't really seem to get it. I told him I wanted pancakes that were not cooked in the same grease as the nut batter pancakes (I think they're called honey nut or something) he said ok. I also told him I wanted 4 strips of turkey bacon bucause I can't eat sausage or regular bacon. My meal came on a greasy plate w 2 turkey bacon strips and 2 sausage links. I told him I wanted the turkey bacon again he said he would get it no apology. took another 30 min for the rest of the bacon it was cold when I got it. I went to the front and found that he had charged me 2.50 for the bacon that should have come w my meal in the first place. Lady at te front said she couldn't do anything about it... Frustrated I pd the 15 dollar bill, that was only my meal, that's crazy expensive for greasy American food! I went to the ladies bathroom and it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks there was paper all over the damp floor and poo on the toilet seats. Don't go here."}
{"text":"preston is  awsome he was on point with his customer service he made my day! i had to come all the way from houston texas to las vegas to have beyond great customer service thank you preston you deserve a raise!"}
{"text":"My husband & I come here every time we're in Las Vegas for breakfast. We get seated quickly & the waitresses are always nice & quick to accommodate anything we need. The food is always good."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy IHOP. The kids like it so that alone makes life easier. I enjoy the steak tip dinner. But the last time I was there the bathroom was horribly dirty. And on my way to the bathroom I got a glimpse of the kitchen which caused me not to eat the meal I had just ordered. Restaurants have to be clean folks. I used to frequent this place but haven't been back since I saw the kitchen. Doubt I ever will unless I read a bunch of reviews saying something changed and everything is clean."}
{"text":"Awesome!! Nikkole is amazing!! She was the best waitress I have ever had especially how busy they were tonight. She was on point and I am very grateful!! Jaime was great too!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Some fellow associates and I came to try this new IHOP out in between business meetings. We expected the classic, quick IHOP experience but to our surprise we ended up waiting well over 45 min just for our food. My fellow partners pancakes had hair in it, they gave me the wrong French toast and the manager had no control over her work environment. She was also stupid. She did nothing compensate for the grievous errors."}
{"text":"Incompetence is the best way to describe my experience here. 35 minutes after our order was taken, our waitress returned to inform us that our order had been lost & to retake it. 12 minutes later we receive our order do to the manager becoming involved. The order was incomplete, I received half my order of pancakes & my friend didn't receive her toast. We asked for ketchup when our food was first brought to the table & had to ask for it again when the remainder of our order was given to us. Once we finished eating & the bill was delivered we were compensated for the bad service by not charging us for my orange juice & her coffee. Are you kidding me?!?!?! This place needs to be purged of all of it's current staff & replaced with capable people or it should be closed!"}
{"text":"My 16 year old daughter and I waited over 30 minutes for our order. We ended up leaving the restaurant before the food arrived. I don't understand why it was taking so long since the restaurant was nearly empty. Not once did anyone come to our table to let us know there was going to be a delay. I felt like a fool watching the wait staff walk towards us hoping they had our order. It's totally disrespectful to the customer to keep them waiting like a dog at dinner time. My daughter was looking forward to the crepes that we ordered and was let down by the experience. No one should be treated like that. Every customer is important and should be treated as such."}
{"text":"First, the dark colored floor was dusty/dirty. When my food came out, my eggs were rubbery (fried over well), but ate them anyway. I had ordered my bacon CRISPY, but what I got was 'floppy' bacon; but, I did eat some of the more cooked part. Lastly, my pancakes were dry and hard on the bottom. I asked the server for another order. When the reorder came out, the top pancake was just like the first order, but the bottom one was a little better. I ate that one. When I checked out, the cashier asked if everything tasted good and I said 'not really' and she just continued to ring me up.  Not sure I will visit this location again."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. The night lady ( lisa ) was extremely rude and as i looked up the prices i saw other bad reviews on her. We ordered 2 plates of hash browns and 2 orange juices, since when is 1 class 4.99 and my food was colder than my drink. The worker also comes out after me and my friend and tells us,\"you forgot your keys and you might need them even though you dint leave a good tip\", after she told us this she dropped the keys on the bench and walked back inside. Terrible service."}
{"text":"I was not even hungry when I took my family out to IHOP after checking in at the Buffalo Bill's. My wife asked for a table where cigarette smoke wouldn't bother us. All three personnel were super polite and friendly.   My wife ordered the chicken crepes and they were AWESOME. My mother ordered the tilapia dish and the fish actually tasted like fish; you know how fish often loses the taste at restaurants. I had a clam chowder and coffee and were alright- the rest of the food made up for that. Rhyan was our waiter and was very nice to us and made our baby laugh."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm going to give this 4 stars only because the service is usually pretty good here, a notch or 2 above Denny's at Concord Mills and actually better than the IHOP in Matthews, so kudos to the managers at this location as well as the staff. This is what it is, a breakfast place, not the Taj Mahal. I try to base my reviews on what a store or restaurant actually is , and not compare an IHOP to the Brown Derby. 
The food is consist ant and is my mothers fave place to meet my wife and I for breakfast. I only wish they offered omelet without the added pancake batter, it does make for a fluffy omelets, but my wife has gluten issues, and this severely limits her menu choices.  Try to arrive no later than about 8:30 unless you like waiting on a table.

Also the last few visits the Wi-Fi was down for some reason"}
{"text":"Another big box breakfast joint, what can I say, all the standard. It is just off a major highway, so unless you arrive before 830am or so on the weekend, be prepared to wait. If you want more detail just see my review for the IHOP in the Charlotte University area. The difference here is that the service is down a notch or two. While the service at the University location is at a minimum competent , it really can be lackluster here. I'm not expecting Brown Derby level service either, but I would like our coffee urn to be kept filled, and for our orders to be brought out together."}
{"text":"Busy place ~ pretty clean ~ friendly enough staff. Pretty predictable ~ good food for reasonable prices.

It a blessing to have a nice inexpensive place nearby.  : ) KC"}
{"text":"New location ~ haven't been able to get in yet ~too long of a wait ~ must mean it's good.

It's great to see so much prosperity.  Blessings : ) KC"}
{"text":"Never again!!!! Food was ok, service sucked!! Waited 15 mins. to be seated, 20 mins. to order another 20 mins. to get our food. Saw the waiter three times in over an hour. If you have a lot of time to waste this may be your place. Not mine!!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible,20 minutes without drinks and then 45 minuted for a pancake breakfast! I honestly wish i could give a negative stars! Will never come back ever again!"}
{"text":"It's the people that make the experience, thanks Wilbert.  Place was clean, waiter was on spot from the recommendations to making sure the beverages were refilled.  I would highly recommend this IHOP.  Make sure you ask for Wilbert.  I'll for sure return and try another dish.  IHOP change my mind today."}
{"text":"It is an IHOP and they are all pretty much alike. This one is o.k. as to when you go and who is cooking at the time. It can be really really good or really really bad. I would say what times we have been to this one that it has favored the good like 75%. We would go again as it is close to us as long as there isn't to much of a line. It can be a fairly long wait on the weekends. Parking runs out quick."}
{"text":"I had the Philly Cheese steak with onion rings...it was pretty filling and good.  The service so so and the waiters must have been new or really forgetful.  Over pretty good.  I did notice the blueberry pancakes just had them on top, not in them, kind of disappointing."}
{"text":"Had the build your and breakfast with the red velvet pancakes. Typical IHOP. Fast and delicious. Our server was Margrari. She did a fantastic job. Got the food out quick, correct, and she checked up back on us a couple times."}
{"text":"Truly the worst Ihop I have ever been to!!!  There was a waitress that was walking around sweating buckets of sweat while serving, not appetizing at all.  The food came out cold and looked completely unappetizing.  My husband got a Western Omlet--it had a little cheese and a few pieces of ham and literally NO ingredients iside, just all egg.  My food was awful, cold-it looked like they reused it from the last person that probably left it on the table uneaten.  Ugh, will never go there again."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I used to go 3 times a week and then I stopped because it was going soo down hill. Today my family and I went there, thought we would give it another shot and it was horrible. When we got our food, it was cold and we couldnt even tell our server because he never came back to check on us. My husband's eggs were raw too. The cashier asked how was everything? and I said bad, our food was cold. She said oh sorry. She could care less! I can officially say we will NEVER go back there again!!!! Don't waste your money at this place!"}
{"text":"Always satisfying at one or two in the morning with a friendly and funny staff. Food isn't the best but it is available and affordable at all times. Good restaurant."}
{"text":"Servers have no knowledge, slow paced staff and never have grits even though it's advertised as 24-7."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service at 715 a.m. on a Saturday after Christmas?  15-20 minutes after ordering the food came to us. 2 breakfasts off eggs, bacon and waffles with one coffee and one OJ cost us 27 dollars and change. I left 30 dollars total only because I wanted to leave and didn't have exact change for my bill, otherwise I wouldn't of tipped."}
{"text":"Every time I put a to go order in its 5 + min and they act like they don't know the menu. The food will get the 4 star review but the phone service is horrible."}
{"text":"First of all it only gets 1 star because there isn't an option to select NO stars. DON'T GO HERE!! we came in about 2:45am after leaving a concert in the area and getting back to our car. We pull up to the parking lot which looks empty. We go in, there are about 10 tables of seated customers. At least 5 of them had no food and 4 of those didn't even have drinks yet. There is 1 couple waiting to be seated ahead of us. We wait about 20 minutes to be seated. The manager finally seats us at a dirt table for 6. There were only 2 of us and plenty of 2 person tables avail. We didn't complain. Another 15-20 minutes goes by. The manager comes back to us and see we haven't gotten drinks. He asks if we have even put in a drink order..nope. So he takes our drink order and send a waitress over with our drinks about 5 minutes later. Who bring us each our drink and a second drink each. (knowing she wouldn't be back in time to give us a refill) at this time we place our order. We wait and wait and wait for about 45 minutes. Many more people have arrived and been seated by this time but still there same 5 tables that didn't have food when we came in still had no food. So about an hour since we had been seated a waitress walked by and we asked her how much longer our food would be. She said it should be ready. We told her to just go ahead and box it up. By this point it was almost 4am and lots of obnoxious drunks being loud. She gladly said okay. About 10 minutes later she bring us our bags of food and says its on the house. We were so upset at the whole situation by this point but we nicely said thank you and left. Got back to our hotel to eat our cold food and none of it was even right. I don't know who's order we got but it wasn't ours. We attempted to eat some of it but it tasted horrible. No flavor just plain bland cold rubbery eggs and bacon. TERRIBLE. then only reason we stayed was because we were starving and it was all that we could find open. I don't know how this place is still in business or how the IHOP chain hasn't closed them down yet."}
{"text":"Easily the worst IHOP I have ever been to. The service is horrendous, slow and the servers couldn't be more miserable. Food isn't great and it's kinda expensive. Go to Cracker Barrel 10 mins away from a meal that's 100 times better. 0/10"}
{"text":"Is there anyone working here or what? The guy host/server didn't even greet us or asked us how many in our party. He just assumed that it was us 2 girls eating. It's 10am. It's not even busy. But we have received past mediocre service. It took forever FOREVER ! To get our drink order. Manager I'm assuming can't recall her name took our drink order & breakfast order. I feel discriminated because of my age. Yes, I am young but believe I am one of the best tippers ever. Just because I'm young doesn't mean I can't tip. I worked in a upscale restaurant I know this people work for their tips. But it's super frustrating that 1. Slow slow service. 2. Order didn't come out completely right. 3. I asked for Cholula  but by eggs and hash browns got cold by the time I was able to catch one of the other servers. My friend asked for another glass  of milk, & even though the server said, \"just give me a moment please\" as if it was a real bother. In all, I  hesitate to even leave a tip because I truly don't think the manager or anyone in this establishment deserves a tip. I won't return and I don't recommend  this place at all."}
{"text":"This is a good IHOP location. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The dining area is nice and clean, and the tables were clean and comfortable. The service was slow, but otherwise they were very good."}
{"text":"Cold everything had to talk to 2 managers about it in the middle of the restaurant very embarrassing. Not even busy 50% full. Terrible and not coming back.

After waiting for 10 min to put in an order, 10 min for coffee, then the cold food.  They gave us 25% off and a card for $10 off on our next visit, really?  I told them that this should be comped after embarrassing us so much and told them to keep the damn card.  Then went upfront to pay and somebody in the back said \"F them they aren't going to pay, call the cops\". I don't walk out on checks this was another embarrassment.  I had the GM called the front, and she comped the check.  I will call corporate and I expect the food runner to be fired and the GM Demoted.  This is NOT how you run a restaurant!  I have NEVER been so embarrassed in all my life of eating out.  Never eating at another IHOP again.  I don't know why we didn't go to Eat n Park.  BTW, this is in an affluent area of Pittsburgh, not an area where people will walk checks, this is not the hood."}
{"text":"Gave this location another shot today. Horrible service! The waiter was \"busy\" with one other table so someone else brought the completely wrong order to our table. Never came back to check on us and we had to wait at the front for the check. This has happened both times. There were a total of seven tables in the entire restaurant at this time, four of which already had their food. Definitely will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"This is quite literally the most poorly managed restaurant I have ever seen. Consistently, insanely understaffed, service is nonexistent and just getting a table is basically a miracle. I have worked in food service for 5 years and can't even begin to list the problems this IHOP has. If you don't have 2 and a half hours to wait for less-than-adequate service, please do not waste your time. Do not go to this IHOP."}
{"text":"Food was excellent however, first server was RUDE!!!! When I came to sit down I didn't even sit down and I was asked for the drink I wanted. I replied applejuice she immediately snapped no free refills are allowed. I didn't even ask for a refill!!!! She then left and there were 3 other servers coming to the table. So out of order!!! Things I asked for did not come to the table. I was like forget it!!! They need polite individuals that present customer service and structure!!!! The only good thing out of this situation was good food!!!"}
{"text":"The service was alright, but there was a short black curly hair in the food. Right in the middle. Food was below average."}
{"text":"At first I thought this place was just bad when its crowded (after 1 am) with teenagers. But when I tried them again in the middle of the day when it was relatively empty, the service was worse. Our particular waitress kept forgetting what I wanted, brought me the wrong meal, charged me the wrong prices, and not to mention she was flirting with my boyfriend."}
{"text":"Just wanted a quick breakfast. Usually IHOP is OK, not this time at this one. Got seated quickly even though they were kind of busy (about 8 entries before us on the seating list). Now is where it goes wrong. Waited about 10 minutes to order then 45 minutes for food. A couple that came in about 10 minutes after us got their food about 15 minutes before us, don't know who they tipped for this. The waitress never came back to tell us the kitchen was backed up or slow, we just waited contemplating leaving.  I ordered the country fried steak and eggs. It barely qualified as such. The steak was almost 1/8 in thick and the breading barely there and overcooked. It was obviously frozen and deep fried. The eggs and hash browns not remarkable at all. My wife got eggs and bacon, both over cooked. The bacon had been cooked hours before and reheated. It was dark and very limp. We discussed sending the food back, but didn't want to wait another 45 minutes and we were getting close to an appointment time and would not have time to go somewhere else so we picked out what was edible.The service is the only thing getting 2 stars, food was minus 2.  I WON'T BE RETURNING AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS STORE TO ANYONE."}
{"text":"Horrible rude service from the servers to the Manager Tina.. Worst experience ever"}
{"text":"What happened IHOP??? Pancakes were terribly thin, cold and chewy. Eggs were like a sponge. I would expect this kind of food from a cafeteria. Horrible food, just horrible."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if it was possible. The service wasn't bad except for the fact that they gave me water that had things floating in it, and when I asked for another glass there was no difference. IT LOOKED LIKE TOILET PAPER IN MY WATER. There were also eggs that had spilled onto the floor and 45 minutes later the manager sat a table while stepping over the eggs stating it had just happened. The most disgusting establishment."}
{"text":"I am a fan of IHOP anyway but this IHOP had good service, attentive and prompt.  Food was on par as usual and would recommend this location.  We were a party of six and had the spinach and mushroom omelette, chikcken fried steak, breakfast special, western omelette and chicken tenders.  Everyone was content and FULL at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"We went today for breakfast and it wasn't busy so we thought we'll be in and out. Well we ordered and our food took almost a half hour which is surprising since it's not busy. I ordered the cinnamon roll French toast brioche and my hubby ordered the blueberry pancakes. Sadly the food was cold & at this point didn't feel the need to send it back since our wait was so long to begin with. I understand if a place is busy but when you don't have a full house why the long wait? The waitress was friendly & so was the hostess but other than that they need more help in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here the waitress was terrible got my order wrong twice because she simply couldn't listen. The manager needs some retraining your customers should be satisfied!"}
{"text":"The manager here is ridiculous. First off he was upset that we had a party of 10.. As soon as we walked in he made this \"ugh..\" sound. Our group wasnt drunk or being loud.. So he had no reason to give attitude. Then when we were leaving we had our checks split.. He got upset at the fact that my friend had a 100 dollar bill broken. THIS IS A RESTAURANT IN VEGAS... I'm sure we're not the only people paying with cash on the strip. Get over it and take the money. However, our waiter \"lobo\", I believe was his name was extremely polite and very attentive. 3 stars for his service and no stars for the idiot most likely senile manager."}
{"text":"Horrible we went in with my wife and my son to have breakfast the meal was so so at best  the coffee was old tasted awful asked  if they could brew a new pot I then asked for the check  when I got it back I couldn't believe my eyes my wife and son asked for turkey bacon instated of the regular bacon and they charged  us $2.89 each piece of bacon I asked for the manager and she tried to tell me that in the  future they were going to change their prices on their menu I told her I didn't care about the future I am leaving in the present she took the check with sarcasm and made the proper changers. I will never again set foot in IHOP IN CENTENNIAL they are the absolute the worse. I will spend my money else where. IHOP YOU WANT MY BUSINESS \"Get some real Managers\" someone that can deal with human beings"}
{"text":"Not the best crowd, there was a drunk lady customer cursing and wasn't moved until requested by me, very slow service, no one came to the table to take the order after they gave the menu and I had to yell out to just get a server to come to my table, my first time at this ihop, and the worst service I ever had in my ihop history, no complains for other locations yet, but this was the worse. Our server was a polite guy, but this Place has bad management in the sitting area and the kitchen too."}
{"text":"Great experience! This is the first IHOP I've been to that the food looked exactly like the picture and better. My BLT was packed with turkey bacon and goodness! If you're in the Las Vegas area you should definitely visit. It's 24 hours and worth the trip."}
{"text":"Met up with a group of friends over there and once I sat down, I waited 15min for a menu. I had to get the waiter's attention just so I can place my order, and on top of that my friend asked for a refill on an orange juice, and he waited 10min for it. I think that's unacceptable, it's not like the place was packed. Food was okay, but I'd rather go to Denny's."}
{"text":"So I come to Ihop to eat as I was craving the food and close to work. As we walk in and wait to be seated. The hostess were talking... another one came over and saw us waiting and still took her time to seat us. When she was ready she was talking to herself not paying attention to us. She then seated us and we waited about 15 minutes for our waitress to come over and thats only because we told the busboy to get the mgr. in whic the mgr refused and sent Vica the waitress. Who was very apologetic and took out our order. Her mgr pussied out and sent this locely lady over... roles and pay shoold be reversed.... thank you Vica...."}
{"text":"A three you shall be because your bacon did not make me glee...

Ok so that was a bad rhyme, but that is mostly why I give this IHOP a three because out of my eggs, which were cooked right, my hash browns which were a sweet golden...well brown, and my toast, the bacon was not up to par. It was chewy  and cold, and it tasted as though it had been sitting out for a day or so. Needless to say I have definitely had better. 

However, IHOP is a great chain, though since I moved to Vegas, Blueberry Hill has been my favorite breakfast spot, and I wanted to give this one a three at least because the wait at such a busy time on a Saturday morning was great. We got there and they had said 15min, but as soon as we sat down and got a couple sentences out, they called us and we had  table. There was a lot of folks in front of us too, but they got them a table quickly I guess. One things I would recommend is if you have a group of 8, just get two tables of four, because this guy next to us apparently had been waiting a while and he was not very happy at the IHOP staff. 

Service was quick, food was decent except for the bacon, so all in all a three fits just fine for this location."}
{"text":"This was the worst thing that's ever happened to me, and my parents died. Legit, no joke. I want to die, but that's not related to this IHOP. More to the point about this IHOP, their service takes forever, the food is mediocre at best, and there's no reason I should pay this much for such a terrible experience. Sad!"}
{"text":"Cory C was our server tonight. We eat out once a week for a cheat meal. He was so attentive and kind. He even offered us a take home box so we could give our extra food to a homeless person instead of wasting it. I would come back to this location just to have great service from him again. 
Also he sang to us as he delivered our food. 

Thanks Cory :)"}
{"text":"Honestly I give this place 2 stars because even tho I reminded them TWICE about my French toast they still never brought it to me and never refilled my water..... My hash browns were barely cooked and they kept ignoring my request for more water. They can definitely put more effort into their orders"}
{"text":"Though the staff were friendly when someone decided to wait on you. Thx. Goodness for Miss Tiffany because I probably would have walked out."}
{"text":"This place is  dirty they brought me a cup that still had food on it. The people are rude. We were here for about 30 minutes before they took our order! Yes my first time at this location and my last!"}
{"text":"The service at this location is outstanding. Every time I go I'm greeted with friendly faces and I never have to ask more than once for anything. My drink is always full, something I appreciate even more now that I live in Arizona, and we are always offered to-go drinks when the meal is done. The place is always clean and well staffed and I've yet to have a bad experience here.

As for the food itself, it's iHop! Not much to comment on other than it's always been well prepared and tasty. Haven't had any complaints about any of my orders and they always come to the table promptly. Great location, they will treat you right here."}
{"text":"Expensive and small portions. 


If there is a Fast Eddie's near you, go there instead. Great price and good portions."}
{"text":"My daughter and I decided to have breakfast out this morning. Big Mistake.
We went to IHop because she loves pancakes and waffles. The restaurant was busy but we were still seated right away.  
Our Server Kate came over promptly to get our drink orders. When she brought our drinks she got our food orders after that it kind of went downhill.
It took 20minutes to get our food (pancakes with face and brioche french toast) shortly after we got our food and after we had ordered a 2nd chocolate milk my daughter tells me she has to use the restroom. (Daughter is 7 ) . When we return from the restroom our table has been bussed and there is someone else sitting there. We were not in the restroom that long. her pancake had not been eaten and I had only finished one piece of my french toast, als0 her 2nd chocolate milk had not been drank.
I went  over to the hostess stand to say something and they were less than helpful.
They did say sorry. I said that the check was still on the table as well as uneaten food
then they handed me  my check. 
I was about to pay the whole tab and I was getting angrier for the lack of reaction from the Manager I told the manager that I did not think I should pay for my daughters
pancakes since she did not get a chance to eat them.
She removed them from the bill and her note on the check was \"did not eat\".
I'm not sure what I expected but I will not be back."}
{"text":"This location specifically must be poorly managed. I did an online to go order and it was a complete strikeout on IHOP's part. I thought something simple, one cheeseburger and fries as well as a chicken, bacon, and avocado wrap. The lady and I ordered a couple sides of ranch for the fries. Easy enough, the burger was okay once it finally arrived. However the ranch never came and neither did the bacon or avocado for the wrap. The wait was right around 90 minutes and still wasn't a correct order. Minimal/zero effort was given to compensate when contacted in regards to this foul up."}
{"text":"The food is really good. I rally love their pancakes, However, our server was really careless and rude. He hardly even spoke or made eye contact. The food is good though. =)"}
{"text":"I will never eat there again we order our food and it took 45 min to get it and the place wasn't even busy"}
{"text":"We walk in, got sat at a booth. A server comes up to us drops off an empty pitcher of coffee doesn't say a word to us then walks away. After sitting down for about 10 minutes and no one comes up to us and greets us at all. We then got up and left ... POOR SERVICE!!! By the way we work in the restaurant industry."}
{"text":"After Call away Golf Course, my dad said he was hungry. One of my nephews (the younger one), suggested Ihop. So Ihop it was. As we got there, the parking lot wasover crowded and people were waiting outside to be seated. It took us a few minutes to find parking. While we were looking for parking, my dad got out to hold a spot for us. Shortly after that, we finally found parking, parked, and walked towards the restaurant. Our wait time was but 20-25 minutes before we finally were seated. Once seated, the waitress took order drink orders. The boys had chocolate milk, orange juice, and my son had a lemon strawberry mix. My dad had coffee. My mom and I had coffee and orange juice. As for our dishes, the boys had Rooty-Jr plates wish consisted of Pancakes, Sausage, pancakes, and eggs. My son had a sandwich soup combo. And my parents and I each had the breakfast sampler plates which had pancakes, has browns, ham slices, bacon, sausages, and eggs. We had a great time."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of IHOP, the food is delicious, unfortunately this location has the worst service. Very slow and incompetent. Orders are always messed up. And I have been there multiple times, and each time there is a wait even though there are multiple empty tables, the servers take 20 min before they come to take your order and then the food takes an hour!! Very disappointed by this location. Will definitely not be returning again!"}
{"text":"They really need to learn to cook. They're shelled eggs taste exactly like powdered eggs and greasy. Hash browns for real greasy fries taste like ever cooked with onion rings everything taste like onions. Bacon was undercooked. The only thing that was cooked right was the pancakes but it's impossible to screw up pancakes. I call it our $30 not so meal. What does staff was friendly. They can't help how horrible the cooks are."}
{"text":"We waited 45 minutes for our food. We arrived before 3 other groups and they got their food before we did. The food was undercooked and still doughy. The server never checked on us and gave us the wrong drink."}
{"text":"Today was FREE pancake day at IHOP... One of the busiest days of the year for ihop. Best day on earth for customers , worst day of the year I'm sure for the employees (I work with the public, it's understandable!). I was guided to a seat in less than 20 minutes, the server was extremely patient with me as I waited for my boyfriend and mom to join, and was so understanding and sweet when we were delaying the order waiting for my mom! He hooked us up with the extra pancakes even though my mom couldn't make it due to a family emergency. The staff at this location is so sweet and is the kind of people you think of as a family member or close friend because they are so kind. I will never stop coming here and I wish I knew the waiters name because 10 stars for him!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  I placed a carryout order.  I was told by toneka to be there in 15 minutes.  I got there in 15 and waited an additional 30 minutes to get my food on a pick up order.  When I told toneka that she should have told me 45 minutes for pick up she raised her voice to me then quickly turned her back and walked away.  Such a rude and unprofessional  person should not be working with the public.  When food got home toast and hash browns were burnt.  Over easy eggs had hard yolks and pancakes were ice cold.  I used to go here 1 to 2 times a week.  But will never return."}
{"text":"Well, I've just returned home after going to iHop for breakfast.  We were seated as soon as we walked in, which was surprising given the number of cars in the parking lot.  But, after waiting more than 15 minutes at the table and not being greeted or acknowledged in any way by any of the wait staff, I went to the hostess stand and let them know that our server was MIA.  One of the hostesses went off to search for him or her, but after another five minutes with not even a glass of water or any acknowledgement that the restaurant had any intent to feed us, we got up and left.  As we were leaving, no restaurant employee said anything to us, including the girls at the hostess stand who knew the issue.  The service here stinks.  Avoid it and go to Dunkin Donuts across the street."}
{"text":"That man that was working today, cooking, needs Manager Training. As a professional and a manager myself I would never yell or degrade my staff and fellow workers as he did the entire time we ate breakfast. All of the staff seemed to be beat down but still came to the tables with a smile. I was shocked at how his behavior was tolerated. It was completely unprofessional! The woman manager gave us a discount but we didn't want a free meal we gave it as a tip instead, a well deserved tip!"}
{"text":"The worst IHOP I've ever experienced and I even gave it a second chance. Avoid it at all costs, just go to a different location. You will wait forever to be seat, wait forever for your food and then when it finally comes it won't even be what you ordered. One time they were purposely not clearing empty tables so they did not have to seat patrons, causing people to give up and leave. Very disappointing as I was so happy when they opened since it was close to my house."}
{"text":"This was our second attempt to eat at this IHOP location, the first time had a 45 minute wait, so we passed. We were very surprised to be seated within 15 minutes. Our server seemed very friendly at first, brought is coffee and water quickly (while spilling mine all over the table) and took our order quickly. I have to say the atmosphere here is not my favorite. There were a great deal of children and it was extremely loud. Our food didn't take too long and when it was delivered, I asked for ketchup. After the server left, I noticed my turkey bacon was far under cooked, but It was still edible. The issue came when we were trying to get ketchup. Our server was seated her second table and after that we never saw or spoke to her again until we were finally brought our check. I had to spend 15 minutes trying to flag down any employee to get a bottle of ketchup. We finally got another server to bring us the ketchup. We also saw a manager checking on all the other tables around us but she never stopped at ours. I know it was busy, but our server had only two tables to take care of which is nothing in a regular, busy restaurant! Our complete lack of service was appalling and we will not be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Food is always good, but the service and the cleanliness is always lacking. There is usually a 4'11\" Hispanic receptionist there who may have the worst attitude in the history of food services. My wife and I always wager that she will exceed her previous horrible performance. She's undefeated"}
{"text":"I haven't been to IHOP in a while and do not remember it being this bad. The coffee was bitter service left a lot to be desired. The harvest pancakes were awful I asked to exchange them which I rarely do but they were that bad however I didn't get my new pancakes until I was done with my meal when I asked for a Togo box is when she realized I never got my pancakes I would have asked for them earlier as I needed a refill on my water as well but she never returned until the end. Just a disappointing experience overall."}
{"text":"Five stars because the food just tastes amazing. Must have a secret recipe for the funny face pancake."}
{"text":"Great food and Filipe made our dining experience a perfect one. The food was cooked quickly but everything was done perfectly."}
{"text":"Everytime I go here it seems the food gets worse and the price gets higher. I'm pretty certain this will have been my last trip to the Ihop chain."}
{"text":"I placed take-out orders with them on several occasions and only once has the food tasted very good.  The coffee has no flavor.  The pancakes are very doughy on each order except one.  The worst thing is that they consistently forget to include all food items I ordered in the bag.  I had to go back to the store on several occasions for them to give me the rest of my order.  Also, I ordered  the short stack of pancakes, which is suppose to include 3-pancakes, but they only gave me 2-pancakes.  I decided to try another IHOP to compare.  If you order take-out, make sure you carefully look in the bags to ensure they included everything you ordered!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast there. 10 years ago, the food was so bad I said, \"I would never go back!\" Broke my word, went to a new one 3 weeks old, still bad. Coffee was so weak, no flavor, could read a newspaper through the bacon and the syrup was thin and tasteless and the waffle was airy! I promise I will never return!"}
{"text":"Store #3096 is the best IHOP I have ever been to. I have worked in several restaurants including an IHOP, and this one is the cleanest and most efficient one I've been to. It was extremely busy with a full lobby when my husband and I got there, but the hostess was on point, she greeted each guest and had most people sat in less than 10 minutes. Our waitress was pleasant and even though she was busy as well, she didn't make us feel rushed at all, and she checked on us often. Even the busboys were great, quick clean-ups as each table left.
We were there at 1:00pm on Saturday, July 18."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Servers are very nice and courteous. The food is excellent and the price is right even for las Vegas. So stop by and what ever you need, breakfast, lunch or dinner. They are open 24hrs."}
{"text":"It's so sad that a place with this name has such horrible service. My family loves IHOP and we were so excited it was opening just 5 minutes from us. We visited it about 3 weeks ago. It was a Saturday morning and we hit it around 10am. There was no wait and we were seated immediately. Our teas were never refilled. The food was slow to come out and service was OK.   So we said we would give it another shot. We went today and we will not be returning ever. We had a 15 minute wait. After we were seated we placed our drink order and our food order as we knew what we all wanted. We got our drinks and just 30 short minutes later we received most our food. I informed the waitress my cup had lipstick and finally got it replaced. We had all our food after 40 minutes ate and left. My eggs were barely cooked and I ask for over medium. The sausage was cold and the bacon was just ok. My kids had pancakes. One was cold the other hot. Server never check on anything and the place was not very busy. They are not going to be good for locals as they are going to rely on their solely their name and cater to people passing through. 
Save yourself frustration and eat somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Outstanding service. Only knocked it to 4 stars because I wanted to eat & work on the computer but their WiFi is horrific. But if you're just going for food & service..."}
{"text":"The only reason my hubby and I go here is because it's close by. Tonight was the last visit we will make to this location. 

Our server, marylin, was sweet and courteous. Seated us right away and was very diligent. Although we did not like how we received our appetizer with our meal that sat in the window for about 10 minutes. The food was okay. But the environment completely blew. Granted its IHOP but my expectations are higher than what was met. Next time it's Denny's."}
{"text":"Came here on a sat morning. The place is packed and it is SMALL. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated. Service was slow as they were short staffed. (Per a waiter). Coffee was lukewarm and I am convinced that the pot wasn't full to begin with as it only served 2 small cups of coffee. Food was \"eh\".  I've had better food at the diner in the next town over."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this no stars. Came in December 16th at about 8:30, got led by an employee who didn't know where to sit us and took us around the restaurant just to be seated. We were waiting for almost 20 minutes and not one person came by to ask if we had been helped or given drinks. We noticed a few other tables that were probably in the same situation, one lady even left when a waiter came by because of the time she waited. This other table had been helped out and they arrived 10 minutes after us! It didn't look like there was many employees on shift, but there was definitely some screwups with people's orders. 
This is the worst customer service we've ever experienced at an IHOP location. It's a shame because it's the nearest to our home."}
{"text":"My server Jennifer was very courteous and fast to seat me and take my order. Confused as to why it took over 15 minutes to get a couple eggs and hash browns when the place was empty.The crappy part was seeing my food in the window for another couple of minutes while 6 servers and manager milled around in the kitchen. My server apologized for the delay and didn't return for a call back until I was done . Never mind clearing the dirty plates, leave it up to another helpful server."}
{"text":"Seriously upset to see servers more preoccupied talking to each other than doing service. Then after 10 minutes I asked for a server...nothing. 15 minutes with no service seemed like enough disappointment. Thanks for ruining a celebratory luncheon my husband and I wanted to have before we have to go in to work...I will never go here again"}
{"text":"I had such a disappointing experience at this location. Way understaffed. Our server went on break apparently and no one ever came to check on us. I needed to flag someone down to even get a check. Then wait a while before a cashier even came. When I tried to get anyone's attention in kitchen, most just looked at me and didn't even respond. An older couple was waiting almost 10 minutes to get seated. The restaurant was nearly empty but no staff was around to help. There was no manager on duty. The shift leader finally was apologetic. I think such a large national chain should be ashamed at the level of service. I've been to this location numerous times and  service has been slow before, never to this extent."}
{"text":"Awesome! We came here for breakfast not to long ago and it is great! Our waiter was very polite and our food and drinks came very quickly. My pancakes were great and the sausage was awesome. My mom did think her food could use a bit more sauce but then our server gave us more without even telling her! We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad at all. For a late night craving (even if it's sweets or just breakfast) this place is 24 hours :) Arriving at this place with most restaurants closed, is pretty relieving cause when it comes to comfort food, this place is where you want to be. 
Service was pretty fast, quick to the order, quick to the food. Can't complain about my server, he did it all (greeted, sat us down, took our order, bought our food, cleaned our mess, and checked us out at the cash rap) great job for him.
The food came out looking good. It didn't look as if it's been waiting under a warmer. And the crepes I had was the joy of my meal. It's my favorite nutella crepes with banana, whip cream, and juicy strawberries. But from past experience, even tho the hot drinks in those big mugs looks great on picture, it sure doesn't taste great. I passed on it this time ;)"}
{"text":"I've been to many IHOPs many times. Every other location I go to, either in Charlotte or in another state on vacation; for some reason it is never good. I like to excuse it by saying maybe I went at the wrong time? But it shouldn't be like that. I should have had a good experience every time I go. I'm talking about the food itself and not the service. That review could go on another IHOP location. But this specific location in Matthews is always great. Every time I go here the food is always good. Service from the servers is usually good. 

That day I checked in was when I had brunch here and there was someone training a new supervisor or something? They were the only problem I encountered at this location so far. I mean I'm not expecting to eat at a 5 star restaurant with great customer service. But when I walk into a restaurant, I feel as if workers should at least act like customers matter. Greet them with a smile and seat them or let them know there's a wait. The two workers did not do any of this. I think the trainee was shy or nervous but he was laughing about not wanting to do anything while the trainer spoke to him in an unprofessional way that should not be in front of customers. 

Overall, I love IHOP because it's 24/7 and I'm obsessed with pancakes. The Matthews location is better than any other location I've been to at any time of the day. If the servers could act a little more professional, that would be cooler."}
{"text":"They had 59 cent pancake stacks. My wife and I went here because of that. It was really good pancakes, granted I don't eat much pancakes because I am watching what I eat. I also got eggs, hashbrowns, and some bacon. It was really good. The service was good too. The bill came out to $8 for the two of us. I left a $4 tip since I will usually leave a $2 per person tip for good service if under $10 a person. The toast was not good though. It tasted stale. It was very busy, but we sat down fast, got our food fast and was served well. I would go again!"}
{"text":"I dont usually go to iHop but this visit was better than I anticipated. I was gonna order some pancakes but I decided to order the \"Mega Monster Burger\" and it was quite delicous. I also really like the taste of the Mtn Dew. But the service was slow, maybe because my waiter was an Undercover Boss."}
{"text":"I remember when I was young, this place used to be called \"The International House of Pancakes \" and we all called it IHOP for short. 

Well apparently somewhere a few years back, they decided to change there official name to \"IHOP\". I could only guess that the old name probly limited the number of people that where looking for a burger and not a pancake...

Either way, keep up the good work!
I love having a great selection of breakfast food, any time of day.."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. I've had bad service at other IHOP locations, but this particular location receives a gold medal for Worst Service EVER. 

I was told the wait would be 15 minutes max, and 30 minutes later my party was seated. The sodas were flat and warm (ICK!), so the waitress exchanged them for \"fresh\" ones, which were also flat and warm. We settled for water and coffee..can't go wrong there, I suppose, except for the water glasses had bits of food stuck to them from

The food took an absurdly long time to come out. When it did, we were all disappointed:

Friend's pancakes included several black hairs inside of the pancake.
My side of ranch was obviously old with a yellow tinge and sour taste.
My breakfast sandwich was drenched in butter.
Other friend's pancakes were so soggy in the middle that they kind of congealed together.
Everyone's breakfast sausage was dry and bland.

For specializing in pancakes and being known for their breakfast dishes, this place sucked. I won't be spending my money here again, EVER."}
{"text":"I've had bad experiences here before but never waited more than an hour to get food before. On top of that didn't even get coffee in that amount of time. At least 20 people came in after us and were seated before were. This place needs to close down and a Denny's can open in its place."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about IHOP, but I think it is totally overpriced and disgusting. 

I rather go to Denny's. 

The last time I went here our bill was $60 for 4 people- that is a little ridiculous... especially when my order was not right, and my food was cold. 

Disgusting... who wants to eat cold eggs with their french toast. 

I was so disappointed."}
{"text":"Best IHOP experience in AZ thus far! Our food was great but the fact that they have \"BOYSENBERRY\" syrup was definitely the WOW factor!! Not many IHOPs carry boysenberry anymore (Shameful) but this Ihop knows how to make the customer happy! Our server Amber was terrific ! She even warmed..I REPEAT.. WARMED our syrup without us even asking for that! What a Gem!  Amber delivered on the special request that we had made on our orders and checked on us several times to ensure our meal was great !  We definitely will be back!"}

The waiting for breakfast to be served was about 45 min and came incomplete. No utensils or napkins no check up after breakfast was served. It wasn't a good experience at all and very frustrating to be honest."}

{"text":"Worst breakfast ever! Dirty, unfriendly (except for Sicily), and food was sub par. The server we had never came to the table and after 12 minutes I waived someone done for help. Another server came by who didn't know the menu or specials. Food took way longer than expected and I like I said was sub par. Alberto the server needs some retraining on customer service. VERY DISAPPOINTED!"}

{"text":"Me and a buddy came here a few weeks ago at 2am. Granted, I understand 2am service will be a little bit less than normal dining hours (although I don't think that's a good excuse, but I understand it). Seated instantly. Food was good except for the steak I had ordered. I asked for it medium rare and it came out extremely well done... before I even said anything the waitress had said they were already making a new one for me ( that was good- without me having to say anything ) BUT THEN the next steak came out and it was extremely well done, almost exactly the same as the first steak. At this point there was no reason to cause a ruckus but what a let down... business side you are using more of your inventory to correct a messed up order, but without even fixing it! I enjoy their pancakes of course so I will return.. will just have to be super specific when/if I order steak from there again"}

{"text":"Love the updated look and location. This is my boyfriends favorite place so it's hard to go wrong here! The waitress was over apologetic for little things that weren't a big deal. I also thought it was odd that my hash browns were a square shape but other than that good experience!"}
{"text":"This is the first & last time I will be coming here. My fries were cold and when I received a \"new\" batch it was just warm, which looked like the leftovers from my order, not even hot or a fresh batch! The reason why I gave one star, was for the waitress. She was nice and I can't blame her for the kitchen staff making the food. When I got home I felt sick from eating the greasy tasting burger and the awful fries and chicken soup. From the other reviews I read, this IHOP needs a new kitchen staff who cares about sending out quality food rather than trying to get the food out which was slow and not fresh! I've been to better IHOPs and this one is the worst for food quality!"}

{"text":"- went in 3 times.
- twice we did not get serviced and no came to the table.
- poor management and unprofessional
There is always a wait
Even if there is 10 free table.

Never once was greeted by hostess or cashier."}

{"text":"I hadn't checked the reviews, This IHOP was just close to where I had the gang this morning and I wanted to take them out to breakfast, so we went.  I mean its IHOP, how different can it be right?

DO NOT GO TO THIS IHOP!

It was average busy and we were seated relatively quickly.  Admittedly we were a big group (10).  Then a few more small groups came in and they asked us to move for a moment, and by moment they meant get up and go back to waiting so they could seat the other groups.  They had plenty of other seating, just too broken up to accommodate our group, but would have been fine for the others had I thought to make an issue of it before we were already up.  

Then we heard the waitress complaining that she wasn't going to waste her time waiting on teenagers.  Admittedly, most of the kids I had with me were teenagers, but I'm in my 50's and was paying (if concern about teenager tipping was an issue).  After 20 minutes I gave up and took my kids somewhere else.  I don't remember the last time I was treated this badly at a restaurant short of when a staff member was melting down, and even then management can say its sorry.  Here management is in on the bad service.  I guess they know they get enough business off the IHOP name to now worry about customers coming back."}

 The place was clean ."}
{"text":"Me and my family have came here about 4 different times since they've been open, there have been some issues here and there but we're very understanding and managers have been attentive to every concern that customers have had (being that there has been very very rude people like the ones that have been leaving these bad reviews) the staff at this location are really trying to make the people happy, Celeste has been our server twice and every time we go we'll make sure to keep asking for her food and service it great and it just keeps getting better every time. Thank god u guys are close by, the ihop on 83rd and bell have been having some huge issues lately"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Sat and waited 10 mins for help then when our food came. We had no syrup and ended up getting syrup from a diff table, after our food got cold. Complained a out hashbrowns being undercooked. Manager said she would get us new food however all they did was heat it up.  Waitress name we had was a heavy set lady name Mary. Manager was a young gray haired lady. Your better off at Waffle House"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. First off there was a hair in my food. A black one and I have red hair so I know it wasn't mine. Then after they took my food to fix my daughter said \"There's cream in my pancake\" NOPE! It wasn't cooked. So they took it back. My food came back and it wasn't fixed correctly so I sent it back again. This time my crepe had half the amount of cream in it. Oh well. After about 10-15 mins they finally brought my daughter her pancake back.  The manager came and said that her meal was on them because it took so long. I said fine but really I wanted to say the whole thing should be on them. After all HAIR in my food. The waitress came over(she's was VERY nice btw) and said that she talked to her manager and they were going to take care of the bill and she kept apologizing. My daughter ate about 1/2 her pancake and said she didn't want anymore. I looked at it and it was still raw. Uncooked pancake mix! This is totally unacceptable. I'm glad they took care of the bill or I would have been even more upset.We will never be back!"}
{"text":"Worse service ever. We waited 40 mins for breakfast. 1 star is generous. You are better off making your own breakfast at home. The hostess was rude."}
{"text":"Whelp I said it once and i'll say it again, literally because I wrote a review about this place on google but it was deleted. I went here to get some take out food (which took about 30 minutes of me waiting there and the food sucked). Before I even entered the place a car was blocking the parking lot in front of the main entrance. It turns out it was some loser employee just sitting in the passenger door waiting for his shift to start. Idk why this place is so popular, probably because of all the gluttonous pigs who eat here. I should have went to Carls Jr. 20 ft away, I would have waited maybe 5 minutes for better food."}
{"text":"This place blows. I went here on my last day of college just to get something to take out, and I ended up sitting there for 20 minutes for some tasteless food. First of all when I arrived there one of the employees was blocking the parking lot because someone was dropping him off and they were just waiting there for his shift to start. He looked like Frodo and I pity his existence. When I came in everyone was friendly and I took an order from the manager actually, but what took so long? There's only 1 or 2 families there waiting and 2-3 of the waitresses were just standing at the patron counter socializing. Btw girls you aren't hot, your skin is white as cake get a tan plz. Also, the families eating there were all fat so i'm not surprised who this place caters to."}
{"text":"The eggs are ALWAYS trash, the bacon is always undercooked, their portions are so small I NEVER have left overs and I always order a lot of food."}
{"text":"WOW, do I ever wish I had checked Yelp before going to this IHOP. Our experience this morning was a mess from start to finish. We got seated easily and our server saw us right away. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there.

1) The server took 10+ minutes to come back with our drinks. While we were still waiting, another server came to our table and started the whole process over. These two servers alternated turns waiting on us the entire time.

2) At the table next to ours, a child knocked over some water. Their parents told the waiter, and instead of cleaning it up, the water sat on the floor for a good 10 MINUTES before they finally cleaned it up after being asked to do so twice more by the parents.

3) The silverware wasn't particularly clean- lots of water spots. Yes, this is Phoenix and yes, the water is hard. I still expect better.

4) Service was incredibly slow. Our two waiters were nice enough when we saw them, but the food took forever to come out. When it did, the toast and the hash browns were burnt.

Ugh. I normally love IHOP, but I am never taking my family back to this one. What a mess!"}
{"text":"Both of my children had food poisoning after eating at this location.

My husband works early so he agreed to have \"breakfast for dinner\" and take me and my two daughters (5 1/2 and 18 months) to Ihop on Mother's Day. Both of my daughters had the 'build your own rooty jr' which came with scrambled eggs. I had crepes and pancakes, hubby had an assortment that also came with eggs but he did not eat. Both of my girls ate their eggs. My five year old complained that night for three hours about her belly hurting and had a very unpleasant bathroom experience. The next day when I woke up and went in to get my 18 month old, I found her covered in vomit (all egg, none of the pancakes or bacon she had eaten). She later had three diarrhea filled diapers that day (all with egg in them), two the following day and one last night. Finally, she seems to be feeling better, but I definitely will NOT be exposing my children to this cesspool again."}
{"text":"We went at 5am after a night on the strip... 
3 stars because the gentlemen working there were so nice and helpful. Great customer service and the food came fast. 

-2 stars because the entire restaurant smelled like urine. Really really bad!"}

{"text":"IHOP was good. I took my guys from work to a early lunch and had a good experience with my server and the manager. I can't rember there name now but The manager was pretty soft spoken very polite had glasses and I was about 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning. Our server I want to say her name is Sandy but I could be completely wrong the joke was we were calling her Tracy or Stacey LOL. She was just being fun very helpful and of course our table was a little louder than most. They gave her a meal up in the kitchen but com she was just being fun very helpful and of course our table was a little louder than most. They Did screw up my meal in the kitchen however she went back and had it done right away I can even hear her I need this re-done right now this is screwed up lol. The manager thought I was upset and came over to apologize. I told him not at all were upset it was great service and we all make mistakes. Keep up the good work off and great management"}

Never did I wait at an I-hop for my food for almost 30 minutes I wanted to walk out I was so frustrated and when we got our food the portions well I don't know what's going on but they were small leaving u hungry after u just ate! I will stick with Waffle House!"}
{"text":"I never do well at chain restaurants, and this one is no exception. First as I walked in a bus person nearly ran me over and thought it was funny. Not a good start.

When our orders came, they got my wife's completely wrong and acted snotty when we told them. When my order came,  I asked if I got toast with the meal and the waiter said \"this is not eat and park\" and then walked away.   One of the plates my order came on was dirty but at this point I gave up, paid for my meal and left. 

Save yourself some trouble and skip this place, there is a Cracker Barrel nearby :)"}

{"text":"After reading some of the recent, or not so recent reviews on here about this place, I decided to write one. Normally I don't write reviews on chain restaurants, but after seeing all the bad reviews on here, I think this place deserved more. We came here on a Saturday afternoon about 1:45ish. Place was pretty dead, not very many people eating here at that time. We were seated right away, attended to right away and served pretty quickly. Was typical food from any IHOP nationwide, nothing special, but definitely no complaints. We were in from out of town for the weekend and this place was close to our hotel. We came back the next morning. Being Sunday morning, the place was packed. There was a wait for a table, but surprisingly, the wait wasn't long. We were seated within 10 minutes, and our server was waiting on us almost immediately. Food was typical of IHOP as usual. Nothing great, but not not bad at all (you're not eating at a 5 star restaurant). I am not writing this review because I feel sorry for these people, I'm writing it to let others know, I was either extremely lucky, or this place has made some phenomenal progress because the service was great and the food was as expected. For a really busy Sunday morning, all the employees were humping their butts waiting on everyone. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"We ate an early dinner here tonight. The place was empty. There were maybe 10 customers in the entire restaurant. Our server was very sweet, the food came out reasonably quickly and tasted fine.  

The reason for the low rating is that the manager berated one of the waiters in the middle of the dining room in front of the customers and another manager.  I don't know if this jerk was showing off for the other manager or what, but it was completely unprofessional. The man clearly has poor management skills, because of course public humiliation is not motivating to anyone!  Then I overheard him telling an elderly customer that he was brought to that location recently to help get the place in order.. Good grief!  This same manager was standing near the door exit when we left and given plenty of time to thank us, he never said a word.  I said Good Night and he did finally acknowledge us. 

I'll choose another IHOP if I'm craving pancakes."}

{"text":"This isn't the first time that I've been here, but service has NEVER been this bad. Unfortunately for the servers it's not their fault that the managers UNDER STAFFED ON A SATURDAY MORNING!! like please tell me which BREAKFAST restaurant only schedules 2 servers in the morning on a Saturday. I'm a server, and this is just sad.. You've got your servers running around like chickens with their heads cut off because there's so many people here and only 2 people on the floor.. One of the servers doesn't seem very well trained or experienced, and the other server has only been on her tables.. #teamwork Please tell me, where is the MANAGER and HOSTESS?! Why are the servers seating themselves? Why is the manager sitting in the office not helping out? Why are customers coming and knocking on the kitchen door because they've been standing up front for so long... Absolutely ridiculous... Again, where is the damn Manager!?!
Y'all need to rethink your scheduling techniques, and be more involved. Never have I worked at a place where a manager is not involved in the operations of the business. It's sad."}
{"text":"Waitress has shitty ass attitude! You can feel her negative vibe when you walk in. I didn't even touch food, that's how much she killed my mood. Should've went to Denny's."}
{"text":"This is the third time we have been here and the third time it's been awful each time. We will not be returning. First, they asked if we wanted a booth or a table. When I said a booth, they said, \"oh well we would have to clean one, a table would be faster\". When I looked around, there were four open booths, all dirty. He kept trying to push a table on us instead of just cleaning a table. The other 3 booths sat dirty for most of our visit. 

The service was also horrible. The waiter asked for our drink orders. I ordered coffee and water, my daughter ordered water, then he walked away without asking my husband what he wanted. He just brought him coffee and a water (my husband doesn't drink coffee). Before we could say anything, he walked away. He came back a few minutes later to get our food order and almost walked away again without getting my husband's order! 

The water cup was also very dirty. You could see chocolate sauce in it and it had clearly been used for chocolate milk, but it didn't look like anyone had even attempted to wash it. 

The waiter, Yousif, was nice, but oblivious. He did apologize for the long wait for our food (it's been almost a half hour already and we have not received our food yet).

We like to give things 3 tries before giving up and each time here it's been worse than the last. We are definitely done with iHop!"}
{"text":"Would give a \"minus star\" if I could!!! Waited 15min to be seated in a half empty restaurant then waited another 10minutes for someone to take our drink order. Then after waiting 35min for our food, we decided we no longer wanted IHOP. So we talked to the mgr who said we didn't have to pay for our drinks and we left. Waste of time. My advice- Go eat somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"What in the heck happened to the portion sizes at IHOP? Back in the day, I used to walk out of this place with a full belly, ready to collapse on the couch. This time, I found myself picking off my son's plate! My husband's omelette was smaller than my son's that we ordered off the kids menu! Weird... just weird. I don't think we'll be coming back. I'll stick with the Good Egg."}
{"text":"Nothing different. Easy. Come here a lot cuz kids eat free."}
{"text":"We came in around 2am feb 12th,2107 the place was less then half full. Grace was our waitress and it took 50 mins for our food to come out which every plate we received was cold. Ridiculous!!! When we spoke to Ashley the \"manager\" we explained we had no explanation, no apology of any sort. She granted us with 20% discount....really? What an insult to the experience we had this early morning. Moses was the only one I notice being apologetic and trying to help those around us who were also not being helped. To top it off Ashley seem to be blaming it on Grace for not giving the proper discount. Which ended up not making up for  the bad service you all have to offer on the over night shift. A table of 6 seated behind us left before their food came out because they were so upset. What a disappointing night for your team."}
{"text":"Ok, so. my friends and i have a bi-monthly or whenever we can pancake thing we do.

we congregate at our local international house of pancakes and get our pancakes on.

so after today's friendly gathering of breakfasty goodness, i thought i'd yelp about the lakewood ihop.

i mean, it's ihop.  *international*, even.
this means you can get swedish crepes AND french crepes.
oooooooooh.

call it what you want, but the ihop is darn good breakfast.  brunch.  it's just yummy.

and with a plate called the root 'n tooty fresh and fruity, can you go wrong???

our server, erin, works her ass off.  and i give her mad props.

thus, i just wanted to give my local ihop a shout out.

OOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUT!!!!


end scene."}
{"text":"No words needed, picture says all...this was my experience in a nutshell.  

Overall it's IHOP, pancakes were decent but everything else was not cooked or over cooked!!  

Burnt toast...all servers just avoided asking why I paid for toast but didn't eat it.  It's a hockey puck!!!  Never once offered to remake.  Eggs were grossly under cook.  Bacon was half raw.  Pancakes were decent but we were done eating before we even got them!  Overall unimpressed and prob won't come back...."}
{"text":"Great customer service, very attentive, and staff is super friendly!! Foods amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Holy bad service! Ran out silverware. Forgot order like 3 times. Food cold. Go elsewhere on a sunday morning."}
{"text":"Since this location just opened, we are going to wait a while and give them time to adjust before trying again. My significant other and I visited last weekend and were seated right away. Unfortunately, we got a table for two in the middle row and were constantly having either our table or ourselves bumped as people walked past. It was very distracting as this was an isle with heavy traffic. We would have shifted our table more towards the center but there was another table with 4 people right next to us, so we were stuck. Suggestion: please consider either leaving the tables together to seat 6 across or 4 across. The center isle really is too small to separate out a 4 top and a 2 top and meals would be a lot more enjoyable without butts hitting your table as people walk by!

Staffing doesn't seem to be an issue, there were quite a few employees floating around (around 25). There was clearly a lot of confusion who was covering what tables though. We had a handful of different servers ask if we'd been helped yet (including towards the end of our lunch which was a bit odd). Again, this restaurant is new so I'm sure they'll get things figured out as far as communication between servers. Despite how busy it was and the confusion, it's worth mentioning each server was friendly. 

The food was pretty good once it arrived. It took around 25-30 minutes but looking around that seemed to be the length it took for others to receive their food as well.

Again, I'm hopeful they'll have everything worked out in a few months. We will give them another try then."}
{"text":"Ive been here a handful of times and they are usually pretty good at getting the food out fast and i haven't really had any issues with customer service .."}
{"text":"Food was decent and no different than any other ihop location,  the service on the other hand was absolutely horrible! Our waiter barely ever spoke, he mostly just awkwardly stood there and stared at us, and the rare occasions when he did speak it was extremely robotic and scripted. We waited forever to receive refills on our drinks. When our food came out he dropped the bill with it and NEVER stopped back by our table. When we stopped by the counter to pay we waited for a good 5 minutes before our server came over to check us out and he again didn't say a word. Just stood there and stared at us. It was a very uncomfortable and terrible visit and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Honestly, worst IHOP experience I've had. I called and made an order to go, while I was making my order, they said they'd have it done. And got the whole order messed up. We got the wrong sandwich, no ranch, no extra seasoning. I understand it is Sunday morning, but they didn't seem to be properly staffed for this morning."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience at this location. We were seated right away, however, we had to ask to be waited on. We ordered the fish fry - it was over cooked and way too greasy. It is a fish fry but the grease was puddling on the fish. The coleslaw was warm. No refills on drinks. There were only 2 waitresses waiting on customers with 4-5 total waitresses on shift? Where's the team work? The heater was on..... it was sooo hot. 

During my visit - I approached a waitress to take our drink order, instead she told our assigned waitress to take our order. I guess what she was doing was more important. Where's the team work? I approached the same person again with our glasses in hand for refills on our drinks. She had our waitress bring us refills. WHERES THE TEAM WORK? The 2 waitresses preparing silverware were not team players or concerned about customer service at all. I don't care if you don't like or want to help your co-worker, you still need to be concerned about the customer first. 

The staff do not work as a team. There were 2 young ladies that were only concerned about wrapping silverware in napkins. Neither one of them bothered to assist the 2 waitresses waiting on customers.  When I asked for a refill she should have refilled my drink no questions asked. Instead it was refilled by my very busy waitress when she got a moment.

The manager did not check on staff or customers, she only came out at the request of an employee. Team work needs to emphasized and practiced by management. Management needs to lead by example....simple not complicated! 

HORRIBLE PLACE I WILL NOT RETURN TO THIS LOCATION!!!"}
{"text":"I always go to this IHOP and order the strawberry cheesecake pancake meal the staff is always friendly. Never have a problem the iced coffee isn't great ): but the flavored hot coffee is delicious and free refills! I recommend this IHOP."}
{"text":"Place is almost empty. Came with 9 other people. Slow service,  still waiting for food. We won't be coming back here.  Extra waiters must be hiding.  Food came lukewarm. One of the group asked for the manager but they never came over. Waitress was nice and tried hard. Too bad she has to put up with poor kitchen and management.  

UPDATE:  Manager came over and listened to our problems. She was very humble and apologized in a sincere way. She adjusted the 3 bills that we generated.  We left waitress nice tip for trying. 

IN SUMMARY:  After receiving the sincere apology from the manager we would try them again on a Sunday after church.   If you have a problem anywhere, take it to the manager.  Don't always blame the server."}
{"text":"I'm not coming back to this place. First standing there like a dump for 5 min with no one seated us. Then waiting for about 30 minutes for a damn burger. Woohoo!"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast today! Great service! Delicious food! Janelle is a wonderful waitress as well! Great day!"}
{"text":"Went around 10 PM one night, and wanted to order one of the specialty pancakes but they were out of peaches. We were seated and had our orders taken in a timely manner as it was not busy maybe two other tables at the time, They were out of peaches for the pancakes I wanted so the waiter suggested the New York cheesecake pancake which was actually really good. The service however was horrible and you could hear the workers in the kitchen talking about something being \"DISGUSTING\". Not something you want to hear from the people making/bringing your food. Our waiter checked on us once and I had to slurp on my straw to get any attention for refills on my beverage. We waited a while for our check as well."}
{"text":"I have breakfast here every other weekend or so. Its  been pretty consistent when it comes to the omlettes, but when i tried the chicken fried steak it was really dry and basically unedible. Waiters and wait staff have always been very cool, but the manager (a youger guy) was a total moron to my breakfast party when we asked him to return the fried steak. He made excuses, then proceeded to only take the fried steak off our bill. We will be back, but I wasnt too happy with that level of service to repeat customers. I wont comment on lunch items because I've never ate here for lunch, or dinner. Prices are also a bit high for what you get, imho."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE EVER!!! I ordered scrambled egg whites. I received regular scrambled eggs. When I mentioned it to the server, she gasped, but did exchange them for the correct order, however the bacon she brought back on the same plate was very under-cooked. My wife also had bacon, so a comparison was available. The bacon on my plate was so raw, that it was inedible. I let the server know and she angrily stormed off to get some bacon that was actually cooked. My wife ordered hash browns that were never served. Part of my wife's meal included hash browns, but the server did not serve them. My wife mentioned it to her and she then brought them out, however when the server billed us, she billed each component of my wife's meal separately instead of in total as the meal she ordered. When the bill was delivered, I let the server know that she improperly billed us but she refused to make the adjustment to reflect a meal price instead of the individual pricing. I ended up paying much more for our meal than I should have. The waitress (Marisela) was very rude, but so were the servers who delivered our food and her other co-workers. Upon checking out I mentioned the bad service to the person at the register and she laughed about it. She also tried to take my receipt which provided an opportunity for feedback. I had to ask her to give it back to me after she set it aside in a box next to the register. INCREDIBLE!!! TERRIBLE!!! WORST SERVICE EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Beware of this location!'s food! 
I just got food poisoning from here last night. Ate one of their new burgers & friend ordered cheese dessert crepe. Something between the two was bad cause we were violently ill within half hour. 

Furthermore, I called them to inform of bad food & they blew me off. Didn't get my ph# or anything! Mgr was cooking. Terrible customer service regarding something so serious. I'm still sick today!

In all fairness, I've been there b4 & never gotten sick so hopefully this is isolated incident but just beware eating burgers here."}
{"text":"Horrible food and service. Come here if you want to starve, vomit and be treated like dirt."}
{"text":"We went here on 10/9/2012 and let me say please go to a different location. I had to send back two, yes two breakfast plates. The first breakfast meal was cold and loaded with grated cheese. I asked for extra chives and bacon but when I asked what happened, I was told that the restaurant was out of chives. I couldn't locate the extra bacon to save my life and never requested for extra cheese. The second breakfast requested was for the sirloin tips and eggs. We received a burnt up mess but at least the manager on duty was able to identify what is was on the plate. Now, lets get to the Spanish speaking in the back involving two employees complaining about another table bitching about their breakfast too. News flash...I speak,read and write in Spanish. Thank you very much. You never know who can and its just very unprofessional! So, I say that the cook(s) and servers should take a look at the pictures of how meals should look before sending it out. If it looks like crap...your customers will assume it taste like crap too! I'm so glad I took pictures of the meals and sent them along w my experience to the IHOP manager. Some additional training is needed."}
{"text":"It has been quite awhile since I've eaten here but recently I came here w/ my youngest daughter & my hubby for breakfast.  We never had any problems with this particular location.  Nice staff.  Orders are always correct.  Extremely close to my home.  Always clean.  I ordered the big steak omelette.  Something new I guess.  It's really good.  Huge.. but soooo yummmy.  My youngest daughter got the create-a-face pancake which she loved! =) She's 2 yrs old so she was pretty excited to see a face on her plate made out of fruits. haha!  The pancake was as big as the plate so she barely even put a dent in it.  LOL! I think it's good enough for TWO toddlers to share if anything.  Our waiter this time was super nice.  He made sure we were taken care of especially since on this day we went was a little busy.  I used a coupon for a BOGO free entree which wasn't put on our bill but being that I ALWAYS double check everything,  I brought it up to the cashier when it was time to pay.  No problems... he discounted the right amount that was suppose to be removed from our bill to get that free entree.  He was nice about it.  Definitely would go back again. =)"}
{"text":"Place was pretty empty for 4pm on a Sunday so we got a seat right away and got our order in. Both my kids got their food within the first 5 minutes of the order, but my boyfriend and I sat there for another 25 minutes while the kids ate (they finished by the time we got our food.) When they finally brought our food, they gave me the wrong order and shorted my boyfriend some of his eggs. The food was okay, but 25 mins for French toast? Very disappointed, don't plan on coming back here. The waiter was nice but not efficient."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of IHOP in the first place because I don't like pancakes but if there's any reason to avoid this particular one, it's the service. We walked in and were under the impression that they were busy and patiently waited only to see that the hostess was talking to her co workers and didn't realize we were there. After 15 minutes, we decided to go up to the hostess stand and were seated immediately. When we actually got to the table, we were only given two menus for five people. After 30 min of being seated, we finally had our orders taken. 

The only thing saving this review was the fact that our food was decent and it was delivered quickly. Avoid this place if you can. It's not worth it for pancakes."}
{"text":"They seated me and then forgot about me. The waitress was inexperienced and ran around like a deer n a headlight. When she notice she had forgot about my table she asked the manager to serve us. Cause she saw the mean looks on our faces. PS, their glasses are soooooo dirty"}
{"text":"We go IHOP florida and we were expecting the same at one of Las Vegas location decided to come here. Very regular service, not attention to details at all we have to reorder one of the guests dishes due to egg allergies,  fix errors in the bill and clean the silverware provided by our own."}
{"text":"Terrible service, today we waited for almost one and half hour after order a breakfast to can enjoy it !!! We understand that is vacation, but the wait time was exaggerated ... Only people that speak with the manager obtained their attention..."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this IHOP since it opened and have always liked the food.  My father was a prior franchise owner so I know what I should expect and we get that from this store.  Great food , great service from Corrine."}
{"text":"I know, it's hard to believe...this was my first time EVER eating at a IHOP. And it was okay. 

The Good: 
I thought the decor was really cute, they have these walls with windows that kind of give it a cottage feel (i feel weird saying that for an IHOP...But its true) 
I waiter JESUS was super nice, and thanked us for our order and coming in. I thought that was special because most restaurants don't thank you for your $$.
the french toast was SIGNIFICANTLY better than the blueberry pancakes. the syrup was overpowering on the pancakes

The bad: 
the meal is 9.99 compared to the exact same meal at dennys costing 3.99
the hashbrowns were cold and hard. 

Next time Ill go to denny's since neither place is fancy, might as well pay less."}
{"text":"Service was excellent once I got their attention!  Approximately 1:30 pm, but not busy at all. It took a bit of time for them to recognize that I was seated by the greeter, and that no one had waited on me. The food was served hot, I ordered breakfast menu items. The waitstaff was friendly and courteous and my waitress acknowledged that I did not have a lot of time to eat."}
{"text":"Rating is based on an IHOP standard, let's be clear. I did not weigh this on the same scale as I do some other restaurants. But, for what it was for, they did the job. It was about 4am and we needed a quick spot to eat and this ihop is 24 hours. It is in a sketchy area and there is a random person or two standing outside the restaurant. I would suggest you do not come here alone. I didn't have high expectations, because, I mean come on, it's IHOP and it's 4 in the morning AND, it's ihop -__- It wasn't super packed, but it took the waiter a while to come by, but once our order was taken, our food came out exceptionally fast. Almost questionably fast, or maybe it was because we had been drinking. I don't know. But, I ordered chicken tenders and they were some of the best, late night chicken tenders I had in a while. Or, maybe, again, it was because I had been drinking and I was sleepy. I don't know, but everything was hot and tasted good. So, good late night spot if you are on this side of the blvd."}
{"text":"Great food wonderful customer service. But a few employees decided to have McDonald's for lunch while working and ate on the floor also while playing grab Ass and making inappropriate jesters. Our server Laura was excellent tho she was very efficient and seemed to keep busy. If we go again we hope to have her again."}
{"text":"I reduced  a star, because it took 20min just to order my drink and another 10min to get it. Good thing I had put in my food order at the same time. After that the customer service improved. And the food is always good no complaints. Will be returning."}
{"text":"This was honestly the worst service I have ever received.

I was in a large group of about 25 people. And I get it, it takes a while to serve that many people. But despite being the only group in the restaurant, it took about 20 minutes for anyone to even ask what we wanted to drink. And to actually get the drinks took even longer, and I had to get up and ask the waitress for my water. After another 20 minutes they came to take our food order. My friend ordered a half stack of chocolate chip pancakes and the waiter said he couldn't order those, giving no explanation what so ever. According to some friends at another table, she asked \"really?\" In a disbelieving voice when she ordered a burger. As she went around our table of about 7 people, she completely skipped over my sister. She never ordered food because she was too shy to call attention to it. At the table next to ours, they had to wait for their food for so long that they went up to the kitchen to see what was going on, and they found that there food had been sitting on the counter and was now cold. Not a single table ever had their checks given to them, we all had to, again, walk to the main area to get it, despite requesting the waiter bring it to us and being told she would. 

The food was fine, but the service came no where near being worth the 18% large group gratuity that was put on the bill. It was one of those situations that I'd rate the place 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars I would it took over 20 min just to get water and coffee. Trust me I am a patient person when it comes to dining but the server did not even stop by to explain herself. She did not show up until we were leaving. Will never go again!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fathers day brunch at IHOP was great. The restaurant was extremely busy, but the waiter still managed to service our table of 13 people. Yes, orders came out messed up, but it was easily forgiven considering how busy he was. He was able to fix everything up and the food was great. My daughters enjoyed the Nutella pancakes. Plenty of food for the price."}
{"text":"Am I really the first to review the Steelyard Commons IHOP?  Woo hoo!

I used to LOVE going to IHOP when I was younger.  Then I sort of decided to take a break, grow up, and go out to \"brunch.\"  Well, today was an IHOP kinda day.  So we went there.

It was PACKED! Well, what did I expect on a Sunday morning?  However, the hostess was sincere and friendly, and I was able to sit while waiting.  We were taken to our table within 10 minutes, just as she'd guessed.

We got coffee and water right away, and then our waitress showed up, who was a little too intense/perky, but still got the job done well.  We had to try the \"all you can eat pancakes\"--I mean, it just made sense money-wise.  For $4.99, I got two eggs, hash browns, and two pancakes--and then, they promised, they'll replace those pancakes with a stack of three AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT.  

My husband and I were sorta strategic about how we ordered for this reason, but we didn't want to \"cheat\" IHOP.  We both ended up ordering our first replacement stack, although I totally didn't need it.  After eating one of the three and putting the other two to the side, our waitress said those loving words: \"Would ya like a box for those cakes?\" and sure enough, we got to put those pancakes in a little styrofoam case and save them for later.  Genius. Most places with an \"all you can eat\" feature don't allow carry-outs.

I should also mention that they have added an \"IHOP For Me\" section to both the regular AND kids' menu, featuring dishes on the \"lighter side\" with nutritional info.  (Good thing they don't include the nutritional info for the country-fried steak with biscuits & gravy and corned beef hash.)

This is not an every-weekend type thing.  But if you want moderately greasy food served with a smile, this is the place.  Also, I love their different flavored syrups (but Old Fashioned is still my favorite). One last thing to mention: to this day, IHOP is the only place I'll ever order pancakes. Sad, but true."}
{"text":"It took us over 40 minutes to receive our food and it was not edible. Received a email from the manager but did not get a follow up correspondence from him."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Las Vegas last weekend and we were trying to look for an Ihop off the strip since it can get crazy busy and the service isn't the same. So we looked up this place but were kind of hesitant at first because of the bad review it has but we were overall happy with the service and how quick we got our food. I don't remember the serviers name but he was very attentive and a really nice guy. It's your typical Ihop but we were just craving pancakes and they get 5 stars because back in Cali they no longer have the Strawberry Cheesecake Pancakes so my boyfriend and I were very happy that they still had them here. We will definitely come back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Came here at 1:30 A.M. With a group of friends absolutely horrible service and the food was cooked very poorly. The place was surprisingly busy at this time and they only had two hostesses working. The bacon was burnt, the hashbrowns were burnt on the outside and cold on the inside. We received our original drink order and were just about done with our meal before our empty glasses were filled approximately 20 minutes later. I don't think I will ever come this place again at this time."}
{"text":"Poor service. Uncooked bacon when I asked to get some crispy it never came. Waitress never stopped by table again except to give me check."}
{"text":"I give it one star because they told us our food was about done and then 20 minutes later we still didn't have our food. When we got our food it was cold and hard. We asked for a re feal and 15 minutes later we didn't have it."}
{"text":"I loooove IHOP...BUT the manager at this place is a grey haired nasty old rude dude! We came in on a busy day and had an infant asleep in an infant car seat (that I removed from stroller). The manager raised his voice and rolled his eyes appearing very annoyed trying to give me advice on how to place my child in the booth. He insisted he had done this a million times...SO HAVE I. Food is good, as usual. Go to the IHOP at south premium outlets, manager is a doll!!!"}
{"text":"Good service, great manager, good food, ready to go shopping!!! Loved the iced coffee and the smoked sausage with my scrambled eggs and hash browns. Yum"}
{"text":"When you've had a long night and the only thing that helps a bounceback is greasy hashbrowns and eggs.. you turn to IHOP.  But when you wait for 40 min to get a table and once you get a table it's another 20 min to be greeted and another 40 min before you get your cold food, it's not worth it. Especially when you hear the tables around you also complaining. When we told the manager that we were leaving she asked us Tuesday So they can fix it.. whilst I appreciate the gesture, I won't wait around for another 20 min for what i assume will be either another cold plate or spit-filled.  Thanks for... the water."}
{"text":"We've stopped in a few times to this location late at night and the staff is always super friendly and there's always an available table. 

The food is good and it's a nice place to sit and talk and not be rushed out! 10/10 would visit this location again."}
{"text":"When I got to Ihop, I was waiting to be seated then I went to the bathroom. It was FILTHY!! There was toilet paper everywhere!! Then, I got a cup of water and when I looked in it I saw stuff swimming in it. It was black stuff. Then, I ordered my red velvet pancakes. They looked good but as I ate them, I realized they were BURNT but the burntness was disguised by the cream cheese drizzle on the pancakes!! These teen girls were loud as hell cursing too and there was a baby screaming like there's no tomorrow. I gave this place a second star to be nice."}
{"text":"Took over 8 mins for server to come greet us. Not even 75% of tables full. My fiancé ordered the pancake platter, and I ordered bacon wrapped sirloin ($7 special) and some crepes. After a modest wait, the crepes came to the table, and the lady that delivered them (different from server) asked if we wanted another plate, or if my fiancé was going to have anything. I felt so embarrassed by that. I'm a pretty big guy, and when she looked at me when she said that, she looked disgusted. Apparently this happened because our server put this on a separate ticket, and not with our meals.

So, when our meals came out soon after, we breathed a sigh of relief because I was worried that my fiancé's brunch was not coming. So, we dug in, and started eating. The eggs were not over medium... they were over easy... My sirloin steaks were ordered to be medium rare, and came well done. One was actually cooked so long it was dry. I told our server, and she replied \"ok, I'll let them know\" and walked away to another table. I then stopped a manager, told him about it, and he said they could take them back and cook new ones. I said \"great! and please bring my fiancé some butter for her pancakes\".

Well, second try on the medium rare steaks came... one was well done, and the other was just over medium well. Also, the butter I had asked for was no where to be seen. So I just decided to choke them down. Not to mention, while my drink glass was empty, several people came by our table to deliver food, or to check on us, and not one asked if I'd like a refill.

Yeah, this place is an IHOP. You're not going there to expect fine dining... but if you want Sunday Brunch, they better be able to deliver it! The IHOP in Wausau, WI would run circles around these people. We went to the location in Wausau many times with not one mistake, nor any type of bad service.

There is only one good thing I can say about this dining experience -- Thank you for the excellently buttered toast!"}
{"text":"I don't know how the service was but judging from the interaction atv the door it was probably worse. There was no one at the front when we walked in. We noticed the girl to the side chatting with another server. She just looked at us but didn't even acknowledge us. After about 40 seconds she came over and got our name. While waiting 2 different parties of 3 came in, the girls didn't even look at who was next or who came in first she just looked to the ones closer to her and sat them.  After those 2 parties were taken back we asked why they were seated before us, we were 3 also. She didn't even apologize or try to make it right, she just stood there with a blank stare.  We just walked out. Never again though.  I'd rather make the far drive to a smaller place where I know we'll get great customer service and even better food."}
{"text":"This ihop has been open for about 2 months and it is the worse!!  Do not go on a weekend morning you will be waiting for a seat forever. Also the setup is unorganized. There is one place to order, to pay, request seating and food pick up for phone orders.  It is complete chaos.  Today i ordered carry out waited on hold for over 5 minutes today on a previous occasion i couldnt even get through I ordered a Burrito todsy had no taste although the pancakes were ok. Although this ihop is literally in walking distance i will be not visiting again. Do not recommend at all"}
{"text":"We went here for a late dinner on a Saturday. It was around 8 o'clock. There were other parties already eating in the restaurant.other than ourselves in the restaurant at the time as we walked in there was a strong odor of urine"}
{"text":"Race issues

I was in your restaurant New Year's Eve for breakfast with a goof friend visiting from out of town. I was looking forward to a great breakfast like always since I started going since moving to surprise a year ago every Sunday after church. I was very disappointed to find everyone around us received service including refills,straws, food and check. While we sat there for over hour no straws empty drinks no food never see our waiter again until we said something. Then we received our food cold and incorrect. I did think to much except there was a mistake never happened before ..... looking back my good friend is a black female and I'm a mix Hawaiian and white race. In this day and age I really did not think happened much coming from Maui myself. I would like to say shame on you we will never be back in your restaurant and be sure I will let everybody know how you treat people of a race you don't agree with."}
{"text":"Very good. New clean menus clean restaurant. Staff is polite and very effective. I had blueberry pancakes. They were excellent."}
{"text":"The pancakes were good as one would expect.  Eggs were icky and the hashbrowns were cold and chewy. Service was quick and polite. Restrooms were kind of bad though."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever, they attended others that came in after us! And the host didn't acknowledge us until we asked her."}
{"text":"Very good meal. Only complaint was the bacon. Thin enough to read the menu through. And they're advertising new bacon! Lol... Coffee ALWAYS good, but overpriced!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location about 30 or more times now. Theres only about 5 good servers and the 24/7 service is the plus side of this ihop location. I've had an equal amount of good and bad visits here. Ask for Kim as your server if she's free to do so, she deserves your tip over some of the other servers."}
{"text":"So.. we've had \"challenges\" the last couple times we ate here. The food is good so my husband insists we go once a month or so. Today there was one waiter for the entire restaurant and she wasn't even that friendly. The greeter was very nice, but he asked how many in my party, walked away to \"find\" a table for us. (There were at least five empty ones) He didn't return for over ten minutes and was helping fill drinks and carry food to tables etc. Overall, the bright spot is the food. Don't go here if pressed for time, although some times are better than others. I would be surprised if this place lasts much longer. Next time, I'll opt for take out."}
{"text":"My family and I went to this IHOP for dinner after moving into town.  The restaurant was clean and staff was beyond welcoming and helpful.  Food was better than other IHOPs I have been to and for $7, their burgers are a pretty good bargain."}
{"text":"Party of 9 that included two kids. Breakfast items were really good. The lunch items, a burger and melt had issues. The fries that came out were cooked in old oil, so were the onion rings on the burger, which ruined the taste. Ordered chocolate milk for the kids, which came out not stirred. One of our items came out 15 minutes after everyione else's. It was taken off the bill. Took too long to clear dishes. Really nice server and staff."}

When I questioned them about it they has 2 managers come tell me that the steak is all pre-weighed and that is what it comes with. I pointed out my finances plate vs mine and stated that if I'm paying the price for the steak then I want steak! They ended up bringing me a side of stake bits after about 20 min and were very rude. I will not go back there!"}

The service sucks I will never come again. my son was so upset and so was I I called and spoke with the manager. The manager was very nice and helpful over the phone as I told him how upset I was with the service. He told me that if I'd like to come back he would take care of our meal. I told him I wouldn't want to come back and I'm sorry that he's lost my business. when you live off tips, maybe you should take care of your customers instead of ignoring them"}

{"text":"Went for breakfast this morning.  It was somewhat crowded with tables filled with students back from winter break.  Seems that they only have one volume: loud.  Which reminds me of the music piped in.  Now, I like Oldies rock and roll.  Grew up on it.  Have a vast collection of it.  That being said, I don't care for it blaring while I'm eating breakfast.  Ordered the Bacon Temptation omelet.  Bacon is, after all, a major food group.  Opted to substitute on the pancakes, getting the strawberry banana instead of the buttermilk.  The omelet was a decent size and the bacon done nicely, but it the flavor of the whole thing was bland, other than the bites with bacon.  There were some pale pink bits on top that were supposed to be chopped tomatoes that I scraped off, preferring my tomatoes red and ripe.  Moving on to the pancakes, I had hopes they would redeem this meal.  They did not.  They weren't awful but if you choose to call yourself a house of PANCAKES, your pancakes had better be worthy of top billing.  These weren't anything special.  The coffee came in a thermos on the table, a feature I always prefer so as not to depend on a waitress refilling my cup but, as in Perkins, the coffee tasted burnt.  They must both use the same coffee and brewing method.  The service was good.  I was wearing my New York Giants sweatshirt, still basking in their victory over the top-seeded Packers last night.  Turns out the waitress was a Packers fan.  She said she was bummed by the loss but she was still pleasant, so I did not feel it necessary for her to sample my food before I ate it.  Cheeseheads are not sore losers like Eagles fans.  My visit ended with having to wait on line for quite some time to pay my bill.  Seems like they were training someone or something like that but the hostess was working with the cashier and the two of them together didn't seem able to figure out whatever was going wrong.  Not a good last impression."}
{"text":"Love this place! You can't go wrong with breakfast. They keep my coffee filed and the foods always hot. Friendly service what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch here yesterday. We came here as I had a coupon and it is close to where I work. 
We were seated right away. It did a while for the server to come over, but once he did it was rather quick service. 
I ordered the fried chicken. And to my surprise it was pretty good. The chicken was moist, the skin crispy and crunchy, good flavor. it was way too much food for one person. Took half back to work. 
My friend had the German crepes and loved them. 
All in all a good enjoyable lunch. 
I would go back."}
{"text":"Took AN HOUR to get in and get our food. Food was awful and undercooked. Waitress was even worse and pulled out one of the seats at our table and tried to sit to take our order!!"}
{"text":"Their pancakes usually taste like and have the texture of microwaved plastic. Never again. French toast and eggs are usually a safe option. Their lunch menu is pretty gross- especially the side of veggies. Clearly, it's frozen veggies that are thawed out for a few minutes and are not given any seasoning whatsoever. I only go here because my parents are old and think this is a decent place."}
{"text":"So we found ourselves on this part of town when running errands & I really felt like some Garden Stuffed Crepes so decided on a whim 2 visit my fave IHOP loc8ion. I've never gotten bad or even just decent service here & I always get a warm inviting vibe from the interior lighting & decor in warmer pastel hues. 
  
   Ok, so part of it may b a li'l nostalgia being I used 2 work in this shopping plaza & across the street back in my GCC days when I lived over here but I find it impressive that they're the ONLY place in this vicinity that's STILL here from even b4 back then when everything else has changed businesses several Xs or been LONG GONE. It was also unusual not 2 have 2 w8/b put on the list as whenever we've been here on wk~ends it's always pretty slammin' but I never mind the w8 as it's worth it.

   Have mostly eaten inside w/ the cushy booths but have also ventured out 2 the patio area a few Xs under the misters when it's been nicer weather outside. 2day we were served by w8ress Lindsay who had just come on 4 her shift but didn't know that till she told us l8er as she was the usual on~the~ball type service we've always experienced here.
 
   I was disappointed 2 discover they had removed the Garden Stuffed Crepes from their new menu as it was my favor8 (& a gr8 price) but I guess it did have a good run as I'd been surprised many Xs 2 c it still offered all those previous occasions. So instead I ordered the Spinach Red pepper sandwich on sourdough which came w/ seasoned fries & my companion had the Strawberry Crepes w/ a side of wheat Banana Pancakes (Gr8 w/ their Butter Pecan flavored syrup ~ just another trademark of theirs 2 luv w/ several selections 2 choose in addition 2 Strawberry, Boysenberry & their Original). 

   All was Delicious as we've come 2 expect from all our previous visits here, but we were both blown away by the PERFECTION of the sandwich!! We ordered this same item @ 19th/Northern & tho it was really good & nice size portion there, this loc8ion just has it down as far as the complimentary blend of quality ingredients surrounded by a perfectly seasoned Toasted Crispy Sourdough on the outside & savory softness w/o being soggy or  greasy on the inside & fries were SUPERb 2 ~ Major props 2 the cook/preparer!! So thx Lindsay 4 ur #1derful,  friendly, attentively accomod8ing & professional service 2day + all the other patrons we saw u taking such good care of! Awesome food, Amazing & quick service @ a Gr8 Price, it's no 1der this will remain our FAVE, the other loc8ions can't hope 2 compete w/ what we experience here! Just really wish they would BRING BACK the GARDEN STUFFED CREPES 4 us Veg~heads ~ that's the ONLY thing I can say that would make it even more PHENOMENAL!!..."}
{"text":"Went here w/ an open mind, it is IHOP after all but we decided 2 give this newer loc8ion a try. This locale is defin8ly bigger w/ more tables + seating areas than the 1 that closed off 19th ave/Glendale, but still a bit of a w8 (which we kinda expected esp bein' it was the wk~end). There were people w8ing everywhere: inside, outside & in between the double layered doors so we sat in some random chairs just inside, lining the wall while attempting 2 face each other in convers8ion so it didn't feel so awkward 2 us & those eating right across the way. 

  A little after 20 min our name was called & the hostess showed us 2 our booth w/o uttering so much as a word 2 us. Maybe she knew our server wouldn't b right w/ us but it felt uncomfortable not having any exchange @ all. We had awhile 2 go over the menu as we weren't acknowledged, nor offered drinks 4 another 10+ min.  No biggie, we started playing guess who our servers gonna b when a rude gal rather aggressively said 'excuse me' rather loudly, proceeding 2 shove her sweeper under our booth while we tried raising our feet fast enough, only 2 hit our shins on the table leg. Really?? Had 2 go about it like THAT & it couldn't that have been done B4 we were seated?? Uhm, ok..... 

   Finally our server Celsa S came 2 let us know we were her table & get our drinks, she was actually a Pretty Good Server (once she got 2 us) & we already felt 2 invested in our time already spent 2 consider leaving. There Rn't as many options 4 Veg~heads on the menu here but finally went w/ a Spinach Red Pepper Melt on sourdough which was TWICE the sz than when we've gotten it other loc8ions & DELICIOUSLY PERFECT!! They went w/ the Veg (egg substitute) Omelette since they didn't have the Garden Stuffed Crepes on their menu. The Mango Mosa drink was also better here as it had Fresh squeezed orange juice instead of the concentr8 when prepared elsewhere. 

   The FOOD was Exceptionally better than service this go round & hopefully they can train certain staff such as the hostess & 1 of the sweeper gals 2 lighten up a bit as people r paying not just 4 the food but the experience as well. It doesn't require much 2 b pleasant ~ if it's 2 much of a strain 2 b nice. So even though we like the atmosphere & better service @ 67th/Peoria in Glendale, we may give this another try from time 2 time (just may have 2 bring some shin~guards next time)!"}
{"text":"Great customer service!  shout out to claudia she was amazing but Horrible food I asked for a medium steak came back well done. I asked for scrambled soft eggs it came hard. Dennys is wayyyy better and there low on my ratings"}
{"text":"This IHOP is where pancakes go to die (instead of bask in buttery, syrupy, delicious glory). 

Everyone who works here seems disgruntled--that could be just their natural demeanors or it could be the fact that they got stuck working at the International House of Poop (instead of \"Pancakes\", of course).  The food is always mediocre at IHOP, but it's never really a bad thing. Sometimes you just need a sloppy pile of breakfast mush, but when it comes with bad service, things that aren't food in your food, and mixed up orders, it's completely not worth it. 

In short, I agree with everyone's previous complaints, but I'll probably be back if a strong urge brings me here. The problem with that, though, is that I'm way closer to the Inn on Coventry and know I'll get great food and service there. So, really, I'll probably not be back due to any urge..."}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes for a table for two just to find out that they skipped us, took another 10 minutes for the server to take our order and 25 more minutes for her to bring us our two orders of pancakes. Definitely not worth waiting 1 hour for some pancakes. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a pretty sad dining experience. As you enter, you notice the front door is filthy with dirty glass and grime on the frame. Makes one want to see a hand sanitizer station at the entrance. The coffee was barely warm, but the staff seems to be trying to make the most of a hopeless situation. It just comes off as a tired and worn establishment that has lost its spark and any sense of caring. Maybe the owners are satisfied to be on the D list of dining choices in Surprise? It needs a remodel and a thorough scrubbing. Yes, the prices are good, but I'll pay more elsewhere.  Oh, and the chef needs to check the pancakes closer as ours were uncooked in the middle. Should be a better place."}
{"text":"Let's be honest.  If you have half a brain you know what you are getting when you step into this place...solid if unspectacular food.  I will only go here because my girls like it.  Hey when you are a parent it pays to make the kids happy every once in awhile.  IHOP is your typical chain restaurant that are everywhere, but hey they serve a purpose.  The servers at this location are always very nice and the kids love the different flavored syrups."}
{"text":"I've come to realize that for the price and what you get doesn't have it so the only reason why ended up here is because only my daughter loves this place for breakfast. In which I mention other places and I explained to her you have to think about the value of a dollar and what you get for that dollar. Especially when you start paying for your own meal. So proud to be from now on will go to other places other than IHOP.even though I do use a coupon buy one get one free but you have to order two soft drinks so in reality the mill cost $28 without the coupon but with the coupon in the mail was $18 and change. But I still see no value in what they had to offer."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying i am a local and brought some friends from out of town here.
This is by far not only the worst IHOP I have ever been to but the absolute worst  restaurant. We asked for one extra mozz stick so we could all have an even amount. The waitress didn't say it would be extra just said she would see If she could get us an extra one. When our meals came they were cold. My hashbrowns tasted like they just chopped up a raw potato and put it on a plate. Our waitress never came back to see how the food was and just brought the check
 When we went to the cashier she was too busy talking it up with a coworker to help us. Her coworker said \"you have a customer\" and she said \"oh do I?\" And continued her conversation. When I asked her about the extra food charge she was complete bitch. Needless to say I will not be going back. 
I wouls give zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"I generally like IHop.  Really, what can be bad about eggs and pancakes?!  Well -- I'll tell you:

I ordered a ham and cheese omelette.  My eggs were over-cooked, with just a smattering of diced ham, and a slice of provolone plopped on top.  \"Shouldn't the cheese be melted inside?\"  I asked my server.  I thought she would replace my eggs, but no.  They stuck the omelette in the microwave -- cheese still on top -- and brought back the eggs now overcooked AND spongy, with a melted glop of cheese.

The pancakes tasted like they sat for awhile, and the syrup spouts were so clogged,  and sticky that nothing came out of the strawberry and blueberry decanters.  The sugar packets were crackly; obviously, something long ago spilled on them, and they were never replaced.

It's a treat to eat breakfast out, but I walked away unsatisfied.  I'm sorry I didn't spot the Marie Callendars a few blocks away.  I'm sure it's better than this place."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was correct. The air conditioning was way too strong. When our Server presented herself I asked if she could regulate the ac, she said that she would ask. She came back to find out if things were better, they were momentarily. The ac came back as strong as ever, to a point that our newly served food was going cold on top and my goose bumps were out. I boxed my food and hurried out into the lobby where it was much warmer"}
{"text":"Usually I give it higher stars. I am a frequent visitor late night. Usually the waiters and waitresses are amazing. Never had a complaint. Well I come tonight (Tuesday) there are a few people in the place but I wouldn't consider busy. It takes 20 minutes to get our drinks and an hour to get our food. My entire meal comes out stone cold. I don't like to complain and will eat it lukewarm but not stone cold. I ask him to throw it In the microwave. Ten minutes later he forgets about it and asks the cook to make another. At this point I say cancel it and walk out. I've never seen this waiter before and it is an atrocious experience. Younger African American gentleman who obviously needed some help. There should be more wait staff, things have gone down hill at this location."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant I've ever had. We waited about twenty minutes for someone to take our order and another twenty for the food to arrive (pancakes for my husband, chicken and waffles for me). 
Our food was COLD. Not even warm. My husband told the cashier and she took a whole two dollars off our tab. So we ended up paying $19 for an indelible dinner. Unacceptable. Will never go there again!,,"}
{"text":"Service was great. Everyone was happy and cheerful from the moment you get inside. The food's okay. I've never been terribly impressed by IHOP's food. I'm not a big sweets person so fancy pants pancakes, french toast and waffles doesn't impress me. But for a place that specializes in breakfast, you'd think their breakfast would have a little more oomph in it than Denny's or Eat n Park.

I got the breakfast sampler. You get bacon, eggs, sausage, ham and pancakes x 2 plus hash browns. You don't get toast. You can sub the pancakes for the toast but I can't help but feel cheated subbing my pancakes for toast for my eggs. Everything was tasty, but my over medium eggs were barely over easy. And considering I had to share my toast with my friend for our eggs, the toast to dippy egg ratio was pretty messed up. Yeah, I said dippy eggs....my folks are yinzers so even a few words have sunk in to this Zonie.

She got the french toast breakfast. Her eggs were like mine....supposed to be over medium but barely over easy. Everything tasted good, though. Her french toast was fluffy and sweet and we poured gobs of blueberry syrup onto it.

She also got this flavored coffee that she wasn't impressed with, other than the chocolate chips and whipped cream. Flavored coffees with chocolate chips and whipped cream doesn't impress me, either.

Our only real complaints were that it took over thirty minutes from when we sat down before we got our meals. We showed up at 10:30 so maybe we were at the tail end of their busy shift. The waiter was on the dining room floor the whole time so I know he wasn't in the back rolling silverware or ignoring us to do sidework. He was also super friendly and cheerful.

Honestly, for the price, I'd rather get my no-name somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had the Jack cheader & Bacon potatoes substation the pancakes for biscuits and gravy ......omg so good.  I went early 5:30 am. This a new menu item and I believe a keeper just top the potatoes with the two eggs you get with them (over easy)  Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"After a TERRIBLE experience at Black Bear Diner on GV Pkwy my kids decided they wanted IHOP! 
Greeted right away and the service was literally some of the best we have ever gotten. 
Wasn't too busy but our waitress made sure we had a great experience. Food was good too! 
And the end of the night, we were told that kids eat free with a paid adult meal! Pretty awesome and even better for the waitress who got a 75% tip! 
Wish I could remember her name but will update when I get it. 
5atar service!!!"}
{"text":"I have a mild heart condition that makes me sensitive to caffeine.  I specifically asked for decaf coffee.  What the waitress brought me obviously was regular, as a half hour after leaving the restaurant I had a strong reaction from having had caffeine. NO EXCUSE !!!!!"}
{"text":"As I-Hops go, it is pretty typical.  My wife loves getting breakfast there at all times of the day.  I've had both breakfasts and lunches ..mostly sandwiches.  nothing great, but it's passable.  The waitresses are usually good, cheerful, and attentive ( tho occasionally you get a clinker ..but that happens everywhere).  These are hard working ladies so leave them a reasonable tip."}
{"text":"This place is beyond disgusting.  Seriously, many people get food poisoning from this IHOP.  It is filthy dirty and there are always people starting fights there.  Service is okay, but the food is really disgusting.  I was at the convenience store next to this Ihop once and two of the cooks were in the store talking about how an \"ugly chick\" came in, and they were laughing about how they spit in her food."}
{"text":"Ehhhh I have never been a big IHop fan. I mean how good can eggs really get? lol  nothing impressive, nothing bad.  You want breakfast and you're in the area, sure why not."}
{"text":"I visited this location last night and the first thing our party smelled was bad body odor in the front lobby. 
We were seated relatively quickly at an open booth which was covered in sticky residue and leftover hash browns on the seats. Our waitress didn't give us utensils until I had to ask 10 minutes later and requested a clean booth to sit in.
First glass of orange juice was watered down so I ordered a new one. Our 4 plates of food  took 35+ min but i'Il excuse that b/c there were only 2 waitresses at 9pm on a Sunday. When the food came they had messed up my sister's order.
I realize customer service at a 24hr diner might be subpar but this was the worst experience I've ever had at IHOP and I expected better from such a reputable establishment. Our waitress was sweet but made no effort to engage with us at all and was kinda distant. We would've gone elsewhere but we were pretty high and just wanted to eat."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and every time I regret it. The service is beyond slow. Literally waited over an hour yesterday morning to be served 2 omelets. I was late for somewhere else I needed to go because of the ridiculously slow service. It wasn't even that busy so no excuse. When I questioned and asked the waitress where the food was because it was an extremely long time since we ordered and I had to be somewhere, she checked and said he just got yours started. Mind you, this was after already waiting 45 minutes. Won't go back unless I have all morning to waste."}
{"text":"Negative star

Waiting up front for a long while.
We were seated and never saw our waiter. 
The place was slow 
There were 6 workers cleaning 2 tables lol
After about 20 min of just seating there we got up and left.
The Sunday afternoon crew are a bunch of slackers"}
{"text":"IHOP is an OK place to go for breakfast or a pancake craving. You won't find anything amazing and the pancakes are probably as good as you can make at home, but it's a place that you can count on to be open at really late hours, which is nice. I like their chocolate chip pancakes!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever and the bill was incorrect. Don't go here if you expect good service and accuracy. The server couldn't even remember answers to questions she had just asked and the service was incredibly slow."}
{"text":"I would not go back here, unless I wanted to take up waiting as a occupation.   It took 20 minutes for a waiter to come by and take our drink order and then another 15 minutes for a second waiter to come by and ask to take our food order who then promised to expedite the order due to the wait but blamed the kitchen for being slow.  At this point I was very frustrated but want to hang on for the kids.  

Once we finished ordering, my 5 year old needed to use the restroom and wanted an escort over.  I could not help but notice that several people who had been seated right before us and others who were waiting to be seated after us had already been served their food and were half done with their meals.  Slow kitchen right.

This did not improve my opinion of the restaurant nor did the drama at the table across from us. Apparently our waiter has messed up the order and served the wrong food to the table and was having to run additional food over.  Based on that squabble and another 15 minutes of waiting I decided to leave.  I could not face waiting longer and having the food order wrong and \"cold\" as the lady at the table across us was loudly declaring.

In summary the service is very questionable.  You either get lucky and get your food quickly or you get stuck in limbo with no recourse.  My seven year old did not like leaving but told me in the car that we should never go back to the Pineville IHOP again \"As they broke a promise to get our food.\"  I couldn't agree more."}
{"text":"We went in and they took 45 minutes to finish cooking our meals. Once they came out, they were all not what we ordered. The most their rug merchant manager was willing to do was a \"25% discount on our meal\" after screwing up our order. Never coming back here. Their manager nazeem or however you spell it clearly wasn't willing to let a couple dollars go over their own laziness and lack of professionalism. I have never had worse service anywhere."}
{"text":"Got seated with this location literally empty, one family as the sole customer. The dining room had at least 6 tables with dirty dishes, napkins, etc left as if this place just had a massive later dinner rush. After 10 minutes of waiting for  server to offer to bring drinks or water, one server continued wiping down the table next to us and said nothing as if we didn't exist. That was plenty to say See Ya! I have to wonder how the heck this place does business."}
{"text":"We love I-Hop! This is the best place to go for a late night snack. The food is always fresh and hot. The servers we get are always the nicest most sincere people you will every meet. We love William!! He is the funniest, most adorable person ever. I'm so glad he works here, he will always make us want to come back."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong w/ Ihop.  Beautiful new location.   
Lobby is a little small for a rush, but was seated quickly. 

My server was Tyler and I'll ask for him again.   He knows his Ihop!"}
{"text":"Once again, Chain restaurants... sighs...

Cons

heavy cigarette smell inside

waitress kept forgetting about us

I ordered an apple juice and automatically got super sized on it (didn't care so i kept it)

I ordered a waffle by itself and automatically got a combo (this I didn't keep, I sent back because is not what I wanted)

the waitress kept forgetting about us, even with giving us the check

children's menu is overpriced, might as well order from regular menu and feed the child more food

They almost gave us someone elses food twice


Pros.

The waffle was ok

I feel like this place makes mistakes on purpose to get you to pay more. Horrible way of doing it. I haven't been to IHOP in many years and this was my return. Will not come back. I'll stick to good ol Denny's thank you"}
{"text":"Glad we didnt pay attention to the bad reviews. We come to Vegas almost every month, its our fav getaway. Here visiting from CA and craving IHop. Went today 7/21 at 2:00, wasnt crowded at all. This is one of the bigger IHops very spacious. We were seated right away, our waiter Anselmo was great and food was fantastic.Their wifi is free & strong.  I like that this place is away from the casinos, a good escape from the noise and traffic. We will be back."}
{"text":"Just went to our fav IHop when we're in Vegas. Today our waiter was John T. he kept our drinks full and was very attentive and polite. The parking lot is big so usually not an issue, we've come on the weekend and of course it can get crowded. The service has always been really good and the food from presentation to taste delicious. Next time i'll take some pics, this is usually our first meal of the day around 1:00pm so we slways tear into our plates b4 i think of taking pics"}
{"text":"The new remodel is very nice and inviting!! The air conditioner makes the dining experience difficult"}
{"text":"We've given up on this location. Food is not good here. Scrambled eggs are not edible, the kids never like them here. Hash brown usually burnt. Omelettes as dry as can be. Coffee is just horrible. Unfortunately, we always give it a try once every few months, but always the same. So we just go back to village inn. It's just better tasting food."}
{"text":"Burnt scrambled eggs, crunchy pancakes, bacon overcooked at one end and undercooked at the other, terrible service. NOT A GREAT VISIT!"}
{"text":"Who wants to wait an hour for cold food?! Terrible service with a side of burnt bacon is what you can expect here. God forbid you need silverware."}
{"text":"Decent food, decent service, but usually very busy. I attend often."}
{"text":"one of the worst meals i've ever had.  only went there once and that's all it took.  the service was slow, the dining area was dirty and the food tasted like cigarette smoke.  in my nicotine days this might have been seen as an added bonus, but now not so much.  chalk this up as a one and done!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible. We were a party of 10 waiting for almost an hour while they were happily seating parties of 4,6, and 8 who all came in well after our party. On top of being very rude about the situation, we were denied a chance to even talk to the manager."}
{"text":"2 Stars for Late Dinner:    The food was okay, it wasn't that great and we were disappointed.

4 Stars for Breakfast to go:  We ordered for pick up.  Everything was packed and our orders were correct."}
{"text":"I like this place. I like it so much that I'm here about  two to three times a month. Food is good, the mushroom & spinach omelette is my favorite and the never ending coffee with hazelnut creamer. Service is good considering that they are always busy. The place always looks clean and prices are reasonable.
Good food    =star
Good service=star
Clean.            =star
Value.            =star
Now here's the problem. There is a section in the middle of the dining area that seats four per table with a divider in the middle that supposedly makes it a  two -two person table. Well that doesn't work! were all seating in the same table with strangers! We can hear each others conversation and reach over and steal other peoples marmalade. These dividers work well on a checkout line at the grocery store. My groceries /divider / your groceries.
But they don't work on restaurant tables. I need my personal space.
Check please!"}
{"text":"Just blown away by the stupidity and audacity of our waitress this morning. I came in to have a quick pancake and hot chocolate with my three year old daughter and ordered her a kids hot chocolate and a coffee for myself. I guess I've been spoiled by Dutch Brothers because i expected the kids hot choc to come in A KIDS cup and at a safe drinkable temperature, but it came in an adult coffee mug instead. The KIDS hot chocolate came out so hot i burned myself on the mug, it was much hotter than my coffee. I asked the waitress if she be comfortable carrying this back to the kitchen in her hands and did she really think it was in ANYONES best interest to give a 3 year old something that could cause a 2nd degree burn? She immediately gave me attitude, as if i said something outrageous , and said \"well the hot chocolate is supposed to be hot, i don't know how to make it cooler\" ......
Awh geez rick, how could you possibly make a hot beverage cooler?????? ??

I had to suggest ice cubes. I did. 

She came back with half the hot chocolate gone and it freezing cold full of ice cubes. 

It's beyond me how she's made it this far in life. 

You work in customer service, it's obviously not for you. Find a new job that doesn't require as much common sense as to not GIVE A TODDLER SOMETHING THAT COULD GET YOUR COMPANY SUED. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was great.  We went twice while visiting in Las Vegas because it's a good place to take kids and it was close to our hotel (Ramada Inn on Flamingo Rd)."}
{"text":"Took long to get our dine inn order for brunch. When you're hungry be ready to end up starving :("}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! At first I thought this visit would be great! Not only were we seated quickly but by someone who wasn't even on the clock yet. I thought what amazing service to not just ignore us. But then we got our server. He kept getting our order mixed up which ok no big deal. But when he brought us our food he didn't bother to ask if we needed anything else all because another table waved him over. BTW we did something but not only that the entire time he never came back over to us. We waited 5 minutes after we were finished just to get our bill. It was just the worst service. I used to work for this IHOP and they used to be so big in customer service now I can see that is no longer the priority. Definitely won't be back here... lots of other breakfast places with better service."}
{"text":"food was good, but heavy set blonde waitress had a horrible odor to her. Monday morning 6-6-16 making food hard to keep down."}
{"text":"Same oldies channel w/ Doobie Brothers 'Black Water' & Don McLean singing 'American Pie' just as I remembered iHops last time I ate at one, over a decade ago in Iowa.  It's like time stands still here lol.  

Kathy our server was fabulous & deserves five stars totally.  They have a +55 menu for the folks & I had the 'Fit' breakfast w/ egg whites, turkey bacon & wheat toast.  The side of fruit looked horrible.  

Overall, it's an ok quick breakfast, nothing special.  $31 for three.  Located right off of the freeway & the sign is hard to see.  Farmer Boys is in the same parking lot & we had no clue either as we are waiting for our car around the corner."}
{"text":"The absolute worst service ever at a restaurant in my life . Service is well below 1 star, food quality also , and managements reason was \" he is a new server it's his first day\"so shadow him with a experienced sever and train him that's not my job I'm the one paying for it !!!!!!i just wanted a stack of pancakes and they couldn't even do that at international house of PANCAKES."}
{"text":"Foods decent on a good day. Loved the banana pudding pancakes. Some days you have really good service from amazing people in a good mood and those are the moments I appreciate. Cleanliness gets about 3 stars any day but can't expect too much there when it's open 24 hours"}
{"text":"Really poor service from Nicole (Manager) with attitude. The real manager is not on the premise. Watched interaction with other customers and the attitude was completely different. I believe more training is needed. I will be delivering a letter to corporate about today's visit. Would not give this visit 1 star."}
{"text":"I'm usually never disappointed in IHOP, but there's always a first time for everything. The food was subpar at this location and the service was fine until it came time to pay. My waitress said she would pick it up when I'm ready then she proceeds to leave me for like 5-10 minutes. I waited then I thought 'well might as well go to the front, it doesn't matter who takes my money as long as I pay for it right?' I waited at the front register for someone to come ring me up and they just walk right by, some would look with blank stares, confused as to why a customer would be waiting at the register with her receipt and card in hand, ready to finally leave this place and finally a person came up and asked if I had cashed out with my server. I was like cashed out? Well I'm ready to pay if that's what you mean just for her to tell me I can't pay for my meal with anyone else but my server. I found it weird that they had bound my entire IHOP existence to my server (the one who I hadn't seen in quite a while) but I sucked it up and said ok and started looking for her. I got tired of waiting and went to the restroom, which out of the 3 stalls 2 were gross, and came back out and tracked her down. That soured my experience even worse than the extra average food and terrible bathrooms. Not coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"Well
It just opened recently and has been sold already for 2+ million...was there last Sunday with wife and 96 year old mother in law ... they both ordered breakfast items and loved it and ate it all and to me it looked really good. However I ordered breakfast tacos.... not really good... and it took extra long for mine to come out..tooooo loooonngggg.
Waitress was ok but very new and nervous
Bottom line if you have something on the menu know how to make it."}
{"text":"Big waste of money. Feel as though the quality of the food has declined severely...we ordered a quesadilla and a breakfast sandwich and all we got was a bag full of grease. Thought it would be better than nothing in the middle of the night, but we were wrong!"}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes were amazing. The pumpkin coffee not so much!!   My crepe omelette was amazing. Got me hooked!!! Very filling. I'm a very picky eater. I would eat here again. :)"}
{"text":"I have been liking IHOP's menu no matter which location because they always seem to work with me and how picky I am. I have been getting and eggs Benedict crêpe that I'm in love with.  It's not really on the menu but they make it for me anyway.  There's always filling and the price is always right.  I have seem to gotten lucky with the timing.  Because every time I'm about to leave there's a huge line that I seem to have missed completely.  (Yelper Karma?)"}
{"text":"I wanted to compliment the ihop on bell and 19th.  I am in the middle of moving and am eating out alot alone and i really appreciate great service and good food.   I went in for lunch and Zak let me choose where i sat.
He readily took my drink order and brought them to me.  I ordered the chicken and waffles and It was nice and hot and fresh when he served me my meal.  He even went out of his way to ask me if i would like warm syrup on my nice warm and fluffy waffle.
He also brought me rancj for my chicken.  I never waited for anything.
I would definitely go back and look for Zak. He is a fantastic server who made me really appreciate the little things like a smile and quick service.
Good job Ihop..

{"text":"It's iHOP. Nothing too special about this place, food is solid. Ordered a pancake and eggs and it's all just fine. nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Had a late breakfast here on a Saturday afternoon.  No complaints from me.  The service was friendly and fast.  The booth was clean as well as the carpet and walls.  Our waiter was friendly and fast to give a refill or check to make sure we were ok.  The food was hot, fresh, and good.  Nothing more I could want from an IHOP."}
{"text":"Super busy and rude personnel hostess nayeli no customer service what so ever super rude! Took them 45 to get seated just cane here to have a nice breakfast and buy gift certificates for my company but after this I ended buying them from Denny's instead."}
{"text":"Got me in quickly and got my food to me quickly; IHOP is what I called \"old reliable\". Good food at a good price. Staff was quick and efficient. Good Sunday morning breakfast before and early movie."}
{"text":"Food good sometimes ,remodel nice. 
2 times there .  1 waitress had attitude over easy eggs runny did not eat nothing done.
2 attitude waitress again we were a group after bowling  some women playing. Mah jong told us to be quiet it is a restaurant we were paying they were playing for free.
Maybe we should start a poker group there and not pay then IHOP would listen to our complaints."}
{"text":"Came in tonight with my girlfriend to have a nice dinner waitress her name was Nancy nice lady everything was good she pre-ordered my food for tomorrow morning for my office meeting we will return"}
{"text":"Came in for a simple breakfast sausage eggs hash brown my girlfriend had sausage eggs and hashbrown and both had pancakes food is good it was delivered real quick but we had to wait over 20 minutes to get our check our server was Anselmo, we had him ask another waitress to get our bill"}
{"text":"Don't go here. Plenty of other IHOPs to go to or even other restaurants. Management and service is very poor. Ignorant servers. 

Advice to management: replace your crew and yourselves."}
{"text":"Wow! I haven't been to IHOP in years! I think I got bougie due to all the trendy brunch spots I've been exposed to.  I like how bright, shiny and new it is!  Even though I don't eat meat, I love how they now have turkey sausage.  The fruit was really fresh and thank you to our waitress for letting us sample some to check.  She was a fantastic waitress!  I ordered the Spinach & Mushroom Omelette with egg substitute and pancakes.  My friends ordered the Garden Omelette and Eggs and Turkey Sausage.  Everything was fine, but I definitely see how my palette has matured, lol.  I miss the country griddle pancakes IHOP used to have!"}
{"text":"what can I say average everything service is slow food is ok well pancakes and everything else are okay Banana Foster brioche is good for a place like this to me it's equal to Denny's Maybe a little better than a Waffle House  it's 24 hr good after the bar food"}
{"text":"IHOP is one of those places you go to knowing its probably not going to be good but even then you get disappointed. The crepes were really bad but the pancakes were ok. The waiter was nice but the girl up front was really rude and had a \"don't bother me\" attitude. Just typical IHOP."}
{"text":"The service is better on the weekends I noticed, but staff is very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Food good... Little bit of a slow start but the waitress was very nice. Ordered the big steak omelet and it was more than I could eat.  O.J. coffee and food for about 15 bucks.  It's IHOP.  Basically what I expected."}
{"text":"We came on a busy Sunday morning but we were seated promptly. It was definitely surprising since we were called as I was reading terrible reviews on the place for having long waits. I also read about bad service here but I definitely did not get that. Our server was really sweet and never forgot anything we ordered. She also checked up on us many times. Also, (I'm assuming) the store manager greeted every table and asked if everything was okay. 

The food was good. I'm not going to say it's not the very best breakfast in town but it's good, tasty breakfast. Everything was cooked well and we finished everything! I'd go to this location again. It was my first time and not the last. I hope I get the same stellar service and food every time I come."}
{"text":"Food is usually good here.silver ware is scuzzy looking. Water spots says they. SOAPY says I. We washed them ourselves after rejecting 4 sets. Great staff friendly. Personable. Too bad."}
{"text":"We were greeted nicely at the door but once we sat down our waitress was not very nice. She was simply unfriendly.  Not sure I'll return to this location due to the interaction with this waitress."}
{"text":"This does not make sense.

I came here with family tonight. I know there were a lot of people in here, but even though the servers are doing the best they can the kitchen is horrible. I don't know what's going on with them cooks but they're leaving things off certain menu items and the bacon that's requested extra crispy is as limp as a spaghetti noodle.  Every single plate of bacon!  On top of that, one of the plates of food were stone-cold.

Mind you all that's after waiting 30 minutes for all the food to get here. This is utterly ridiculous. This location used to be better in the past and they need to step it up before the next time I come back here.  Poor servers are getting beaten up in here because the kitchen staff can't get it right.

This is a major step down."}
{"text":"Had the Breakfast sampler of 2 eggs, 2 links, 2 ham, 2 bacon, hash browns, 2 pancakes. Overall? Not tasty and kind of cold.

However, since this was my second time to patronize this establishment, I must conclude that this is THE WORST IHOP EVER."}
{"text":"We have been to this location 3 times and NEVER again!  The service is ALWAYS horrendous and trying to get a refill on ur coffee is like pulling teeth!  Next time I feel like IHOP I will make the drive to another location....ugh. the ONLY reason it gets the 2 stars is because I enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"I get a craving for IHOP maybe once a year, and this past weekend I had the craving.
 
I've been to this one several times, never truly amazed by the service or food but never have been put off by it either.

We went in this past Saturday and before we were ever seated (and we stood there for almost ten minutes, not one person came out of the kitchen or even passed by) my husband decided to hit the rest room, he came back out after a minute or two to announce the soap dispenser not working, so we decided to leave,  

If a restaurant doesn't have a working soap dispenser in the bathroom then maybe there might be a few employees not washing their hands after using the bathroom.

So needless to say we left. 

Just food for thought (and no, no pun intended)."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I love this IHOP so much. Maybe it's because I can order pancakes, a cheese omlette, cheesy-hash browns with bell peppers, bacon and toast and  it all tastes so damn good and is relatively cheap... although I just realized our waitress overcharged me by A LOT this morning. Grr.

Pretty solid experiences all around here. Go IHOP!"}
{"text":"Casandra was amazing. She remembered my order from 4 months ago!!! I'm here from Cali to take care of my dad and she is great!!!! If you are in Glendale or Peoria GO SEE CASANDRA!!!!!"}
{"text":"If i could give them a half star i would.I will never return here..it was awful.server was rude. Manager was avoding me the only person that acted like they wanted to work was the bust boy.I spilled my juice it took someone 30mins to wipe up and that's only because the bust boy saw it walkn by I translated in spanishb to get manager and he did nothing about the waitress .didn't comp me a drink or anything.I ased for syrup and hot sauce by time I got it I was ready to go"}
{"text":"Great location horrible service. Everything is sloooooow her. Honestly, don't even bother. I've been here multiple time and its been the same every time. Badly mismanaged location."}
{"text":"Solid IHOP. I've eaten here a couple times with a friend who lives right around the corner and we almost always sit in the exact same booth. We always have pleasant service and there is never really anything of note."}
{"text":"I will never go here again. Went here on Thanksgiving day for breakfast with two friends of mine that I haven't seen for months. We were seated immediately and were given our menus. That was about the only positive thing about my experience. Our server came for the order. I'm not a huge fan of pancakes and I resumed to tell the lady that I didn't want any. She stared me down almost in awe that i didn't want any. She asked me what I wanted instead I wasn't sure what I could have so I asked if I could have an extra strip of bacon. She laughed and said no honey you can't get no meats. I'm sorry but I didn't know. I'm sure the lady must have been unhappy because she had to work on Thanksgiving, but you don't have to take it out on the customer. The food itself was complete garbage. No flavor on the meat the bacon was too salty and the hash brown were way too crunchy. Overall a pretty negative experience. Thankfully I don't live in Charlotte and I won't have to visit this location again."}
{"text":"Took my granddaughter there, and she had waffles sausage and bacon for breakfast and she ate all of it to my surprise. 
Then she wanted another piece of sausage  and ate that  (for a 7 year old). 
We always go there to eat either breakfast or lunch, and the food is always good to eat. 
Good place for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I am disappointed I ordered online, the cashiers are plain rude, unprofessional. Please you guys are serving people! Look at the food, so sad NEVER coming back"}
{"text":"This place has great servers they were all friendly.  Everyone made sure our drinks stayed full and our food came out hot and exactly the way we wanted it. Our server Jessie was amazing!"}
{"text":"I will never return to the place. Service was very slow. My sons food was under cooked, coffee sucked and on top the that the place smelled like BO/toilet."}
{"text":"While waiting for our food my father spotted a pubic hair on the table near the condiments! We told two waitresses and one hostess and no one cleaned it so we sat at another table. One hour had passed and we still hadn't received our food. All of a sudden my dad says, \"Look behind your mothers back there's a bedbug climbing on the wall near your mom!\" I looked and to my astonishment there was a bed bug! I said to my family, \"Lets get out of hear this place is bed bug infested!\" I told the hostess and showed her where it was and then left. When I got home I realized that my leg had been bit up!!!! This IHop is filthy!"}
{"text":"When during brunch hours. Prices were reasonable for what they offer, good for families with kids!! The staff was Nice and attentive"}
{"text":"First time ever being to IHOP and serves here was horrible. I ordered my food (which I know will be a wait) and my coffee. I didn't get my coffee literally 30min later after asking my waiter for the 3 time. I also realized everyone was getting there food even when I got there before them. The waiter then tried to charge me for another plate I did not eat or ordered. She tried to fight me on it, and it was just so annoying! Not good service and I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, the guy took forever to give us everything.. even our waters, which he didn't give us straws for. The food didn't come with what was included in the menu. The food looked and tasted microwaved. Also the workers were just casually talking about fighting people. Won't go back ever. Waste of $10. Guy was super unprofessional and  slow like if he was stoned."}
{"text":"This ihop is the bomb!!! The server rick is great...he made sure our food was out and hot!!! The pancakes were made perfect and the hash browns were toasty...I recommend just add some ketchup and hot sauce to your hash brown and boom, bomb fire just like that! This place is fast professional and the staff is awsome...even the greeters."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst service I have ever had. Took 10 mins to get a drink order. And our waiter was just rude and seemed to be bothered by us. Also it look us 30 mins to get food. And when we mentioned it to our server she went back to the kitchen and told them our order. Never will come back to this location there is always a problem when we go here."}
{"text":"I loved the breakfast. It was exactly what I orders. But the best part was April out server. She was friendly, efficient, and helpful. I hadn't have this good of a service in a long time, and I go out at least once a week!"}
{"text":"This is the worst breakfast experience ever.  
Cooks don't know how to cook. 
And servers that don't know how to serve.   
Get the feeling this place doesn't like customers"}
{"text":"Last night I decided to make a late night stop at a sit down restaurant so IHOP immediately came to mind. We were greeted by a very polite and courteous young lady which led us to our table though we couldn't help but notice the incredibly cold temperature inside the restaurant. We moved tables but it still remained very cold, the service was flawless especially considering she was on her own and the food was delicious my only big problem was how cold it was it made the dining experience relatively rushed."}
{"text":"This is the slowest and rudest ihop. The hostess had us wait for almost 10 minutes to get a table, when there were maybe 3 taken tables total. After sitting down no one went over to our tables to take drink orders (or any order) and have been waiting for 34 minutes now. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Worst IHOP I have ever been to and will never come back too! We were sat down immediately but Abel, \"our supposed waiter\" didn't even greet us for 30 minutes. He took our order which took 40 minutes to arrive to our table and it was not even cooked, half burnt, half undercooked! What awful service and disgusting food! We finally left after almost two hours of our time wasted. Don't waste your time at this location."}
{"text":"We have been going to this location for about two years and service has always been decent until very recently.  Two days ago my husband got a drink that had lipstick on the rim from the previous user.  Since we had never had problems before and they gave us $25 off our next trip we shrugged it off.  Bad stuff happens and I wouldn't give them the bad press if it had not been for our trip this morning.... The service was incredibly slow and with three small children in your family slow is the worst.  I got chicken and waffles. The waffles were ok but the chicken came out on its own plate with cooking grease splattered all over the plate. The grease was old and in dire need of being changed. This made the chicken taste terrible and is the suspected culprit in stomach issues I experienced throughout the day.  My husband couldn't order what he wanted because they changed what they stock before they change their menu.  The kids couldn't order their build a scary face pancake that was advertised all over the restaurant because they hadn't got the stuff in to make them yet.  And the food got out to the table cold.  I sincerely regretted going.  I didn't bother to complain as I don't want to get incentive to give them yet anther try.  My stomach and my family regret the trip and won't be returning."}
{"text":"If I could rate this location a 0 I would. From the moment I walked in I knew this would be a bad experience. The store alarm was going off and the crew had no idea how to shut it off. They sat us and after 15 minutes of no service we got up and left. They were not busy at all. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Very surprised - excellent service. Super friendly hostess and server. Not what I was expecting from a late-night experience at an IHOP.

Food also was more than acceptable, it was actually good."}
{"text":"Would have given five stars if the waiter didn't lie to me about the crepes. I asked if they where fresh spun to order and of course the answer was yes.    Crepes had water from being frozen just. Cause u can't properly pronounce the word doesn't mean you should lie to your customers about them"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever.   Managers at night actually don't help customers clean or really do anything cause they legit are lazy  and trying to push away customers s OK they don't have to work.   The wanna be Guido of manager is an absolute prick of a boy   had a few poor experiences all do to him last time thou was a joke.  Literally you have to get a manager out of the kitchen and stop him from doing Drugs with the cooks just to get service. Honest to god I could have taken you guys for all your money but I doubt there is any money in the register. 20 mins later they start making my order that was called in half hour ago. Manager acts like I made the mistake an obviously my fault and must of called another IHOP if I was that stupid I would be filling out an application"}
{"text":"We eat here two days in a row, we always order the eggs with Tri tips, worst breakfast, Tri tips were tough both days. Our son had an omelet, which was so dry he couldn't eat it.
We have always had good meals at this IHOP, but really has gone down hill, we ended up at Denny's, had two good breakfasts."}
{"text":"Decided to stop at IHOP for a quick breakfast on my way to work. Got seated fairly quickly and my order was taken in a reasonable amount of time. Bacon was uncooked and inside of pancakes were still batter like. After requesting a redo 15 minutes passed without ever being served. Very nice waitress but with an almost empty restaurant you might think she would notice she never brought my order before giving me my bill. I left hungry and disappointed with this particular IHOP. Last time ever in this establishment...wished there was an option to give \"0\" stars."}
{"text":"I was there tonight at 11:45pm.the worst service ever.the waitress was extremely rude.the food came out wrong.then we waited 45minutes for them to fix the food and it still came out wrong.I would never ever return to this location.im a general manager at a restaraunt and if my employees ever responed like the waitress did,I would terminate them imediately.before it effect business.I would like a response back from someone in corporate.because I respond to all my yelp reviews."}
{"text":"We used to love coming to this location, but unfortunately it seems that service has gone downhill drastically. We arrived and noticed that the restaurant wasn't hugely busy, but ended up waiting 15 minutes. As we were waiting, we noticed what seems to be an extremely disorganized wait staff standing around while not enough tables were being served, to the point of a table having to hold up all of their menus to get their servers attention. We chose to leave before even being seated."}
{"text":"Simply the best IHOP experience I've ever had. I like IHOP- they have the best pancakes. This location was staffed great. Seated right away. Our waiter was top notch! I'd go out of my way to head here. My pancakes were heaven! Great experience!."}
{"text":"I know that all problems start from the top down. Management, never present, that I've seen. The past two visits have been horribly understaffed. Everyone sitting around waiting. This location is centrally located and on the light rail. It should be the beacon of all other diners in the area. Get it together IHOP on Central. we left. Terrible."}
{"text":"Horrible service every time we go there. They never take off the kids meal prices for kids eat free unless you ask. My husbands burger was bright red raw in the middle.
We have also had the kids mac n cheese come out still in the steam bag. No presentation or concern from staff. Im sure the dinner staff must be the training crew"}
{"text":"A large, fairly standard 24 hour Ihop. You know how sometimes the booths at a restaurant have kind of a musty funky smell? Well, that wasn't an issue here, and that's usually my major issue with ihops. Also the menus were not sticky, another plus. Service was friendly, smiley and prompt. I come to ihops for their distinctly buttery pancakes and their perfect hash browns, and was satisfied there.
But. The men's bathroom was NASTY. Narsty. Gross. Dave came out looking traumatized and preferred to wait out the ride home than go near those funknasty toilet seats. Step it up guys. Even if it is next door to a strip club. 
So bring your purell if you want to clean your hands and vacate your digestive system prior to coming, and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Tasha is amazing! I brought my 2 little ones in for my sons birthday lunch and she made his whole day! She told him how handsome he is, wished him a happy bday and even gave him a gift of $5. Totally unexpected and very much appreciated. Thank you, Tasha. I wish nothing but good things for you."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite breakfast place in Madison. Their food is always hot and delicious. The service is great and we get in an out in a respectable amount of time. Even if they are super busy you can usually get your food in 15 minutes. I tried their hot chocolate last time i was there and it was perfect! I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Family oriented restaurant, open 24 hours, clean, friendly staff. I usually order the steak tips, with eggs, crispy hashbrowns and a side of pancakes. They are happy to accommodate my delicious request and always smile when I order my pancakes with bacon added inside them. You just can't have enough bacon!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend, his parents, and I all went to I hop last night. When we walked in there were only 3 tables full. We got seated by Kristen (who was awesome btw) and got our orders placed relatively quickly. However we waited 1 hour for our food. Kristen came to check on us periodically however we started to get upset after about 45 minutes and thought about leaving. Kristen informed us that they were just getting caught up in the kitchen but there were now only 2 tables. This is I hop, I assume it wouldn't take 1 hour to make a few eggs and pancakes. And then the food was cold. However Kristen was great. The only thing deserving stars was her."}
{"text":"I don't have much expectations of IHOP. It's a crappy chain known for low end food so l suppose I shouldn't be complaining? We were on a road trip and stopped in for a \"quick\" breakfast. 

The hostess was pouring sweat like she had just been out for a run, and honestly looked like she just rolled out of bed. We were seated and it took a good 10 mins to be greeted by our server. We quickly discovered they were either short staffed or this location has a terrible manager running the joint. Several tables around us weren't bussed from the time we sat to when we left. The table next to us was handled only two forks (for a table of 4) and said sorry this all we have. Our water was served in foam to go cups. When our food came out there was cheese dried on the side of my plate that didn't come on my meal and the bottom of the side plate was coated in red strawberry syrup. Did the dishwasher not show up??

We ate and got out of there to laugh at how disgusting it was. This is probably why I don't go to ihops. My mistake"}
{"text":"Surprisingly the food was great.  The service was good and overall we had a good experience.  My daughters ordered pancakes and they came to the table quickly."}
{"text":"One of us got their food ten minutes before everyone else. I ordered pancakes , the ones I got didn't even fill a six inch plate! We have eaten here before 
I always order pancakes, they used to be big enough to fill a ten inch plate. Very disappointed.Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"IHOP.  Funny waiters. Great place to bring the family. I recommend anyone to go and eat their breakfast platters."}
{"text":"This IHOP location was clean and centrally located near hotels and shopping. Since it was Sunday we had a bit of a wait. However, the wait was too long. Our waitress was nice and the food came out quick. When I come back to stay at the location I will go back"}
{"text":"The manager I believe his name is David was awesome!! He sat us and took our drink order as soon as we sat down. I noticed that the employees were great full and happy to have him around because he seems like he really cares about service. We ordered or meals and He noticed our food wasn't out yet so he went and told us our order was stuck in the machine so he was going to give us a discount for the wait. We didn't even realize it was taking awhile so when he informed us we were surprised but very happy and great full. I've never had better service."}
{"text":"Save your money and drive a few more miles to the Original Pancake House. Much better."}
{"text":"Went around 10ish pm during a weekday; ordered an omelette and pancakes- I was starving! I was attended really fast; the waiter was nice; my food arrived really fast too. I don't know why this place has low ratings. And yes, I would go back."}
{"text":"Haven't been to IHOP for a very long time because those closed to my house never impressed me.  But my friend wanted to go & we found this one.  First impression was clean.  Then there's a little crowd.  Then the pumpkin pancake turned me on.  Turkey instead of pork kept up my appetite.  Service was very good too.  Worth my time.  Good!"}
{"text":"Best I-hop we've ever been! Not much waiting time.  The food was fresh and warm. Andrew our waiter was simply great! Best service we have ever had!!! Thank you so much great morning after a long flight!"}
{"text":"We were driving around, looking for a place to eat. We ended up at IHOP,  We had a GREAT waitress, Amber. She was awesome. She had great customer service. Positive attitude, and she was also very patient, friendly, and polite. For some reason we thought they were going to take a while for the cooks to make our food since there was a lot of people. Our food was out within 6 min of waiting. Amber also made sure we were doing ok. Once again thank you Amber."}
{"text":"They did a great job at serving us at 9 o'clock at night, even when we were the only ones there, they were really happy to be there. They even seemed happy even when the rush start coming in. Speedy service, great food, and amazing pancakes. I've been going here for a while and I've always enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The night cook is a beast and makes very good food , Very nice server Alexandria is always serving with a smile"}
{"text":"Realized I hadn't eaten all day and it was 4:45p. 
Was at Happy Valley & Pleasant Valley in Peoria. MANY choices to eat. I decided on I-Hop. I was surprised how clean it was...  but empty. 

I asked my server why no one was there. She replied that they had had many bad reviews about poor service and long wait for food. 

The menu was AMAZING! I was so surprised by the varied and healthy options! I ordered a spinach, mushroom, pepper omelette with the Hollandaise on the side. Asked for a side of buttermilk pancakes. The syrups on the table looked yummy and bottles all clean. 

My meal arrived quickly, was hot, exactly as ordered. I was pleasantly surprised how everything was DELICIOUS. It was fresh ingredients and a pleasant surprise after previous experiences at any pancake house. 

Hopefully, management is straightening out personnel problems because it was perfect when I was there. Families came in and I hope they, too, had a positive experience! I'll definitely go back and WILL spread the word about their excellent menu!"}
{"text":"Love this location. It's a bit small. But it's quiet and the staff is very friendly. Sunday mornings are the worst with the older generation and the church crowd. But all in all it's great! They never answer their phone and I'm not sure if they do to go orders but highly recommend anyway."}
{"text":"Our service was great (ask for Fabricio), the food was good and the service was fast. 

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered  a big steak omelette with extra steak  which they charge 3.99 for, and mushrooms. When I received  my food it was no extra  nothing I immediately asked to speak with a manager. When the manager arrived she stated that maybe it's was inside I proceeded to open the omelette in front of her and we both noticed that I didn't even have any hash brown inside"}
{"text":"The waiting time was not bad on a busy Saturday morning. Upon being seated we immediately got greeted by out waitress. She was a sweet gal and meant well but could not get our orders right. We were a party of 4 and she messed up on two of the orders. Waitress name is Genevieve. The reason why I am giving this place two-stars, it is because the location was easy to find."}
{"text":"Very poor experience. They were out of soup, tomatos, provolone cheese and was told they didn't have egg whites. I told the waitress that if they had eggs they could make egg whites  she just said they were really busy. We had to ask several times for drinks , ketchup and jelly. When we tried to pay no one was up front to help us or check anyone in. I went to find someone to tell them several people were waiting to be checked out. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is sloooow. We've been waiting for over 30 minutes only to get cold food and the place was empty. I have no idea what's going on here"}
{"text":"My family and I were very pleased with our meal and service today. Maybe they are are finally figuring it out at this location!"}
{"text":"Service was actually pretty decent. Though I find it quite strange that I'm needing to review yet ANOTHER IHOP about service...I'm unsure what it is? Maybe karma.

Anyway, the hostess didn't seem exactly friendly...but I guess she was ok...?

The server was nice enough to us. He was decent and the food was a lot more than I expected.

I'm giving this one 4 stars only because the food was ok. The hostess needs to get herself together. Smile. Please. It's better for you to smile than for you to frown like you did to my grandmother."}
{"text":"IHOP has a fabulous variety of pancakes and other breakfast foods. They are good, but not the best breakfast place in town."}
{"text":"The food was yum, and our server was cheerful and helpful, the food took longer normal and getting seated and paying took a long time as well :( over all it was an ok experience but nothing too great"}
{"text":"We ordered online and went to pick up, staff was pleasant. Service was speedy, Food was yummy except the French toast was raw inside and runny. Probably won't order from here again."}
{"text":"The service was ok but the food was not good at all.  Burnt bacon, the hash browns were sitting in grease, overlooked eggs, and the chicks tenders were so overcooked and dry.  
#fuckdennysforlife"}
{"text":"Horrible just horrible, first time here at this location & definitely the last we were waiting to be seated for at least 15 minutes while there was like 5 tables available no one acknowledged us i finally ask they took like 5 minutes then sat us down but took a good 40 minutes to bring the food out. When we said we were ready for the check they brought us the wrong one . If your near by looking for an ihop just dont stop at this one save yourself the trouble"}
{"text":"This was my second visit.  This time went a little earlier to avoid the rush.  At some point a think things will settle down but at the moment, I think they need a bigger place.  It was 15 minute wait when we left at 9:30 on Saturday.  But that speaks to the quality.

This time I got the all you can eat pancakes and the wife got a 2+2+2.  They don't make you get a drink for the AYCE Pancakes, so 3.99.  They were stacked high and hot.  The wife's eggs were ordered over easy and came out scrambled, but it was resolved quickly.

Service and staff are still top notch."}
{"text":"Usually come in late at night but decided to get something in the light of day. Called and ordered the 2x2x2 with a side of turkey sausage (2). When I get there my bill is $21.33 which is surprise since the meal is only $7 with the sides only costing two dollars. So I try to address the issue and when the manager comes over she informs me that I ordered two orders of my meal but when you look at the receipt it looks like a duplicate order was rung up. As I was trying to explain that the bill is wrong she remove the extra turkey sausage that she had put on my bill but yet still proceeded to ring me up for $18. I informed her of my bill was still wrong and when she brought over the receipt for me to look at I could see it was a duplicate order. I then explained to her that I would not order two orders for myself of the same order. She then started to try to reverse my charges but acted like she couldn't find a way to do it so I end up with an extra nine dollar charge on my credit card. This late night favorite has officially become a failure."}
{"text":"My husband & I eat at this IHOP about once a week. We've always awesome service from the wait staff. The food is good and usually comes very fast. I was there on Monday after Xmas & it was total chaos with so many people waiting....but the staff was excellent and made it well worth the little wait. I told them what an excellent job they did under the circumstances and they did it with a smile and a great attitude! Good job folks!"}
{"text":"Free pancake day was crazy busy!  People waiting out front all over the place.  The store was still clean, quick with our food and the food was really good.  We were so impressed with how well we were treated by hostess and waiter!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone to this location several times and we went today and it was HORRIBLE. 

We ordered the splashberry drink and it was disgusting. Tasted like nothing. The guy who made it even admitted to not knowing how to make it. We told them twice how bad it was and got no apology and either ignored the comment or just nodded. 

When we tried to checkout, there was a group of teenagers who had no money and had only $2 on their card. All the employees were brand new and there was NO MANAGER. They couldn't clear the system and called all the managers with no answer. So we got stuck waiting in the lobby with our tired toddler for 25 minutes as they tried to figure out what to do with the register.

When they did finally get it figured out and rang us up, a simple apology, no refund for the nasty drink, and now I have no desire to return. 

My family and I will not be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"Was in the area on business and had some time to eat. It was about 10ish in the morning and the place was packed.  Were they giving food away?  
They seated me quickly considering.  I love their Harvest Grain pancakes so that was my choice.  The stack of pancakes looked good until I stuck a knife in them.  Turns out I really didn't need a knife--I needed a fork.  The pancakes crumbled so much so that in order to eat them I had to push the fork tines against the pancake to  pick it up.  So clearly something happened to the batter---not enough butter--something was wrong.  I have never experienced anything like this with any of IHOP pancake ever.   Note to management:  Do something with the  Harvest Grain Pancake batter.  You kept me from enjoying one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Come on.... its IHOP... its not that bad & ya know what you're getting into. I do, however, appreciate the healthy selections now available on their menu. I tried the fruit-loaded crepes, which were definitely low-cal because they definitely had me snagging a few bites from my hunnie's plate of fail-safe IHOP omelette & pancakes. Yum- not gourmet, but get the job done for a quick breakfast nosh in Vegas that's not a buffet!"}
{"text":"Drunk people go here. Service is good depending who you get. The Burger according to one Arik B can not taste his burger. When ask the server, how come my friend Arik b can't taste his burger? Why?

You had to be there to laugh. What a fun night!!!!

Don't order the pancakes, they are not very good. The chicken strips were a-ok."}
{"text":"bad service, bad food, awful customer service along with bad attitude. Wouldn't come back here again if it was the last place on earth. Pancakes are cold along with bacon.... how do you mess up bacon? This place needs to close and just reopen."}
{"text":"The service at this particular location always SUCKS! The food is still standard with other Ihop's but if you value your time and sanity do not eat at this one. My sister and I went here for lunch the other day. Mind you it was not packed but it took 10 minutes for our \"first\" waiter to come and ask us what we wanted to drink. 5 minutes later the \"second\" waiter delivers the drinks and takes our order. 20 minutes later we finally got our food delivered by a \"third\" waiter (last time I checked a pancake only took like 2 minutes to cook). Throughout the meal no one ever checked in on us, as a matter of fact we never got a ticket. I had to end up telling the cashier what table we sat at so he could pull up the bill and ring me out, SMH!"}
{"text":"Can't beat cheap breakfast food in Vegas. Staff is always friendly. The days I went to the restaurant the AC was working. Be prepared for a wait because everyone else wants cheap good breakfast too."}
{"text":"Come hangry leave happy. It's an IHOP, so don't expect gourmet food, but within the world of cheap chain restaurants, IHOP is one of my favorites. This particular one isn't the best one I've been too, but it's far from the worst. Food took forever but the server tried hard to keep us happy."}
{"text":"The food is good . But they take too long with bringing out the food. I ordered online and it was suppose to be done by a certain time. It's now 15 minutes past, still waiting to pick it up. Management needs to get it together."}
{"text":"Due to the light rail construction, I believe the Glendale and 19th ave location had to shut down and construct this new IHOP on Northern.  

This place is fairly new and there is still construction happening in the area next door to this building.  

We went here for breakfast (8am) on a weekday and a lot of open seats.  Our server (didn't catch her name) was very nice and on top of things.  I tried the blueberry pancakes which was really good.  I would definitely get it again.  

Only thing that disturbed me about my visit here is when I went to use the restroom.  The male restroom has one wall unit and one toilet.  I was waiting to use the toilet since it was occupied by someone.  After he finished, I walked in and was immediately grossed out.  Before I say anything else, the only reason why I was so pissed off (No pun intended)  was because the person that used the stall before me was an employee (server, didn't catch his name).  He pee'd with the toilet seat down leaving a mess all over the toilet seat and didn't even clean it up.  After being disgusted and irritated, I left the stall without doing any of my business."}
{"text":"I have been going to this IHOP every month for 4 years. Our group is anywhere from 8 to 25. There are only two places in the restaurant that accommodate groups and for the most part, we have been seated relatively quickly. Over the past year, service has gone down hill. It started taking forever to get our order taken, get our drinks, or get our food. We are a very forgiving bunch and know it's not easy to serve a large group but as service started really sliding, our last trip ended the relationship. We had about 20 people and knew we would have to wait a bit, but after 30 minutes, we inquired how long and it was like \"your waiting for a table?\"the kept sitting people at the tables that only could accommodate large groups. How can you not remember a group when they take up the whole lobby? We called a near by breakfast place and they were thrilled to have our party, which grew smaller since some left at that point. We found a new home and they will get 5 stars on my review."}
{"text":"This IHOP used to be good when it first opened but it's gone down hill. Service is extremely slow and food is mediocre at best. My toast was basically oversized croutons. It was as hard as a rock. We were seated well before another family. We had the same waitress but she took their order and got their food before us because they are regulars. I guess they want to keep their only returning customers happy because we won't be back."}
{"text":"8:30 AM on a Sunday morning and it wasn't crowded.  I've been here before and my breakfast is usually good.  This time though, coffee was cold and tasted horrible, pancakes were cold and my over easy eggs were not even cooked.  Sent the eggs back after waitress said, \"That's the way they make over easy here.  You want over medium.\"  She brought me new eggs, but it was exactly the same, all raw and runny inside.  Asked her to nuke my pancakes too.  Oh well, it was a bad morning there for sure.  I should have just stayed home and made my own breakfast.  Won't go back.  Sick and tired of restaurants in the North Hills serving swill and not being held accountable!  I'll stick to traveling to the city for a good meal!"}
{"text":"We come to IHOP every other weekend with the kids. Over the holidays, we got busy and didn't make it in. This morning, we got back into our routine. Our favorite server, Sean, remembered us right away. He greeted us and asked about our holiday. When we ordered- he remembered that one of my girls uses sugar free syrup because she has Type 1 Diabetes. Hearing that he remembered, gave her a smile from ear to ear! It's not often that a server at a restaurant can make a child (or a whole family) feel so special. Thanks for all you do, Sean. You're making a difference in our world! xo"}
{"text":"I ordered a turkey sandwich here and it was delicious! Great service too! We had a coupon and they were really helpful."}
{"text":"After a rough day at work remodeling a home, my family and I want to eat at Ihop. I have to say that Taylor our server was amazing. He was on top of the service the minute we walked in the door. Our drinks were always filled and he gave us an amazing service. The service was so great that it became a topic at the dinner table. One of the things that our family said  was that we would wish that our services at other restaurants were as amazing as the one Taylor provided for us. Thank you Taylor for a great service on such a hard day, you sure made us appreciate it."}
{"text":"I have time to write since it took 45 minutes to get my food.   Why would soup take 35 minutes?  And then be runny.   My daughter made me come but next time I'll put my foot down.   No more IHOP  for me."}
{"text":"Horribly horribly slow and understaffed. 
Possibly it's just this specific time but some of the other reviews indicate it's a historical problem."}
{"text":"A great to come for a quick breakfast but fill you up quickly. I especially love The cup cake pancakes breakfast. This visit amazing because they knew I bacon crisp. I will definitely would like to come back soon for another breakfast."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast this morning....waiting to be served and in walks a lady with a dog......she was not trying to hide him.....was carrying him on a blanket    Showing him off in the waiting area while they were putting tables together for a large crowd.     Wait staff were aware of his presence.  No one said anything.  No service vest on dog...he was clearly a lap pet .....first thing he did when she sat down was reach out and lick the table!      How many health code regulations are being violated here?  Service was below par..... numerous wait staff walking around in red shirts yet we had a long wait to have our order taken, then another long wait  to be served...when food arrived it was cold...  on top of that, we had to ask for refills on drinks every time.    Server asked if I needed a box turned and walked away before asking anyone else in our party if they needed box, which they did, so she had to make another trip... manager did come over as we were leaving.  He was nice listened to our story.  But too late"}
{"text":"only giving this place one star due to the kitchen staff waitress and hostess were good. took almost an hour to get our food. never coming here again."}
{"text":"First and LAST time and get this I live 2 minutes away!  Use to be my favorite breakfast spot and I'm not even a breakfast person.  What happened to customer service??  Uuugghhh!! Our server Stacy was very nonchalant.  He was not happy about his,job today at all.  Though today is free short stalk pancake day, you all do know some of us actually planned to eat more than the free pancakes.  These people don't even know the ingredients for items on the menu.  How do you bring potatoes without the peppers and onions and ask me what's wrong with it when YOUR menu states potatoes are served with red and green peppers with onions.  All of this is going back overit.com.  I'll stick to Denny's with my wife going forward."}
{"text":"We just went there to eat for lunch for our 1 year  anniversary, 30 minutes after being seated we were still awaiting a server to take our drink orders. 30 minute wait for drinks which we never got to order. After getting so inpatient with the bad service we ended up leaving."}
{"text":"I think this place is under new management.  I think there is a new manager.  The former manager was a bit obnoxious and non-responsive.  
Have had great service of late which used to be an issue. Kyle was our server during our last visit and he was great!   
The place was redecorated and looks really good.  
I like the place. 
Don't know why the ratings don't reflect it."}
{"text":"Well, it's 1:40 pm, so it's time for breakfast (seriously I had to go to the doctor for some blood work, and had to fast first), so here I am at IHOP. They are pushing their burgers right now so I ordered their Mega Monster. Like the other dishes I've had here, I expect it to taste as good as it looks! Onion rings are coming with it, too, and coffee! Ambrosia!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I went on Sunday afternoon. The wait to be seated was not long. It took a good while for our hostess to place our orders  and I noticed the floor was really dirty. I'm not sure if they are understaffed, but they definitely seem to be lacking in housekeeping. 

It was a little frustrating that they were out of orange juice since it is a breakfast restaurant. I had to get apple juice and it was served warm for some reason. Our food came out pretty quick and everything was good."}
{"text":"This location we find much better than the one in Homestead. Generally, this location is very good, but we have had a few times where I felt the cook did not do their best effort on an order. An example of this can be seen in my picture of my Quick 2-Egg Breakfast. The plate was dripping in oil and the serving of hash browns was minimal at best. My husband ordered a salad and it was much more visually appealing than my breakfast plate. Pictures of both are included. The service is usually on point at this location with friendly servers who bring the orders and any follow-up requests in a timely fashion. There is plenty of parking, but the wheelchair ramp is not in front of IHOP. Unfortunately, it is down in front of another business. That means a step for folks who might find that difficult. Over all, I believe three stars is what IHOP rates as it's A-OK."}
{"text":"Worst place 
For some reason only 2 employees on Saturday night what a joke and of course services with around 25/30 customer 7 tables and empty dishes on the tables place looked like hasn't been cleaned in months .. 

Understand it's Easter Eva either you closed or have enough staffing .. 
I understand this much work needs more employees but as customer and restaurant/coffee shop owner it's not customers issues you are under staffed ..."}
{"text":"Oh man just like all the other reviews the service is slow. I'm not sure if it's due to all the young employees I'm talking 17-18 years old. Food is good typical IHOP food just so slow when it comes to cooking it."}
{"text":"Called to place a to go order and was placed on hold 3 times for about 5 mins each time and by the 4th call I said fuck it. Clearly they're service is terrible."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast on a Sunday. They were real busy, so we had to wait 5-10 mins for a table NBD. 
Once sat, out order was taken promptly, the waitress was friendly, and the food came in a timely manner. No problems."}
{"text":"My favorite Ihop!

Good service and fast; also very attentive. 
When I'm out of ice coffee the waitress is already making her way over with a new glass, so I love that I don't have to bother for a refill.

Besides the great serves, the food is delicious. 

I usually get the \"pick a pancake combo,\" with blueberry pancakes and may I say, any style of pancakes from Ihop are the best. 

I would recommend their signature, buttermilk pancakes, and let you decided whether they're the best."}
{"text":"I come every Saturday for breakfast. The host always sit me very quickly they're so lovely I've had great experiences. Today I was very upset. I got sat down very quickly but my waiter Thomas W definitely treated my boyfriend and I differently from the other tables he had to take care of. He constantly checked in on his other tables especially the one in front of us. All he did was take our order give us our food and then while we were eating he gave us our receipt to check out as we were eating. I was very offended. Never once asked if we needed hot sauce or ketchup as he did for the table in front of us he constantly checked in on them. I was furious how differently Thomas was treating us. Maybe he thought since we were young we weren't going to tip him or something. I'm just very angry how differently he treated us. The host are always so lovely and kind and treat us very well they recognize us when we go in and greet us so wonderfully I've had other waiters that have treated me so well but I was extremely upset with Thomas. He never checked in on us if we needed anything just gave us our food and then our check. So rude."}
{"text":"My experience was the antithesis of Bill M.'s. They sat me immediately, took my drinks order, and gave me some alone-time with the menu. Very smooth.

My server, Courtney, was wonderful. Definitely one of the nicest waitresses I have had in Charlotte, including upscale fancypants dinner restaurants. The food was equally good. I expect you know what you are getting at IHOP, and they didn't screw up their standard fare. So that's great.

If it weren't so bad for me, I'd be back soon."}
{"text":"Crappy service: 
To begin appetizer was brought out with 3/4 meals ordered. I waited on my food while the others in party were eating.
My friend had ordered grilled chicken salad but got crispy.
We went at a time where it wasn't busy yet had to ask for syrup twice-by the time we got the syrup-the pancakes were cold. 
We had to ask each & everytime we wanted a refill.
Back to the salad, my friend wanted a side of garlic bread-which we had to request 3 times. It ended up coming with his to go box. Horrible service & the manager wasn't much better to deal with."}
{"text":"It had been several years since we had been to Ihop, as we used to go frequently... I loved their pancakes!  So the other morning we woke up earlier than normal and decided to go to breakfast.  We have a favorite breakfast place \"Sunrise Cafe\", however, for a change... we went to Ihop.  It was very early, so it was not busy.  We were kindly greeted and seated right away.  Minutes after being seated while we were looking over the menu, there was a very bad sewage odor... I looked up from my menu and saw that one of the employees had the women's restroom door open mopping the floor.  WOW... was the odor bad... I think the employee mopping saw the look of disgust on my face, as he quickly finished and shut the door.  The waiter was friendly, however his English lacked in that it was a bit difficult to communicate (us to him and him to us).  I ordered a simple omelet (cheese / bacon) and chose the pancakes in place of toast and my husband ordered the red velvet pancakes and scrambled eggs... we both ordered coffee, which was mediocre at best, and the pot of coffee left on the table barely gave us each a half cup.  The pancakes were delicious, just as I remembered, however the omelet was just okay... it was on the small side and lacked cheese and bacon... PLUS, there was no fruit, or potatoes!  The waiter did not offer us more coffee, although he did bring me a box for my leftovers and he took our dirty plates / silverware... and gave us the check.  I guess that was his way of telling us our breakfast was over!  I got up to use the restroom and gasped when I opened the door!  Mind you, I have very bad allergies and can hardly smell, however the odor of sulfur / sewage that resinated from this restroom was the worst that I have ever experienced, so strong that my lack of smell disappeard... so much that I could not go in.  Seriously, in my opinion, the health department should investigate this because my guess is that an odor as pungent as this one was, is quite toxic.  I had not yet looked at the check, but when I did as we were walking up to the cashier, I was SHOCKED!!! Almost $30.00 for hardly any food!!!  Needless to say, and after years of being loyal iHop customers, we will never go back, as the overall experience / price is definitely not worth it.  Goodbye Ihop."}
{"text":"Brought my kids here this morning and had a BOGO complimentary entrée coupon for dinner to use. The waitress was really nice and told me I could basically use the coupon on any entrée, it was basically BOGO on any entrée up to $8.00 in value, I had the steak tips with mash potatoes and corn, my Son had the chicken fried steak with broccoli and mash potatoes and my Daughter had a breakfast entrée. When the food came it was very good, tips were mixed with mushrooms and onions. I added some A1 sauce to it and couldn't believe how good it was. I was expecting mediocre, nothing much more than that but boy was I wrong. I guess that goes to say that's why the place was filled to the max upon arrival. Luckily we got a booth right away. We usually don't come here that often but the cook they got at that location right now at this period in time is on point! The restaurant is only as good as there cooks and the food I had was delicious. Thank you IHop for honoring my coupon and thank you to the waitress that treated us with respect! It was a great experience and hope to be back soon. FYI. We went Saturday  morning today. You  might want to hold on to that cook you got on at that particular time. He/She is very good!! Cheers!!"}
{"text":"I don't want to be THAT guy but it was 8 at night and no other customers but me and I have not seen the waiter since my food came, I had to beg for the bill."}
{"text":"First time here.  Ordered the 2 X 2 X 2 for two of us plus the Swedish pancakes (we were really hungry).  Poached eggs--perfect.  Substituted the buttermilk pancakes in one order with the Harvest Grain which is my favorite.   
Everything was perfect.  
Chris, a server in training, executed the order and service with perfection.  Nice going.  Wish you luck.  

The place was clean and welcoming.  Lots of parking.  
Will be back!"}
{"text":"Doesn't even deserve a star, the wait is unnecessarily long and the wait staff is not at all nice or attentive I would not recommend this location to anyone"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on our way home from Vegas.

It was okay and a hot meal and hot coffee for our long drive. Customer service was good. People behind us complained about their food being cold, but I think they may have just been snippy. The service at the counter was responsive."}
{"text":"Just got breakfast and it was the worst EVER!! I normally go to this IHOP whenever I'm craving breakfast and it's usually pretty good but today,  it was just disgusting. The bacon looked old, like it had been sitting in a pan of grease for two days. The pancakes also looked old, tasted burnt & bland. The sausage and ham were ok but my over-medium eggs & hash browns were good as usual.  Ihop needs to have a cook that actually cares about the quality of the food and the customers he's preparing it for. Looks like I have to find another breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Ok all you pancake lovers today at IHOP you get dollar pancakes !!! Yummy . Taste so good especially with their butter pecan syrup , that syrup kicks ass ! I gave this place three stars because it could be cleaner and employees could be nicer . If you go let me know what you think about the syrup . Enjoy all !"}
{"text":"We had to wait 45 minutes on a 15 minute wait. Under staffed on a day that they are having a promotion. Tables empty and lobby full with people waiting to be seated. We arrived at 4:45 pm and as we are waiting 3 employees leave. Now they are trying to rush me. Won't come back to this  one."}
{"text":"Had a late breakfast the other day, and had to try their funnel cakes... Omg, so perfect for that moment!

Hot summer day, and cool sweet strawberry funnel cake with strawberry lemonade, totally hit the right notes.... Hubby loved his warm apple cinnamon funnel cake, and I'll grant that it was tasty... Just not as perfect for summertime as chilled strawberry was ;)

Just bring a big appetite or share one of these treats, the portions are ridiculous... I was only able to eat about 1/4 of mine."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the better ones in town. Service was fast and the food was good."}
{"text":"First ever I Hop i have ever been to. Love the breakfast, steak and eggs seems a bit heavy for the morning, but I'm game. I hop in Quebec please"}
{"text":"I came here to eat with my parents and this facility was extremely shorthanded. They had one waitress waiting on everyone and seating everyone as they came through the door. They set us in the back and forgot about us. Outta sight outta mind. After sitting for about 15 minutes without drinks or having our order taken, my dad went to get the attention of the waitress, then the manager. After waiting about another 10 minutes,  the manager came out to get our drink order and food order. Once he took our order it wasn't too much longer to get our food. Once the manager left for the day, it was another task to get the bill. My dad had to go find and retrieve the bill. He came back to us saying that there wasn't a bill. We were thinking that maybe the manager took care of it because the problems we had. As we were getting ready to leave, the waitress came to us and said that there was a bill to be paid. I'm not a big fan of Ihop to begin with and with this recent experience, I will NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"Is it my imagination but doesnt toast and coffee come with breakfast???? I could of bought eggs, toast, and coffee for less than 20 bucks. Well 89 dollars later at ihop.. Im pretty much done. 2.99 for a soda. 1.99 for toast and 2.99 coffee. Highway robbery."}
{"text":"This ihop is the worst! Came here for breakfast. The booth they put us in really needed repairs. No cushion, you can feel the wood of the seats up your butt. Took forever for a waiter to come by to even offer water, then don't get me started on the wait for food. Simple scrambled eggs and hashbrowns took forever. Customers who sat in the booth next to us came in at least 20 minutes after us got their food earlier than us.  Oh boy when the order came out wrong..... I almost lost it. 

Good taste wasn't too bad but overall 1/5 stars is more than I can give"}
{"text":"Do not order online, we paid and we never received our food, their customer service is horrible, even from their manager Kim. We understood they were busy and ordering online issues, so we waited longer than estimated time given, but not a single apology or understanding of what we were going through, even after they took our order again in person we waited for another hour and still no food. It was a horrible experience."}
{"text":"From the un controllable LOUD kids, their running around, crawling under tables, to the WAY too close booths. I am honestly bummed about this place. If parents don't control their kids, staff should ask them to quite down. I wont be back, to that location at least."}
{"text":"For being a Sunday morning and on the way out of Las Vegas, I was truly surprised at how awesome and quick the service was. 

I had the crispy chicken salad and it was really good. The chicken wasnt dry and over-cooked. She brought more dressing when I asked and we all got service with a smile. They were super busy and it seems like the had it all under control."}
{"text":"This place blows.
Seriously blows. 

I know, I shouldn't expect much at IHOP. But I normally like it for cheap, greasy, fattening breakfasts, especially if I'm hungover.

Not anymore.

I went last month and, as always, ordered the migas. The eggs came, with about a pathetic three or four tortilla strips in a soup of egg, tomato and grease. All covered with an inch of USDA Grade D processed cheese. I scraped the cheese off. But that didn't solve the problem of the inch of grease on the plate. I ate about four bites.

I told the waitress that it was inedible, but she wasn't helpful. Then when I paid, the guy asked how everything was. I told him, and he grunted. Still had to pay for it, though. Why do they ask if they don't care?

IHOP, I'm done with you."}
{"text":"Horribly slow even when they're not busy, even though you called in the order 40 min ahead. Even after all that the food was not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Ihop's quality has definitely declined over the years. I remember coming here at least once a week for breakfast with my father when I was a little kid. As the years went by, their portions have become smaller and smaller while their prices have risen. It's gotten to the point where I can only order a couple things from the menu because I feel as if any other items are not worth it.

I've never had anything wrong with the taste or service. But if I'm going to be paying $10-15 for a plate of breakfast, I expect a good sized meal. I'm almost never filled when I leave this place anymore."}
{"text":"This IHop has a small wait time even when there is a line. I remember we were told it'd be a 20 minute wait, but it was actually a 8 minute wait. This IHop is also clean, and I see workers brooming and wiping down tables which is excellent. The menu here is also organized and simple. The menu has a variety of foods and also have foods for the different types of days like Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.
     The food for the most part is amazing, there is only one dish I've had an issue with. The Chicken tenders were dry and tasted very simple, and the fries were decent. The chicken tenders is something I would not recommend, but this burger that is an IHOP exclusive known as the Denver Omelette Burger is delicious. It is definitely worth its price, and also leaves you full. The Ham and Egg sandwhich is also one of my favorites and is also filling.
     IHOP offers the same fountain drinks as any other place, but they offer this drink that is an IHOP exclusive known as the Splashberry that tastes amazing and is unique. It is my go to drink, and its the drink I always order everytime I go to IHOP. It also has free refills, which makes it that much better. What also makes it better is that the waiters frequently see how things are going and try to give you what you asked for as quick as possible like ketchup, more silverware, or a refill. Overall, I've enjoyed my visits to IHOP and I will be visiting IHOP again soon."}
{"text":"It was your typical IHOP, Meal was great and Mrs Donna our server was awesome too!!!"}
{"text":"I would give them ZERO stars if I could! I will never go to this IHOP again. They advertise a burger combo that includes fries and a drink for $6.99. We were seated and given a menu but we couldn't find anything about the special. Our waitress came by and we specifically asked her about the $6.99 burger special, she said \"no one gave you the menu, great\" and went and got us the special menu. It had ALL the burgers on this special menu so we each ordered a different one. It took forever to get our meal, it finally came and it was ok but we thought for $6.99 it's fine. Well we got our bill, went up to pay and noticed we were charged full price for the burgers and for our drinks. We questioned the cashier about it and she went to ask the waitress. When she came to talk to us, she informed us that it was only one burger that was $6.99 and not the ones we ordered. We should have been told this from the start!! The menu is very misleading and the chicken s**t manager didn't even come out to talk to us.....BAD BAD customer service. I will be calling the corporate office!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"As the music pounds the crowd the camera cuts to the couple.
\"You wanna head somewhere more private?\"
She yells \"WOOOOO\" one last time and nods as the camera pulls back from the couple at the bar. We see them wade through writhing bodies.
The camera hard cuts to a bright table at IHOP with three guys nursing coffee as they wince at sounds and light.
\"where's Sean?\" on of them asks, his voice rough from yelling, cigarettes and shots. The other two shrug, but manage an envious grin.

You've seen this scene, or one just like it in every Vegas hipster movie made after the 80's. This my friends, is quite possibly that IHOP. It's on the strip, south side of town, and I've sat next to more than a few rough looking groups, in rumpled club wear, bridesmaid dresses, or wardrobe malfunctions held together with paperclips or safety pins.

Now that we've established the environment, let's look at the food and service. If you are sober, and not hung over, I'd say both are average within the range of breakfast places. If however, you are feeling fragile, heading south early one morning, or just \"ending up here\" the coffee is hot, service is fairly quiet and quick, and most of the food is simple and well suited to sit ok on all but the most heinous of hangovers."}
{"text":"I was in a party of 7 attempting to enjoy this conveniently located restaurant. We had been seated fairly quickly, but we're placed at the furthest point from the entrance. After loading the Hulu application and watching an entire episode of Rick and Morty, we realized that we had yet to be served much less acknowledged. At this point, we noticed three other tables surrounding us had already been greeted, talked to, and offered drinks. Mind you, these tables had arrived much later than we had. We felt ignored, hungry, and flat out disrespected. I would give less than one star if I could. I'm not sorry to say that this will no longer be my restaurant of choice after tonight. 


The district manager came in contact with me a couple weeks after I wrote this review. She apologized and offered to resolve the situation. She gave us some certificates and wrote a letter along with it. I appreciate the time taken to formally apologize, it isn't always that businesses take time out of their day to do this for customers. We have yet to use the certificates but still appreciate the gesture. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Back again 6/1/15. Great food, hard working people providing good service. 
I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Acknowledge within 4 minutes. Pretty cut & dry. Was seated after 2 minutes. 10 minutes later, never saw anyone . We came to eat. It's a Restaurant. Left. Not happy! Not the1st time at this location. But the last."}
{"text":"Could have been better. Service was fine, and so was the overall restaurant.  I did have a problem with the original stack. No taste. No flavor. Even loaded with syrup it couldnt help."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy IHOP quite a lot as I'm a person who loves breakfast anytime of the day. The last two times I've been to this location the service isn't great at all. I have been to this location when they've run out of menu items and aren't willing to substitute to allow you to have the same item - instead they tell you that you just have to order something completely different from the menu. The last time I was there it took forever in a three quarters empty restaurant for the server to come over and once he did he took our drink order and disappeared to the kitchen to speak to some of the young female servers. One of the supervisors had to come over to deliver our drinks and take the rest of our order and then a different server came out with our order, but by this time the food was cold and they kept having to come back with items that they \"forgot\". We had to flag someone down to ask for our ticket to pay. it was very disappointing as this location used to have great food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Good service but their food still sucks. It's just IHOP. Blah! Took my three-year-old to breakfast today for his birthday. We were sat right away and served immediately. Our food came out fast! I ordered a kids happy face pancake, coffee, chocolate milk, and the Colorado omelette with toast. My omelette was very dry and honestly not good at all. I really really want to like IHOP but I don't think I'll be coming back here again."}
{"text":"We went for dinner one night, around 8 pm. We were seated and given menus. Around 10 mins later another couple were seated by us and the same girl who sat us down and gave us menus took their drink order. Keep in mind we were there before them. Another 10 minutes later we still didn't have our drink orders in let alone our food orders. The kids were fussing and the adults were annoyed. It wasn't packed maybe less than 7 tables needed service. Safe to say we left and are never going back."}
{"text":"Awful service. Waited for almost 30 minutes. If I could rate less than 1 star I would. Waitress working night shift with dark hair. Did not serve us kept looking at us, all menus closed."}
{"text":"OMGeeeee!!! Service.... EXCELLENT!!! Meal.... EXCELLENT!!! Fluffiest pancakes ever!!! Yuuuuuummy!!! The BEST service, great people who treated us like family!! One of my top 5 best experiences since I`ve been in Vegas!! I live on the north end of town & won't go to any other I-Hop... This ones the best!!!"}
{"text":"I just got an order to go but the server was wonderful. She thought of everything including utensils and syrup. It's not the first time I have been here and I know it won't be my last"}
{"text":"Went to this I hop this morning, me and my three friends order food. And after 15 mins we get it and in my boy Billy's food on the toothpick it had hair. Then they brought my girls food it also had hair. The manager asked if there was anything she could do. My boy Brett said he had no confidence in them. Two plates one table. No way. Horrible experience never ever going back. Now I'm at jack n box.... WTF. It's hot no hair all good"}
{"text":"Been coming here to this IHOP for 6 years and thy have been for the most part good friendly service. Last 3 visits I have noticed that the staff is very disconnected with customer service. No smiles or greetings as you walk in. They keep walking past you without asking if you need something etc. 
I think management need to re-evaluate their guest service and hire mature yet outgoing staff. Tips are earned not expected. Please get this place back on track or many others that live close by will find another place for family Bfast or gatherings."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 5 years. The new staff and management are great. Always friendly and the food is served hot and in a timely manner. Good place to eat."}
{"text":"Worst service ever waited 30 mins for a seat and it wasn't busy then waited another 30 mins for our waiter to even come over and get our drinks. Then forgot some of our food and never came back to see if everything was okay. I have never had such horrible service."}
{"text":"Went to this place because it was close to where I work and I had about an hour and a half before I had to be back. Finally got seated and  about 3 and a half minutes later a waitress shows up, nice lady. She took our order and brought our drinks not exactly in that order but you get it. We waited for 30 minutes no food, so I began to look at my watch to see how much longer I could wait. Needless to say after about 10 more minutes of no food we left and went to the chinese joint around the corner, and although I had less than 20 left I was about to sit down eat an appetizer and a meal and get back in time. It takes to long to get the food, even when the place is empty, poorly managed! One of the worst ihops in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Sat and ordered and all was well. Food arrived incorrectly and even though we asked we still had no utensils. Both breakfasts were wrong but settled on 1 and 1 dish was sent back to be corrected. 
It came back again and was wrong a second time. Still had to ask for utensils. My friends food was ice cold by then. Went and got manager. She sent food to be corrected and told our server we should've had utensils before we sat. 
Food came out for the 3rd time and was wrong AGAIN! 
This is about 45 minutes later for scrambled eggs and still no utensils. We also didn't receive the condiments we asked for two times. Had to get up and get them off another table. Then I walked back to serving area and got my own utensils. 
Not only was this the WORST service we've ever had it wasn't even corrected after 3 attempts."}
{"text":"I travel all over the United States for business and visit Hop for breakfast because the food  is pretty very consistent regardless of the location. Although the food is the same in most locations,  it is the service is what makes or breaks the reputation of the restaurant.  This location in particular is consistent with outstanding service. The staff are friendly, fast and just all around wonderful.  I would put the professionalism of this staff against any restaurant in the county. I just adore these ladies. Thank you for consistent wonderful service,  you were the highlight of this trip."}
{"text":"I love IHOP Restaurants, but this location is my favorite. The consistency here is good and the place is always packed. Today my server was Maggie and she was training Shannon. They both excelled and made our monthly breakfast here very nice. 

Sometimes the food won't look like the commercials on tv or like the pictures on the menu. But, it's good food. Even though it's a busy location the majority of the staff seem to be in good cheers and somehow manages to provide good service."}
{"text":"Terrible service from the waitress and the hostess. Unfriendly, rude and/or indifferent. The food isn't good enough to put up with that. Next time: Waffle House."}
{"text":"I love IHOP and of all the places I could have gone to on my birthday in Las Vegas I came to this place and had the worst experience ever my husband and I waited for 1/2 before they even took our drink Oder mean while tables around us ( whom we were here before )were given there drinks and food  so after my husband brings it to there attention that no one has even taking out drink order they finally send someone over to bring us coffee to make a long story short we waited over an hour to get our food no refill on the coffee and when I finally speak to the manager it's still another 10 min before we got our food and the waitress wasn't even apologetic at all how rude I k ow that things happen but to pretend like it wasn't your fault or not even acknowledge that you have unhappy customers is RIDICULOUS"}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times and will continue to be loyal to this one. The staff has always been great, good food and average wait times. Nicole is usually my waitress who has given me and my family above average service but again they're all pretty good so far. I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Worst management I have ever seen I feel awful for the workers their don't plan on going back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience tonight. I will never be there again. At around 10pm, my roommate and I got there. About 3 tables had people at them and we were seated immediately. Good so far... Then it gets bad. Our server, Lydia, came and took our order... aaaand that was the last time we saw her as our server.  
My roommate had to use the restroom and when she got back she said it was disgusting. Toilet paper all over the place, two of the stalls had toilets needing to be flushed, and it stunk horribly. I decided to hold off on my potty break then. 
Nikki, the other server, came and brought us our food after an hour. (I assume with it being 10pm there was only one cook), She was going to bring us our condiments and then never came back. My roommate had to go to the kitchen and request them. Our drinks didn't get refilled for another half hour... By this time we'd been in the restaurant for at least an hour and a half.
Then we had a saving grace. Alek, the third server, came and refilled our drinks and checked in on us and make sure we were doing okay. We found out his shift had ended and he was off the clock, but noticed that just after we came in, it got busy. At the busiest time, there were about 14 tables of 2+ people. All was running around like a madman while we kept seeing our designated server off in the corner (they had the side wings blocked off and weren't seating anyone there) talking to A group of young adults-one of which we later found out was the assistant manager.
At one point, 3 tables other than us had to get up and ask for help and ask for things because Lydia/Nikki were both too busy talking to the others back in the corner to help their tables. Alek stepped up and was literally running around the 3 aisles taking care of us all. At least two other tables besides us tried to tip him, but since he was not our designated server he said he was not allowed to accept it. 
The breaking point for my roommate and I was when one of the other tables began yelling back and forth with the table where the (off duty) assistant manager, his girlfriend, and his buddies were seated. The table behind us seemed to be upset because the girlfriend kept throwing dirty looks after the few of us who tried to tip Alek began talking about the poor service and leaving Yelp reviews. One of the women at the table adamantly told the teen assistant manager to go get /his/ manager, which she had to say at least 10 times before he did. Finally an older man in a plaid shirt came out and immediately told the table they needed to leave. 
At this point we had finished our food, which was really good... But I has ordered the endless pancakes and told Nikki (not our server) I would like more as she rushed buy thirty minutes prior. So total we spent two hours in that mess of a restaurant. While the manager and assistant manager were talking to the table, Lydia brought us our check and was all smiles and \" Hope you enjoyed your meal.\" Ha.
We decided that we were never going to get out if we waited to pay. So, with exact change in hand, we went to the counter, left our receipt and the money, and walked out. Alek had also had enough it seemed and left as well. We ran into him in the parking lot and we found out that one of the girls was trying to leave early and quit taking new tables, so the other girl had to take them or no one did. It explained a lot of what was going on, but that doesnt make it okay. IHOP needs,to get their act together because if this is how the other locations are... They just lost a few customers,  cause I'm telling everyone I know.
Alek was the only member of the staff (including management) that was helpful and seemed to actually care about taking care of the customers.  He was amazing during all the chaos. IHOP doesn't deserve an employee as amazing as he is.

TL;DR / Summery
There were multiple tables that were ignored all night by the on the clock employees. We were there for over 2 hours and we barely saw our \"server\" twice. An off the clock employee stayed at least 2 hours after his shift to help out and we couldn't tip him. Customers were being given dirty looks by off-duty staff after we talked about the bad service. Management didn't seem to care about customers at all. 0/10"}
{"text":"This place sucks ! There is this woman who is friends with the waiter and is making a whole bunch of noise being loud causing problems with other tables. Second the waiters have no type of personality. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"IHop is a good place for breakfast, the food is reasonably priced and the portions are good. My only gripe is that it is always too cold in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Normally I go for a local business when enjoying the first meal of the day.  I had friends that were rolling through town from Cali to another state. I met them at this location due to it's ease of getting off the I-15.  I was impressed by the service and the food was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Wish I could comment on the food, but Monday, 11/30 at 5pm was the second time in a row that I've stopped here, waited in the lobby to be seated, and waited, and waited... and walked out.  There was no one else in the lobby, maybe two tables seated in the dining room, and plenty of servers wandering around.  This place sucks.  If egg works or whatever the name of the place down the road was open in the evenings, I wouldn't even bother trying IHOP. Unfortunately, they're not.  Still went somewhere else."}
{"text":"This location is the nearest to me. Never again. I came here for a birthday breakfast and received terrible service. Then the food arrived and everything was super salted as if the cooks were trying to kill the spoilage of the food."}
{"text":"Can't get no service here. Food was served late. Plus she didn't even bringg us silverware.  They expect you to eat with your hands here. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"The food here is ok. The serving sizes were kinda small, we were hungry again a couple hours later. Service was good. Denny's is a better fit if you are hungry for breakfast fare."}
{"text":"Love their steak. Good customers service and the place is clean."}
{"text":"I don't think the owners will care as long as they are making money but this place has a giant bug zapper over the register when you walk in . No hostess or greeting, I got a wave from a waiter  . The restroom was unclean and has a sewer gas leak. It will only stay contained in the restroom for so long  . This was on a wed. At 9am , very few customers . New poorly trained wait staff with no supervision giving them direction . No drink refill , pancakes forgotten . Give the young staff training and supervision . This place goes on my no fly list as does village inn across the street ."}
{"text":"This particular establishment seems newer. Service was just okay, pretty long wait for service but that's understandable considering the place was crazy busy. Our server however was very sweet and funny. Atmosphere was pretty noisy on a Sunday morning, but as-is most breakfast places. They actually have pictures in their menu now, which I don't remember since my last visit to one years ago. One thing I do miss is their corned beef hash. It looks like they yanked it from their menu, booo!"}
{"text":"If only I could give this piece of shit location no stars at all. Every time I come here I get raw eggs!! If you can't cook an egg get a new job. Wtf it's not that hard. And then wanna still charge me $8 for the 1 piece of bread (toast) they brought me. Are you fucking kidding me? $8 for a piece of toast and raw eggs and undercooked bacon I couldn't even eat. Then wait till we are done eating to bring drinks to us there are 100 servers but so overwhelmed with the 3 tables u actually have. Maybe get a new job since you aren't cut out for serving."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here but today, it wasn't even packed and my food was luke warm, the floors were filthy and it took forever to get our food. So disappointed:( no sight of management. Server was very nice and very professional and apologetic but I don't think I'll be coming back. Needs some major cleaning!"}
{"text":"I live across the street from this particular IHOP and always enjoy myself. If you are looking for anything extraordinary about this location, I will just tell you it is the same as the others. I would argue that service at this location is very good and the probably primary reason I visit (and it's across the street, remember?)."}
{"text":"Haven't event gotten my food yet and I'm BLOWN away! This is coming from a JOHNSON AND WALES GRAD!!! Outstanding service Patrick"}
{"text":"it's been a while since i'd been to the iHop on Brookpark Rd. while not the worst experience ever, it wasn't very good. 

i ordered the country fried steak breakfast (which came with with eggs, hashbrowns and 2 pancakes). Danielle had the strawberries and cream crepes (with eggs, hasbrowns and bacon). her bacon wasn't very crisp, in fact it was pretty undercooked from what i saw. she also didn't realize the strawberry topping was a pie filling and didn't care for the strawberries. eggs on both our plates were not cooked. we got them scrambled in hopes of avoiding uncooked eggs. so much for that. i mixed mine up in the hashbrowns which helped a little. Danielle didn't eat hers. lastly, our server never bothered to check in with us till we were finished eating. 

i'm sure i'll be back at some point, but i'm in no hurry."}
{"text":"This IHOP was super yummy.  Server ALAN was amazing to us... Really pleasant.... Got everything we needed lickety split... Not a single issue.  Just all around a great visit.  Will come back!!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here for the last 4 weeks after church on Sunday.  Favorite breakfast egg white omelette with additional broccoli served with harvest nut pancakes.  Yum!  THE PNLY COMPLAINT IS:   THE URINAL IN THE MENS ROOM Hs been out of order since we've been coming.  REALLY?  Can't they get it fixed?!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service from Jayvonte. He made the whole experience worthwhile! The pancakes are just as good as always."}
{"text":"Great place to go for FREE Pancake (Shrove Tuesday) Day. Took my staff there for the free short stack...Because I'm such a big spender. We shared a grand slam with our short stack and there was enough food for an army. We were so full that we all skipped lunch. There's nothing like free food and a great server. We are returning to the $1 short stack March 17th (but you have to wear green). Pancakes were fluffy and moist. The variety of syrups were a plus but I prefer the traditional maple. They did a great job for the demand. The wait was only 15 minutes for free pancakes."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday with a party of 6. It was super packed. They seated a family of 10 first and they came in 15 minutes after us. Her excuse was because they only had one server back there. The food took forever to come out and was expensive for the quality. I'll never come back to an IHOP again. I'll stick to mom&pop restaurants. SUPPORT LOCAL!"}
{"text":"Si vous êtes aux US vous devez tester IHOP.

En revanche les locaux vous diront de ne pas y aller pour autre chose que le petit-déjeuner/brunch, car la carte assez inadaptée pour les autres repas. 

Les pancakes sont bons, les prix sont raisonnables, et il y a plein de sirops d'érable différents à tester. Vous pouvez demander des oeufs (au plat, brouillés, en omelette...) du bacon, des saucisse... chose rare, ils proposent dans les pages \"55+\" des portions plus petites (ça change des autres restos).

Moins bon et original qu'un Diner des 50's comme on en voit souvent aux US, mais pas cher et peu d'attente même les jours de grande affluence."}
{"text":"I came to grab a bite to eat here at around midnight.  I was seated as soon as I walked in and the waitress was nice.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger medium, as I didn't realize the burger patty was comparable in size to a fast food joint.  No way you can cook those patties anything but well.  Kind of disappointing, but I still ate it.  The fries and onion rings I got with it were great!  The waitress made a slight mistake on my drink but I brought it to her attention and it was quickly corrected.   Awesome customer service.   Steer clear from the burgers!"}
{"text":"came here for breakfast on saturday morning.  It was busy but we were seated quickly.  Waited about 10 minutes for the waitress to see us, and then waited some more for the really bad coffe to come.  Food was ok.  Coffee is not worth the $2.19 each that you pay for it.  Waitress was condescending and snooty.  Technically polite, but you could tell her heart was not in it.
Not sure if we would go back......."}
{"text":"I call it \"Bassett Street Brunch Club West\" only it's actually way better and fairly priced than that place. Pay, tip well, and relax and read a book!"}
{"text":"The one star was for the crepe I had that was good. The lack of stars is for the super filthy floor and tables that rarely were bussed. We almost walked out because there was so much filth all the way from when we walked and so much under our table. Chicken, forks, tops to stuff, forks, sugar packet garbage.... our waiter nicely swept under our table when I showed him how gross it was. Management... please figure out how to get things clean..,"}
{"text":"I'm not a yelper but I really feel like this Ihop location deserves some good words.

My fiancé and I just moved to Peoria and have not experienced good service since we moved here. We went to Ihop craving pancakes and okay breakfast food. It was either Ihop or Waffle House so we weren't really expecting anything gourmet.

We received the best service as soon as we walked in to the second we walked out. Working many years in the food industry, I understand the ups and downs of the daily restaurant life. It's not easy to keep a great attitude but the manager on duty was super upbeat, positive, and constantly moving and making sure not just the customers were happy but her employees were happy during their Sunday morning rush. 

This is proof that no matter where you go, McDonald's drive thru or a 5 star restaurant with a James Beard executive chef on board, it comes down to a great leader to manage a team to create a great experience.

Thank you team Ihop Peoria. My fiancé and I have mad respect for y'all."}
{"text":"Another awesome visit... amazing customer service by Christina. .. Ihop is lucky to have some amazing employees... I asked about employee recognition how to submit something. . However I was told there really isn't any. .. cone on Ihop value those who keep your business going. .. who set your reputation, who are the face of your business. . The food us ok, but I come die to the service and the people who work here. ."}
{"text":"Great place to come for pancakes for under $5!! I had to come to this location for a business meeting.  They ordered a sampler and I ate some of that. The smell of it made me hungry so by the end of the meeting, I was starving! It took awhile to get the attention of a different waiter, since mine was on break. I didn't want any sides and only wanted the strawberries & cream pancakes. Delicious and filling! It was only $4.21! Will be definitely going to any IHOP when I need my pancakes fix. This is a great location and the staff pay attention to their customers!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here after a dull morning of hunting.   This place is okay for breakfast food.  I like it and will come back."}
{"text":"Never ever again! This place has gone to shit! Food is not good. Staff seem to do whatever they want, one employee even had ear buds in. So loud in the restaurant from dishes banging around, staff trying to communicate with each other."}
{"text":"Server was quick but:

Forgot about toppings on pancakes.
Forgot my side of hash browns.
Not enough utensils on table.
Cheese on omelette not done"}
{"text":"SLOW!!! Really slow service. Our server was nice but kept going missing. After waiting 50 minutes for our food, the manager finally got us our 3 dishes. We went during a not-so-busy time (about 2 pm on a Sunday), so I didn't expect everything to be so slow. We wanted our check and waited 30 minutes for the server to pass by but never saw her. We went to the register to ask for the check. Turns out that our server was out back talking on her cellphone. If I wanted to wait this long for our food, I would have gone to Friendly's instead of IHOP or ate something before going there."}
{"text":"Late breakfast today with the hubby again. Pretty decent. Ordered my usual banana foster French toast and they forgot to put the banana foster sauce TWICE.. tasted delicious after the mistakes were fixed."}
{"text":"I was craving a patty melt and they did not disappoint.  So many times the rye isn't quite toasty but they got it just right and the grilled onions were wonderful.  The fries were cooked perfectly as well.  What was really nice was that it was a \"To Go\" order and it was packed up very nicely along with small plastic cups of ketchup and a pickle spear.  I'll definitely keep them in mind when my patty melt craving hits again!"}
{"text":"No body there to seat us and then the lady at the front sighed when another employee point us out. Waitress brought me a chocolate milk that had next to no chocolate I  it.. Got my order wrong.. Then when I asked for a sobe life water (as listed on thier menu) she looked very confused and said they only had regular water.. What?"}
{"text":"This place is kinda lonely but the service was great and the food was dellliiccioouss!!!definately coming here more often"}
{"text":"Service and food was good as usual. Although I paid for extra cream on my berries and cream waffle I felt like I was given the normal amount which is why I am giving a 4 star review. The rest of my review will just be a \"bonus\" about my experience here tonight. 
A homeless man walked in demanding money from a manager, When he wasn't given any money the man started yelling saying that he will starve to death and he cursed at Obama for not being a good president. I also saw a guy with no uniform going through the money in the register. All of this in 3-5 minutes..."}
{"text":"Food is excellent... However, Dana was extremely rude to us, my wife thinks she was high or on drugs. This woman was Spacey, abrupt, and actually said \" why you want to eat with the black folks?\" I can't understand how this person has a service industry job."}
{"text":"This location is your average ihop. Service isn't anything special but what ihop is. On this particular visit I ordered the strawberry cheesecake pancakes and honestly it was mostly just regular pancake batter and if you were lucky you would get a small strawberry. I personally didn't even get a hint of cheesecake. So I wouldn't recommend that stack again. Other than that everything else was your average good food at IHOP."}
{"text":"Ordered online for pickup.  Order completely wrong.  Ordered a 4 dollar sundae.  Wasn't even a scoop of ice cream.  No whipped topping.  No cherry. Will be contacting them about this.  I have pictures.  Complete waste of money!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went late last night we were the only ones there. Waitress was very attentive and nice. The food came out about 40 minutes later. It was cold, cheese not melted, and meat unseasoned (just gray unseasoned meat). It was the first time my kid didn't eat his cheeseburger at a restaurant and he's 8. I don't know how we were the only ones there and the food comes out cold."}
{"text":"This is by far the best IHOP I have been to.

First of all, there were many people working, though it was pretty early on a Sunday morning.  Service was friendly and quick.

Second, the food was really good.  Nothing unforgettable, but as far as basic breakfast food goes, this was delicious, especially for the price.

Third, sign up on their email list.  You get free Pancakes when you sign up, and then again on your birthday.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Nasty food. Omelette is like instant egg batter poured into a crepe, coated with a lot of butter and dripping wet. Never again."}
{"text":"My wife and I. have. eaten here sevseral. times and the service is great. The watresses and waiers are friendly and curtious. they even offer discounts for people 55+
They live up to thier reputation of being a 40 plus year old company..What more can I say. Ihop is tops."}
{"text":"I'm giving the 4 stars mostly because of the awesome service we received from Teaaron, our waitress. She was happy and friendly and interacted well with all her customers. It was a busy time of day but our food came out fairly quickly. My only complaint is that their scrambled eggs are from a mix and the consistency was inedible for me."}
{"text":"IHOP is IHOP. The food is consistent and what you would expect it to be. It's good. I always come at like 2 in the morning and the servers are always really nice. And I know working the graveyard shift probably sucks so it's cool that they're so nice. Also bathrooms are clean, which I can appreciate."}
{"text":"This is my second Sunday in a row visiting IHOP so they must be doing something right! 

I went with a group of friends for brunch, there a short wait when we arrived but for a Sunday (with the after church crowd) we definitely were not complaining. 

The place looked nice! It was super clean so I was instantly a fan! Our waitress was very kind, especially with all of our changes, special requests, exceptions and substitutions...YES my friends and I are \"those people\"... But she handled it like a pro and our orders were correct and hot when they arrived. 

I ordered the Brioche Berry French Toast as a combo which comes with eggs, choice of meat and hash browns.

When you check out my pics you need to know that I'm not a fan of wet bread. So I asked for my berries on the side. Normally it comes out smother on top, that's just my personal preference. I ordered up everything else well done (I prefer crispy hash browns and bacon). Mmmm Mmmm. 

All in all, the food and service was good. We left happy and full, I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Good but not great. Don't be in a hurry at Central Ave IHOP because quick service is a thing of the past.

I didn't feel the staff is properly trained to multi task. The managers are young kids training young kids. They have no idea how a pancake house could serve food back in the A Frame days. The idea to Get em in and get em out and make good tips while doing it seems to be forgotten in the manager's iPhone disorder.
The menu boasts unlimited fries and drinks to go with quality burgers but our server kept us waiting for things what seemed like forever.  The staff is friendly and polite but believe they have never seen their jobs done right."}
{"text":"Consistent food and service.  The new red velvet pancakes were surprisingly better then anticipated."}
{"text":"Service was on point. Place was very clean and food come out at a good time. We will come here a lot in the future for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was horrible not cooked well the restrooms were dirty don't waste you time and money"}
{"text":"This is just a review on customer service, because we ended up giving up and not 
eating there.

We were a group of 10 wanting to eat a late Sunday breakfast around 11:00.  They said there would be about a 15- or 20-minute wait.  Well, it's Sunday and we did have a group of 10, so we figured we would have to wait.  So we stood around and waited.

Around 11:25, we checked again.  It will be about 15 or 20 minutes.  What?  That's what you said 15 or 20 minutes ago.

The manager was sorry, but the place where they could seat 10 people was just finishing up, and he could have us in in about 10 mins.  We looked over there and it seemed that they just got their food, so we left.

When someone asks how long a wait it will be, just be honest.  45 minutes is a long time to wait (especially for a Denny's), but if we know that's what it is up front, we can decide.

We ended up going across the street to Jason's Deli.  Great choice, so the morning wasn't a total loss."}
{"text":"This has been the nicest location we have visited of IHOPs. Normally for the birthday meal they just offer the fruity pancakes but they allowed me to get the double chocolate chip pancakes instead, I barely managed to finish them since they were so good. The staff are very helpful, will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a night out at Ghostbar. Our server was extremely friendly and quick. 

She took the time to chat with us and ask where we're from. We ended up being from the same area so we talked about that for a while.

Food was good, space was clean.

Good experience!"}
{"text":"What a bust, took an hour for the food to come out, pancakes were cold and bugs were on the table and in our drinks. The poor waitress looked so stressed and the restaurant was understaffed."}
{"text":"The service here is HORRIBLE! The food is barely Meh! Wait time is Horrible! They are slow in waiting on you. Not checked on at all. Table weren't cleaned off. Waited 15 minutes for silverware. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"}
{"text":"Waited almost 40 minutes for food. Food came out cold, like it was in the refrigerator. Asked for no tomatoes in both meals, both came with tomatoes. Physically watched waitress touch 2 stacks of pancakes, with bare hands, right after she had wiped a table down. Needless to say, we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Avoid!  Food good.   Service is beyond poor.  Sat at the table for 30 minutes to get food.  20 minutes to get check."}
{"text":"IHOP was great ! I had a a large order for pick up Angie patiently took my order and went over everything exactly how I ordered it"}
{"text":"Waited over an hour to get a simple meal.  Talked to manager who said he didn't understand what happen. Clueless staff. Clueless manager. Clueless server . Pathetic overall. The icing on the cake was the wrong meal after an hour wait!"}
{"text":"While vacationing in Vegas, we decided to come here for our last meal before making the 12 hour journey back home.

It was Christmas day, and Ihop was very very packed.. we waited for 20 mins to be seated. Ok, understandable. 

What was not understandable was we had to wait another 10 mins to even get greeted. Someone came to our table and said, \" what would you guys like to drink?\" 
We politely answered \"water\" and let him know we were ready to order. He said, \"Well I'm actually off work and just helping [insert name here]. She's the one that will be taking your order.\" Okay, whatever.. 

Another 5 minute wait, and [insert name here arrives]. She takes our order, and we're good.. or so I thought.

Chris points out that none of the tables in our section have their food. Red Flag.. we really should have left right there and then. They were here first and that meant they would get served first before us.

Needless to say, the guy that was off work already helped our server, thus making it a somewhat faster process. We did get free oj, compliments from our server, which was nice. Food was good. We quickly ate our food and headed back to our hotel room. Just in time for check-out. 

Since we did go during a busy period, I do not know if this is how slow it usually is. I did read other reviews, and apparently they are slow. Only suggestion/ tip I would give is, do not come here if you are on a time crunch. You will probably be late to your appointment"}
{"text":"IHOP seems to be one of the go to places for us when we are looking for something cheap for dinner. The kids think having breakfast for dinner is the coolest thing ever (they eat free 4-10pm so that's a bonus) and IHOP is one of those places that you know what you are going to get.

This was our first time at this location. We came on Sunday, early dinner time, and it was fairly empty. There was a large party already seated, but other than that there weren't many people there.

Our server was friendly, and when our food took longer than normal (because of the huge party ahead of us and only one cook) she was super apologetic and even gave the kids free yogurt and didn't charge for the kid drinks.

I ordered the patty melt...weird choice in a breakfast joint but it sounded good. I don't like rye so I asked for sourdough. I wish I was told that the burger didn't fit the shape of the bread. Little patty, huge pieces of bread. The onion rings were good and hot. The fries weren't great. My husband got your normal two egg breakfast. One daughter got the Rooty Jr but didn't like the pancake, the other daughter got the chicken strips with fruit. Our server threw in an extra chicken strip and my daughter ate all of them but hardly touched the fruit (I don't blame her...it looked gross).

While we were waiting there was another server who was \"babysitting\" a little girl (probably not even 2 years old) that was running all over the place and getting in the way. You could tell the employees were annoyed. From what I'm guessing, the mom works there, in the back (bookkeeping maybe?) and had to get some work done so she stuck one of the girls not doing much with her child. Super professional (*eye roll*).

I wish I could remember our servers name because she was on top of everything, communicated well, and was all round awesome."}
{"text":"HOLIDAY PANCAKES, OH MY!!!!

What was I thinking?! I wasn't. This is what happens when you feed yourself based on a craving. Boy was I wrong to do this to myself. 

Walking in, it felt like a ghost town. No one was there to greet us and there were 2 other guests in the dining area. Oh yeah, it was also a Tuesday night (7 pm-ish). Maybe I should have went to the Chipotle nearby but they didn't have pancakes!

Our server seemed real anxious to get our order even before I had a chance to  take off my jacket and get seated. My brother ordered the chicken fried steak but she said:

SERVER:\"We're not allowed to serve that for the time being.\"
BROTHER: \"Um. Why? What happened?\"
SERVER: \"Well it didn't happen to us but there was a problem at another location. They found glass in them.\"

We should have left but we didn't. We ordered our food and waited longer than we should have for diner food.

It was just as I expected, crap diner food. The International House of Pancakes has failed me. I no longer enjoy this home of the fruity tooty fresh and fruity. It has become a grease pit."}
{"text":"Not a good location to go at night, I don't know if is the lack of experience for the staff, but the food was raw, uncooked ..."}
{"text":"I was so happy when I heard that this location had opened. We patiently waited a few months for all of the hype to die down and for all the kinks of opening a new restaurant to be gone before we went. 

So Tamika and I went on a weekday around 8am. We were seated immediately and ordered our drinks. A couple minutes later our drinks came. We then ordered our food. I got steak and hash browns with a stack of pancakes. Tamika got some type of breakfast platter with pancakes, eggs and corn beef hash. My steak tasted like liver but the hash browns were tasty and the pancakes were delicious! Tamika liked her platter but ,had to repeatedly remind the server to bring her corn beef hash. It was gross once she got it! It looked like it came out of a can! 

The service sucked. Our waitress had really crappy attitude! Once we got our food our waitress vanished off the face of the earth for at least a half an hour. 

What I don't get is by 8:45 there were about 20 to 30 people waiting to be seated and they had a whole empty section but wouldn't seat anyone there. WTH? It's like when you wait in a long line to get into a club and when you finally get inside there's only 5 people in the whole club. 

I had to constantly ask for a refill on my OJ and Tamika's coffee. I love IHOP and have been to quite a few in different states but this location was a complete disappointment. I would have been much happier at Pamela's or even the Original Pancake House! 

Insider tip: Get here between 8 and 8:30 to avoid the morning rush."}
{"text":"This place works like clockwork! The service staff is fast and efficient. The day was v=y busy but everyone was really fast and courteous. The food was a little on the lukewarm side but it was ok. Our server stayed to chat with us for a while. And we checked out fine. The building is outdated BUT the fact there are FOUR stalls in the ladies room made up for any negative thoughts I had....which I chose to forget. Thanks IHOP * HI-5*"}
{"text":"I was really pleased with our most recent trip to iHop. The service was a little lackluster in that the server was having a particularly loud conversation with another guest. 

Red Velvet Pancakes were really good and left me wanting more. I seriously considered ordering more, but didn't want my company to wait around on me just so I could hog on more cakes."}
{"text":"Am only giving one star because I have to and because they Gave me a 20% Discount . I was a party of 11 . Thank god all 25 of us didn't all go but it was a party of 11. Slow service. Waiters don't even check up on you . Plus other waiters are not even helpful either. Just to get our order 30 minutes and that's just the drinks . Coffees and to get food 30 more minutes . How hard can it be to make omelets and pancakes . I know theirs people so at least inform us on how much longer it will take . Nothing . My waiter Hidding from me . I have to flag her down when I see her . And that was only 1 time . Finally I was getting frustrated and the manager saw me . I told her I was not happy on poor service and slow service she offered a discount so good for her  but am still writing this. Avoid coming here then the waiters just talk between them when I told the manager. Looking at me and saying things. Really I care less what they say . I just wanted some good service and some pancakes but guess this ihop location can't get this done . Never coming back to this location. I did leave 5 dollar tip just because when manager told waiter she miraclously became a good waiter . Attentive and everything . So she gets 5 .but overall expierence this place is trash . Never ever ever xoming back my family saw me get upset which is not ok . !!!!!!! Dissapointed on u ihop !"}
{"text":"There not much to say, bad service , very slow service and  food don't taste good not once but the last three time . My girlfriend said she wanted to try it again so we went once again :-( boy was that the wrong place to go . Not again to many waitresses & waittor working., everyone running around but service not getting done! !  I can go to a restaurant with 2 servers and lots of customers and still get faster and better (hot) food.. bad management thinking! !!"}
{"text":"Great as ever the food and the people are wonderful. Never wait long to sit or order. Bonnie our waitress was on top of everything and kept us well taken care of. Ole"}
{"text":"A delicious cheap, pancake breakfast complete with artificial syrups......... a sweet memory from my childhood!  Actually, the banana macadamia nut pancakes topped with butter rum sauce are pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"I hate this location! We were starving & I'm always into having breakfast for dinner. With that said we arrived & I was craving crepes! I ended up ordering the steak tips with onions & mushrooms with of course a side of German crepes & my man ordered a t bone steak with eggs, hash browns & pancakes. When our food came we requested ketchup & steak sauce. This is where everything went downhill. With our food in front of us we were told they are out of all steak sauces. After a shitty day at work you might as well tell me that you're also out of bacon or crepes! 
We didn't want these steaks without sauce, we all know IHOP cuts need sauce! So without the waiter caring we ate everything but the meat & took it home to stop at the grocery store to buy some A1 since of course we didn't have anything at home. I ended up heating our shit up & that summed up the night. 
Dear IHOP waiters, tell your guests there's no steak sauce if they order a steak at your place! Please...
We would have changed our orders had we known & I can't imagine a good reason to not have steak sauce, how about a manager make a trip to SAMs or Costco?!?!?!?"}
{"text":"Great service and Delicious Food! I wish I could remember our waitresses name, I believe it started with an A, like Anah something like that. With that being said, she was great, extremely friendly, quickly took our order. She was on top of the kitchen, and thanks to the cooks because our breakfast was delicious."}
{"text":"Pretty typical IHOP. Food isn't amazing but it's edible. Its open 24 hrs and very conveniently located with lots of parking. I primarily frequent this place because of servers Roxanne and Tiffany. They're amazing!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast restaurant! The chicken florentine is really good as well as the colorado omlet. Sandy an excellent waitress is very friendly and thorough please ask for her and leave a generous tip!"}
{"text":"Waited  1/2 hour for service on Friday . No body came so left guess they have a problem with some black people"}
{"text":"It's IHOP, breakfast food fast and cheap...open 24 hours a day how can youo wrong?!?

I chose the Colorado omelet which really is a meat lovers dream! It's loaded with ham, bacon, sausage and pot roast! It comes with salsa on the side which adds a very nice flavor! 

My food came out hot, and prepared just the way I ordered, these omelets are pretty big so be prepared to take half of it home! 

The pancakes were fluffy and hot...I always ask for the hot syrup to go with them! 

Just a note....Parking is horrible...the lot is always full! Other than that it was a good meal at a good price, so you will see me again IHOP!!!"}
{"text":"Too bad I cannot give a zero.  A group of us went here on a Tuesday night several times.  Sometimes we got good service but we noticed the last 2-3 times, service going downhill.  Well we will not be back EVER.  Last time, the place basically empty, there were 2 other tables of people and 3 servers.  We had a group of 12 in the far back.  2 people never got their food.  The waiter never came back to check on us or even re-fill water glasses.  We had to track down the manager to complain about 2 people not getting food and basically beg for our checks so we could leave.  Manager said it was the cook's fault.  No, if the waiter had come back to check on us he would have seen 2 people didn't get food.  Then manager tried to blame us for not getting food.  Really?"}
{"text":"Came here last night for a midnight meal with the hub. The food was as expected, that's why we came. The waitress Gabby was so lovely, sweetest waitress I've had in a very long time. The place was clean, not too crowded. The cook did mess up our food by forgetting an added on ingredient, but it was made again quickly. Other than that, it was a relaxing time with good breakfast food."}
{"text":"This location has had good service and delicious food every time I have been! I have been (about 3-4 times in the last 6months). My favorite is the Strawberries and Cream crepes with hash browns, bacon, and scrambled eggs. They also have chicken and waffles and right now they are also doing their endless pancakes promotion, for a limited time. The servers we've had have all been attentive and, they bring us new drinks before the drinks we have are fully empty. I will definitely come back here again"}
{"text":"They sit us quick but it took 45 minutes before anyone even acknowledge that our food order had not came to our table. Terrible service, Terrible all the way around!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was awesome today. Service was great, our waiter was super friendly and attentive. The pancakes were just stupid good, lol, I usually don't polish off the 2 pancakes but today I made an exception. Yum! Other staff was also friendly, a manager stopped by to ask us how our meal was and another sever thanked us for coming in and verbalized he appreciated us coming in today as we were leaving. Thanks for a delicious breakfast!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast. Pancakes are ridiculously amazing. Omelettes are perfect size and full of my favorite toppings. Kiddos loved their meals and the patio was perfect weather to enjoy my Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Usually I get a very good experience at this location. I went in today on Mother's Day which yes, is one of their busiest days of the year, and from when we first entered the host, Kimberly, had quite a bit of attitude. I was observing while we were waiting and she had this attitude with nearly every party that walked in. Yes it's busy, it's going to be busy so I expected the host to have a lot better customer service towards everyone. Very upset with her quality of service. I work in the food industry as well and I understand the overwhelming stress of working these holidays but don't take that out on the customers because that changes their perception business. Definitely won't be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"The first time I went to this particular IHOP I went with my daughter and everything was perfect! I got a parking space right near the door. We were seated immediately. The pancakes were FREAKING EPIC! The food was fast, hot and delicious and the service was great. We had an older lady as our waitress and she really took care of us! I don't know how she did it as the place was completely packed. My cup of orange juice never went below half full. I am really anal about that! She even gave us full to go cups of what we were drinking! Needless to say I left her a tip that was bigger than the cost of our meals as her service was that good! 

The second time my wife went along as well and it was a totally differant experience. Over 45 minutes to get a table. Service was awful! Our waitress was a young girl in her late teens that just couldn't be bothered. I had to track her down just to ask for a refill and some extra napkins. The food was rushed and didn't taste nearly as good as it did the previous time. 

Now I love IHOP and have been to quite a few in different states but I will most likely never go to this location again as it is just too far to drive for crappy food and service! 

Insider Tip: A IHOP is currently being built in Squirrel Hill next to Hokkaido Seafood Buffet! It should be opening very soon!"}
{"text":"Overall a pretty decent IHOP.

We were in the area yesterday and decided to give this new location a try. Once we walked in we were greeted, immediately seated and handed our menus then nothing for over 20 minutes! No waiter/ waitress, nothing!

A very nice waiter walked by and saw the disgust on our faces and asked had we be waited on and we told him no and that we been seating there for over 20 minutes. He repeatedly apologized and asked us what we wanted to drink. Not even a minute later he was back with our drinks and took our orders. He then told us that he had let the manager know what happend and that our entire meal was free. 

My wife and I had the red velvet pancake combo that comes with three sausage links, three pieces of bacon, hash browns and eggs and our daughter had a kids chocolate chip pancake and sausage. All of our food was excellent but, the highlight of the meal was the red velvet pancakes! Run don't walk to IHOP to try them!

While we were eating the manager came over and apologized for the mishap and told us our meals would be free and that he hopes we will come back and give them another try. 

The fact that our waiter's shift was over but, he stayed to wait on us after no one else did still has me blown away! Now that is customer service done right! Our waiter was great and the food was even better. We will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"After 40 minutes of waiting I still didn't have any pancakes! How hard is it to make 3 pancakes?! Worst service ever!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Felicia is super attentive and efficient makes for a very pleasant experience. Of course we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for teacher appreciation day. They offered a free meal to teachers, which was super generous! We were able to order anything off the menu - score! Our waitress was the nicest lady. Food came out as expected. Would come again!"}
{"text":"Service staff was friendly, though a little slow. Pretty busy for a Wednesday late morning. 
Food was your standard iHop fare. I appreciate being able to sub egg whites and fruit for a bit of a healthier start. Overall positive experience."}
{"text":"I'm very amazed how great this place is kept and how friendly the staff is! They didn't have a certain sauce for one of the crepes but they improvised and it made me happy :)"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. Waiters and cashiers on the phone, while customers stand around waiting for service. This IHOP probably has the worst food, and the establishment is dirty. Maybe their poor service is due to the high volume of tourists. I'm a local, third time here and last. Hope management sees this. I was here at 800am."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and the interior of the restaurant is spotless. Appreciate this area as they are working on building it up."}
{"text":"Cheryl was our waitress. Extremely friendly and helped us with our order. We have to eat super healthy and clean and she was great in making sure that happened ;)"}
{"text":"I don't know how this IHOP is not rated 5 stars? Me and a couple of coworkers went after work. We work nights , so we ordered around 4 and we all went nuts!  I ordered the chopped steak, eggs and hash brown's with a side of cheesecake pancakes. The steak was so tender , with a very good flavor sauce. And the cheesecake stack! Say no more!!"}
{"text":"This IHOP is in a very good location as it is right outside of Nellis Air Force Base. We were in Vegas for the week and went to just check out the base on our way to the Hoover Dam and decided to stop here for breakfast. 

The food was ok, I ordered the split decision which I ordered most of the time I visit an IHOP. My French toast was a little soggy and the butter from it was melted and got all over my eggs. My husband got the Belgium waffle which he didn't eat because he asked if they used a buttermilk batter to make the waffle and the server said no which another employee latter confirmed that the do use the buttermilk batter.

The restaurant was very clean and over all our server was nice, I Just which she had went to ask about the waffle batter for my husband instead of just saying no."}
{"text":"It really sucks you sit down have a cup of coffee and no slice of pie this is billshit man it sucks ass fuck this place."}
{"text":"The place looked crowded when we walked but we were told the wait was only 10 minutes, and that's exactly what it was. We were seated promptly at a clean table. 

We ordered coffee and we got that really fast, it was very much needed. We asked to have our orange juice brought with out food and were kindly obliged. 

I ordered the big steak omelette - 13.49 and it was bigger than when I usually get. Guess everything is bigger in Vegas. My wife had the florentine crepes and they were larger than usual as well. I'm not a fan of hollandaise sauce but it is pretty good. 

Oh I almost forgot, the side of buttermilk pancakes. They were really fluffy to the touch, but they didn't melt in your mouth, even with syrup. Guess it wasn't a totally let down, but I would have liked them to melt like usual. 

Service was very good. Our waitress was quite attentive without being over bearing. She was good making our visit a pleasant one."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying I love IHOP always been a fan of this place and have never had a negative experience however Saturday 2/4/17 was poor customer service management clearly is not present to what's going on because a lot of the reviews are similar to my experience I went in at 845AM got menu standard coffee pot (already at table) and the hostess bought our silverware to the table once she left we never saw a server after that  now I will say I saw 3 servers standing around that could have done something but again management is clearly not visible directing the staff to where they need to be so stay with me because now I'm sitting at the table in clear view of all servers and they have to pass our table before they move on it's now 9:19 and still no one so we quietly get up ask for help and guests that came in after us were served so the girl I asked was polite but obviously was not paying attention so we leave I will also be letting corporate know about my experience because this seems to be an ongoing problem"}
{"text":"Sloooooow!!!!!! 

My goodness?!? How do they stay in business?! 

Here's the scenario: 

My coworkers and I walked in group a group lunch around noon. We found parking right away and there was no one waiting in the lobby. This should be a quick lunch....right?! 

Wrong. 

We tell the host and he says \"can you wait 10 minutes for a clean table?\"I'm sorry was there some wrong with the twenty CLEAN tables we can clearly see available?! To make matters worse three severs came and asked us if we wanted to be seated....hmmmm....so if the servers are ready to seat us.....why are we waiting again?! That's strike 1! 

We finally get to our table and our waitress takes our drink orders and disappears....when she finally reappears she has our drinks and asks if we're ready to order....hmmmm....it's been 20 minutes so I'd go with YES. I ordered the Spinach and Mushroom omelette with fruit as my side. And then the waiting game begins again.....cue the jeopardy music! We waited....and waited....and you guessed it! We waited....and finally our food arrived. And after all that time it was barely warm! But I was starving and we had to get back to work so sending it back to the kitchen wasn't an option. Ugh. At least the fruit was decent. But still that's strike 2! 

When everyone's done we get the check and go up front to pay and here's where the fun begins! We have to wait for the manager to count (out loud) the cashier's drawer, answer the phone and chit chat with the staff! Couldn't this wait?! To make matters worse he wasn't very happy about separating the checks. Yes! We still need separate checks! No! Asking us again and again won't change that! Do you want to get paid or not?! Strike 3!!!

Folks, that's three strikes and your OUT! I'm happy to take my business somewhere else. 


But seriously.....Get it together IHOP!!!"}
{"text":"It's an IHOP, my expectations aren't set unreasonably high. The kids always think it's funny to eat breakfast for dinner so we decided to stick with something safe.

Our server was friendly and attentive. When I asked if my husband and I could exchange our iced teas for something else, it wasn't a problem. It tasted like it was brewed with dirty dish water. 

The only negative experience was the manager that was on duty. We overheard her speaking to the customers sitting in the booth next to ours about how, \"normally we don't do this (some sort of substitution) but because your server said that we would then we will just this one time, but in the future we don't do it for free.\" Good job making the customer feel like the asshole. 

All in all it was fine. Not amazing, just fine."}
{"text":"Pissed of I order the same thing  every time I come here I love there toasted marshmallow hot chocolate and today of all days they all of a sudden forgot how to make hot chocolate taste like hot water in a cup when asked about the hot chocolate the waiter  brings me flavoring and  say add more very rude then we get are food cold pancakes and cold egg even my sons happy face pancake was cold I'll be going to henderson location instead of this one  for better service"}
{"text":"Came here today, a beautiful Saturday morning. Wonderful service! Food was hot and ready in no time. There was even a balloon guy walking around making kids balloon art. Very happy with this location!"}
{"text":"This is ridiculous had to ask for menus 
Had to ask for coffee
Had to ask for someone to take our order 30 minutes of just sitting"}
{"text":"Food was what I expected, but slow service. Probably last visit to this location. Previous visits were same slow experience."}
{"text":"Service was kinda slow today.  It was really busy and a holiday, so that's probably why.  I ordered the Belgian Waffle Combo.  The eggs were a little over cooked, but the waffle was very good.  The coffee was really bitter so I had to water it down a little to make it taste ok.  I wouldn't order their coffee again."}
{"text":"Me and my family LOVE the waffles but they are just a little overpriced. That would be their only flaw in my book. The servers are energetic and the food comes out fast. My daughter says the kids chicken and waffles are excellent also. The interior is a little out dated and needs an update."}
{"text":"This place is horrible the customer service stinks here its literally ran by a bunch of teenage kids who are constantly on their phones while working. Food was cold but after they re heated it up for me because i doubt they re made it for me it was just okay.. I miss the iHops in California..."}
{"text":"I went here with my daughters in December in the middle of the week. I was just getting over the flu and all I wanted was something to drink and some soup. We were seated relatively fast but no waitress came over for about 15 minutes or so. When she finally came over we ordered our drinks. I asked her what the soup of the day was. She said she didn't know but she'd be happy to go and check. We waited and waited. Not only did she never bring our drinks but she never came back at all. She left the restaurant completely. We learned this from whoever came to take our order, I  think as she was the hostess. Well, after having waited an hour all together with no food we decided to get up and eat somewhere else. I've had some other issues there but this takes the cake."}
{"text":"Their food is pretty good.  Not the best but it's consistent where you get the same quality every time."}
{"text":"Wanted some breakfast but it was past 12 so I decided to hit up IHOP. There's a ton in ny so it was familiar. First thing there was no one to greet us when we came in, red flag for me. I guess they were short staffed. The food was good kinda what I was expecting. Price was actually cheaper than I'm used to so that was nice. 3 stars cause it's a nice place to stop for breakfast all day but could be better service."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place one more time after previous bad experience. What a waste of time we were seated fairly promptly and sat for upwards of 15 minutes waiting for service before we had to leave. Completely unacceptable. The service is horrible steer clear this place you better off going to the Bell Road location. Never had a bad experience there."}
{"text":"Came here for our Valentine's Day breakfast. This is the first time we've been to this location. The interior of the restaurant is very nice and very clean. Ceilings are high and there are huge windows. Food was amazing as always and Jaime was an excellent server. Manager was very nice and applauded us on our breakfast choices. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"IHOP is the perfect place for breakfast , lunch , pretty much anytime of the day; I mean who doesnt love pancakes at 2PM? 
I ordered the pancake combo and im picky so my order was kinda specfic and alot to take in but it came out perfect! 
My server, Christian, awesome guy and hell actually conversate with you unlike servers who are \"strictly professional\" with you. 
I recommend this IHOP anytime!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend come here mostly after 10pm (since it is busier during the day) 

We had some good and bad experiences but overall I like the food. My favorite is chicken and waffles. Pancakes not that good. Sometimes cold and soggy (due to the cook putting way too much butter on top)

The waiting list during the day is crazy. Almost 1 hour to just be seated? Its even worse on a Sunday after church.

I recommend going late at night. Who doesn't like breakfast for dinner?!?"}
{"text":"My problem with this place is not the food, but with the service. Oh. My. God.

The only reason why I come to IHOP is because Vegas is sadly lacking an IKEA, and every now and again I need my Swedish fix, in this case crepes. The food is generally like any other IHOP, pretty much the only thing this place has going for it. Okay, the location somewhat near the strip must keep this place open as well.

Every time I've come here the service is horrible. The wait staff seems like they have better things to do than their job and I've truly felt like I was intruding on them for a sec until I realize that yes, I'm in a restaurant. Usually when I've come there's three, maybe four tables occupied in the place. It might as well be twenty with the lack of follow up or any other presence after serving the food. Perhaps each table should come with a bell, as I'm uncomfortable peeking my head in the kitchen or wherever their hideout is. 

Again, I only come back here for to satisfy my Swedish lingonberry fix. Nothing more."}
{"text":"It's a good quality, clean IHOP with friendly service -- what more could you ask for? This is a favorite morning stop between the airport hotel and visiting my wife's parents on the South Side. True American morning driving fuel. The food is the same consistent IHOP favorites you can expect to find across the country, with big portions and free refills. Get there early and you'll be in, out and full of pancakes in no time."}
{"text":"I only went here once. It was a good experience. They had a lot of options of pancakes and other breakfast options. A little more pricey than expected but still on the affordable side. The service is a little slow though but nothing too unbearable."}
{"text":"OMG. How many times do I need to slam my head against this wall before I learn that IHOP is not the place to go if you want to eat in less than an hour. We get in and order two omelets, nothing special and just off the menu. It is almost twenty minutes later and no food. Some things never change."}
{"text":"Once and a while we like \"Brinner\" Breakfast/Dinner and prefer Denny's, however I have not had Ihop in a while and it was close.

My sons breakfast: bacon and eggs adult meal.  

We orders over hard, only a little runny, but this came our over easy/medium.    We didn't say anything because it's hard to get right and orders scrambled eggs.  Really wet in the middle - kind of gross.  Didn't eat that.  

Still hungry and ordered toast (wheat), surprise its got nuts and grains in it - hope you don't have allergies or weak teeth!

Bacon definitely over cooked and stuck together.  Pancakes were good, but the syrup stand was definitely dirty.  (But it's nice to have flavor options).  

My breakfast: eggs and sausage with a side of fresh tomatoes.

My eggs were ordered medium but the whites were not cooked well.  My sausage was pretty good not too spicy but really tiny (I want to see how they are made I can't imagine the machine that stuffs these).  

Tomatoes, 3 slices was just enough.

Hash browns:  we both liked them, they were cooked well.

Complaint: cold coffee, ordered a fresh one but they brought the Carafe and no new fresh cup?!?  Service a little slow with only two families in the restaurant.  Waited for a while until we finally had to steal new napkins from another table.

3/5 average."}
{"text":"Stopped by this location on our way back from seeing Christmas lights 8:30 PM on a Sunday night. We were sat fast ordered drink right away, also our 3 year old mac n cheese. His food arrived in a cold out of the refrigerator. He still ate it. About 20 minutes later our sandwich and pancakes came our food was fine drinks never refilled. Amber the server came by once to check on us. We finished and WAITED. The servers were walking around asking for help. The lobby was filled with people WAITING to come in and to pay. We sat and WAITED for Togo box and check. Finally the dishwasher/ bus girl brought the box, then another WAIT and the same person dropped the check. 10:00 hopped in the car to drive home. So much for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Dirty, slow service, music so loud.  Wait staff needs a bath.

The night manager is covered in tattoos, and is shady looking.  I paid cash for fear of my card number being stolen.  Scary."}
{"text":"Our server Stephanie was excellent I do recommended to everybody but sorry Stephanie your old Phillipino cashier made us bad dinner the end & obviously got reflected to your tip.  My boyfriend went to pay at cashier using his credit card she was keep asking him if he need use calculator to figured out how much the tip will be made him feel like damn ass plus she looked at me asked my boyfriend if I was his mother.   He told her no that's my girlfriend....   She was telling him sorry her glasses is bad or something.   She just need keep her mouth shut & do what she needs to do.  Thanks for good dinner mama Sue"}
{"text":"I like IHOP but this was the worst customer service I have ever expirenced. ANYWHERE

Upon arrival I was accused of dining and dashing and the server never apologized for the false accusation. I sat at my table with my friend and we were very offended the entire meal. When speaking to the manager about the incident she backed up her server 100% leaving me, the customer feeling alienated and unappreciated.

I will never eat there again"}
{"text":"Service is mediocre, food is mediocre...I mean, I have had worse, but I don't understand how these franchises keep growing. LOL! But, I wish them the best and personally, I'll never eat at IHOP again. Just subpar."}
{"text":"We visited with a group on a work outing while we were in town. Typical IHOP experience for me. You get adequate food and service for an adequate price and hope for more exciting things to happen afterwards."}
{"text":"Steak omelette very filling, good coffee. Used a dinner coupon a couple of weeks ago --- dinner menu disappointing. Stick with breakfast."}
{"text":"Great Service from Preston... i would give it a 5* but my T-Bone was well done when  i requested Medium... preston quickly fix it without any issue..."}
{"text":"Had the crepes and was very impress with it. I've paid a lot more for worse. Customer service was good our waiter was fighting with another waitress, but good service."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible! DO NOT COME HERE! Literally three tables sat including our family of four. Four servers on shift (I counted) and it still took twenty minutes before anyone came to the table, another twenty minutes for drinks, took an hour to get our food and when we finally did it was all cold. Server did not check on us at all and we were constantly having to flag her down from behind the waitress station or wherever she disappeared to. Literally dead in this place and the service couldn't be worse. If I could give it zero stars, I would. Will never, EVER come back and I recommend no one else come here either!"}
{"text":"The menu is pretty standard fare for breakfast. The restaurant is always clean and the staff are friendly. Surprisingly I ordered the beef tips dinner and it was super tender and had a good flavor. I was pleasantly surprised. They have the best croutons here!"}
{"text":"Constantly disappointed by the experience at this location over the last 9 years. I've been there probably 10 times. There is always a dirty coffee mug, incorrectly served breakfast plates, luke warm food and dirty booths. Its close to my house and cheap for the kids to eat. The servers are always nice. Those 2 things earned it a 3 star rating. If you want a better experience we like the one on Decatur."}
{"text":"Every time we come to vegas  this is where we eat and so far they have always been polite and specially our server for the last two days (michael) and yes maybe a bit slow but if you dont mind that its a good place to eat the food its delicious!!:)"}
{"text":"Unbelievably slow. Went at dinner time on a Sunday night, table for 2, ordered \" breakfast\" food. Restaurant wasn't busy, but it took almost 30 minutes to get pancakes and eggs (and that was after waiting 10 minutes for someone to take our order). On the plus side, everything was nice and hot when it arrived. Everything tasted fine, but  that is way too slow for simple food. Waitress was friendly and good at checking on us for drink refills, so I think the problem is in the kitchen."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very unorganized and a little too relaxed.  Went there a couple of times (not my choice) and each time it is the same thing.  Never really received friendly or pleasant service.  Sometimes the other patrons can get a little rowdy, I remember one incident the police came and this was around 10pm."}
{"text":"IHOP just opened, great service even for being open for a week.  Food was as we expected and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Nice server.  Terrible food. Scrambled eggs were dark brown all over and the sausage were black and dry. Horrible."}
{"text":"I was sketchy about coming here based off the reviews but I wanted pancakes and this is close to where I live so I gave it a try. As soon as I walked in I was seated right away. A waitress came and took my drink order and then another one named Jessie came with my water and asked if I was ready to order. Placed my order and it wasn't even 15 mins and my food came out nice and hot. She brought me warm syrup too. My service was good with my waitress and I'm glad I had a better experience than what I thought. I left there full and happy."}
{"text":"Ihop is ihop. The service at this one is not great. Our waitress came by for our order and to deliver our food. And when you asked for something it seemed like it was really a big bother to her. But the food was good. The red velvet cupcakes were delicious but I think they forgot the cheddar cheese sauce on my omelet. Overall I'd comeback but don't expect anything special and remember where you're going for breakfast or brunch. It's ihop."}
{"text":"For an IHOP, the Pineville location is as good as it gets!

What do I mean \"for an IHOP\"?  It's a fast food franchise, whose claim to fame are their fast, and (fairly) inexpensive, breakfasts.  Frame your expectations accordingly, and you won't be disappointed.

We're especially fond of the night crew: (Spring, Tracy, and Tiffany); each are not only friendly and efficient, but they're funny as hell.

For as much as I might enter this location with a frown, I walk out with a smile each time, and it isn't the pancakes. It isn't that they're bad...it's just that they're standard IHOP fare.

The dining area is consistently clean; servers are great, the pancakes are pretty good, and fairly inexpensive.  This is a place for breakfast, but not much else."}
{"text":"My family (9) and I had the opportunity to scope this IHOP out for the first time Saturday morning (1/14). For a Saturday morning we were sat after a 15 minute wait, which is understandable considering our party size. We were immediately greeted by Alicia G. She was amazing from beginning to end!! Her consistency and over all serving expertise is absolutely awesome!! I would return just for her but not this location. If you're easily claustrophobic this place is not for you. The restaurant size is beyond tiny. We were literally hitting people in the booths as we walked by. It's not the managers fault at all. No one is at fault, I just don't feel comfortable here but good service all in all. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Sunday for brunch and this place was cray crayyyyy. We waited about 20 minutes to get seated for a party of 6.

Our food did take about 30 minutes to come out, but our waitress did advise us as we were being seated that the kitchen was backed up. Our orders included, an ultimate breakfast, a California scramble, a split decision, the florentine tilapia, and the bacon crusted chicken. 

We asked for the soup of day and to my disappointment, our waitress said they didn't have soup that they had ran out.. Ugh! Our California scramble was supposed to have avocado in it and it did not. When we asked about it, our waitress replied, \"We ran out of avocado.\" 

Okay.... Idk come on IHOP what's going on... Oh and the ladies bathroom smelled like wet diapers mixed with dirty socks. When we told the guy at the front about it he just shrugged his shoulders. I guess the employees sadly just gave up on this place..."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch today. Not busy, but very long wait for food. Way too much shouting and screwing around in the kitchen. Slamming of dishes. Will not be back."}
{"text":"The food is good, service is friendly and fast. They really do have delicious pancakes. The prices seem to have shot up dramatically since last time I ate here, but that kinda seems to be happening in most restaurants in las Vegas. It seems like the pancakes have gotten smaller over the years as well. I'll be back, but not as often as I used to."}
{"text":"I came here during the morning so I didn't have to deal with the excruciating wait to get serviced. 

Nothing special, anything you would expect at your typical IHOP. Even though there weren't a lot of people our waitress was still slow. And the location is a little sketchy and the interior isn't great either. So if looking for a nice place for breakfast in Vegas, try another place."}
{"text":"It was Thanksgiving morning and we wanted to meet friends for brunch. Not a lot of choices in places to eat. It seems that only Denny's or IHOP would be available on Thanksgiving . We chose IHOP. To my delightful surprise we got seated right away in a perfect table in the back in the corner where it was quiet and we could talk. I chose a \"fitness\" item. This was a omelette with egg whites, veggies, and cheese, topped with lots of diced tomatoes. I had a choice of sides. Being at the House of Pancakes, I chose a small stack of three pancakes as my side. I was absolutely delighted with my choices. The omelette was delicious and incredibly filling. In fact I was only able to eat half. The stack of pancakes did not disappoint. They had a choice of syrups. I originally tried the old fashioned syrup. But then I switched to the butter pecan syrup. That was excellent. I really enjoyed my brunch. We were not rushed and were able to sit and chat with all friends for as long as we liked. The price was ridiculously reasonable, especially since we had a coupon. A very nice choice for a Thanksgiving morning."}
{"text":"It's an IHOP. 

After our the one we wanted to stop at had a super long wait, we trekked over to this location and were seated in less than 10 minutes on a Sunday! Sweeeeet. 

Even though the place was a bit of a mad house and a bit dirty (trash on the floors, tables weren't clean) our waiter arrived pretty quickly after we sat down. I'm assuming there were a few big parties that just left....but still the presentation could have been better! 

I ordered the Chicken Fajita Omelette, Derrick ordered the Bacon Temptation Omelette and we both enjoyed them. Nothing to swoon over but they were both hot and tasty. 

Like I said before...it's IHOP you know not to expect much but this visit was A-OK."}
{"text":"Perhaps I just came in on the right day and got the right waitress but my visit with my family was excellent! 

We arrived a little after 11:30am and we were seated right away. Our waitress was Kimberly and she was phenomenal! She was funny, prompt and attentive...everything you expect when you're dining out! 

My mom and grandma went with the $4.99 specials, bacon, eggs, hash browns and pancakes. My dad and I both had the Breakfast Sampler platter. It comes with everything, ham, bacon, sausage, eggs an pancakes. 

The food arrived to our table hot. The coffee and water cups stayed filled and we left full and happy. 

Couldn't have asked for a better visit!"}
{"text":"Terribly slow service, very low quality food. Waiter came around maybe once in a 45 minute period. Groups of people left because it was taking too long"}
{"text":"Had an awesome experience this morning at this location. My wife and I stopped in for a quick breakfast and our food was fantastic! Took a little while but it was well worth the wait. The staff was enthusiastic and our server Sean was excellent on every level; super positive attitude, kind patient and fun! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Usually pretty busy but they always seat in you in a decent amount of time.  It's ihop so the food is pretty standard.  Good breakfast option for the area.  Try the iced coffee it's the only reason I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Came in around midnight on a Wednesday night
 Place was relativly empty.Our original server had just come out of training so I was patient at first. But a fter an hour of our drinks still not coming out and the original server not coming to take our food order or the other server Jacob came and asked us if we had been helped. We told him the situation. He apologized and took our orders and we got transferred over to him. The food came out a while after and then we finally got our drinks. I ordered mozzarella sticks and they were overcooked and I asked if they could be remade. He said of course with a smile and later was brought different ones. Our entire experience was changed because he was able to handle it so gracefully. Jacob was the best! He was one of 5he best servers I've ever had."}
{"text":"I would like to say that the food was good, or bad, but I was told to leave before ordering. 9:30 on a Monday and they would not serve a 2top. Apparently the carpets were so bad that they had to close early to treat them. Jesus was nice, yet unaccommodating."}
{"text":"just a normal ihop location; I asked for no butter but that didn't happen. Overall just the usual food & nevertheless tastes good + busy in the mornings"}
{"text":"First visit, 4/15/16, 0750am. I ordered a breakfast special of 4 sausages, 2 eggs, hashbrown potatoes, plus a side I never expected to order. Not seeing anything interesting on the menu I specified cinnamon french toast.

The service was fine, the dining area clean and well maintained.

The eggs arrived warmish, everything else was okay. I never touched the french toast. it was drizzled with a white creamy looking waxy sugar sauce and smelled horrid. I couldn't slid it far enough away to not be nauseating.

Plenty of parking in a private lot. The front door of the restaurant is on the wrong side of the building, facing the street, not the parking lot. If you use a walker it might be a long hike before you can be seated at a table. 

This chain adds pancake batter to their eggs making their omlettes look like they're made of yellow foam rubber so I try to avoid eating at this place, today was an exception because I had 45 minutes to kill at 8am. Just about any other breakfast chain does a better job with their food."}
{"text":"Don't come to this location when it's really busy or too late at night. I had NEVER received good service here because I always came at one of those times.. and I've been coming to this location forever. 

This all changed on Friday evening. We decided to dine in and it was around 7:30pm. We were quickly greeted by SADE and he took us over to the table. He informed us he would be our server and he took our drink orders right away. 

He brought over our drinks and told us about their special that night (unlimited fish fry) and the soup of the day. He took our orders and did check up on us a few times while we waited for our food.

We ordered:

One fish and chips
One tilapia dinner with mashed potatoes and toast
One ham and cheese melt with a tomato soup

The fish and chips was delicious and and it was perfectly crisp. The tilapia was also good and it had a good flavor. Our ham and cheese melt was served to us with fries even though we had asked for a soup.

We quickly informed Sade about the mess and he kindly said he would bring us out our soup. 

I was shocked to see the good customer service he provided as I've never seen this at this location.

Thank you Sade, the 5 stars are for you!"}
{"text":"I should have looked at the reviews before coming to this location. My husband order was fine but my wasnt. I ordered the chorizo omelette. Which i've ordered on several occasions at another location and loved it. Tonight though they forgot to add all the toppings

It literally came with burnt chorizo and peppers on top. The forgot to add the salsa, the sour cream, and the grilled pepper on the side. It looked nothing like the omelettes i've ordered in the post or the picture on the menu. 

I tired to flag down the waiter but was ignored. I got up to grab my own menu to compare the thing on my plate with the item I ordered. I finally got the waiters attention and pointed the picture out to him. He assured me that it was what I ordered. I pointed out that the salsa and sour cream where not present along with the grilled pepper (which I wouldnt have eaten anyway). He tried to claim that the salsa was absorbed into the omelette. And that they just forgot the sour cream and pepper. I had to argue with him before he went to the kitchen to get me \"more\" salsa. 

A bit later I asked for more napkins which he never brought. 

I'll drive a little further to go to my regular place. Its just so sad because this location is within walking distance of my new house."}
{"text":"This is the second IHOP in as many days with terrible service. I had to get a servers attention to get served. They acted surprised that they had customers. Two other tables were seated after me. And the first one to get served was the\"pretty girl\" that walked in 10 whole minutes after I did. What ever happened to taking pride in your job?  If you don't like where you work, go somewhere else. Needless to say, I am done with IHOP"}
{"text":"We go several times a month after church. Service is always good. I've tried the classic burger - big but only adequate. The Belgian chocolate pancakes and waffles are wonderful!"}
{"text":"I love this one because it is after all the closest one to my house... I just wish that getting a seat was faster, so alot of times we order from home and take it home to eat... That can cause a little confusion though because the register up front never seems to have change... But overall very friendly people...."}
{"text":"Just wanted to let you know that your waitress named Annette was outstanding on the day we went to dine at your restaurant on 06-11-18.
We had gotten to the restaurant around 6:30pm and she came and took our order.. with whatever was going on at the time our order was taking longer than expected. We asked a taller gentleman which appeared to be the manager on duty as to how much longer it would be for our order he just shrugged his shoulders and said it should be out shortly, 1/2 hour later our order comes and my wifes order was the wrong item.... The waitress Annette said she can have it redone but my wife did not want to wait any longer since we waited a long time as it was.... So Annette you waitress did an AWESOME customer service and said they would comp the meal, I said she didn't have to but she insisted since it was late she boxed it up to go.. you need more associates like Annette that still have the old school customer service taking care of your business like that ..... On our way out I tipped her $20 for doing what I thought was something she didn't need to do..my hats off to her .... :) thank you Richard ..."}
{"text":"I live close to this location so I pop in once in a while with my bf. We ordered over the phone for pick up this time and the person on the line did not know what they were talking about, and did not know what my order consisted of when asked. At the end of the call he did not give us an approximate time our food would be ready so we showed up 20 minutes after ordering. We ended up waiting there over an hour to receive our food without anyone checking on us or apologizing in any way. I would understand more if the restaurant was busy, but it wasn't. Customer service at this location is seriously lacking. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is a mess, since it is impossible to guess what the service will be like on any day.  As other reviews noted, the inconsitency has taken its toll:  the restaurant is rarely busy, even on weekends.  Given its prime location, one has to wonder why this place cannot get its act together. 

There have been times when an individual server has been attentive and profesional.  But too often, the servers are disinterested and inattentive.  Sometimes the food has been delivered, hot and tasty.  More often, it's cold and badly cooked. Silverware often is not set and I have actually gone searching for my own utensils on more than one occasion.   And it's questionable whether the staff knows how to properly bus a table after service.  I don't know how often a manager is on-site, since the staff seems to hide in the kitchen (rarely exiting with food), or gabbing near the register.  

I am a forgiving customer and I want to like this place. It's close to my home and the prices are reasonable.  In the final analysis, it's hard to blame anyone but the management, which does not teach basic food service skills to the young staff, nor exercise oversight of operations."}
{"text":"I have been to this IHOP a few several times and every time I leave happy. Good food awesome customer service server is always attentive. Fast with drinks, refills and anything else you need server is there for you. If you ever come to this IHOP ask for mekenzi she is awesome! And also gabbi was a wonderful server and the best part it's open 24hrs!"}
{"text":"I came to IHOP for a very casual brunch with a couple of buddies. The plan was to get something to eat and sit and talk for a long period of time. We picked the right place.
Ambiance: this is a typical IHOP restaurant lots of booths around the outside and tables in the middle. There was a small area that could be walled off if you want to have a private party. Very clean (even the Men's Room was clean).
Service: Our server, Ben, came to our table immediately. Very warm and friendly. Brought our coffees right away. Got our order correct and brought it in a timely fashion. I like their policy of leaving a pot of coffee on the table so you can refill your own without having to flag down the server for more.
Food: I was feeling daring and went for the chicken fajita omelet. A fairly large portion. Came with salsa and sour cream for the topping. Very tasty.
And despite the fact that we sat and talked for a really long time, we never felt rushed and Ben kept the coffee pot full."}
{"text":"Walk in no problem. Place was half full. Took our drink order 20 mins from time we walked in. Food order was taken 40 mins after we walked in."}
{"text":"Worst ihop i've ever been to.. The service is rubbish they were very late to bring the food and my friend order they forgot to bring it till 30 minutes later we tried to tell them to bring the order but the server was never there. Btw me and one of my friends ended up with diaria"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences that I have ever had. There were people that not only got there after our group did but they were able to order after us, get their food before us, eat and then leave before we even got our food. There were hardly anyone there tonight. Not only that but it took literally over an hour to get our food after were placed our order. Absolutely ridiculous. The service and food was terrible and the restaurant was dirty. I will never come back to this place."}
{"text":"So far so good....
Well the ham is not cured, and is tasteless, according to my fiance. The egg substitutes could have been a bit more \"egg white\" tasting and a little less \"substitute\" tasting. Overall though for a quick cheap and pseudo healthy breakfast it is doable!

It appears to be hit and miss as compared to all the other IHOPS..."}
{"text":"We have been to plenty of IHOP restaurants in the past but first visit in Vegas. We drove a bit further for this location due to the Yelp rating being slightly more decent than the ones nearby.

First, we were seated without any utensils or napkins, so when the coffee was delivered, I had nothing to stir my coffee with. 

As we were waiting for our food, I saw the bus person wiping down the table, seat, then onto wiping the next table...

My omelette looked more scrambled than omlette, and the fruit bowl looked old. The edges of the fruit pieces were rounded from being kept long after being sliced. It was NOT fresh at all! Just to test, I took a bite of honeydew melon, and I was right. Stale taste!

My husband ordered T-bone steak and eggs. He said the steak had the taste of being kept in the freezer for too long. He asked for medium and received near well done. We didn't want to be they're any longer than necessary, so we said nothing.

Not returning to this place."}
{"text":"Food came out cold. There was only one server on shift, poor guy, he was overworked. No utensils on table, server had 10+ tables all around the dining room. I had to walk to a different empty table to grab utensils.

Notified IHOP via Twitter for their sake, I sincerely feel bad for the employees that work here; they are being over-utilized and don't have the right staffing numbers to create a positive customer experience.

See the other 1-2 star reviews on Yelp recently for IHOP? It isn't just me."}
{"text":"Do not order To Go. Order was completely wrong and the cashier blamed me for it, another employee saw her error and offered to correct but we were so irritated by that time we just took our wrong order and left. Next time we will  eat in or pick another breakfast place with better customer service."}
{"text":"Best place in town. Friendly staff great service! Can't ask for more. We love this place we come here often and will continue to go. Hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"This Ihop is great! Our server Kaycee was quick efficient and a joy to have help us. If your ever in the area stop in and request her she is great!"}
{"text":"This place was great I got to eat breakfast and watch the football game! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If I could give this a 0 star I would. I came in and had the grossest meal ever. I ate the strawberry crapcakes. I had food poisoning and puked for a couple days. Horrible food, whenever I hear IHOP I cringe. Denny's is way better and doesn't give me poison for food. I just wanted a peaceful brunch with my grandma but no. Also, the water tastes stale and contaminated. IHOP, more like INOT."}
{"text":"The food is the usual IHop food.  Our waitress was nice , but the hostess in from looked like we were bothering her to eat here . Plus the service was slow...just to get our drinks.  The location was clean."}
{"text":"This has been my best visit here in a long time. This time the service was good and friendly. our food came hot and in a reasonable time. And thank the Lord they finally got my eggs right. (scrambled with cheese) All the food was on point and delicious. 
would be 4 starts, however I would like to return and make sure the improvement isn't a flook."}
{"text":"This was my second time at this location, 2nd and last.   We were so excited to see IHOP coming to our area, but so far the experience has been dismal.  There appears to be enough waitstaff, so the problems must stem from the kitchen.   If you have AN HOUR to spend awaiting your food (only to be served the wrong item), then by all means, try it.  But, from now on, we will go to Haymakers or Village Inn, both just across the street.  We just wish we had the foresight a few other patrons did, and left when they saw what was happening before we invested the time!
(As an aside, manager was apologetic and gave us a food discount, but we still had to take half our food home due to time constraints)"}
{"text":"So this review is for a pick up order. I called in at 10 and was told it would take 15 minutes for my food to be ready. 
I arrived at 10:30 and still waited 30 minutes for my food! It was so chaotic inside and ppl were getting mad for the long waits. 
I hope my food tastes good."}
{"text":"WORST TIME EVER!!! 
JUST spent 1hour WAITING for our food so when I asked what was going on they take another 10mins to tell us they lost the ticket \"but if you would like to wait we can go ahead and work on your order \" REALLY?
I've heard about bad service but this is just top of the line."}
{"text":"Our waitress seemed really bored and slightly rude. The menu smells like dead raccoon. In fact, the entire restaurant smelled like a dead rat. I got hot chocolate and it was cold. When we ordered, we ordered the crepe build your own breakfast that was on the menu, but our waitress told us it wasn't on the menu - while she was staring at the page that it was on. Our waitress knew nothing about the menu. She didn't remember who ordered what. The quality of the food was not worth sitting through the terrible service."}
{"text":"Ok. I said I would never come back to this location and here I am. My grandson wanted to come so.... I Ordered a waffle combo. Wife ordered a party melt. It was noon. Server brought out two orders but informed us at the time that they had no rye  bread. So we waited at least 7 minutes. The waffle was partially cooked. The eggs were not as requested. The meat on the melt was dry and overcooked... Gee I wonder why... Grandsons crepes were fine however. Manager visited the table after I told a server to find our server, who never stopped by to check on us prior. Mgr comp'ed us but still - that should never need to happen. Needless to say - I don't care who in my family wants to go to this  location - I'm never going back."}
{"text":"This place is always packed. Why? Am I missing something? Someone please tell me! I have only been for Breakfast and it's moderate at best. That morning I had scrambled eggs which I truly believe were a week old, turkey bacon which was grossly undercooked and pancakes which were light, fluffy and very tasty.

The service was good. Our waiter was a little shy, probably his first gig but still very nice, polite and attentive.

The opinion at the table was the pancakes ruled and everything else was unacceptable. With that said, I honestly can't see myself frequenting this place often just for pancakes. I need more to choose from. That's why I ask you to please tell me what I'm missing. Why do so many people frequent this place? Is there a secret menu I don't know about? Am I visiting at the wrong time? What? Tell me!"}
{"text":"Went here on Christmas day after church just to try it out. Food is what you'd expect, nothing special, nothing horrible. But, the service was atrociously slow... Waited 45 minutes before they took our order. Waitress was apologetic and very friendly, but maybe they were short handed because of the Holiday. Nonetheless, nothing would make me return here!"}
{"text":"This was maybe my worst experience eating out.  We arrived at 735 to bring out kids after a Halloween party At school and they were really looking forward to it. We were seated and it wasn't even busy. There was like maybe ten people in the whole place.   We were seated with only two place settings we are four people and were actually never brought more napkins or silverware.  We were brought one drink in an hour and a half! Even asked for a refill and nothing. My boyfriends food NEVER came! We needed up bringing it home in a to go box after an hour and a half. Mine came at 845 and had food I didn't order mixed in with mine like it was dirty or someone else's left overs. My pancakes looks like they came from someone else's table uneaten.  I couldn't even eat my meal because it looked so bad and messy? It was cold as mushy. The kids was fine and Kyles order never came!! We asked to speak to a manager and we were told she was too busy to speak to us but gave us half off? I was very upset you can't even make the time to speak to us?? Wth! And we were charged literally two times the amount on our bill and then it was cut in half hahaha what???!!!?  I demanded to speak to the manager she tried to blame the waitress which I didn't like, and then still never brought more napkins, silverware or drinks.  We did end up getting our meal for free but it was truly the worst and unpleasant experience I have had as our kids were sleeping at the table by the time we got out food. So upsetting and not how we wanted to spend our evening w our kids as a family. I am beyond amazed to say the least."}
{"text":"The pancake is burned and the service was too slow...O stepped out for a moment and the server is cleaning up my table, I wasn't done eating yet....."}
{"text":"This IHOP was clean and the food was as good as expected. For a chain this IHOP performed well. My grandkids loved the entire experience. Service quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Service is great, but every time I go they're understaffed. Hard to beat down on them, considering it's Scottsdale. Why work for IHOP when you can work for more lucrative businesses in the surrounding area, notably Old Town Scottsdale with a plethora of hipster restaurants to choose from?

Nevertheless, IHOP in Scottsdale does what any IHOP is expected to do. They offer classic selections of breakfast food at decent prices and they're open 24/7. Sure, the serving sizes are smaller than your mom-and-pop joints, but considering they're an international chain that is forced to standardize globally, I think they're doing alright considering.

Would I return? Yes, when all other options are exhausted."}
{"text":"tl;dr: Go to the IHOP in the university area. Always more than an hour wait for food at this Highland Creek location, no matter the time. 


I hate doing this, but I think this IHOP is understaffed and can never keep on top of things. I've been here twice and have had the same experience. I went once at night and waited almost an hour for our food to come. I went back for a Friday brunch and had the same experience. My fiance was losing patience after a fifteen minute wait for someone to take our drink order, then an hour wait for our food, but I told him to calm down it was definitely brunch time and they didn't seem to have enough wait staff. When we finally got our food, he was glad but my omelette was not cooked. The cheese and mushrooms were completely raw. I asked for a new one and it was another 30 min wait. I waited it out and it came back with three small mushroom slices. I was so excited for a brunch date with my fiance on a day when we were finally both off work, but it didn't go as planned. The ihop in the university area is a much better pick. I've always had good experiences there."}
{"text":"IHOP, how can you go wrong, new to the ASU area. Nice clean place. You can even watch sports there. Ask for Kelsea, she's awesome. Just love those pancakes with butter pecan syrup."}
{"text":"We come for breakfast almost every Sunday.  They're always busy, but they always treat us like family.  Fresh, hot and consistently good."}
{"text":"Well IHOP is IHOP so don't expect amazing food. The wait wasn't too long, service was good, they forgot a couple things but once mentioned they brought it out super quick. Dining here is super affordable. Great for kids."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this review is not for all I Hops just this one particularly.  Never go to this particular I Hop.  So Ill tell you my story.  Me and my Lady went here and soon as we walk in you get this wiff of mildew smell like their dish water has been sitting there all week.  It should smell like food not some filthy washroom (just my opinion).  So we sit down and we order pretty quickly.  We got our drinks me apple juice my lady orange juice.  When I received my apple juice there was something floating in my cup.  The waitress apologize and sent me another glass. So we ended up getting our food.  I ordered an spinache omellet with a side of strawberry pancakes,  my lady got the tilapia meal.  She had no complaints besides the mash potatoes which seemed very pasty.  I waited 15 min after she received her meal for mine.  You would think that an omellet would be quicker than her meal.  Any who, I received my omellete..  And it was cold the pancakes looked like they've been sitting out for so long.  I've had enough.  I told them to take it back and I'll pay for the drinks and her meal...  They apologized and said everything was on the house.  Two stars."}
{"text":"Wow..what can I say.we wait for almost 20 mnts after sitting only to have a glass of water, after that another 25 mnts to have our food.though the manager gave us 10% discount for our long wait.but it is not about money.it is thoughtful to give a discount for such a long wait and I appreciate that.but it was 12 o clock at night at that time and our friend had his 1 yr old baby with him and ofcourse we were terribly hungry.so sorry but I have to give u one star for ur service."}
{"text":"Bittersweet welcoming and Bittersweet breakfast. I had the country fried steak, eggs, bacon, and waffles with disgusting Frozen strawberries on top. Food was good besides the fruit.. not a fan of Frozen or canned fruits. I recommend this place to know one"}
{"text":"Sub par pancakes and the omelettes are ehhhh. Only reason why I've been here are those drunken late nights and nothing is open. I need to stop drinking and eating here."}
{"text":"For a quick breakfast ihop is usually a pretty safe place to get. Usually i prefer something like Cracker Barrel but didn't want to drive 35 minutes to get there. We were sat fast, then waited 10+ minutes to be greeted. There weren't very many people around us since we went around noon on a weekday. The eggs were very cold and the toast was burnt. Probably going to make that 35 minute drive next time it's time for breakfast outing."}
{"text":"I've recently moved into the neighborhood and decided to try IHOP today. A big mistake. After I was seated I just waited and waited for someone to take my order. And it's not that they were busy. The place was practically empty. I saw waiters just walking past me avoiding eye contact. They didn't even bother to tell me that someone would be with me shortly or something like that. Customer service anyone?

Finally a waitress came along and I told her that I've been waiting for a long time. She was apologetic and nice, and came to check upon me 4-5 times during the meal. But by that time they had totally ruin my Saturday with their pathetic service and \"I don't care\" attitude. None of the people working there looked like they wanted to be there at all.

I'm not going back which is a shame as the place is right next to my apartment."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst IHOP I have ever eaten in. Not only was the place dirty but the food was terrible. I asked for well-done bacon and hashbrowns and they came out medium. I sent them back but when I got them back the eggs were cold. The attitude of the server and the manager matched the overall poor experience"}
{"text":"The egg yolks were neon yellow ... literally. That is not natural. 

Go to Matt's Big Breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Currently sitting here waiting for my bill....been over....mmmm 25 mins.....10pm at night. Have to get up for work at 6. Seriously. What the heck?? Slow staff. Nope. Just talking to there friends at another table. Ignoring everyone else....this will be the last time I will ever come to this location. Don't care if it's 24/7 or not."}
{"text":"I had a lovely break fast at this IHOP this morning. Our waitress, Leslie could not have been friendlier or given better recommendations!  I ordered their new Cinnamon French toast, which was to die for!  It reminded me of eating Cinnabon--which I also love!  I love that each table gets it's own coffee pot! Service was prompt!  I really enjoyed my meal at this location and plan to visit again next time I am in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I've been dreading this review. 

Listen, my family and I love Ihop. We even have a little sing-song for it, \"I-hop, you-hop, we-all-hop for IHOP!\" That being said, I've had two, back to back, experiences here that have left me very disappointed. On both occasions it has not been odd hours. Last time was a Friday at 530pm. We stood in the waiting room for 20mins without anyone in sight. No one checked the room and we saw no staff about. 

Once we were seated, we had time to decide drinks, make a food decision (my wife is VERY indecisive) then change our minds and talk about the pros and cons of both dishes before anyone came to get a drink order. Both occasions the orders have been wrong and/or missing a ton of things. 

We ordered a grilled cheese with fries on sourdough bread... we got half a grilled cheese and an explanation of, \"because the bread is bigger we only do half a grilled cheese.\" (LAME)... 

We came in with a big party on the other occasion, 9 dishes were ordered. Not one was written down. Not one came out correctly... one job to do staff... one job.

Look I'm a veteran, I do expect things to run smoothly when I give away my money for services, what little I have, but I am also understanding of mistakes and errors. I try to be easy going, but DUDE... I only take so much. We will drive the extra 15mins to another location."}
{"text":"Fast service, even with a full waiting room. Took us five minutes to get a table on a busy Saturday around 10am. Food was as expected, no complaints here!"}
{"text":"The service here is pretty terrible. Set your expectations on a very long wait. As I stood at the hostess counter, several employees walked past without so much as a greeting that someone will be with me shortly. After approximately a 10 minute wait, I was finally addressed. 

I placed a call in order and was there for the pickup. Once I finally received the order, the food was good, just very disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"Went here on a busy Sunday morning pre-Steeler game.    20 min wait.    Big menu.  Food was great (came out a little slow but like i said, it was super busy).   

I'm a server and the server we had was outstanding.   His name was Abdul.   Super polite and attentive.   Couldn't have been more satisfied having him."}
{"text":"Have been there mutliple times, love the food.  Past visit was last for me and family.  Seated and ordered food shortly after-had table behind me ordered moments before we did.  45 minutes later, NO food, table behind us was already DONE eating and leaving. Victor the waiter would smile and laugh every 10 minutes he walked by saying \"its coming\", once even stating \"just pulled your sandwich off, on the way\"-20 minutes following this we left-saw him on other side of restaurant clueless to us walking out.   We were there more than 45 minutes and got nothing but the water when we were seated. We had Victor the week prior, I assume the service was based on him not being happy with our tip on last visit, but I'll never know. Everyone else around us was served, even people who came in AFTER we did. Didn't seek manager, just left knowing we are done. Beware, or order carryout!"}
{"text":"Nice place, food tasty but not served hot and slow service even though not crowded. But way better then service at Bedford location. Will try again."}
{"text":"My coffee had a bug. They replaced my coffee mug and coffee.  I hated the meals. My first meal was just going to cheeseburger sliders. Upon receiving them, they had a smell to them that made me gag. I thought maybe it's just the smell and the taste could be delicious. The smell and taste complemented one another. I spit my bite into my napkin. I said okay I'll just order an omelette. I got the chicken fajita omelette. The menu says that the omelette is topped with salsa and sour cream. I received my omelette topped with sour cream only. I was so furious. The waitress didn't have the common sense to just bring the salsa with the meal the least. She was getting annoyed with me and clearly I understood. When I don't like something , I try to work it out. Instead of making the biggest fuss I just rather take it to go. The pancakes I got with my omelette is all I could keep down. I'm at home trying to eat my chicken fajita omelette and I can't. My appetite was ruined. The smell and taste of my omelette is disgusting now. It doesn't look as appetizing as it does on the menu. THE IHOP IN DOWNTOWN PHOENIX IS THE BEST!!! If it's not that IHOP in DOWNTOWN, then surely I'll be going back to Denny's(Jenny's). THEREFORE, no more IHOP for me. My experience may be different from yours, so please don't judge me. I have a stomach ache now."}
{"text":"The food was really good. It didn't take too long to prepare. The wait staff was very slow. The other patrons were horribly loud. Building is very run down. If you're in Vegas - eat at someplace you cannot find elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Good meal but Poor service from Rochelle , she seemed like she had better things to do than to be at work.  Had to ask for my daughters juice twice , brought out 2 meals 10 mins before the 3rd was ready. Didn't offer refills on drinks . Not sure if she's a new server but she needs to step her game up."}
{"text":"Bernice is a great server. Very personable and quick. She ran a very busy section perfectly. Thank you."}
{"text":"What's up with a name like IHOP being an International House of Pancakes?  Pretentious name and they shortchange their reputation because people at lunch and dinner already assume their later meals are secondary in quality.  Sadly, I think their lunch and dinners are no where as good as their breakffast though lunch is better than dinner there. But I like most of IHOP's breakfast items and specials.  They've got the many versions of pancakes down.  For decades I have eaten many Swedish and French pancakes, esp. when they had the Rooty Tooty specials, and the International Passport is my typical order.  Overall breakfast is their best meals with a lot of variety. Besides pancakes, I really like their sausages, bacon, and hash browns.  Most of the time, they cook your order quickly, specially if you go to their restaurants during the weekday since weekends, they get real busy and slow. 

This particular IHOP in North Las Vegas in convenient.  It's an easy in and out of Craig Road across the street from Target.  It was a fine experience the first time we went.  They had a few terrific specials with Hawaiian style pancakes.  Lots of food, too and four of us split three breakfast specials, ordered a pitcher of orange juice and pitcher of coffee.  The waitress was nice, it was clean though it was after the rush hour.  Still we were content.

The next time was different.  We went at later, and my nephew likes nothing better than onion rings.  So everybody ordered what they wanted.  The nephew ordered lunch that was supposed to come with lots of onions rings.  But when his food came out, there was no explanation, he was given extra sandwhich, yawn!  They didn't even ask him what he may want, they just assumed it. No options from the server, and we never saw the manager. Needless to say we were all disappointed.  I really hate it when restaurants don't give what you order and ASSume you'll just take anything they force at you.  Needless to say, we won't come back to this restaurant and go to many other cool places to eat in this town.

It's a shame, we're a family that eats outs several times a week. I have probably eaten in an IHOP about once every month or two for the past 20 years.  Their headquarters are on Brand Boulevard in Glendale, I know exactly where they are because one of our offices is less than two blocks from them . Maybe I need to tell them to have their managers and wait staff to improve their customer service skills."}
{"text":"well, I will start out by saying , I am a whole lot of biased against breakfast food, so my review is based off the BLT I ordered. .......How do you ruin a BLT, I thought to myself? Answer ? make it so SALTY, that salt is all you can taste. I am sure I will keep getting dragged back here, my boyfriend loves breakfast, hoping to find something I can enjoy, as eggs and pancakes really aren't my thing....But the breakfasts look good ., But then again , so did my BLT..."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with my last visit. Over 20 min for my food on a Wednesday morning at 9:20am. The order was cold and incorrect. I have been there several times before but this is my only bad experience."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast and the service was a bit slow. We had a party of 4 and all ordered pretty quickly but it took awhile for our food to come out.  Otherwise the restaurant was clean and seemed well maintained."}
{"text":"Worst dinner ever!  Service was extremely slow and when we got our salads after waiting over 20 minutes they mixed up the dressing and gave us tartar sauce instead of blue cheese. Our mash potatoes were cold. Oh wait so was our veggies and main portion. I never got my drink refilled and when the waitress came by after half an hour she never acknowledged that drinks needed filling. She just asked us how our dinner was.
When we came for breakfast our waitress had spilled a bunch of creamers on the floor and they sat there for 10 minutes before somebody pick them back up while people walked by pointing at them and wondering why they're on the floor. This was right in front of the main entrance."}
{"text":"My wife and like to have a hearty breakfast after we climb Usury Pass Mt and like Ihop, we used to go to the one on baseline and Val vista but noticed that service was deteriorating and decided to look for another ihop. Thank God for the IHOP on southern and signal butte, food is great but what made this place even better is Scotty Boiii, he is a very attentive , detail oriented and very well manner."}
{"text":"Food was very salty. I think I'm bout to have a heart attack. God took too long to come out and half our order was forgotten. Anyhoo I was so hungry I ignored the salty food and scarfed it down. There seasonal fruit contained 3 canned pineapples and 2 canned grapes."}
{"text":"Everything, including the service was less than satisfactory. I was unhappy with the food. Most of it was really over cooked. The only good thing were my eggs. All but maybe one of the servers looked extremely unhappy to be there and it showed through in their serving us."}
{"text":"It is unfortunate that the \"right to refuse service to anyone\" option doesn't apply here because I am now totally nerve racked thanks to the obnoxiously loud child that has screamed and yelled for an entire hour since I've been in here. ; ( would've loved to have seen them told to leave....food was ok. Would've been more enjoyable minus screeching."}
{"text":"first time and last time,, host seated me  without say  word like \" enjoy your meal \",waited 25 mins without any attention....THE RESTAURANT NOT EVEN HALF SEATED !!"}
{"text":"This IHOP is just like your typical one, and doesn't really make an exceedingly negative or positive impression. Of course the highlight of this restaurant is their extensive breakfast menu, which always includes fun, seasonal, and exceptionally sweet pancake options. If that's what you're looking for than this is the place to go. It's very casual, so would definitely be a spot that the kids would enjoy, especially with their dessert like breakfast options. It's never too crowded so wait time is usually not an issue.  A step up from a small town diner, but this it lacks that charm as it is a chain restaurant. If you want some place cute and quaint this doesn't really fit the bill,  but if you are in the mood for a cinnamon roll pancake then this is the place to be."}
{"text":"I dislike chains, but its 1am on a Thursday night. After a horrible night I needed some good old fashion comfort food. Place clean, no wait, waitress on the ball with refills. Went with the tooty fruity breakfast platter. YUMMO. I feel full and ready for bed and to wake up in better mood thanks to my fabulous waitress."}
{"text":"The service is slow and it wasn't even busy. Kid's grilled cheese wasn't even grilled. We wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"So we are sitting here right now ... 1149 on a Monday morning. 2 servers. Waited 5 mins to be seated. Waited another 7 before the server came... another 10 to get coffee... another 25 to get food and now I'm literally done with my omelette and have not received my pancakes. HIRE MORE PEOPLE!!!! Unreal"}
{"text":"Sitting here with an empty glass. The service is horrible today. It's not even busy. I've had to wait to get refills and to place my order. A mother and daughter who walked in at the same time just cancelled their order and left. It seems like service is better when they are busy. Food was ok but my soup was cold and no crackers had to ask for those which was another wait. Dissapointing visit today."}
{"text":"Yelp really needs a 0 Star option this place is not worth the money or time. Service is horrible the waitress had an attitude and acted as if we were a bother to her. The food took for ever to come out and when it did some of the plates were cold. The pancakes were not cooked through and when we talked to a manager it seem as if he could care less of what the issue and problem was. Employees here did not care about the customers or the service they provide. I would much rather go to a Denny's than to ever come back to this IHOP 
Don't waste your time or money"}
{"text":"Horrible service
I understand that it can get backed up when it's busy but when everyone around you is getting their attention from their server and yours is no where to be found it is upsetting 
My son asked for a cup of water and when asked if he could get a refill it never came 
My daughters food never arrived and we had no silver ware to eat our food. We asked to get more coffee and silver ware and after waiting for 15 minutes we decided to walk out since my daughter never got her food and we had nothing to eat our food with. Will never go to this ihop again
If I could give them a negative star I would"}
{"text":"I have read the previous reviews and thankful that we have not had the \"server all complains about\"  and had no issues with any of our orders. We have been to this location for  a few times and have had pretty good experiences for an IHOP. I mean we have gone during late morning hours, so maybe the service goes downhill from lunch to those coming in at graveyard shift. Not just IHOP, but other restaurants have been slack in the wee hours/right before closing. Anyway, prices are good for the quality of food and level of customer serivce you receive. One gripe about this location is that payment can only be taken by the cashier station. We went again this past Labor Day and the poor girl could not multi-task. A customer with an infant was placing her indecisive order and the line was backed up by seven people. I could not believe there's only one register!!  So irritatiiiiiiiing. She should have tried to get as many people checked out while the young lady was deciding what she wanted. I can talk a little smack because I worked as a cashier many moons ago in a restaurant and grocery store.  If they fix this, then maybe I would give another 1/2 star. :)"}
{"text":"Every time we order food for take out they always forget to pack and item or 2. I used to always come here back in the day but the food and service has gotten so bad I stay away from here. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because the times they have gotten our orders correct the food was good and the waiters there are great."}
{"text":"Ihop has always been good to us I always get the Colorado omelet and it's always good here. Service sometimes  are not always good but then again nobody is perfect."}
{"text":"Had the rudest waitperson in existence on Sunday. After taking our order (which was probably less expensive than she might have wished because we ordered from the Senior menu and weren't dumb enough to order coffee for $2.99 or juice for $3.29) our snippy waitress brought our ice waters and then totally disappeared. 

Did not come back to refill our ice waters, did not check on us, did not stop by to explain why our meal was delayed, when it might come out, etc. 

After 30 minutes from the time we placed our order, we left, hungry and angry."}
{"text":"Clean, atentive waitress, good and tasty good. The pancakes shrunk. They are so tiny now"}
{"text":"Service was terrible, servers themselves were slow, didn't seem to care, I really got to know the people sitting a table down to us who had been waiting about 30 minutes to get their order taken, that's how I knew we were screwed, indeed we were we didn't get taken care of for about 20-25 minutes, wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"We arrived at about 7:15 last night, were seated immediately, and the service was great. Jasmine, our server, was attentive and friendly. She took our orders as soon as we were ready and our food was delivered hot and and everyone received their food at the same time, which is rare! We will definitely return and definitely want to give our server, Jasmine, two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch with my Mom.  She ordered the crepes while I got the cinn-a-stack french toast.  Though they seemed to pack a lot of Cinnamon between the french toast slices (to which I scrapped some off), it was very good.  My mother also enjoyed her crepes with strawberries.  The staff was friendly and the facilities were clean.   Compared to other \"IHOPs\" I have been, I felt I made no mistake here, it was good."}
{"text":"Compared to \"other\" IHOPs, this location is typically okay, not the greatest nor the worse.  During the weekends and holidays, this place is packed for Breakfast up through lunch; while the workday is less busy and all evenings are dead.  The service is up and down, it seems almost each time I visit they are training someone new there.  Typically the server will spill the drink on the table either by refill or already on glass.  The wait times are average, usually 10-15 minutes from order to table.  The food is generally good, if you ask for the bacon to be crispy or additional strawberries and cream on your pancakes, they will gladly do so.  The location sometimes struggles to stay clean, especially after breakfast; and a few times I found the utensils with food still on them, so be aware.  Overall, if you are in the area and desire breakfast food, it does the job."}
{"text":"When you walk in, the first thing you're hit with is the smell. It smells like a dirty bathroom. I wonder if they're using the same mop to clean the entry that is used in the bathrooms. It's really bad. Still smell it sitting at the table. 

So far the service has been great. Lisa our waitress is super friendly & attentive. 

Food & service were great. It's the smell that is so off-putting."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on our way out of town last week.  We've been here numerous times and even though they were good when they first opened, the last couple of times have been bad experiences.  We hesitated going back, but wanted a good breakfast before we hit the road for a 3 hour drive.  We decided to give them another try.  This time the experience was excellent.  The food was good, but the best part was Kailey our waitress, she was exceptional.  She was very friendly and very attentive.  In the past we've had poor service, so this was refreshing to see, it's restored our faith in IHOP again.  They still need to work on their service at the front counter, there were 3 of us waiting to pay our bill with no one in sight."}
{"text":"Okay so I'm updating my review for this place based on my most recent visits. The food is still typical but the last few times I've been here I've received bad service. The two waitresses that were serving us took forever giving our us our meals and had really bad attitudes. Mind you again this is based off of a few different visits I've been here. I think i am going to take a break for a while on coming here and rather have go else where for pancakes and french toast."}
{"text":"Did not even end up eating at this particular ihop, from the environment to the services was very upsetting. The employees were unprofessional hoot & hollering like kids . The food took 40 mins for one order & they didn't check on us if we needed anything. I was very upset"}
{"text":"Errands on a Friday got us hangry! Lol. 

Host
He was attentive + pleasant

Server Lindsay
She was attentive + pleasant + personable 

Food
We ordered omelettes -- one with sour dough bread, and the other hashbrown

Ambience 
This iHOP is remodeled. It feels contemporary, vibrant, clean, and inviting.

We will return again. ^_^"}
{"text":"People here are super nice. In my hometown I always ask for a pecan waffle. They don't have it in their menu but they'll do it for you (they used to have it years back). 

My only complaint about this IHOP here in Cleveland is that their batter is premixed and they have no nuts to put in. Bummer!"}
{"text":"5 stars just for the manager on duty right now. I didn't get her name but she was a delight. My brother and I came here with my 10 month old nephew. He was a little cranky and my brother started getting embarrassed because he didn't want to disturb the tables around us. I reminded him that we are at a family restaurant, but he didn't care. My brother ended up walking outside with the baby til our food came out. My nephew was still not having it. The manager came over to make sure everything was ok and did everything she could to help calm down my nephew. Got him a coloring pad, showed him how to color, grabbed a small bowl of honeydew mellons. My brother was trying to keep my nephew from throwing his food on the floor, something he loves to do, and she told him not to stress over it because they have vacuums and brooms to clean up with. Given its probably not a big deal for most people it helped calm both my nephew and brother down and we were all eventually able to finish our meals at the table."}
{"text":"This is just an ok place to come for some edible food. The food is good, actually. The service, not so much. They are not necessarily mean, just slow. More often than not we have waited much too long after being seated for someone to come and ask our drink. After our drinks come, it seems they rarely get filled and it takes way too long for the server to return even to check on us. Meh."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with IHOP breakfast. The pancakes are classic goodness. They have really updated the menu over the years to add more choices for the craving palette.  

The prices have increased a bit, but you can still feed a family of 4 for under $45. 

Service is good and the food comes out fast. I recommend IHOP for breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent! I work nights, so finding somewhere open 24hrs is a hassle, ihop is always my go to for when I get off of work. I probably come here with my boyfriend every night around 1:30am or every other night... Food is excellent tonight! I never (and yes I mean NEVER) have any complaints. Food is HOT AND FRESH, couldn't be any happier with service & food quality/quantity/freshness. 10/10 would recommend. I'd say they need to hire more night shift people though, there's always one lady running around serving everyone at night but she is excellent & never loses patience & you'd never even know she was serving 8 other tables."}
{"text":"Had a waffle, bacon and scrambled eggs about 3 weeks ago at 4 pm on a weekday. Did not have to wait for a table. Good service. The waffle was cold on top and warm on the bottom. It was kind of mushy because it was barely cooked. Eggs were kind of rubbery. I wish IHOP would get their act together."}
{"text":"Went to IHOP tonight for a late dinner at 1030. We waited almost 10 minutes for someone to come into the lobby to seat us. After being seated we received our drinks quickly but then waited over 20 minutes and had not been acknowledged by a waiter or waitress. The was one large party of 15 finishing their meal, and table of 2 and two tables of 4.

The table behind us received their order as we were being seated and their waitress came by twice but never approached us. The table down the aisle was also addressed twice. When we left I asked the person at the front to whoever our waiter or waitress was that we waited for over 20 minutes and all he said was oh really. Really!?! 

We went to Denny's down the road and had excellent  service."}
{"text":"We were seated fast even with a group of 7+ baby.
Our server Eddie was amazing. He took all out orders & accommodated us with out hesitation .  He didn't need to write any orders down . 
Everything came fast , correct , hot fresh. We really enjoyed our visit here!"}
{"text":"Went in at 1:48 on 2/24/16. The dining room was mostly empty except for 2 customers. Once seated, we were told our server would be right up. We waited 20 minutes and nobody paid us any attention along with 1 other customer who walked in after us. One customer who was there before us got his food, his check, and great service. My boyfriend and I were ignored and neglected. We left as we were not going to wait any longer to simply be asked for even our drinks. We saw the two waiters, one on her phone and the other one sitting in a table and heard plenty of workers talking and laughing in the back. Not going there again."}
{"text":"My husband and I was the first customer for a new waiter.  I felt so sorry for him.  He was left by himself with another waitress stepping in periodically.  There were tons of waitresses & it wasn't horribly busy.  I can't understand why he wasn't shadowed.  Instead, they threw him out there when he wasn't ready & let the customer deal with it.  I had so much anxiety watching him struggle.  He forgot several different things, we had to wait a long time for the check, then the check was wrong.  I don't blame him, I blame the management.  A manager wasn't to be found until I asked for her.  I can understand having a new person & I am understanding when their are errors, but this was a fiasco.  This IHOP is riddled with service issues.  I have seen in the past where the front counter person has to be a waitress  also.  The only reason that they get 2 stars is because the food was good."}
{"text":"Came to this IHOP for my daughters birthday because she wanted her special pancakes. I usually make them for my kids birthdays but I just moved to this area. I ordered the food over the phone and when I got to the restaurant I was greeted nicely. I was then handed my food and then drove home. I get home and my order is completely wrong and I am missing items, so I call the restaurant 4 times and they do not answer. I get back in the car and drive to the restaurant and explain what I am
Missing and how my order was wrong 30 minutes later I get my order and it is wrong again. The girl at the front takes it back to the back again with an attitude as I am trying to explain the issue with the meal and she is completely ignoring me. She comes back again and my order is wrong...yet again... I then explain what toppings I want on the side and the items I am missing. She mutters something under her breath and walks away again. As she is walking away I ask to speak to the manager and she ignores me. I take out my phone and call and the phone rings. 4 employees are sitting at the table chatting and are ignoring the phone sitting in front of them. Needless to say, I will now be making sure that I make my daughters birthday pancakes and I won't pay someone else to make them. By the way, they also overcharged my credit card for the order!"}
{"text":"The only explanation for the terrible quality and poor service is bad management.  It starts at the top."}
{"text":"It started out pleasant until I had to ask the server to cook my food a lil longer as it is way under cook, and I asked for it well done.

She returned bout 25 mins later with a new dish. Unfortunately, it was still undercook. The middle was soggy and runny. After waiting patiently for nearly an hour for my food ... and my mates were already done eating their food... I was getting a bit pissy, but managed to remain cordial.

Instead of checking on my order, she was busy socialising and taking fotos with diners in another table. We were wondering if she was already off the clock, or on break, or something.

Finally, my food arrived. Yes, for the 3rd time! It was still undercook. I suggested to have the heat lower and leave the bloody thing just a little longer til it's browned. She raised her voice and was no longer cordial. In my younger days, I would have argued with her with regards to her sub-par and inconsistent service, and their food. The food was inedible for me after taking a bite or two. Finally I asked if I need to pay for the food I did not order? \"Yep, coz you ate it!\"  (apply improper customer service attitude) *hahaha* Madam slacker, I ate a portion. Finally, a 10% discount was applied after much \"discussion.\"

We are so looking forwad to dining again at this IHOP location! NOT.IN.A.GOOGLE.YEARS! *faiiiiil*"}
{"text":"Normally, I love iHop but this location is the exception. The hash browns were nothing but grease and the bacon was limp and barely cooked. Both my mom and I had queasy stomachs the rest of the day after eating here. iHop is great, but I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"My kids and I were about to take a road trip decided to eat at IHOP versus Denny's that Friday morning. Worst experience ever and my instincts told me to just leave before we ordered since it took over 10 min for our waitress to acknowledge us. We ordered drinks 2 sprites and a tea and my glass arrived with what looked like a baby roach in the glass. The food came forever later and my daughter had the half pot roast melt and a side of eggs. She ate very silent which is very unusual for her and she later admitted the sandwich was cold and the so were the eggs but she knew I was already mad and didn't want to add to it. My chicken florentine crepe had bacon pieces and blueberries missed in. When we went to pay there was no one at the register and the person that showed up finally to take our money yelled out for the cashier so that obviously was not his job."}
{"text":"I witnessed a serious HEALTH CODE VIOLATION at 11:00 am on 2/22/15. I was sat by the manager and the table had ketchup and Tabasco at the end of it. (For those of you in the restaurant industry, this is a CLEAR marker this table hadn't been wiped down with a sanitized towel. For those of you not in the industry, this is a HUGE thing you need to know.) I told the manager that it looked like the table was dirty and the ketchup was a clear sign it needed to be wiped, and he said different establishments do different things and they always leave the ketchup and Tabasco there on the table. Well that's interesting, because as he said that a busser came up behind him with a sanitizer towel and wiped that table without me asking. (She had obviously just cleared the table and was about to wipe it to make it 100% clean.) She also TOOK THE KETCUP AND TABASCO, so the manager straight up lied about them supposed to be on the table. Then, it took 15 mins for orange juice and the table next to us sat down 10 minutes after us in a different section, and got their food 10 minutes before us. Our pancakes were not cooked all the way through, I saw BATTER & I walked out. My boyfriend tried to explain to the manager that the bussers didn't wipe under the syrup or by the salt which is where the most bacteria builds up, and the manager said I was irate since I walked in the door BECAUSE I ASKED FOR THE TABLE TO BE WIPED DOWN. Avoid this location at all cost."}
{"text":"My BF and I both ordered the combo with 2 eggs, 4 sausage links, hash browns, and biscuits/gravy. Neither of us could take more than one bite of the biscuits because they were so dry and looked like they had been sitting out ALL day, even the gravy was dry and thick! 

We didn't last a half hour without getting the worst heartburn in my life from those sausages (I'm only 22)!!! 

It was around 1 am so other than us, there were only 3 other tables (2 people at each) with people and two waitresses. For some reason we only saw our waitress maybe 3-4 times (including when we asked for the check and left). 

The food is nasty, and the wait is awful! Go to another location!!"}
{"text":"It's good, but not great.  There are a lot more places now that I would prefer over IHOP for breakfast meals including pancakes.  Generally speaking I think IHOP is a bit too commercialized now.  It's a lot more quantity over quality and I don't mean that in terms of more food, they just serve it faster and get you in/out much quicker, so the quantity is for them not the customer.  I would rather go to Egg Works or something, but I am not unhappy with the food...just meh!!!"}
{"text":"IHOP isn't bad, it's just not that good either.  I used to think IHOP was much better several years ago.  They still have good pancakes and French toast, but unfortunately I don't think they do well with most other dishes especially outside of breakfast.  The sausage seems like it was not cooked, but more like boiled or something.  Hashbrowns were also pretty good I guess, but generally I can get just as good or better at several other resturants.  Just seems like the overall quality of the food and service just isn't what it used to be.  I would actually rather go to even Denny's these days, whereas a few years ago I would have chosen IHOP first.  They seemed to remove several items off the menu that I loved.  This time around I didn't see any types of skillets on the menu which is dissapointing for me because that is one of my favorite breakfast options.  The quality of the food is down, and the price of the food is a bit high considering the lower quality.  Also just want to add a comment about the service.  We were seated in a corner and none of the servers noticed us for nearly 10 minutes.  Not exactly the best service, they should be able to do much better."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm with a big group of ten or so. The cleanliness of IHOP is always not so great. It always smells weird in there and does not look visually appealing. We had one server for our big group and I could tell she was overwhelmed. I understand but you shouldn't take that out on us.

Food at IHOP isn't that great. It never fills me up and it always gives me stomach issues. I only came here because my family decided to come here. 

Although prices are nice and cheap, the food and service isn't that great. I wouldn't recommend IHOP to anyone."}
{"text":"Terrible service.. literally waited 45 mins to get our food, in a restaurant with about 7 people in it... When we got up to walk out, half of our food was only ready... was told a manager would come speak to us and it appears that he was too scared, so he sent a waiter to do all his dirty work.. this place just opened but I don't see it maintaining with the current management.."}
{"text":"Service is good but the food was absolutely horrible do not get the bananas foster it's pure brown sugar with bananas.  It is so grotesquely sweet that you can't even eat good luck!"}
{"text":"I can not believe how much the food was here for an IHOP. Like 11$ for a small breakfast. Also it was way crowded and very short staffed. Not the best if looking for a comfortable breakfast place I would recommend another place"}
{"text":"went there for breakfast, and it was almost empty.( should have been my first clue).the server I had was very nice. I ordered their new special, eggs, sausage, hash browns, and a fruit crepe.
I waited 20 minutes for my order. when it arrived, the crepe was the size of a dime in diameter,
very little fruit, and was dry! while eating, I overheard a server, telling her manager she had a party of five, whose bill totaled $46.00, and she was upset she did not get a tip! The manager
asked her if she had any complaints from them? the server told her, two of the people in the group complained that 40 minutes was a long time to wait, to have their food made. as I walked out, after paying my bill, the greeter at the door looked at me, never said have a good day, thanks come again, or anything, because she was texting, or doing something on her cell phone. either it is time to get a new manager, or someone needs to go in to this place, and replace the cooks, and the staff."}
{"text":"Portion size has diminished greatly or maybe it was just my plate that day, either way it pissed me off.  The pictures made it look like a decent portion size. I have been to IHOPs where they actually filled their plates. The plates are big for big portions, if you're going to reduce the portion size bring it on a smaller plate."}
{"text":"Very good food! Quick service and very nice servers! Their music is very spotty and seems like it needs to be repaired because it got quite annoying. But overall great place to get breakfast at 5am!"}
{"text":"We got there and literally NO ONE was there so I don't know why it took so long to make my pancakes! 

When my order came out it was completely wrong. Wrong pancakes and wrong sides. Then it took 20 minutes to bring out the correct order of pancakes. 

While we were waiting for the correct pancakes they never came back to the table to check on us. We wanted ketchup and Tabasco and our eggs and hash browns went cold while we waited for condiments. We actually had to go find the servers to ask for the condiments and for more water. Since we were the only people in the restaurant it seems crazy that we had to wait so long.  

Also, my sister's pancakes were burnt and she couldn't even eat them.

The server was very sweet though, but I wish they did a better job."}
{"text":"ihop is a traditional american restaurant. I say it is average because it does not have anything that would distinguish it from other traditional restaurants like Denny's for example. But still it is good food (I like the pancakes mostly) and always crowded and people love it! good service and even if there is a wait, the turn goes by fast."}
{"text":"Exceptional service! Our waitress Denise was outstanding and the manager was as well!"}
{"text":"I love IHOP, been going with my family since I was a kid but This particular location is ruining the experience for me. Wife ordered a country omelette with no onion. Omelette comes back with onion in it. So we send it back, no bid deal right? It comes back and there's no onion but now it's missing the hash browns the part that makes it a country omelette.

This wouldn't be a big deal however every time we come to this location they seem to botch the order. 

But our waitress diamond was a real trooper we weren't rude or belligerent to her, and she had done everything she could to make us happy and I really appreciate that. 

The cooks though, need to pay more attention to detail.

I came hungry, but I'm leaving feeling \"meh\"

UPDATE: the general manager Alex was really cool and took care of us at the register."}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience at an IHOP I've ever had. My family of 6 came in expecting a great meal. After waiting around 10 min just to get a seat in a completely empty restaurant, we waited even more just so that our order was taken. Around the time our order should have came out we were told that they ran out of sourdough toast. A little longer we waited and they came back saying that they are out of crapes. We asked to speak to a manager and she said the cook in the back didn't know how to make crapes, and that she was never taught as well! When the order came out the strawberry's were frozen, eggs over hard when ordered over easy, orders weren't right and no utensils. We were at least given a 10% discount. It will be a while till we return thanks IHOP!"}
{"text":"I come here late at night and the service is careless. I asked for cheesecake stuffed French toast and a fried egg and got bananas and strawberries on plain french toast with a scrambled egg. Lol. And then I sat there not eating it and nobody checked on me so I had to ask for some butter. I'm not going to complain bc maybe she's having a bad night but It makes me wonder how some people can serve and care so little."}
{"text":"Our waiter was lousy took the order one was wrong, then she never came back to asked if we are OK. We had to get someone else to help us ....yes I know she was busy maybe but you don't treat your costumer like this, I said I will never eat here again, but my wife took my granddaughters here to eat a 2nd time and now she said she will not eat here again."}
{"text":"The staff has no idea what they are doing. They give our toddlers two crayons, can't even give them each one of every color. They give us the wrong food. They don't refill our drinks. They take back the food since it was someone else, then later bring ours. We ask for silverware, and 10 minutes later still no silverware. In the meantime our waitress asks others if they want dessert, and collects tips. We remind her we need our silverware. Toddlers have finished eating, so now I have to try to eat my cold breakfast with kids ready to go. The entree I ordered was horrible. Burnt hash browns, and the entree said it came with salsa which was really just plain diced tomatoes. We ask for our checks, and they give us the wrong checks. Meanwhile I have a toddler that really wants to go, and we have to wait again for the proper check. Honestly it was so stressful, I wanted to walk out and leave the food, but I did not. Still paid, (even though I had only a few bites) still left a small tip, but I will never ever go to IHOP again. Village Inn will remain my breakfast go to."}
{"text":"Service was great and so was the food! This location provides much better service than the location in the Steelyard!"}
{"text":"We tried to go to another spot but it was close so this was right around the corner. Open 24/7. Not very busy and we were there at 7am. The service was good. 
  I ordered the Pumpkin spice pancakes with hashbrowns and scrambled eggs and my husband got a vegie omelet with pancakes. The Pancakes were delicious. They better be since this is a house of pancakes :) but, the hash browns had no flavor and were not completely done. My husbands omelet they used processed cheese in it and it congiled  and was nasty. He tried my scrambled eggs and said they had no taste to them.
   I just suggest when you go to a place stick to what they are known for nothing else. Pancakes for this place stay away from the other stuff :)"}
{"text":"Service was atrocious. We're en route from Baraboo to Chicago and had a group of 7. Though it was Memorial Day, the restaurant wasn't packed yet we waited 25 minutes for a table. Another 20 before our orders were taken and drinks brought. The restaurant itself was truly filthy - stained, disgusting carpet and very poor layout so patrons are walking through service areas. Not cool. Should have gone to Log Cabin in Baraboo."}
{"text":"I rate this place 2 star. The server was very friendly. We received a dirty glass with a lip print on it still and we complained about it and Alejandro was very nice about it and replaced it. When we got the check we were charged for chocolate chip on our pancakes which we did order but didnt get. i asked for it to be taken off my check and the manager Yumilet was very rude and had a smart remark and said \"I guess.\" it is christmas, if you have a sour attitude then dont work in a place where you have to be nice. i dont understand how you expect people to pay for something they didnt get either."}
{"text":"I am never an IhoP person, but I do love turkey dinner :)!  My fam won't wait at the red rock buffet and we ended up here.
However the picture IHOP had on their menu and the actual meal is way off!  The turkey was dried!  When I say dried,  I meant dried like plastic!"}
{"text":"We were served with our coffee first and the waiter served us with dirty mugs and one has lipstick stain and the lip mark  was perfectly still preserved on the rim of the mug!  Made me lose my appetite!  You'll not see me again in this IHOP!!!"}
{"text":"After a really late concert (Velvet Revolver) my then best friend Aaron and I came here for some good hang over food. He was hung over and I was just hungry. Not the best breakfast in the world, however, beggers can't be choosers the following day."}
{"text":"This place is the example of great service.  Our waitress was extremely attentive on a busy Sunday morning.  One of the waitresses cleared a table for another waitress and received a big thank you from her.  Great teamwork.  Management came by and was extremely interested in how our breakfast was going.  

Whoever is managing this place is doing an OUTSTANDING job."}
{"text":"During EDCLV 2014, I stayed at the Value Place next door, so I gave this IHOP a try and was pleasantly surprised. Over that 4-day stay, I went twice and each time given great service and good food. My most recent visit was yesterday and I witnessed another table giving the manager, David, a tough time about waiting too long and demanding that the food be free. He nicely told them that he would go check the security cameras to see how long they had been waiting so he could ensure that wouldn't happen again. While he went to check the cameras, those guests left quickly! Obviously, they just wanted to complain in hopes of a free meal. How disgusting but par for the area. We were seated promptly and with a smile. Our server happened to be Dawn, an assistant manager, who gave us lightning service, drink refills without asking, and the VIP treatment. But wait, she did that for all the guests in IHOP at that time. I question the other less than stellar reviews for this place as over the last 3 months, this IHOP has been consistently good. I would not hesitate to go back to THIS IHOP, other IHOPs not so sure."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all costs!!!

Worst service I've ever had, apparently under new management, they should quit now!!

1. Orders came out wrong.
2. Old guy server had his thumb on my eggs as he put my plate on the table.
3. Our server want attentive whatsoever to the point we had to flag her down ever 5 minutes to give us items she either forgot or didn't bother asking if we want.
3. She gets order wrong them comes to you with the menu to verify what you chose.
4. Food was cold.
5. Old guy sever puts his hands on the pancakes to check for temperature, gross!!!"}
{"text":"We visit here about once a month or so. Staff is nice, sometimes they are understaffed so it might take a little longer. I always enjoy breakfast food for other meals. Pancakes, hashbrowns and eggs."}
{"text":"Under staffed only two waitress an the greeter was hanging out in the kitchen a waitress name toina was pulling everyone's weight she was seating people an check on everyone not only her tables as the other waitress was walking around an hanging out in the kitchen I had to walk up to the kitchen to have my drink filled up an my husbands food was cold"}
{"text":"The food was amazing , nicely fresh made .  Really tasty breakfast . But the services sucks. Our waitress didn't not pay no attention to us , I understand it was 1:19 am however it's not busy at all. Never got refills and never came by to check up on us , until it was time for our check"}
{"text":"Overall the value is slippin'...

They've increased almost all food prices across the board to the point I could take it or leave it.

\"Bit my tongue\" on prior visits but must say that the slow service was too much to take recently. Although the waiter seemed sincerely sorry that didn't change the long delay.

Food was decent so it appears they believe people will come back no matter what.

Well, here's what...the double wammy of prices up and service down earned an update of two stars."}
{"text":"I've ate here quite a few times and it has been up and down with the food and service for me as well. I had a bug (gnat) in my water glass and when I pointed it out to our server she just said \"oh\" and brought me another glass but no apology was offered. That was probably my worst experience here, but it's not the food that's the problem for me and mine when we go it's the terrible service."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday for a breakfast \"lunch\". One couple in front of us at hostess desk but no hostess. Maybe 8 booths full and two servers on the floor. Waited a while and finally server came over and asked how many. The first couple says two and the server pulls out four menus and says to follow him. He sits the couple and says \"this way\" to us. Never been seated like that before. Brought us to a table that was not wiped down and then sat us in back. (later a different server sat a family there still not wiped!) An adjacent table was empty but there was loads of garbage, including silverware and empty dairy cups on the floor.It was still untouched 30 minutes later when we left.Food was okay. Someone there is making bad management decisions regarding number of staff needed and restaurant cleanliness."}
{"text":"Go there every other Thursday for my life group bible study and they are excellent with their customer service and the food is great and they know what I want when I get there and keeps sweet tea on my table. They like us being there b/c of what we do and stand for."}
{"text":"Me and my wife go there every Saturday and we always have the same waitress. Food is great and the staff is very friendly. We usually get the just about the same thing every week so they know what we want. By the time we sit down w/in about 10 mins our food is out. When your there ask for Ashley b/c she takes care of us and is the best waitress they have over there and friendly as well."}
{"text":"Best place ever! I brought my own waffles and had their philly and onion rings. Coming back again for sure! #Victor Castañeda"}
{"text":"Place very dirty, waitress took our order, brought our drinks and food .
We never seen her again until she brought the bill.
She told customer next to us that wanted  a refill to wait, because she could only do one table at a time.
Poor service"}
{"text":"We had such a great experience at this IHOP! Our server, Janet, is absolutely the best in the business. She was kind, quick, and had a great sense of humor. She was also super attentive to our drinks and made sure to check in regulalrly. 

The food came out hot and fast and everything was made to our liking. Nothing but smiles as we tucked into our meals. The food isn't incredible (it's IHOP, afterall), but this location did a great job putting everything together. 

When we return, it will be 100% because of Janet's amazing work as our server. Good choice for a late night bite!"}
{"text":"I have visited this location once a month every month for the last 14 years with work for a group meeting.  

Sean is SUCH an amazing server and always makes us feel completely at home.   He remembers where we like to sit, what we like to drink, and basically remembers what we order.   I have observed him with other customers and he is as equally pleasant to them as he is to us.    We have had other servers through the years and all have been pleasant and efficient. 

The atmosphere is a typical IHOP/chain/non-descript eating establishment.  What you see is what you get.  Nothing fancy or trendy.   They did update this location in the last year or so, but one thing that bothers me is that they seemed to stop part-way through- and it looks unfinished.   Whatever, it's an IHOP, for the love of Pete.... who cares?

I have been ordering the Chicken Florentine crepes for my breakfast - without the hollandaise, because I think hollandaise is gross, not because theirs is bad.  It's just gross in general.  

The others in my group get eggs, pancakes, bacon, sausage, blah, blah, blah, and it's always cooked to order and there has NEVER been a complaint - EVER.  This is surprising because we're a tough group to please. 

I've been to this location a few times on the weekends and it's always packed, but they turn over the tables pretty easily and the food is pretty consistent. 

So, if you're in the area and want a trustworthy straightforward breakfast, this is a clean location and friendly servers.   Stop in and tell Sean that Laura said 'hi'."}
{"text":"I have always gotten good service and good food at this place. The wait staff is attentive, and the quality is consistent with other IHOPs I have been to. Coupons give you the best deals."}
{"text":"It was not that busy while we were there. I asked for a kids menu and crayons. The waitress says they are out, but should have some next Friday. I'm here today, not next Friday. Anyways, eventually 2 crayons are found and a piece of paper which was nice. However, 40 minutes to get our food seemed a bit outrageous. We were told several times our food was next, but food kept coming out that did not go to our table. When we finally received our food, one of the orders was messed up, but we did not dare say anything in fear it would take another 40 minutes to have it fixed. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Brand new location 
Super clean, amazing service!! The manager/ trainer was very personable and funny! We'll be back"}
{"text":"The food here was good and came out quick.  They seemed a little disorganized when it came to taking care of our larger than normal party which included 9 patrons."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with their service. I went there today with my family and right as we walked in, there was another couple there having breakfast however they had their dog with them at the table. I know that many of the establishments here in LV are dog friendly however they do not normally allow dogs inside unless it is a service dog. This was a small to medium-sized dog and its owners had placed his food on the table and him eat off of the table. Once they left, the bus boy cleared the table and another couple was then seated there without them having cleaned the surface of the table.
When we were ready to pay, I asked the cashier (Angel) to explain their policy for pets. At first, she said that couple is a regular customer so they allow the dog. When I said that this is unsanitary and against the law, her response was: \"what do you wanna do, complain?\"
I asked to speak to the manager who then claimed they are not allowed to ask if it's a service dog and they allow the dogs into the restaurant. 
I have nothing against dogs but I will never return to this IHOP because I do not wish to eat at a table where a dog was probably just eating at. 
The manager could not care less but I am sure they will care once the health department gets involved ."}
{"text":"Why does it take a half hour to make some eggs and pancakes when I'm the only person in here, and why haven't I seen my waitress since she took my order...again over a half hour ago!

The real question is why did I come back here when this is not the first time this has happened."}
{"text":"Let me introduce myself as a person who doesn't regularly eat @ IHOP. Today I decided to walk in and the experience I received is not amusing at all. You walk and and nobody greets you or welcomes you at all. You stand there waiting for someone to sit you right it, and the hostess is helping other customers so the hostess is actually absent the entire time. You stand in line for about 10 minutes with the hopes of being noticed and no one notices you. Until you have to approach an IHOP employees and suggest if they are willing to give you a sit in or not. Since nobody has noticed you stand in line for about 15 minutes. A restaurant is nothing without courtesy and excellent customer service. I have nothing against the employees because as of right now they are working hard to make sure everyone is getting what they need and request. But towards IHOP I am very disappointed. I expected a breakfast diner where you are treated respectfully the moment you walk in, not ignored. I can't believe I lost my appetite. Never again will I walk through these doors. I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"We used to come here often with no problems with no service or food quality. 
Last visit of a party of 6 2 adults with 4 children  food came out cold and totally unacceptable, food was remade after waiting 15-20 no yes. People when food is not Kept at a certain temp bacteria grows! I has to snatch  a cold sausage out of my sons hand, my waffle was cold and soggy with burnt pieces. kids pancakes here cold as well. The side of hash browns which cost $2.57 was  about 4 ounces of potatoes. The manager husband omelet was warm to touch and slightly hatter inside. Dan the acting manager was totally incompetent to handle the situations. Furious!! Leaving to go find food elsewhere!! NEVER AGAIN be cautious... We walked out, I would not even allow them to remake food!"}
{"text":"The food is good and they try to get you in fast. The manager is lazy however. He just stares and does nothing. He walked up to a server next to us and said:\"there's is a napkin on the floor\", and then walked away. Pick it up!  I worked in a 4 diamond restaurant in a 5 diamond resort, the floor captains and even the restaurant's general manager would bus tables. Service would be a lot faster if you helped. Been there a few times and always see the same thing. I never see him walk him up to tables to ask if they need anything."}
{"text":"This is a new IHOP in the Promenade Shopping center by the mattress store (across from Starbucks). Our server told us they opened  on 12/10/2103.   I didn't know they were there until driving by a couple of days ago and just noticed the signs saying they are open. 

This restaurant is small compared to other IHOPs I have been to, but the menu is  typical with lots of breakfast options, dinner options, sandwiches, soup, etc. 

Food is typical IHOP quality - probably 3 stars, but the service was good so I bumped it up to 4 stars overall. We kept our server busy with coffee & water refills and she was friendly and helpful.  One person in our party had requested an omelet made with just egg-whites and they were happy to oblige. 

Even though this is no gourmet dining experience, it's nice to have another option for breakfast anytime in the area.  Note though that this location is not a 24-hour restaurant, they close at midnight."}
{"text":"I dine here frequently and I always get excellent service. Food is always fresh, I've never had any mistakes. Very friendly staff all around."}
{"text":"Waited about 30 minutes on our order, the food came our room temperature, eggs not fully cooked, bacon not fully cooked, and old tasting sausage. My pancakes were on the burned side. My boyfriend found two hairs in his steak tips! Just so unacceptable. They need better cooks for sure. I've never had a bad experience here except for today."}
{"text":"It pains me to leave IHOP a 2 star review. IHOP, in the past and going back many years would get nothing less then 5 stars.

Lots of good memories eating here while much younger and as I got older. Lots of good memories taking my own family there, with no worries of the normal long wait on weekend mornings sitting outside waiting for your name to be called. 

That long wait was frustrating for most but for me, it was a good thing. If we didnt have the time to wait, no prob, we go elsewhere. If its a lazy day, the wait was a good thing. Its hard nowadays to spend quality time with your family. Heck, its hard to spend any time with your family nowadays. Everybody is busy, everybody has things to do, everybody has an iphone/etc attached at their hip. So even having the time, whether sitting at ihop or at your own table in the kitchen. Everybody is glued to their phones/ipads etc.....

My rule was simple. No smart phone/ipad use while in a car. Even if your not driving. While you may not be driving, guaranteed the driver is pre-occupied with the 3 other people in the car yapping about this FB post, that thing on twitter, this email/ to and/or from so and so.....and etc

2nd, all phones/tablets etc are off during 'family time'. Period. We have enough hours in the day to click on our phones.

Back to IHOP. I hate one of my all time favorites is now not even an option we consider any more.

Was never concerned about slow service. Good things were meant to wait for. Every table full, a 1 hr wait for a table, the servers are swamped. Not the servers fault. Not the restaurants fault that so many like it they are willing to wait an hour for a table.

To me, this was a great time to spend with my family. While looking forward to a terrific breakfast.

However, now, many terrific items are no longer even on the menu. Most everything is now far higher in price. I accept and understand that. In fact, I expect it. 

But quite simply, the food has gone downhill. I dont mind that everything now is twice the price. But I do expect the food to be the same. 

They still have great pancakes, crepes, etc....But what happened to these terrific large, stuffed omelets? Ok, so they are now twice the price. Ok, they dont come with a stack of large pancakes. They now come with 2 very small pancakes. No problem. But they went from 3 large egg's in each omelet, stuffed/filled with whatever ingredients your omelet comes with, to 3 medium eggs with half the ingredients, and now, not sure. My last 2 visits, I went with my normal 'go to' omelet and my family went with their go to items (french toast, crepes, pigs-n-blankets, fruit, burgers etc..). We always left stuffed and normally with a large doggy bag, other then crepes, pigs-n-blankets, fruit, which could be eaten in one sitting...tasty satisfied and filled up, no need for doggy bags.....

Not the case anymore. Omelets are 75% higher in price, half the size, half the fillings, 2 small pancakes and no need for a doggy bag. Normally, you are quite filled up after 1/2 your omelet and half the pancakes. Now, your plate is 100% cleared.

The burgers? We used to get 1 of 3. Monster bacon, Monster bacon with egg, or just a regular monster, with your choice of side. We always went with the fries or the Potato soup. 

The burgers were huge....ample side of fries or large side of soup....You would be stuffed after eating half. 

Like the omelets, you now no longer need a doggy bag for the burgers. They dont even offer the monster burger with egg and some others. You can get them for $3-$5 more, but even then, its not filling. half the fries or 1/4 the soup as well. 

Very disappointing. IHOP, always a staple/look forward to family event on weekends, when I was young and as olderwith my own family, is now off the list. Even the kids no longer want to go there, let alone look forward to it all week long. In the better days, even I thought $3 or $4 for chocolate milk and the same $'s for a glass of OJ was excessive. But 100% acceptable. After all, they are in biz to make money and you are paying a premium to sit and relax as somebody else cooked and served the food that filled your belly and your families belly and it was worth every penny. But even now, that Large Chocolate milk, used to be large and obviously Hershys. The OJ, was still expensive back then, $2.50 for a small 2 gulp glass or $4+for a large, which as most know is easily guzzled quickly.

Now, while it still tastes like hersheys, the choc milk is basically triple in price. The small is not enough for a toddler, the large is half the size of what the small was awhile back at twice the price, both with obviously much less hersheys syrup in each. The OJ, the same, itsy bitsy cups at 3 times the price, and I hate to say this, but they are watering it down very obviously.

Its sad a staple in our lives is no longer.....

Go with Cracker Barrel Or Stacks. Tad pricey, but honestly, both are worth twice what they charge & the food is GR8!"}
{"text":"New to the area and really enjoy Coming here. Young people laughing, servers and waitstaff that is friendly and fast, and how can you not like pancakes? So glad to Ave an IHOP to go to."}
{"text":"This was either the worst cook or worst burger in history.  After weeks of that annoying PR stunt of changing the name to IHOB, it was time to enter the Pancake House and try a burger. First off, they describe the burger as a Steakburger, but then they say they use Angus Beef, so which is it folks? After that it went downhill very fast. With the exception of the waitress JJ, they might as well level this place and start all over. The only reason to give them a pass (but still one star) is that two cooks quit and the one that was left was clearly not a trained cook. While waiting for the food, we also learned the pancakes got burnt and the cook was putting my fries on the plate. Ten minutes later, the inedible burger arrived looking nothing like the fancy photos or commercials. A gray patty, a pool of grease and a shiny bun (more grease) appeared. The choc. chip pancakes were somehow uncooked in the middle and the eggs looked like slimy hell. In the end, JJ was great and we ended up paying nothing for this miserable excuse of a meal. Call ahead and see who is cooking is my advice and either way, don't fall for the burger hype."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest IHOP fan but each week after our weekly meeting someone picks a restaurant and this week they wanted IHOP. There was 10 of us in our party for dinner.  Our servers name was Denise got everyone's drink orders and took our dinner orders.

Denise seemed to disappear for long periods of time instead of being attentive to our beverage refills. All  in all I guess her service was OK. If the place was busy I would be more forgiving but it wasn't. All in all Denise was very sweet and friendly.

On a good note I ordered the Tilapia Florentine ( two delicately seasoned tilapia filets, resting on a bed of spinach tossed in creamy Alfredo sauce and served with creamy mashed potatoes) I asked for a vegetable instead of the mashed potatoes). When my dish arrived I did not see the menu said my Tilapia came in a  Alfredo sauce. I asked what the sauce was and Denise told me ad asked \"Why didn't I want the Alfredo sauce  \" I replied I didn't see it was in a sauce\", She asked if I'd like it without the sauce and brought me a new Tilapia dish with no problems or attitude. 

What can I say? It's IHOP. Need I say more? Everyone else in my group enjoyed their meals. Sometimes you are in the mood for IHOP like food we were. Our expectations were met and IHOP didn't disappoint us.

FOOD: I don't expect much from these types of restaurants so it's a hard to let me down when I eat there. The food is OK nothing special but It hit the spot. SERVICE: We liked the service that was given to us. The restaurant accommodated our party of  10 no problem.  Our waitress was friendly, attentive and efficient. CONCLUSION: The food was  good, typical IHOP food. No complaints on that at all. You get exactly what you expect. IHOP is IHOP, Its laid back, casual dining. The experience is better when you're with friends. The menu is the same everywhere. RETURN FACTOR: 100%]

************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************

5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!

3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 
2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 
1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT"}
{"text":"I like this IHOP because the team of people are great that work there. Service is good and quick. If your waitperson is busy and you ask another for something they get it for you without the excuse\"I'll find your server\". I have gone on a busy Saturday morning and a not so busy Saturday evening and my servers have both had personality and professionalism. 

The food is pretty good. So kudos to the kitchen staff also. The place is always clean and neat no matter how busy. The location is prime, close to business, hotels and residential areas plus just a short walk from the light rail. It's also open 24 hours."}
{"text":"After seeing all the other poor reviews this place has, I stand somewhat flabbergasted about how people see this place that way.  Honestly, I go here once a month at minimum with a group of people, at least 6-12 at a time.  The service is top-notch, we are always greeted with a smile, the managers know us by name as well as group, and the food is always on par with the iHop restaurants in upstate NY.  I have rarely ever had a complaint, and if I did, the staff did their best to make sure it was corrected as quickly as possible.  For a national brand that iHop is, I am not expecting 5-star meals every time, but they do fairly well with what they have."}
{"text":"Today my mom and I went to IHOP, this location on baseline and 24th. 
My mom had the fried steak, eggs and pancakes. She enjoyed every bite!
I had the French toast and scrambled eggs. 
I found what appeared to be a hair (could have been part of a thread) in my food. 
The waitress promptly notified the manager, and she removed my food from our bill as well as replaced my order with a fresh batch of French toast! The response to this issue was wonderful and the best part was how friendly both the waitress and manager were!
I truly appreciate their amazing service!"}
{"text":"Came in with my mom and son.  As we were coming in, people were leaving complaining about the food. Although the restaurant was not busy it took a little bit of time to be seated. The iced tea was so old and cloudy it tasted bitter so I asked for something different and was told a new pot was being made. Waited for a glass. The tea was much better but because the server didn't really check on us I was only able to enjoy one glass. My son had a kids meal which did not match the picture at all. I ordered a cheeseburger and a salad. I was told they did not have the dressing that I liked so I changed it to french fries. The hamburger bun was old and stale. The burger itself was dry and overcooked and my fries were cold and greasy. We sent the french fries back and the waitress took my entire plate including my hamburger which sat under heat lamps while the french fries were being remade. This was condiments and all so when I received the burger back it now had hot lettuce and tomatoes on it. Although slow, the waitress was nice and that is the only reason for the two stars. There was absolutely no effort for an apology or any resolution to our visit. There is much better, cheaper food elsewhere. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Place was clean. Waiter was nice and kept on checking with us to se if we needed anything. 
I had the french toast combo (2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, hash browns and ur choice of french toast) and a coffee. My Brat had the Denver burger (cheeseburger with ham and green bell pepper and onions omelette) with fries and a hot chocolate.  Food came to us in a decent time and place was busy.  Everything was delicious!! Even my daughter's burger was very good. And let me tell u I'm not a big fan of burgers at places like this. 
An overall we were very satisfied with our meals and service and all for $26+tip"}
{"text":"My husband called in to see how long the wait is and to put our name on the list. When we arrived we went to the check in area and told the host our name and that we called in. Immediately the host says no we don't do that, we don't accept reservations. My husband shows his phone to the host to ask if that was their number. She says yes and says again they don't take reservations. The host then starts screaming towards another worker, that is acting as cashier, to ask if she took a reservation because they do not accept reservations-- it is first come, first served. 
After embarrassing the cashier for her mistake (she normally does not work weekends or in the morning according to the manager), she decides to have us seated. The person that shows us to our seat first takes us to two seats already being set up for two other parties. So we follow her to a third booth that has a two person table attached to it. There are three Black people recently seated in the spot. I guess because we are Black we must be together right? So what if we have a party of 5 which are all standing there puzzled. The person who took us to be seated now begins to make the 3 people already seated get out the seat for us. I request they continue to sit there-- we can wait for another seat. 
I spot a bigger booth that would accommodate our party of 5 and request it. The manager comes over. That booth is for another party but a good booth is offered. While walking over I tell the manager about what happened with the host and how I was mortified she corrected her in front of everyone. So much drama. She apologizes and states that she heard some of what happened. She seats us. The manager then pulls the host to the side to tell her of our complaint (I am assuming). The host comes to our table and gives a fake apology and says she thought she did right by us by getting us seated quickly. She failed to realize it wasn't about the wait. I was upset how she completely ripped her coworker in front of all of us. A busy Sunday morning at IHOP. It was easily 50 people in the front waiting and hearing her rant. 
We came here for my daughters birthday. I will never come here again. The worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Haven't been to IHOP in a while. The quality of service was good, food was fresh, and the bathrooms were clean. It's IHOP, so I'm not sure what more there is to say about an otherwise satisfactory visit."}
{"text":"We've tried to go to this IHOP several times. Once, for dinner, we were warned by the staff it would be a long wait for our food, since there was only 1 cook. 
Tonight, about 7:00pm, we tried again. It was practically empty & they said the manager was helping cook in the kitchen. After 45 minutes of waiting & 2 rounds of drink refills, we still didn't have our food. We had to get up and go to Denny's. 
Some of the other IHOP locations are just fine! Just not this one!!"}
{"text":"I probably would have given it more stars, except the staff ignores anything that might be a problem.  While we getting ready to eat, a little boy threw up on the floor (admittedly, it was mostly clear, but still...) and we told the hostess about it, but nothing was done and they were allowing people to walk in and around the area.  It ruined out breakfast.  Note to staff at this restaurant:  This was a health hazard.  Someone should have at least put a sign on top of the area so people didn't step in it, and then cleaned the carpet first chance you could."}
{"text":"I definitely understand why this place has such low ratings. I went in and was seated, tried to tell the waitress a couple different times that I wanted to go ahead and order even though I was waiting for a couple others, but she kept talking about whatever she wanted to say even when I tried to interject. Could not get a word in edgewise, then she left. I waited for her to come back, but she never did. Sat for 15-20 minutes without so much as an offer of a water. The entire restaurant was almost completely empty, there were only two other tables with customers! Really disappointed because I love IHOP and I had been here one other time with a nice waitress. Oh, and I was on a time crunch so when the waitress finally came over when I told her I was going to leave, I asked first how long it would take to get the food if I ordered, thinking that maybe I'd be able to still squeeze it in. Her reply? \"Well why don't you tell me what you want and I'll tell you\" in a rather unpleasant way. This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've personally had!"}
{"text":"This ihop did a great job today. Greeted with a smile check, seated promptly check, coffee good check, served quickly check, waitress very nice check, great price check and clean restaurant check. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The servers were really friendly. Our order was wrong but they quickly fixed it. The food was mediocre... not the quality it used to be. And the iced tea tasted rotten."}
{"text":"Gave them a second chance stopped last night for a late breakfast got seated promptly got our drinks, then the show began the only waiter aboard started fight with a customer he even cuz her out I don't think that's appropriate there were several guest having diner and the lady had a small child when this happened. He tried making excuses but still not acceptable at all they sure do need some customer service ethics before they can sever some food too any guest, also we keep hearing a barking dog inside the restaurant will be letting the health department know too he was not by the front he must be in the back or in the kitchen, please leave your dog at home before you come too work !!!"}
{"text":"Wow - we used to go here all the time when we lived nearby, and it was good. Back in town today and we stopped by. Service was dismal - waited way too long for our food, the waiter didn't come back once to check on our empty drinks. Once the food got there, we felt rushed to finish. Waiter dropped off the check, then came back to ask if he could take it 2 minutes later. I said I haven't looked at it yet, he left, and came back 2 minutes later. It was about 2-3 pm in the afternoon, not busy at all. I saw other customers have to get up and find their servers to ask for napkins, another table had to ask for their check. It was BAD. Also, the menu had changed so they no longer have the eggs with machaca, the spinach salad, and said they had cheese blintzes, but then came back a few minutes later and said they didn't. My husband liked his patty melt, though."}
{"text":"We love this place. Been going once a week for a few months, the staff knows us and are very friendly. Always the same faces, usually a good sign. We had stopped going there a few years back because the food was not the best.  They have improved a lot. Yesterday the staff was wearing orange t-shirts to promote a new menu based on the Lorax movie coming out soon. Tried the Green Eggs and Ham with Rooty Tooty Bar-Ba-Looty Blueberry Cone Cake, \"a fluffy pancake with blueberries in a crispy waffle cone, topped with blueberry compote and sprinkled with powdered sugar\". It was actually pretty good. My wife had the same with truffula chip pancakes consisting of \"whole wheat pancakes filled with rainbow sprinkles, topped with more sprinkles and a creamy strawberry yogurt sauce\".  She thought they were too sweet,. This menu seems to be aimed at kids, and it was working. We go early and seldom see kids, but the place was full of them Friday."}
{"text":"A bunch of local thieves!!! If I could give 0 stars for unprofessionalism and lack of morale I would. I use this location frequently to purchase breakfast for my team. I normally order take out, so the customer service, or lack of, is not of any real concern. On this specific day, I asked to split the bill $50 on my corporate card and the $28 balance in cash. As i am submitting my expense report for work I notice the charge is for $78; I'm guessing Sheree C and the manager on duty who became immediately annoyed when she asked for assistance, decided to pocket the cash. When I called to open the dispute I was advised that I left an additional tip. Thank goodness I have to submit my receipts for reimbursement. Such thieves. I hope $30 was worth losing all the future business you would have received from us. So sad. So very sad."}
{"text":"I could give minus stars I would service is terrible food was terrible and the floors were filthy coffee was ice cold remembered you never go back here again."}
{"text":"So left Stacks and yolks went to IHOP which was three minutes down the road we've already got our drinks and our order is in  you just can't beat the old-fashioned traditional IHOP."}
{"text":"Ordered the pancake sliders, no flavor at all. Was very disappointed with the food and our waitress was nice but smelt like cigarettes. We went to check out and nothing was organized as far as our tickets plus the cashier caught an attitude when my family and I were trying to tell her what we ordered."}
{"text":"Server was not very friendly, seemed like a lot of staff was hanging around but not doing much. No one was even @ the register.  Will not be going to this location again. Huntersville has much friendlier staff."}
{"text":"Is this your fancy schmancy breakfast brunch spot? No. It's ihop. Your basic diner for breakfast lunch and dinner. It's been a while since I've been at this location but it is newly renovated. Very modern and clean on the inside. Bathrooms are very clean and remodeled. The main restaurant was VERY warm but the back restaurant room was Freezing. I'm sure they hear complaints on both sides, hopefully they get it fixed. Our waiter was quick with drinks and ordering but I def didn't get a refill on water in time. Got the Colorado omelette and pancakes. Hubs got the breakfast combo. No complaints. Just consistent basic food."}
{"text":"IHOP is cheap, reliable and tasty.  When I want pancakes, I usually want IHOP pancakes.  We brought a friend visiting from Brazil and he very much enjoyed it.  Red velvet pancakes are not so much an international phenomenon.  ;)"}
{"text":"Horrible service! We came in for breakfast and waited about 10 min before anyone came to us to seat us, and when the hostess did come up to us she looked like she was having a very bad morning and she never apologized for making us wait.... After being seated the server didn't approach us until 10 min later! The food come out and it looked nothing like the pictures! So I am never going back there! Only giving them  1 star for the actual look of the restaurant."}
{"text":"When I walked in with my family we were greeted right away, and by right away I mean 10 minutes of staring at servers as they walk right by us on the way to drop of food or on the way out the door.  First off if you smoke on your break don't do it 5 feet from the front door.  Once we flagged down someone posing as a hostess we were shown to a table where we waited for another ten minutes to be acknowledged by our server. Order placed and drinks out on the table I thought the worst was behind us.....I was wrong.  40......minutes......later cold and undercooked bacon was tossed on a plate along side undercooked pancakes and burnt toast.  You are a business that specializes in pancakes and you got it wrong on every order at our table. Each one had a liquid center.  The bacon looked like it did  a 30 second tour of duty in the microwave and the grease was already congealed when it hit the table.   Before I took my first bite I heard the table behind me ask to speak with a manager.  They had evidently been waiting for over an hour for food that had not come.  The server went to the back to fetch the person in charge and they refused to come talk to the customer.  For a chain restaurant that we choose out of desperation left all of us disappointed, upset and we left hungry.   From what we were hearing from other people this location has had this issue since it opened.   The jack n the box next door looks like a better option."}
{"text":"Definitely some of the slowest service I have ever experienced.
We arrive at around 9:45 pm and the restaurant is not crowded at all. We were a larger party (of 8) so it took a minute for us to get situated. We ordered after a few minutes and that's when trouble started.
A couple of the girls had side salads which were brought out after about 20 min which is kind of a while for a simple salad. The rest of our food took 50-1 hour depending on what it was. 
Apparently the chef was new, as was our server, but it was ridiculous. We could hear them yelling at the cook and him yelling back at the servers and manager. The other two tables at the restaurant could hear too and seemed to also be quite irritated at how long their orders were taking.
The manager ended up comping our whole meal which was nice, but we all would have rather paid than have sat there starving for over an hour... 
All in all the food was okay, but I was soooo hungry I didn't really notice the taste."}
{"text":"This is the only Ihop in Surprise. We've been coming here for years. We've always had good service, good food. We've taken the family here many times for breakfast, my husband and I have even been here late night after a night of drinking...the food was the BEST that night. 

It can get crowded, especially during snow bird season. We've never waited past 30 mins. Since this place is always busy, it isn't the cleanest at all times. During our last visit, we sat in a booth next to the glass divider by the entrance and my 17 year old pointed out the spit balls on the glass. Wtf? Ewww. Eh, made for a photo moment for this review. Haven't been back since, but if we do. I'll be sure to check all my surroundings as you should too."}
{"text":"Great ihop, friendly staff, no wait on seating. Paco was our waiter, nice to have friendly customer service with a smile"}
{"text":"Sadly after two trys, I left. They could not cook the pancakes right. I hate wet middles."}
{"text":"My children and some pancake lovers are going to hate me but, do yourselves a favor people keep going and do not stop! My last two visits at IHOP have been horrible, and I'm already cursed and can't eat pancakes, waffles or French toast so with that said, I will never return. I had received a gift card for Christmas and tried this location in hopes that it would be better than the last experience I had at a different location(in which my kids convinced me to go for a last minute late night bite) it was not! 
The service was pleasant but the food came out slow, bland and after drowning it in Tapatio the best part of the meal,  about 2/3rds of the way through I found an unpleasant surprise in my food. After letting our server know she addressed it with the manager, then offered  to let me order something else in its place. I politely declined, no longer having an appetite and willing to risk getting another surprise in my meal. The over priced omelet was removed from our bill, and then I noticed the $1.99 upcharge for my son to \"upgrade\" his sausage. I expected a minimal charge but it wasn't upgraded to steak just a bigger sausage. 
The wait is too long for a place that is not busy, the food is bland and over priced, if I wanted a surprise with my food I would have gone to McDonalds and ordered a Happy Meal, at least that would be a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"I was convinced by my kids after trying to find a late night last minute place to eat to come  to IHOP.  We were one of only three tables but the service was painfully slow, and the waiter got my order completely wrong. Instead of chicken tenders with fries I got chicken and waffles. My previous visit was good but I'm cursed with not be able to eat the only decent thing on their menu of pancakes & waffles and bone-in chicken that was brought out was burnt. When the waiter bought out the right order, again after another painfully long wait, he dropped part of the chicken tenders on the floor. Apparently it was just not his night, or mine! The food was not replaced but we were offered a 10% discount of which we were told we could not use that day but on a future return visit. Needless to say, I will not be returning to this IHOP or any other in the future."}
{"text":"Everything was fine as I expected.
Except that a \"family\" type restaurant does not have a Wifi service?
Food: good
Price: good
Service: good
Parking: good

BUT
I was there by myself.. I was thinking of doing some work while eating, but next time, I will just go to the Denny's very near to this place."}
{"text":"If i can give a zero to this place, i would. Customer service is very very poor. 5 of us entered the exit door but the food attendant called our attention and were asked to go back and use the main entrance. First of all, this location only had a handful customers eating. We followed her instructions and entered the main door. There was no one in the reception desk. We waited and waited and waited like FOREVER!!!! My husband had to speak louder to catch their attention. REALLY? Do we have to do this? The old man was blowing his nose as he listens to my husband and tried to help us get a seat without washing his hands... of course we had to leave as soon as we can. My family doesn't trust their food sanitation at all."}
{"text":"Breakfast, the time you grab something like eggs, bacon, sausage, things that are delicious and fast. Or, should be fast. 

My wife and I met to grab a quick breakfast and after waiting a very long time for what seemed like the only server to come around for our order the next round of waiting began. We looked around at the section we were in, with 4 other groups in it, who didn't have any food.. We looked to the other two sections, each with just one group, also no food. everyone was waiting for their breakfast. After nearly 30 minutes we asked our server to put our food in a to go bag when it was ready and proceeded to pay the check. 

I'm no wizard of the kitchen, but I know that in 30 minutes I can warm up a pan, make some eggs and pancakes and have them eaten and be cleaning my plate and pan in the sink. Management needs to bring enough people in to run a restaurant,  even if headcount costs... 

we wont be back"}
{"text":"Dirty with a capital D. Disgusting with a capital D. We went here on Friday morning and ended up walking out and going somewhere else.
While they were walking us to our table, I watched as we passed by tables that appeared to have been wiped, but in actuality most of the yuck was just smeared in a circular motion on the tops. 
When we arrived at our table is when I saw the ants.
Our waiter came over and I pointed out the ants. He proceeded to use his finger and smash the ants 1 at a time into the table. Let's just pause here a moment and visualize. It was repulsive. 
He then looked at me and asked if I still wanted to sit there, or would I like a new table. Yes. He was serious. I was wanting to run out the door, as he pointed to a new table, my 5 year old begged to stay. I reluctantly sat down(after sweeping some crumbs from my sons chair) and thats when my leg stuck to my chair. The table was also sticky and wobbly beyond being able to place a drink on it and not have it spill. I had enough. I had beyond enough.
Just to add insult to injury, While we walked to our car, I saw an ant crawling on my sons face. Needless to say we were itchy for the next hour- not from actual ants, thank God..but from that creepy feeling that more bugs were on us. 
Do not eat here."}
{"text":"We came in a group of seven at 2:00am during a break during Ragnar Del Sol. We sat there for 20min before the order was put in. Sadly, we waited because nothing else was open. The server didn't even take our order until we had to hunt him down. Terrible service. I would think a large chain like this would be better equipped with good servers. I will not return here."}
{"text":"IHOBurgers.. I'll admit the burger was very good! Loaded generously w/ toppings, yummy soft bun, unlimited crispy fries, refills on sweet Tea!  All for 6.99 = Bet!"}
{"text":"Horrid service. Waited for our food for an HOUR AND A HALF and there was only two of us. Never again. The food was terrible. Eggs were so under cooked I wanted to puke. Crepes tasted like old grease. Terrible"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. First time, we didn't have very many problems, we were seated quickly but the waiter messed up on our drinks. My husband asked for an iced tea, he was served an iced coffee, he let it slide and we swapped drinks. 

The second time we visited, we had children in tow, there was a 20 minute wait time which isn't that bad so we waited. After almost 30 minutes passed, I went up and asked when we would be seated, the hostess said another 20 minutes, at that point I was annoyed and asked her why it would be another 20 minutes on top of the almost 30 we had already been waiting. The manager noticed my annoyance and proceeded to seat us himself. 

Our waiter was very nice but we could tell right away that he was new and nervous, he was all over the place. He mixed up the orders and brought out someone else's food to our table, only checked on us once, completely blew off the parents sitting at the table next to us, and proceeded to clear up another parents table while they took their children to the bathroom (they weren't even half done with their meal) he assumed they had left. Our section was filled with disgruntled customers. We didn't hold it too much against him though since we knew he was new, but the customer service should have been better. Hopefully next time we get lucky with better service."}
{"text":"Cant believe i give them a chance every time. Night crew always understaffed. Food takes years to arrive. Always regret coming here, but its my best option that time. Please have corporate find a solution because this chain is amazing, just needs good management."}
{"text":"IHOP is great at MOST places I've been but steer clear of the one on The Strip! I went there with my wife tonight, expecting to order the regular combo which is generally around $5-6.  NOT HERE!!! You are looking at $10.00 and UP!!

It seems that the owners felt because it's on the strip they can charge more. Well folks, that's how you lose repeating customers."}
{"text":"We arrived at this restaurant at 2:30 in the afternoon and it was not busy.  There was one employee in sight working the register.  Two parties a paid and she said it would be just a minute.  Then another customer came to the register and she took care of them. Finally....nope. Two more parties came to the register and as she started to take care of them we walked out and went elsewhere.  Seriously?"}
{"text":"I frequent this IHOP for one reason and one reason only: you can get acceptable breakfast food at any time of day. When it's 3AM and I really want to go get pancakes with a group of friends, IHOP is the only option and is adequate.

That said, the food here isn't great. Particularly anything that isn't breakfast food. It's hard to go too far wrong with basic breakfast food (pancakes, eggs, hash-browns, sausage, bacon, etc), and this stuff is fine. Not great, not noteworthy, just fine. After a few shaky experiences with the rest of the menu, however, I find it's generally best to just stick with the basics.

I haven't found the service here to be particularly awful, as some of the other reviews would imply, but it's certainly not stellar. When I come here, it's generally with a group (4-8 people), and we're never in a rush. Service is almost always slow, but we are happy to sit and socialize while we wait. It's also pretty common for them to mix up or forget a piece of someone's order, but again that's why you should just stick to the basics if you come here."}
{"text":"Went in on Memorial Day thought we would have a large crowd, however the crowd came after we sat down.  Our orders were taken and then the wait started...and we waited...and we waited.  Not sure what the hold up was for breakfast.  Guest all around us had been waiting for a very long time.  Some couldnt even receive refills.  Some had portions of meals that they were waiting on.  We eventually received our meal..it was good.  Just waited an unusual amount of time.  Had to wait to pay as well"}
{"text":"Happy birthday Mom! We decided to have a pancake breakfast together here. The location is prime because it's near the freeway so if you were low on funds, you can hit the highway! Hahaha jk, don't do that! We were seated quickly and the restaurant seemed a little busy but our server, Claudia, approached us and asked what we wanted to drink. She seemed a little under the weather, but I can understand that. It's raining in Vegas. How many times does it rain here?! 3 times a year? I'll give her a break. We told her it was my \"younger sister's\" birthday and we got a laugh out of her.

AYCE is the key phrase for this month it seems. $4.99 for AYCE pancakes but if you order a meal from the AYCE menu, it comes with your meal! The pancakes are fluffy and my eggs came out over medium-- just how I ordered them! And it came out faster than I thought! Crispy bacon, flavorful sausage and crispy hash browns! For IHOP, they really give you your money's worth in food and a little more. I'm sure if it wasn't soo gloomy outside, our server would've been a little bit more chipper, but oh wait! Something I didn't know they did at IHOP at all! The servers were huddled in the kitchen area and our server, Claudia, was holding a bowl of ice cream topped with whip cream. And the lead server yells, \"There's a birthday in the house!\" And I totally forgot we told her it was my mom's birthday! How awesome! It was really a pleasant surprise for my mom and us. Kudos to IHOP's servers and hostess for making my mom's birthday breakfast an awesome one! Happy eating! :)"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this IHOP in quite some time and when I finally went back on Sunday I was very disappointed.  The staff was walking right by us and didn't say a word to us as we were standing there waiting to be seated.  Other people walked in from another side and got seated before us, there was no organization from the host if there was even one.  When we finally got seated they tried to put the two of us at a big table in the middle of the room so we asked for a booth instead and had to wait from them to clean it.  Then they left a dirty coffee pot on our table we had to remove.  The staff was terrible (our waitress however was pretty decent) everyone else acted like they didn't know what was going on and was just walking around.  The place was filthy and the bathrooms were dirty and smelled. Also, you should tell some of the workers to take their piercings out of their face very unprofessional.  Maybe something a little more subtle.  The food wasn't great either it looked like they just threw it on our plate. It still tasted good but the presentation was poor. Not very happy with my experience and that place needs a makeover with the staff and making the place cleaner."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday breakfast.  I arrived at 7:30 AM and as I walked through the \"wait lobby\" it was very warm.  When I got to the hostess she smiled pleasantly and so I told her there would be 3 of us, however, the waiting lobby was already getting hot, she smiled and nodded.  I continued with if it's this hot at 7:30 in Arizona, this will be unbearable within a few hours when the Sunday after workship people begin filing in, again she smiled and nodded and said ok.  That's when I realized I was up against a \"Stepford\" hostess.

Bad enough...

We were seated right away, as we were ahead of any crowd, and ordered.  My breakfast companion specifically telling our server that she wanted the bacon with her breakfast, \"extra crispy\".  The server acknowledged and said ok.  My friend said if the cook has an issue with \"extra crispy\" please have him come out and she would tell him directly.  No no, not necessary assured the server, she would make sure that he understands.
Breakfast arrives and if you tried to hold the bacon upright if would instantly collapse upon itself is was so undercooked.

Not acceptable for such a name restaurant, and we likely will not be back."}
{"text":"Nice place. Not too crowded. 
Fast service( for a IHOP it was pretty fast, like 10 minutes to get my order). 
Good service and nice employees."}
{"text":"Came for dinner( I know it is a breakfast joint) but after 2 previous trips in for breakfast that were pretty bad, I thought we would try for dinner to see if any better,  it was not!!!  Started with soup that came out in a small bowl and was only half filled !  Eight spoonfuls later that was finished! Had steak tips,   wife had chicken , both were not hot. I asked if I could sub mashed potatoes for salad I was told no which I thought was strange as usually most restaurants will do that even if an up charge but apparently not at this IHOP. Kept hoping that a lot of the issues here were startup and working out the bugs but that does not seem to be the issue. Very disappointing as this area needs more restaurants but does not look like this one will be around too long as there was only one other couple in the place and I have the feeling they do not understand the basic concept of service"}
{"text":"We came here last week, on a weekday after lunch and breakfast....about 1:30.  The food we FINALLY got served was atrocious. The crepes were crunchy/tough, and my omelette was cold and tasteless. It seemed like maybe a cook had called out or they were short staffed in the kitchen because the manager looked like he was \"filling in\" back there. We gave it a pass and didn't complain because stuff happens....you can't control everything, and it was just one day. 
Fast forward to today. 11:00 on a Wednesday. We order a salad and an omelette. 45 minutes later,the food comes out....our poor waitress has probably gotten no tips because this IHOP location absolutely sucks. 
We'll drive somewhere else than give this one another try....."}
{"text":"The place was pack but only waited about 2 minutes to be seated. Kind of noisy inside due to the crowd. Coffee was really good and you get flavored coffee creamers as well as half and half. The coffee was fresh, hot and delicious. Ordered our food and it came really fast, scary fast, it was hot and very good. I NEVER eat at places like this, but if the experience was the same I'd eat here more frequently. I definitely recommend eating breakfast here. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Two weeks in a row; hot plates lukewarm food! Server was very good but I should have gone to Stack's!  Surprised restaurant was so crowded. Received a discount for the food but would have preferred it had been served hot in the first place! I asked the server if the kitchen problem has been fixed and she said yes? If you like cold eggs you will enjoy this IHOP. Manager invited us back, but I don't think so. I can cook my own lukewarm food at home!"}
{"text":"The waiter was pleasant and polite. The food on the other hand wasn't so great. The fruit on my entree was still nearly frozen solid. My napkin had dirty ink smudged finger prints on it and the silverware was gross. The environment was clean and again, the server was excellent."}
{"text":"Went there for a late coffee and sundae with a friend. Although there was only 1 waitress for the entire late night shift, we felt attended to throughout the meal. Also, keeping in mind it was IHOP, the filter coffee and sundae were great!"}
{"text":"I can believe how expensive IHOP is, I  haven't been here for a couple of years. The menu is different and I like that Thumbs up, but I notice that most of the meat on their meals is Pork. Not everyone eats Pork so they should add other choices. Thumbs down.   But the real deal is, a regular breakfast that used to be at least 8 dollars now is about 13.00 and if you want a different kind of pancakes they call it Upgrade those cost more, even that people still coming.  So personally y won't be here for another year or more.    To me is thumbs down.  I hope this will help somebody."}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever. Every single time. I've gone here a few times because it's the only IHOP in my area. It's never worth it. We don't get acknowledged when we walk in, this time we waited for about 20 minutes after giving our name.. multiple parties walked out.  Customers were complaining they had been sitting at their table for 30 minutes and had not been greeted. Not worth the drive."}
{"text":"Came in after midnight and there is a fair amount of people but by no means busy like a weekend morning would be... after waiting to be seated with no one acknowledging my husband and myself they finally came over to seat us. A waitress says I'll be back in a minute- well after 12 minutes she comes and asks what we want to drink and I politely let her know I am also ready to order and she said I have to get your drinks and then come back. I let her know we have waited for a decent amount of time and I would like to just order. Hesitantly she lets me. Now begins the even longer wait... let's hope my good is good because the service and the customer service is horrible and because of this alone I will never be back to this location.

Update... This literally is the worst location all the way around. A customer at another table was sat in the dark because their lightbulb was out and the customer literally changed the burnt out bulb with the table next to him and the waiter just laughed? Wow you can't make this up. The manager is rude to customers and my waitress is completely lost in space. The food was ok for 130am and probably because I've been here over an hour to eat some eggs and bacon 

STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION!!!"}
{"text":"Making the rounds with Christmas gift cards...

We had a new server.  He was as sweet as could be!  
We both ordered breakfast, an omelet for me and steak and eggs for my husband.  By the time our food arrived, my husband's breakfast had morphed into dinner.  His (very well cooked) steak was served with broccoli, potatoes, bread, and soup.  
No....we didn't have the heart to tell our server of the mistake......he worked so hard!!

Back again next year -"}

{"text":"The worst. Terrible service & gave me food poisoning- broke out in hives after having their fish and chips :'("}
{"text":"There were four of us and all but one person ordered eggs and pancakes. The other person ordered a patty melt. We all had waters. Our waitress, Julieta, came to our table 4 times total. We asked for refills for our waters and she brought one glass. Finally, our food came out after we waited 25 minutes for it and the patty melt and the side of pancakes weren't with it. We were all almost done with our food before the she came back to the table. She told us that the patty melt had been sent to the wrong table. By the time this happened, we were all fed up and just said that we didn't want it. She brought it five minutes later along with the pancakes. The patty melt didn't have grilled onions on it like it was supposed and we eventually told her to not charge us for the melt. She did take it off of our check, but overall this was not a good experience."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Our waitress Michelle was very attentive to us during our visit. I ordered my meal with no meat, and when it came out, it had meat. She immediately took it back and had them remake it for me. She was apologetic and made sure my food came out as fast as possible. She made small talk with us but did not bother us at all while eating. We will def be back to this location! This is also the nicest and cleanest IHop I have been to!"}
{"text":"Just love it here and especially when Kay is our server! She has to be one of my favorite servers of all time! She is so attentive and friendly  Definitely worth taking a trip and ask for Kay! She will take care of you, and always do it with a smile!"}
{"text":"been to a lot of ihops. this one is old but the food is better than most others. the staff are really down to earth too. I see their managers working hard out there with their staff. good for them. a lot of other places, managers just like to sit around in the office."}
{"text":"Paul was an awesome waiter..  Very friendly professional and took pride in what he appears to love doing..  Food was fantastic too..  Thank you Paul"}
{"text":"Place was packed on Saturday Afternoon for lunch, Once we were sat at our table it took about 15 minutes before someone came over just to get our drinks.  The waitress that took our order was doing this out of courtesy since it was not her station.  The manager was no where to be seen, finally, we saw the manager or hostess walking around trying to deliver food order but looked like she was mad as hell and did not take time to run the restaurant like she should have been doing.  I can understand being busy but I have been a waiter and manager of a restaurant before and this was a poor excuse of how this day was going.  I do applaud the waitress who served us and if not for her we could have been sitting there for another 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I wish I never came here!!! I love IHOP. But this place is horrible. We came in a group of four, about 11:30 pm on Saturday the 24th. And it all started with the hostess. 

She was not glad to see us first of all. I felt if we were bothering her by showing up. She was slow to seat us and walked like a sloth. 

As we sat down we over saw a few waitresses talking about how one has no one or nothing to do and the other two telling her to just go find something to do. 

Our waitress came over after a good 5 to 7 minute wait. ( not any of the girls that where bickering from earlier.) we asked for water and that took a few more minutes. 

We ordered our meals and I did asked for them to use sour dough bread instead of the regular bread for the double-double bacon BLT. 

This must have really caused an issue in the kitchen. It took 45 minutes to get our order out. I looked around and saw other people leaving, some left half the bill in cash and took off. Waitresses bad talking customers and the manager yelling at them to pick up orders. Clean this and clear that table. I feel the Manager had no control.

I was really angry at this time. I received half the portion as the same order, one of the people I was dining with. The sour dough change must have really been an issue. I only got half a sandwich!!! Half the bacon and lettuce !!! All I ask to change was the bread!!! 

But it gets better. I asked for a side of fruit with my sandwich. I got two grapes, 2 two slices of orange and eight pieces of honey dew. Really eight!!! I had a bowl of honey dew. I eat my half sandwich,  two grapes and two slices of oranges. 

I could wait to leave. The bill was paid and we left. Not the best tip either.  Don't go here , drive to another IHOP. It's worth the it to leave.  The managers and staff all need to be fired and start over with all new crew. The worst ever!!!"}
{"text":"Can't say much about the food, but they sat us in the area that was \"faster service\" which would be the bar. We waited for 20 minutes and never even got a drink order. Server after server walked by ignoring us... Finally we walked out and were told sorry. This was at 4pm in the afternoon. Not rush hour. Service was as bad as the casino."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLY slow. We arrived here at 9:35 for a quick breakfast before our flight at 12:30. 42 minutes later, still waiting to even get our food. The whole point of IHOP is that you know you're getting basic quality food, but it'll be fast. Not here. Avoid if you have somewhere you need to be."}
{"text":"Been sitting here for an hour. When we sat down the waitress came over right away and took our drink order and our food orders. After 45 minutes of still waiting for our food the waitress comes over and says that she put our orders in wrong and has to retake our order. She was sorry and that the our food would be out in 10 minuets and the manager would be over to talk to us. It's been another 15 minutes and still no food or manager. I gave 1 star because I had to give something. This ridiculous and very bad service. I will be back for an update on how much long we waited."}
{"text":"Came here a couple days ago with my boo. previosly remember telling him id never been to ihop, so at 5 am we both cant sleep so he says\"lets go to ihop.!\"  Even though i was tired i agreed to let him take me.  Our server Jackson brought us our drinks as i randomly get sick and run the bathroom.. i come back and theres my sprite, as well as saltine crackers on the table,i couldnt believe such hospitality. Later after we cashed my bf started get a lil teary eyed, because we had our anniversary a few day prior and jackspn brought him some napkins.. i was beyond belief.. coming from a server/bartending i really apprecited, and respected his service.. thanks Jackson."}
{"text":"Food - mediocre for how it's supposed to be , SERVICE almost an hour for food had to follow up c almost an hour for 2 orders , only  30% of the tables were filled not sure why service was so slow , horrible .. so sad this has to happen to a new ihop"}
{"text":"Sunday morning busy, but party of 8 seated within 10 minutes.
Waiting 40 minutes after ordering for food. EVERYTHING was cold. After that long wait teenagers did not want to wait any longer as they were \"starving\".  Server and staff were polite and nice."}
{"text":"If you have to wait more than 5 minutes for someone to even acknowledge your presence after you're seated, let alone take your drink order or simply bring you some water because it's 110 degrees outside then you should get up and leave. And that's what I did."}
{"text":"This is a new location so naturally everything inside is new and well kept. The wait staff is friendly and very attentive, despite being overwhelmed during their peak hours they did a good job at checking in on guests regularly. The food and wait times were standard for IHOP, which is decent quality for the money spent. 

Our only hiccups were with the waiting area and table -- as is the case with most restaurants, there is very limited space to sit/stand while you wait for a table. Being in the final weeks of my pregnancy, sitting outside in the sun during the AZ summer is quite difficult, but at the same time there was no space to sit or even stand inside. Once we got a table for two, the table was quickly filled up with coffee cups and water, leaving little room to maneuver while eating. Despite this, the server brought two additional glasses of water although there was no space (he was trying to push our plates and stuff while we were eating to make more space..) and they weren't yet needed - we sent them back. 

Aside from that everything is great. I recommend coming to this location - I normally get turned off from IHOP due to sanitation and cleanliness which was not the case here!"}
{"text":"Rude waitress. Snappy attitude. would've been nice to know that the wait time just to get our drinks ordered was going to be over 20 minutes and to order food almost 30. 
had several servers come around our table and no one helped. would not recommend coming here if you're hungry . You'll end up starving here."}
{"text":"This location gets busy on almost every morning. This morning was no exception, and the wait was about 10 minutes. The service is pretty standard and the food is what you would expect from an IHOP. The Peach and praline pancakes on the spring menu were really delicious."}
{"text":"Real nice, small IHOP near our hotel at the Stratosphere. It was open during xmas and so we had to come eat here, since most other places were either closed or had jacked up prices. Our waitress was very great, especially being that she was working on a holiday (poor girl), and the food was typical IHOP food, so it was good. Nice having something conveniently by the strat other than a fast food."}
{"text":"Great fast service and caring staff but the place is filthy . I don't think it's been cleaned since it opened . The seats were filthy with noticeable dirt and the bathroom was as bad as a gas station bathroom . Here's a pic of the sink in the bathroom . Disgusting ! The dirt filled the tiles and corners of the tiles . Cleanliness in a place of food should be paramount . Otherwise food was timely and a decent value ."}
{"text":"The closest ihop near our hotel.  And let me tell you, this Ihop's location is a definitely a bad area.  We're sitting near a window with an despicable view.  Homeless people and suspicious folks outside.  At the time of our visit 6/13/2013 they had a health inspection rating of a B.  I don't know much about the health and wellness rating in Nevada, but in California there is rarely anything below an A.  That's just something to watch out for.  

The service was okay, it seemed as if we didn't want to be served.  The server helping us seemed very impatient.  The food we ordered was masked with MSG & overall the experience was bland.  I would stay away from this very location."}
{"text":"Went to this location for breakfast. We choose this one because of the doughnut French toast. We sat for 15 mins and I had to ask the hostess where me server was. Then she came over took the entire order and brought back our drinks.  Food came out fairly quickly... however my Apple Fritter French Toast was terrible. First there is a light amount of batter on either side. The apples on top were COLD therefor I felt like I was just eating a Apple Fritter.  The server NEVER came back to see how it was. I had to wave her down to get my check.  Terrible service not so good food... ya won't go back to that location. And it was not busy at all."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped at this IHOP on our way to a baby shower. We were coming from CA early in the morning and what kept us going was the thought of being able to enjoy a delicious breakfast. Well, we were not disappointed! Although it was very busy, we were seated in under 15 minutes. Our server, Brittany, was extremely friendly and very attentive! 
Great service and great food. Needless to say, we will be coming back to this IHOP on any future AZ road trips (:"}
{"text":"Pretty ghetto and noisey and they gave us a kids size orange juice since we wanted ice on the side. Free refills though. We ordered mozzarella sticks and they taste like they were made yesterday with the cheese not even stringy"}
{"text":"I called in a breakfast order for five people 40 minutes before I arrive. I was told my food would be ready in 20-30 minutes.  Therefore I thought it would be ready by the time I arrived. When I arrive to pick up my order, I was told my food was being bagged. 15 minutes after I paid I was told the exact same story. They are obviously under staffed for the morning shift. As servers walked in for their shifts they were told to hurry up and start working. When my food finally came out. An hour after I called it in! I was told that one of my orders was still being made because they \"over cooked the eggs\".  This is ridiculous. I don't mid waiting but they obviously forgot my order and kept lying."}
{"text":"I feel like all Ihops are pretty consistent with the food and service. Ive never gone to an Ihop and been like omg this is awesome or omg this is bad. Generally the service and food is decent all I hops I've tried. This location is no different! Its a good place for breakfast and lunch i think personally but can't really think of it as a dinner place. When I think IHOP I think pancakes, we all do. I know when I come here I'm gonna get what I think I'm gonna get. Ive been here a few times and Ill be back."}
{"text":"Great food. Crappy service. Had to wait 10 minutes to get seated simply because they were understaffed on boxing day.  They had 8 open tables and yet no one to seat , no one at cash register. A few servers were serving those that were lucky enough to get seated, but no one available to seat people coming in. We left with extreme prejudice....previous experiences tell me food is good, but the service has never been up to par but today was particularly bad.

However the owner responded professionally to my complaint and with past experiences I have decided to change my rating from a 2* to 5*. I will be going back and will assume this is a one off experience as previous experiences have been good. Service not perfect, but still better than a lot of places I have visited.
I also respect professional responses."}
{"text":"This I hop is very good the service is very good I like it a lot here the man servicing us is very nice too us the food here is very good I love it here"}
{"text":"Okay I'm a sucker for some good cheap pancakes and I used to love IHOP but today I was at work and I ordered online to pick up.. I ordered strawberry & cream crepes and after I already left I realized they gave me completely  plain crepes.... with about 2 star berries on the side with a bunch of liquid the strawberries were soaked in... they didn't close the lid to that so I had strawberry liquid covering the bag :)) and to top it off my crepes(with no cream) we're not hot and they tasted like rubber??? SO HORRIBLE!!! Want to give 0 stars"}
{"text":"Horrible experience...yet AGAIN. No acknowledgement we were even seated for over 15 minutes. Asked \"host\" who was clueless but did seem to go & tell someone that never acknowledged us either. After another 10 minutes I went up to the front & our waiter Landis was actually ringing guests out as well as \"waitoring\". He said \"I'm your waitor but I've been busy\". Okaaaay sat down he eventually decided to come over...long story short food was cold, poor quality...Corina the \"manager\" could careless. Jeremy the general Mgr was nice but too little too late. 
Bye I-slob...never coming back."}
{"text":"My family and I come to this location quite frequently. I usually get the waffle combo it's great. Together we've had quite a few things on the menu, consistently good food. The restaurant is always clean in the service is always friendly. Depending on where you go sometimes there could be a wait if it's very busy. Never had a bad meal or bad service here would definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"I went here with my little girl. SHE LOVES IHOP. That's why we ate here. She hears cussing and she will not repeat it. There is a lot of cussing in this IHOP. The food was good for the IHOP. The ambience and people around you are \"not appetizing.\" I don't say that much about any places.. ever. The service was very good and I had my food within 20 minutes during the Saturday morning rush. But if you are craving IHOP or pancakes and you are in this particular area, you don't have a choice now do you?"}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve a one star. Service was beyond bad. Waited over an hour and half for food that never showed up. People who arrived after us were seated and feed before us. Ended up leaving and still had to pay for drinks after waiting a hour and half without staff coming to check on us, was not compensated for wait only received a sorry for a manager. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Bad service. Long wait for food, especially when the place was empty. App sampler was served with no plates. The butter on my crepes was frozen, and the crepes were cold. The eggs and bacon were terrible. My son's chocolate milk came with all the chocolate unmixed at the bottom, and the server set it down and told him to mix it. Server disappeared at the end of the meal and I had to request the bill and a to go box from the cashier. Also, the music playing was obnoxious old pop songs. I heard Amy Grant and the Backstreet Boys just while we were waiting for apps, and now \"I Want It That Way\" is stuck in my head. We could have had a better time getting fast food and saved my sanity and $50."}
{"text":"Slowest. Service. Ever. Arrived at 10:45. Greeted at 11:00. Food arrived 11:50. I ordered an omelette...it had been sitting under a heating lamp for 10 minutes...the beef and cheese were the evidence for that. Server was nice but no apologies or updates. As if she was used to this sort of thing. Good example of a badly run restaurant, which is a shame since it's in a prime location. It will stay busy for a while until word of mouth kills it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite IHOP to go to for a few reasons.
it's not trashy, like some of the other locations, it's kept very neat.
The food usually comes out quickly.
The staff is great and you can see management actively making sure people are happy.
I'm only giving it four stars because there have been a few times that the service could have used some work."}
{"text":"This location is small, warm inside, and very dim lighting. Not the best IHOP I've ever experienced. The neighborhood is questionable...right next to the projects. 

The food was good, just like any other IHOP. Our waitress was great, wish I would have caught her name so I could give her a shout out.

\"Meh. I've experienced better.\" but overall it was \"A-OK\"! :)"}
{"text":"Brought my dad to this location for his birthday because he wanted to have breakfast at IHOP. Worst mistake ever! Service and food was terrible! We had asked for creamers for our coffees in the beginning, but did not receive them. I had to get up and ask another server for them. Afterwards our server came to take our order. Once she took our order we were asked if we wanted any hot sauce or ketchup and we said we wanted both. Another person came with our food she set it on the table and we noticed that my moms strawberry pancakes were missing. Instead she brought her strawberry crepes. I told her that my mom had ordered the strawberry pancakes instead of crepes. My dads eggs came out over easy and he had ordered them over medium. My moms plate came with sausage and bacon and she had only ordered bacon for that plate because she does not like sausage. Also she had ordered jalapeños for her scrambled eggs with cheese, but what they did not tell us was that they were going to be canned jalapeños. She had wanted fresh jalapeños. At least they could have told us that the jalapeños were gonna be from a can if they did not have any fresh ones.  Ten minutes went by and we were still waiting on tabasco and ketchup. Once again my dad had to get up and get them from another table. Never again will we come to this location! The IHOP at Central is a whole lot better."}
{"text":"This IHOP is a great place for the family. Everybody is nice the food is IHOP so it's good. We came from LA and let me tell you, the fruit bowl is AMAZING!!! Pancakes are good, and then servers are really nice!"}
{"text":"today my boyfriend, his sister and i all came here as we usually do. we were seated fast and our waitress, NORMA, asked us what drinks we'd like and all 3 of us asked for water. it took longer than usually for just 3 glasses of water as the place wasn't busy at all. She took our order and when our food came out the sisters food had spilt honey mustard on her plate (not a big deal but not everybody likes honey mustard). as we asked for an extra plate she seemed like she didn't acknowledge us and after 5 minutes of waiting for 1 plate she threw it down on the table. we said thank you and she said \"yeah\" and asked the table behind us how they were doing. Not once did Norma bother asking us if we were okay or needed anything. She walked past us and we had to stop her to ask her for the check as she kept walking and said \"yup\". she gave us the check we said thank you and got up to go pay at the front and she didn't say anything. as we were waiting for someone to ring us in all we heard was her screaming \"THANK YOU , YOURE WELCOME\" as she was picking up out table. she then walked to the back and asked 'Janay' to ring us in before she \"knocks somebody out\". Janay was very nice and asked if everything was okay and rang us in and we were on our way. I am not one to write bad reviews but this is just crossing the line. Working F&B is not an easy job especially when you have customers that can be very stressful or rude which we were not and her little comments to us and about us were very rude and crossing the line. If i could give 0 stars i would just because of Norma. Every other time we come here the service is great and acceptable. this is the first time i've ever seen this lady and hopefully the last time because i WILL NOT be nice to her if i have her again. :)"}
{"text":"Ok first of all we came here because there was free pancakes! When we got here the wait was 35 minutes but that was expected. Once we sat down we were greeted by a nice waiter! She got are drinks so fast like only a minute! After that we got are free pancakes. It was a 3 pancake stack. It was good though!!! Also nice variety for syrups! It took a little while to get are check but it was really crowded so I wasn't surprised. When I left everyone at the front desk said bye! Great service! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Food is alright except for they were cold. Ihop is ihop. The problem is the service. Ihop used to be the most favorite franchise before this particular place. It took 30 minutes to get just split decision menu and some pancakes. Bacon cheeseburgers got burned bacon bits. One of my buddies ordered all you can eat pancakes and after one time they delivered the pancakes and then we have never seen my waitress again until the pay time. Dont ever order all u can eat menu cause no one will deliver them after one plate. The worst ihop and will never come back again."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, we all come for the pancakes! The blueberry syrup along with the light and fluffy buttermilk pancake ls are just perfect. I do like how they are always coming out with something new. This place is pretty clean, the bathrooms are a bit small but that's not the main feature. They always have clean booster seats and high chairs which is nice if you have kids. This location usually has pretty friendly staff and are usually on the ball. Like any other restaurant you'll get the occasional newbie server or the one who might be having a bad day. Pretty good place overall."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for our drink, over an hour for our food and silverware, and the food was cold. Hash browns were bricks. Waitress threw check on table, and we were charged for food we didn't even pay for. The manager was very nice and took care of everything. She was the saving grace of this experience."}
{"text":"Service was great, was seated right away. Our server Andy was awesome, the food was good as well."}
{"text":"The seasonal raspberry white chocolate chip pancakes are amazing! It comes with eggs, bacon, sausage and hash browns. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I thought I'd give this new IHOP a shot and was disappointed. The pancakes weren't even cooked completely and falling apart (prolly cuz the batter was over stirred). Plus the simple things like coffee was watered down and cold brew iced coffee didn't even taste like coffee. The only good is the service for a new crew and the eggs and bacon being decent. Other than that this place needs new cooks before going again. Let them work out the kinks as IHOP is usually decent quick bite type of breakfast."}
{"text":"Phoned in a to go order at 9:04am arrive at iHop at 9:30am. A young Latino man asked to assist me, told him my name and for the next 17 minutes I seen him serving others in the restaurant. At that point I become impatient and ask another employee for assistance and my order was brought right out. I then asked how long was the order waiting? They told me it's been waiting for the last 20 minutes. Basically I was racially profiled by that Latino man, iHop needs to look into bad costumer service. That will bring them down."}
{"text":"My omelet was ok but my waiter Michael was excellent and very friendly. He was very knowledgable of the menu and made suggestions. I had the spinach omelet and my girlfriend had a chicken salad. I'm not usually a big tipper but I had no issue with giving him a healthy tip."}
{"text":"Had a great waitress, Cheryl. The food was delicious! Overall great experience. However, the manager that was working was horrible. He was throwing things and yelling in front of customers. He wouldn't look at the waitresses when they spoke to him. He spoke over them. He was very rude and I never even spoke to him. I couldn't imagine working for him. He kept telling his cook to \"shh\" while he was out here yelling at servers. The hostess tried to seat a table and they were already sitting when he yells \"offer them that booth over there!\" Very rude and unprofessional. I've worked at iHop before and had a similar manager. Must be a requirement when hiring."}
{"text":"WARNING!!! The service at this restaurant is absolutely horrendous. It took my family ten minutes to get seated and we were the only people in the restaurant! Once we got seated we didn't start to get served for another ten minutes. Didn't get drinks because we walked out after another couple minutes. Took our business to another local restaurant."}
{"text":"don't get the country omelette. or any omelette with hash browns in it for that matter.  they use it as filler so the omelette has hardly any actual egg or substance at all. i was so pissed bc i love cheese and ham and bacon but it had none it was all hash browns???? just don't get it unless you're not hungry and love potatoe"}
{"text":"Visited IHOP today with my girlfriend, her two daughters, and three grandkids.  The food was fresh for breakfast/lunch.  Our server Natalie was very helpful and patient.  The cost was great for the entire meal (we used an IHOP coupon from the Sunday paper circulars).  When taking kids or grandkids, IHOP has a great menu for kids, who can have changing tastes."}
{"text":"I have been going to this particular IHOP location for years now, and one thing I have learned, is to get there early on the weekends if you want to avoid a wait.  So that is exactly what my gf and I did today, Sunday 12/11/11.  We arrived around 9:30am, we able to find parking without difficulty, and did not have to wait at all for a table!

After going through the standard preliminaries, being seated, placing drink orders, ordering our meals, etc, my gf and I were relieved when our food finally arrived due to our mutual hunger.  I ordered  the 3 egg breakfast, which included, four pieces of bacon, and three pancakes (I ordered the blueberry pancakes).  In addition, I ordered a side of hash browns, just to be certain that my hunger pain would be satisfied.

FOOD:  
My gf and I ordered our eggs scrambled with cheese and they arrived to our mutual liking -hot and with plenty of cheese (see pics).  I thought my bacon was a bit under-cooked however.  2 of the pieces were cooked perfectly and two were definitely semi-raw.  I left one of my slices because I did not feel safe eating it.  The hash browns were standard.  They were good, but def not great, and in need of some salt and pepper.  The best part of our breakfast was the pancakes.  I ordered the blueberry pancakes, which were  \"REAL and SPECTACULAR!\" (see pics)  They were full of soft, juicy blueberries and the warm maple syrup set everything right off!

SERVICE:
Our service was great.  Our server was polite, efficient and to the point.  She refiled our waters twice and all of our food arrived exactly as we had ordered it. We were able to get in and out within 40-50min.  I will say that when we left around 10:30, there was that line of people waiting in the door and standing outside in the cold waiting to be seated!

If you are thinking of going to this IHOP location, I recommend getting the bacon cooked well, as well as arriving early and to try one of their flavored pancakes.  I mean this place isn't called the International House of Pancakes for NOTHING!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast at this location this morning. While there was a mixup with my sons order (he order the cinnamon pancakes) they ended up bringing him something he liked even more (cinnamon swirl brioche French toast). Our server, Aaron I believe, was absolutely amazing. Never an empty glass on our table and always had a smile. He really helped make our breakfast even that much better."}
{"text":"Not a fan!!!! The service was good. The waitress was a little slow but she apologized for being slow and brought me a lot of coffee which I appreciated because I was up before 7am that day.

The reason I'm not a fan is because of the food.  I realize this is IHOP and the food isn't supposed to be fantastic but it's supposed to be represented corrected by the pictures on the menu and warm right? I ended up getting the fit and free breakfast meal. Which consisted of two scrambled substitute eggs, dry toast, a cup of fruit and two pieces of turkey bacon. Sounds good right? I thought it would be too! 

When the food came out I was super dissappointed. I ended up getting half an egg, a bowl of spoiled fruit that I couldn't eat, turkey bacon and toast. The toast was good but can you really mess up toast? The turkey bacon was chewy and my eggs were cold. I really wish they would have told me there was not going to be as much food as advertised or I would have gotten something different."}
{"text":"Took 20 minutes to get my first drink order and it was a soft drink, she brought the wrong drink at  first. And didn't ask what sides we wanted with our meals so of course meal came out with the wrong sides. The staff here are horrible and slowest service ever even when it's not busy. Food was good but service was a ZERO."}
{"text":"Horrible! Tried to take my moms medications when she asked if they had seen them, and the waiter was wiping stuff off her hands, and the table wasn't even cleaned off, and 35 minutes wait and we got cold food!!



When we came back, we also saw that our table wasn't even clean."}
{"text":"So much food and soooo delicious!! Praline peach pancakes with a scoop of ice cream. Crazy good!!!! Great service as well. Nice clean restaurant, too."}
{"text":"This was my first time to this IHOP and I'm usually a big fan of the stuffed French toast. Well if you want to wait over an hour like I did this is your place! After being seated and watched two new tables get sat and served before us I was not pleased. I was not check in on durning my breakfast and my eggs arrived cold as well as the sausage. I will not be back or recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Deserves not a Damn single star. My husband and I went to have late brunch here and let's just say it ended with us being sick. First my order was messed up. Then my meat wasn't cooked well again. And my husband's burger was horrible. No flavor what so ever and the cheese taste spoiled. I felt so bad for our server I just decided to play it off and got a to go box which we dumped asap. By the time we got home we both puked and haven't been good since. We should have not paid for anything. It was that horrible. AWFUL!!!!! Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Okay to start we came here with a parts of 6 (my kids wife and myself ) and we're seated fairly quick .  The server did not smiler introduce herself but was fast . We got the kids pancakes and breakfast sampler for us . The food was served promptly but the kids pancakes were soggy , not to big of a deal because they smother them in syrup anyways . The whole time she came by once so I never got a refill. The price was not bad but the check out to pay was crowded due to the wait line also being right there . Maybe it was due to the time I was there . Three stars due to cost and time . Would be less based on service."}
{"text":"I am not really a fan of IHOP but in all fairness I went along with what my friends wanted to eat. It is conveniently located right next to the Stratosphere Hotel, where we happened to be staying, and we could walk there. Upon arrival we noticed that this place was packed. There was a crowd of people waiting to be seated and since it was just three of us we were seated first! 

After overlooking the menu I went with the Simple & Fit omelette and grapefruit juice. The omelette consists of egg substitute, spinach, cheese, and tomatoes in addition to a side of fresh fruit.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ihop-las-vegas-3?select=YmYM2mV7aK_ftwojzOW54w

My order was the last to arrive and I was surprised by the size of the omelette, it was HUGE! Although it was large it was not good at all but since I was hungry and not willing to wait another 20 minutes for another plate I just ate it. The fresh fruit was not fresh at all, it was a small bowl of mush. Yuck! To top off the rest of my order my grapefruit juice was not even chilled and for the cost of that sucker it should have been amazingly refreshing. 

Service seemed to be lacking and for all the staff they had you would think they would be able to accommodate their customers. So disappointing! I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful staff. Though it was crowded, we didn't have to wait long and our server was very personable and efficient."}
{"text":"Everything else came out well, but this turkey bacon avocado wrap came with basically no turkey and barely any bacon as you can see in the pic, ordered to pick up and didn't see this til I was home and eating it, usually get pretty good service with this restaurant but lately hasn't been well"}
{"text":"The worse! Seriously, we stood at register to pay for ten minutes. No one cared. Left exact amount and walked out. The server couldn't help us fast enough and get us the check. Left and he was outside with the other servers smoking a cigarette. That's why no one was inside to collect our money. OMG where is Frank?"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this meal higher than a 2, but there was too much wrong with our meal.

We drove to this IHOP instead of going to the one on S Las Vegas Blvd thinking that this location was further from the Strip, so the service may be better and it would be less crowded so we could get in and out.

Unfortunately, it's location didn't improve our experience. It took just over 30 minutes to get our meal (despite that it was 10 AM on  Friday), and when the food finally came my husbands dish was wrong. The glass that my milk was in had lipstick on it from a prior guest. The coffee carafe set at our table was virtually empty, making refills impossible. The bad thing was, we struggled to flag our server down to get some of this addressed. But because we were scheduled to be somewhere in less than a half hour (thanks to our food taking so long), we chose to just finish our meal and go."}
{"text":"The place was packed when we arrived, but fortunately we were seated immediately. Once seated, we were given a generous 20 minutes to decide what we wanted before our waitress took our orders. I felt bad for the group next to us who had their orders taken only a few minutes after they sat down. They must have been flustered. The food came shortly after 35 minutes. I'll be honest. It tasted really good. They say hunger is the best seasoning on food and they are not wrong. 

We were able to enjoy our food since the waitress never came by to bother with any questions.

My only regrers were while paying at the resister, I noticed the hostess had a big round button on her shirt that read \"Smiles are Free\". I wasn't sure if we had to make request for those smiles because we never received any from the our waitress or the hostess herself. Not even eye contact.

Other then that, it wasn't too bad an experience."}
{"text":"We always have a great time here as a family. Even the wait staff will play along with us.  I enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Nice place.  They took our coupon.

Spacious & good service"}
{"text":"From reading the other reviews, I think we got lucky.  My family went on Easter morning and had great service, the food was excellent, and service was fast for a busy day.

Used our $5 coupon from JB Dollar with no problems.  Our server was very nice, and checked on us from time to time."}
{"text":"I came back to give Ihop another try. I can't say that my redemption  proved me wrong, whatsoever. I got the 2x2x2 which consisted of two pancakes, two strips of bacon (or sausage) and two eggs. Nothing about my meal really impressed me. It is for sure a little below average to me. My total was around $7 for that meal, which isn't terrible but I would rather spend that money elsewhere for a better value. 

My friend ordered french toast, which looked good. in addition, my friend had ordered two sides of hashbrowns. I cannot exaggerate that the hashbrowns did not come out until we were done with our meals. By the time they came my friend had actually forgot about them because it had been so long. mind you, our food didn't even come out that fast, in fact it was a pretty long wait compared to other restaurants. I think our server should have taken the four dollars off of his bill since he didn't even get to enjoy them with his meal. they also had oil literally dripping from them and soaking in a pool of it on the plate.

All and all, I will probably never return unless I'm dragged there against my will. This is just another example of huge corporations providing half ass food and being stingy with their money and discounts."}
{"text":"The service, organization and overall cleanliness of this IHOP location drag it down.  Went here recently and noticed more than a few tables with messy dishes and dirty plates that needed to be cleared and cleaned.  The floor was full of crumbs.  Its like this placed need to close for a few days and undergo a comprehensive cleaning.    After waiting five minutes for someone to clean one of the 10 empty booths, it took what seemed like forever for the food to arrive.     

Despite these shortcomings, the food is great!  Its always cooked to my liking and the portions are bountiful.  Its that perfect post bar-night, hang-over cure food. 

Surprisingly this place usually isn't super crowded like other IHOP locations in the Charlotte area (i.e. University location).  There's plenty of parking and a bunch of other stores and shops in the plaza this IHOP is located in.  

Go for the food and nothing else."}
{"text":"Ordered over easy eggs was, I was served partly raw eggs. When I talked to the server she told me it was their policy to serve over easy in this fasion and it was not raw. I am a licended food service worker and a cook. Our server also only came to the table to take our order, bring our food, and finally for the check. She would not get her manager. I would give a lower rating if I could."}
{"text":"IHOP used to be good, but in recent years has become overpriced and very mediocre. You have to practically beg for warm syrup at this place. Seriously?"}
{"text":"Came to this IHOP while me and the family are on vacation in Las Vegas. Came in a little after 10pm so we weren't sure we'd be able to get the Kids Eat For Free from 4pm to 10pm deal. The waitress that attended us was nice enough to just give us the kids deal anyway which was awesome of her. Ordered myself the Spicy Chicken Burger with some onion rings and it was delicious. Service was great as the waitress attended us constantly. Ended up paying about $30 for just me and my wife which I thought was a little pricey. Overall it's a good spot to get some great food quick and avoiding busy restaurants along the strip."}
{"text":"This is one location  that is not very busy.  I tried the crepes but it was not sweet. Service is always  good . This time their  pancakes were rubbery. Pancakes were a little small and the portion of butter were small. St
Rawberries were  sourer"}
{"text":"Rude employees very slow service. I don't think the manager prepared for a holiday rush. Put in a very small table. Will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Was waiting outside since no seating inside. Hostess stood at stand and skipped us without even going to check outside."}
{"text":"Well, it's IHOP.  If you've never been to an IHOP before, this one seems to be a bit busier than the others but the overall feel is the same:

- Fast food quality for restaurant prices
- Unlimited mediocre quality
- Lots and lots and lots of screaming/yelling children

I don't know if the ratio of families with children versus everyone else is simply high or I am just unlucky, but almost always I find myself seated next to the large table of a family who thinks it's cute / appropriate / whatever to let their children scream and run around the table / restaurant.

This isn't IHOP's fault, but they could at least politely ask them to have their children seated while in the restaurant so as not to disturb other patrons.  Or is that just forbidden now?  I don't know.

I used to get the Harvest Grain 'N Nut Pancakes here a lot (delicious), but changed it up.  Their Simple & Fit vegetable omelette is pretty good, but a little salty.

There's coupons that show up in the mail every now and again that entice us to come back.  Then we go and realize why we don't go without them."}
{"text":"I have been going to this IHOP for many years and the service has gone to crap. The last 2 times I went with my husband and kids, the service was just terrible. Bad with refills, bad with attending all customers, just bad. I went yesterday and it took a while for the server to come to our table. After serving our food, she was nowhere to be found. Luckily a nice gentleman that was working the section next to her, took care of us. It was so bad a family of 4 got seated but never talked to so they walked out. It was not busy at all! The restaurant was more than half empty! We talked to the manager about the situation, and she surely didn't give a crap! Everything she said was like if it was recited. Terrible service, terrible management."}
{"text":"Only gave 1 star because 0 wasn't an option. Where to begin.. first. Walked in on crutches. Stood in line.  Then finally got a seat. No silverware for anything ordered coffee. Asked for 2 tickets. Made it VERY AWARE that I needed decaf husband even said caffeine will kill her (won't but can't have it for medical reasons) came out we regular and \"decaf\" I confirmed please make sure 100%that this is decaf I CAN NOT have regurlar. Said it was. Trusted that. Asked 5 times for silverware so we can stir our coffee.. I stirred with my finger so that I could actually enjoy my coffee. Nope it was cold.. had to walk up on crutches multiple times and ask for silverware before we got it (after causing a scene). Then 33 min after we ordered we still did not have food. Walk to restroom and came back. Dirty gross bathroom. All 3 other people in my party had their food.. I did not have mine. They brought out mine all on seperate plates. Asked for extra crispy hashbrowns. Mine were the only ones undercooked.  The waitress I couldn't tell if she was new or not, but when all my food came out on MULTIPLE PLATES ARE NOW COLD. The manager dismisses her to help another table and then she took over. Where she said I took your meal and compt it and added a 20% discount. Great not even halfway through with the cold food. And she brings us 1 receipt instead of 2 like we asked. Put it down and walked away without commin back the manager did say she was sorry but made excuses as to why my food was wrong on multiple plates, while all 3 others had theirs correct it made no sense. Then to be dismissed before we even got half way done. Was insulting. Not once did they ask if we wanted anything else etc. This LOCATION Is horrible. Messy, rude, unorganized and untrained in customer service. I will never go back to an IHOP ever.. much less this one. Save yourselves and go to the goood egg. much better than ihop. AND IT WASN'T DECAF!!!!!!! so now lots of pain and Dr appointments for this. Great. Way to waste a bunch of money.   Glad caffeine only hurts me and doesn't kill me. Good job ihop your employees SUCK"}
{"text":"Took my niece and nephew out for breakfast. There dad is old school and never takes them out for pancakes. So we dropped in and all got pancakes. When we arrived they said 20-30mins. Glad they all had groups of 6+. We got seated in a booth within 10mins. Ate and went on about our day."}
{"text":"Now, we ONLY went here with the intention of having a good breakfast. ..with that being said. ..

This place was very crowded on a Sunday morning!  That happens to be common for a good eatery.  The wait was about 15 minutes,  not too bad. 

Restaurant was clean and inviting.  We were seated with a prompt visit from our waitress.  She was polite and attentive to our food requests. 

When our food arrived, at first, it looked appetizing.   Then I went to take a bite of grits....it was full of lumps, one quite large in size.  Maybe some people are not as particular about that facet but I AM!!! Being a true grit lover, you have to make them without lumps. The waitress did attempt to bring another bowl which was no less appealing.        :(         The eggs were prepared right. So that's a plus. My orange juice was very good, if you like pulp! But oh wow did I pay for it! Try $3 per glass (standard glass).

All in all the service was good, but the food was a disappointment to me and my husband.  I usually do not mention other competitors in my reviews but last week I had breakfast at Bob Evans (for the first time ) and was blown away at how GOOD everything was including the EGGS and GRITS. Sorry but I believe they just set the standard for GREAT food and how it should taste ! This was just mediocre food and the grits were TERRIBLE! 

Will I come back? No! I will spend the same amount of money ($27 for 2 dishes) driving to Bob Evans or find a better local breakfast diner."}
{"text":"This is the best IHOP that I've been to. The manager says they make about $100,000/day compared to others at about $15,000/day. They work really hard for our customer satisfaction. Request Evelyn as your waitress! She is so nice! I live in California and I was just visiting Vegas for a few days. You want good service? Make sure you stop by this IHOP on your way to the strip! P.S. make sure you get the \"Splashberry\" it's a great mix of orange juice, sprite, and strawberries, plus it's free refills! Who wouldn't want that?"}
{"text":"I love all IHOPs. This one is my favorite. Seriously, the pancakes were amazing. I want to kiss whoever made them because they were that good. The service was fast and polite. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Full house at IHOP, friend of mine wanted to get breakfast here. He didn't bother to try anywhere else. Waited in the lobby for a good 15 minutes before being seated. Friendly server, informative and dealt with how picky I am with my food. I literally made changes to everything I ordered and he got it all down. Kept refilling my hot coffee and my water. We began to notice that they were serving everyone around us but we weren't seeing our order. After waiting for about 30 minutes the manager stop by to say their system went down and they lost our order. Offered to discount our bill. Another 20 minutes before our order arrives and everything is piping hot! First time I've ever been to IHOP where my food wasn't sitting cold in the window! I was quite hangry at this point and ate so fast. Decent meal at such a great price point."}
{"text":"I give it cero to this I been visiting this location but today I wait to someone come to my table no one showed up a lot of employees lack of service even the manager pass and not even ask horrible never back again is a lot of other places where I can spend my money"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick breakfast before doing some shopping in the area.  While the food is okay, about average, the speed of service is bad.  It took us forever to get coffee/OJ and our food took well over 30 minutes.  The hashbrowns weren't crispy on both sides like we asked but still cooked through."}
{"text":"Nice Service, fast and great for when your on the road! One of the better Ihops in NC!"}
{"text":"Get rid of those annoying ballon shape crap at 9am in the freaking morning..... And the pancakes were thin."}
{"text":"man eat meat


i know the ihop is a pancake joint
but that would be selling short

everyone now and then
man get urge eat meat 
dominate food chain
be big dumb animal 

and when i ordered the 
sirloin tips with eggs over easy 
i was offered a full plate 
of tender meat eggs mushrooms and onions
that together marinated into happiness

that's what im talking about


ps-if the restaurant is slow, there is no reason to have dirty tables"}
{"text":"Who would have thought?!  Not only was the food outstanding, our party of five all had omelettes, but the service was beyond amazing because of our server Cory!!  He was amazing and our tip reflected his service."}
{"text":"This is an IHOP so my expectations were not high. I might add that we got as good as we can hope for.  We came on Christmas morning so I was glad the place was open. We were seated by a friendly hostess and allowed to pick a different table when we didn't care for the first. Our waitress was prompt and friendly and helpful. Food came quickly and was good enough: for the price you can't expect haut cuisine. The waitress checked back and refilled water. We were ahead of the game until it came time to pay. The cashier took a takeout order as we were paying and was not effective at multitasking. She left us waiting as she couldn't do both. Somebody else was ready to receive the order but the cashier insisted on handling it. The price was right."}
{"text":"Great IHOP.. Very friendly and attentive staff. Food is always fresh, excellent, and made to order. Busy on Weekend mornings like all the best breakfast restaurants, but they move customers in fast! Award winning IHop with a AAA GM who treats all like family!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly  and attentive.  Had their crepes . With eggs and sausage.  Portions were large .  A lot for one person. Reasonably  priced. They were very busy at the lunch . But they got us in quickly."}
{"text":"Always an issue when we come here...been here 45 mins with no food because another server took our order. They had to remake it..
It's always a super long wait, order isn't right and have to ask for utensils and drink refills..
This place is the worst..
 Not coming back here anymore.."}
{"text":"This location definitely stays busy. Always a wait time in here, but surprisingly today at 9am didn't have to wait. I always order the country fried steak (always). Brittany was our server today and she was very nice. Checked up on us and refilled our drinks right on time when we needed a refill. Service always makes it a good time. Definitely will be back around this time right before the busy wait list. Was too hungry to take a photo but it's always delicious!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic breakfast at IHOP at noon.  We intended to try burgers but the pictures on the menu called to us.   Biscuits and gravy were perfect  as were the 2x2x2 meals.   Service was friendly, helpful. Our server Angel hit it out of the park water and pop were refilled without requesting.   Shoutout to the cooks we enjoyed our meals and cleaned our plates.  The four of us all commented why didn't we dine there more often.   We will be back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best 24 hour restaurants in Phoenix. It's clean, the staff are fantastic, the food was excellent, and they have free WiFi. It's worth the drive if you're looking for a decent meal in a decent location. 

Two thumbs up for the way this iHop handled the Christmas Day traffic of people who had nowhere else to go."}
{"text":"we got seated WAITED 12 minutes and nobody showed up, worst service ever. wasn't even busy"}
{"text":"I have a prejudice against chains, but this IHOP is a notable exception.  I'm in with other yelps giving kudos.  Certainly a great place for stacks, but the service is what brings me back.  Fast, friendly, and they have figured out early morning eaters want a pot of coffee on the table and possess the ability to self pour.  A block away from the light rail gives it a great location."}
{"text":"No wait, great food but our waiter, Andy, was super super rude. Looks like he doesn't even like his job, not even a crack of a smile."}
{"text":"Our service Austin was amazing!! Never would I imagine having such great service at an IHOP. He was super friendly, extremely polite, overall AMAZING! They need more of this type of service on the strip. 

IHOP is IHOP at the end of the day. I usually order the same thing. For some reason I wanted to try something different well I should have stuck to my regular breakfast order cause the Chicken Parmesan was not good. Honestly that's my fault it's IHOP I shouldn't be expecting the best pasta meal but it really was made with no care. For about $13 I wasn't impressed with the quality. Blueberry Hills is a breakfast joint but they still have decent meals. 

This is our usual go to IHOP and we tend to leave very pleased for the most part. Their service is great! The food is what you expect from any IHOP. Oh for some reason is very cold at this location."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, burgers were bland. Breakfast items were good. Cindy deserves a raise of some sort."}
{"text":"We take our kids here every other weekend for dinner. This past Friday made the 4th time we have been here, and I am still not impressed. The only thing that keeps us going is that everyone really enjoys the food. It hasn't been busy, which we LOVE, we are greeted and seated right away. We all know what we want by the time the waiter comes back with our drinks, but for some reason it still takes them 45+ minutes each of the 4 times we have been there. They dont refill our drinks, we have to flag them down or get up and go find someone. I just think its not a Sunday morning after church, its Friday at 6, its not busy. HIRE MORE PEOPLE to cook and wait on the tables. paying almost $60 bucks for the 5 of us to eat isnt worth it any more. :( I hope they get more staff and cooks who can cook eggs and pancakes faster!"}
{"text":"My favorite IHOP so far. Waitress was very sweet and attentive. The food was prepared very good. We ordered a bacon cheese burger, steak with mashed potatoes and cupcake flavor pancakes. Very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Rude staff, not helpful. I wish I didn't have to leave a star because they don't deserve it. We asked to not be seated by small kids (almost impossible in a chain restaurant), but we like our quiet time and the hostess tried to put us in between 2 families with small kids. Ummm, did you not hear our request? We asked to speak to a manager after we got our bill and the manager would not come talk to us. Serious? How unprofessional can a manager be? When you have an unhappy customer you should try to make things right, right? Well not at this place, they could obviously care less. That's fine, we won't ever be back and every social media website will know exactly how this place operates. Keep up the piss poor customer service and management skills! I'm sure you'll go far in life with the skills you all have."}
{"text":"Awful taking pick up orders.  Had to call a total of 10 times (put on hold and never picked up, busy line, no answer,  etc). Food was supposed to be ready in 10, it's been 30 mins. Still waiting."}
{"text":"We arrived at 8:45am. We were seated promptly. However, we sat unattended for, at least, 10 minutes. 2 employees came by but neither stopped to give us coffee or take an order. Fewer than half of the tables were occupied. So, we decided to leave. There were 3 employees standing at the register, doing nothing. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast for the office, one order was strawberries and creme crepes and they crapes were empty and sauceless!"}
{"text":"The waiter pressured me into buying a big steak omlet even though I didn't want their big steak, I simply wanted a omlet with steak. The waiter was simply rude."}
{"text":"Our waitress was nice, helpful and friendly. When we went to the register to pay both ladies were too busy to help us. They seemed frusturated that we were there to pay. One of them was wearing a veterinary scrub which is probably not a good idea to wear in a restaurant. My bill came to $24 and change. I left $35 and walked out (besides the tip I left on the table). Not going there ever again. Lord knows what the lady with the vet scrub do and if she's around the food. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Considering it's your only decent option within miles, it's awesome.  It's IHOP, so you know the drill."}
{"text":"For low expectations, this place is great. 

It's very cleans and the service is always friendly, although I rarely go here. I used to take kids I babysat here because thy loved it and one kids meal gets comped per adult entree which is awesome. 

I typically get red velvet or cheese cake pancakes. You know, the crazy things. Once in a while you need that kind of food!"}
{"text":"Slow and poor service. I was told 10 to 15 minute wait and had my name added to the list. My family of 4 was not seated and I noticed people arriving after us were being seated before us. When brought to the hostess attn she said we could be seated next. The point is that we were taking up a full side of the waiting area but she claimed not to see us and never used common sense to rectify the oversight or see why we hadn't been seated. This is a small restaurant and waiting area so there is no way she couldn't see us. I spoke to the \"manager\" and he was no more help than the hostess."}
{"text":"When we travel, we usually end up wishing for a better breakfast at the airport. Last month we had a 10AM flight to New Orleans. We were going to park our car off airport when we decided to look for a breakfast place. 

Within a few miles, we saw an International House of Pancakes and pulled in. No issues with parking or getting seated. Service was great and attentive. My wife liked the pot of coffee placed on the table---a hot refill upon need. My diet coke was refilled before I requested it--no waiting at all. Our breakfast of eggs was very good compared to anything offered at the Airport---even real metal knives! 

When finished, we continued on our way, parked our car, entered the Airport and passed all of \"those\" terrible places offering their breakfasts with plastic ware!"}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday around brunch time, so it wasn't very busy at all. The waitress was quiet and awkward. The food took at least 45 minutes to come out, and once it did, the pancakes were cold! We had to request fresher ones! 3 different employees asked how our meals were, and we told each one our problem, but not a single person actually cared to hear our answer! Very odd to be asked so many times and nothing done about it (pretty sure one of them was a manager too). I wouldn't recommend this location"}
{"text":"The staff were all very polite. We were seated right away and able to order quickly. However we noticed that orders sat for several minutes before being delivered. When we received our food sure enough it was cool. However the country fried steak was steamy hot. The cooks need to learn the proper food prep order so everything is hot. Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been to an IHOP. My first at this one. My friend and I went in on Labor Day to try their new crepes. They have been advertising these on TV and we were trying to kill some time before our next appointment.

What we had:
Chicken Florentine Crepes and Crispy Banana Caramel Cheesecake

This was not our first choice. We really wanted breakfast and they were advertising a breakfast special from $4.99 - $6.99 with a fruit crepe. We wanted to find out how much it would cost to order an additional fruit crepe with one of the specials. The waiter told me it would cost an additional $3.99 with the order. We thought something wasn't right as the lowest price breakfast special was only $1.00 more than for an extra crepe??? 

We chose the Chicken Florentine Crepe. It was tasty, a little on the greasy side. It consisted of chicken breast strips (I didn't see any chicken strips, but there was chicken breast pieces), fresh spinach, mushrooms and onions, lightly seasoned, with Swiss cheese topped with hollandaise sauce for $7.99.  It didn't say it was an a la carte item, but there wasn't any fries or salad that accompanied this dish, just the two crepes.

We finished it off with their Crispy Banana Caramel Cheesecake. It's suppose to be cheesecake with chunks of bananas and caramel, quick fried in a flaky pastry tortilla sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and whipped cream.  I can't say there were any bananas in the filling, but there were some on the plate. I've never had anything quite like this, but it was ok.

They need to work on their presentation.  When they brought out the Chicken Florentine Crepes, it looked very plain like something was missing on the plate, maybe a little garnish, some fries or fruit would of been nice.  

I still want to try the fruit crepes, maybe another time."}
{"text":"Been sitting at the table about 10 minutes...no one's come by yet. I had enough time to yelp another breakfast place, map it and seriously consider leaving. And now she shows up. Ordered the usual...eggs, with some pancakes and coffee. Took about 17 minutes to get out drinks order. Bright side...Vanilla Iced Coffee....very good. Now it's been 33 minutes since we walked in and no food yet and no one's come by to refill our drinks. 
Ok...bumped it up from 2 stars to 3. Food came out and it was very fresh, and delicious for IHOP.  French toast were perfection, waffle was delicious and the sausage was better than the bacon! 
Overall slow service...good food."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal at this 24 hour IHOP. I love this place so we came in search of a great breakfast off the strip. There were a ton of people but the wait went by really quickly, even though it looked like it would take hours to get a table.
The food is your basic ihop food, which is great. I think the prices may be a little higher since it's not far off the strip. However, it was food I knew would be good. 
It's also close to the strip near an outlet center. I think it took ten minutes to get to from the east side of the strip. 
The service was not amazing, but it was good. We got our food at a decent time and refills on our drink when we asked. 
They also have free Wifi, which seemed to be hard to find in Vegas. It was slow, but it was free."}
{"text":"I need to update my review because the last two times we came here it smells so much better. It smells like an inviting restaurant now.  I don't even notice the old furniture now. smells mean a lot. Service continues to be superb and food is yummy."}
{"text":"So let me tell you about my experience at this location. I have been here many times without any issues and I keep coming back because of that. I don't think I will come back to this location again after tonight. Me and one of my friends came here to eat after work since there are not many options available at 3am. We were served by Michael. We sat down and he proceeded to sit directly next to my friend to take our drink orders and then did it two other times to take our food order. First off, he didn't even sit next to me and it made me uncomfortable. If you are trying to be friendly and not want people to look up at you then stand at the end of the table and crouch down, don't sit next to them, it's just weird. Second we get our drinks and he doesn't give us any straws and we never got any the entire time we were there. Then we get our food and my friends pancakes were soaked in butter and half of the butter wasn't even on the pancakes. According to my friend, this isn't the first time this has happened either. Then we had to wait a few minutes to bring us silverware and never gave us napkins. I guess they decided our pants were good enough to use as our napkins for our meal. Then without any warning, Michael walks by our table slaps down our check and mumbles something about our check and walks off, doesn't even stop, just blew past us. Then we look at our check and he wrote some gibberish on our check that neither of us could decipher. Once we were done, we went up to the front to pay and waited about 5 minutes before anyone came up to ring us up. Let just say, if you come to this location, don't get served by Michael, get someone else, it will save you a lot of headache."}
{"text":"The service was good,  I popped in for a salad and toast,  and was given everything I could need for my lunch to go.  

I really appreciated the glass of water to go too, it's a great cup,  I'll be making ice tea for a while now in it.  

I don't know if I can come back too often,  the prices are mid range,  $8-$10 and that is just more than I can afford regularly,  but I'll be back as a treat to myself from time to time.  You do get your money's worth.  

They have a TV, clean restaurant.  Prompt service,  the noise level was perfect,  light and easy to sit and think. 

Good deal of parking,  although I walked in, I don't recall bike areas,  but the neighboring building had some."}
{"text":"This is another place that has been around these parts for a long time now.
I have visted it a few times over the years I must say.
Always decent. Always very busy, they work hard here.
They are always having more people cmoe in. It has got to be tough on them. But, they always smile and they always get everything right.

This visit I got the Chicken Crepes. I have to say I really like it and I am not a chicken fan at all. Also got some eggs and pancakes. Nice and hot and I really do appreciate that.
Lots of parking. Great location. Right down the street from the airport.
God knows we are always going by it for something.
Bathrooms are clean as well. Which is another good thing."}
{"text":"IHOP not a place that generally go too but late night cravings for any food well IHOP was calling out. I went with with some of my hockey family after our game and drinking at our favorite watering hole. It was 2am. So being the only peeps in the restaurant always odd feeling but our waitress she was fabulous. She friendly, attentive, and offer some great suggestions for food. 

I ordered the Pot Roast Melt. It was better then I thought was going too be. The sourdough bread was toasted perfect golden brown. The roast beef was nice and moist in every bite. I like the gravy/sauce made the roast beef even more moist that much more delicious. The cheese was well melted and every bite oozzing more cheese. The fries nothing special but everything was nice hot. It best late night snack one cure any hangover the next day."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Terribly slow and horrible service. On a Saturday morning celebrating our wedding anniversary, my wife and I wanted some IHOP. Being from SC the IHOPs there are on point with service and quality of food. But this one was horrible on a Saturday morning which is there most active time. They were understaffed causing a 20min wait, which is typical for an IHOP. Get to our seats order our beverages and meal. My hash browns were cooked to a dark brown.  My wife food had hair on both plates. I would not recommend this place. Go to midnight diner for breakfast! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The lobby was overflowing when we walked in but they have it down. We were seated within 10 minutes, had our food within another 10 minutes and were out of there after a total of 40 minutes. For as busy as they were they did an excellent job. In addition our waitress, Kim V. was right on top of everything & we never had an empty glass or had to wait on her for anything. GREAT JOB IHOP!!!"}
{"text":"Came into IHOP craving some fluffy pancakes and today they have some seasonal pancakes that were really delicious. The Double Vanilla Pancakes were so good and has a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. We also had the Salted Caramel pancakes which were also pretty good, but just a really strong taste of the caramel butter that was on top. The Double Vanilla pancakes were great with the butter pecan syrup! Mercy was out waitress and she was really nice and took great care of us. Overall was a nice breakfast."}
{"text":"The restaurant was freezing.  Asked for the temp to be turned up but it was not noticeable by the time we left.  My strawberry crepes were ok.  Daughters pancakes were good.  Wife's breakfast was cold.  Another table near us had cold food as well."}
{"text":"Good breakfast. Good service. Good location. Needs more parking and one of the chefs doesn't known the difference between sunny side up and scrambled..."}
{"text":"Here for Thanksgiving dinner that came with literally cold turkey, broccoli,  dry powdery? mash potatoes? 2oz of cranberry sauce and no factor butter to be found anywhere. They don't seem to know what they're doing here from servers to cooks to Manager.. So disappointed on Thanksgiving.."}
{"text":"Worst service we have ever had anywhere. The waitress had an attitude and when she brought our decaf coffee, she made a comment about it being \"time to wake up.\" My wife and I walked out after that. Spent less than 5 minutes there."}
{"text":"Three times I have been here and never have had a good experience. Today my family and I went for breakfast. When we checked in we were 15-20 minutes, which we were ok with. 30 minutes go by and we are told that there was a back up in the kitchen and we would need to wait another 30 minutes to be seated. Now, the addition to that 30 minute wait was that the hostess told me that there were three cooks in the kitchen and the the place only have four or five tables that had someone seating and eating already. How can there be a back up in the kitchen, with three cooks and nearly everyone seated have there food already. I will not be going back to this IHOP.

In the end, I wish my family and I had our 35 minutes of life back. We ended up leaving and going to Cracker Barrel, which we were seated and had our food writhin 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Our breakfast was testing like burned oil. When we arrived they had ran out of bananas... the restrooms are smelling horrible. The waitress was really nice. I guess it's a bad management thing... it wasn't worth the 20 min drive."}
{"text":"Only gave them one star because it's the only way I could post it. The service was horrible we asked for a table for 6 and they gave us a table for 4 we were bunched up we asked for a bigger table the manager told us we could go back outside and wait for a bigger table because they had a bigger group to accommodate. She was very rude. My parents had to get a table just for them so we ate separately and then my mom found a piece of plastic in her eggs and all the manager said was sorry. Never going back again. Avoid this horrible, uncaring, rude, waste of time, rude employees and careless place. I was so ready to walk out with my family simply because we are there to buy we're not there for free food."}
{"text":"It's IHOP.  it serves a purpose.  I was making a late night run to Walmart and decided to eat here on my way out.

Food was typical IHOP food and the service was spot-on.  The thing is that the typical IHOP food isn't enough to warrant more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"I mean... it's an IHOP.  Had some good food, and decent prices.  What else is there to say?  Pretty clean place, and the waitresses were happy to chat with you.  I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"called in to order for pick up....................................
looked online at their menu, ordered a simple chicken caesar salad. Got to there, paid, and the cashier asked me what kind of dressing i wanted , um, caesar? Then another employee comes up to tell me they no longer serve the caesar salad (that i order paid for and came to pick up) so at this point i have a salad in front of me with only lettuce and croutons ............ So i ask for the rest of a normal salads ingredients and i get 3 huge slices of red onion .......... so i ask again for just a normal salad. they bring me a salad but they added bacon that i didnt ask for ......... i dont even eat pork. Long story short, i hate everyone."}
{"text":"Pancakes are the best! Try the country fried steak breakfast. It's awesome! 100x better than waffle house in huntersville!"}
{"text":"This IHOP is the only one I really go to, me and my boyfriend are really picky on our food, no this, extra that, they never look at us like we're crazy and have no problem with complying with our request  I think the only thing they could really work on is checking on the customers more, especially when it's slow. Other than that everything is always fresh and just right ! Never had to have them take my food back."}
{"text":"Here I go again trying to give a one star review a second chance. Bad idea.

Call in our order. Come 20 mins later and it's completely wrong. They say they need to re make all four meals. Wait there sitting another 15 mins. It's all ready says the cashier and surprise surprise.. It's wrong again. The waitress comes forward and looks at the cashier like she's dumb. So I'm assuming this happens often? She apologizes and says do I want to wait another 15 mins? No! So I become annoyed and say I will take whatever is there. Luckily the waitress takes a meal off because she says she feels bad the cashier messed it up twice. Get home and in the end I was missing an entire meal, so the meal she took off I really didn't get any compensation for. 

Third times a charm an I'm not goin to come back to chance it"}
{"text":"I called a to go order at 10am and they told me it would be ready in 15-20 mins. So I get to the IHOP at 10:20am and tell them I had a to go order and they said they will check on it. I still didn't get my order till an hour later. At 11am is when my order was ready. So disappointing. I do not think it takes an hour for a TO GO ORDER!!! Horrible!!


Update: the pancakes were semi warm with NO syrup in the bag for the pancakes and the bananas that were put on the pancakes were cold and getting black"}
{"text":"We came here for a late night dinner, only thing open besides Fast Food joints. It was fairly empty,
we were immediately greeted and seated. I got the Big Steak Omelet with Hash Browns and the Hubby got the Kings Hawaiian French Toast with Bacon, Eggs and Sausage. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Best service. Best goddamn food. Nice ladies helping me out, bringing me coffee and breakfast. Didn't mind that I stole creamer for my purse. 5 stars"}
{"text":"Now, I don't know if all the IHOPs in the Phoenix area do this...but this one is under orders NOT to season their food AT ALL. This is just like typical cafeteria food (think Furr's). I know WHY they do it, they cater to the blue hair crowd whose elderly stomachs can't handle it. But what's to stop them from putting a damn sign up saying exactly that!

I previously had not had issues with their food, usually eating breakfast food. If I had steak, I could put A-1 on it. But chicken parmesan without Italian seasoning and no garlic garlic bread was AWFUL, completely and totally tasteless cardboard. 

They get the one star only because of that. Service is usually good, even late at night and, now that I know, I'll be more careful about what I order or bring seasoning myself"}
{"text":"We went to IHOP with a group of 8 people and we got all the food delivered before one person and by the time everyone was done eating her food still had not come out. When we ask they forgot to make it all together. It was taken off the bill but still not a good experience."}
{"text":"This IHOP always has helpful service friendly people and and a positive atmosphere. However, the floors are sometimes not the cleanest, no matter how many staff are in the kitchen they always take forever and sometimes the food is not worth the wait. If you're looking for a relaxing meal on a Sunday afternoon this is the place for you. If you're looking for a quick grab n' go I would not eat here."}
{"text":"Average bacon melt, average service, average place. Ho hum."}
{"text":"Good food and prompt service ! What more can you expect ... it's IHOP ! 
Clean and updated restaurant with affordable prices .... the food is good and coffee is hot ! It's IHOP !"}
{"text":"Good clean restaurant - manager is hands on and aware of customers and kitchen staff. I sat near kitchen so it was loud - my order was steak and eggs with steak medium - came to me with well done steak - manager immediately fixed it - 
For lower than expected expectation the experience didn't disappoint - 
If your hungry for breakfast food it is a good place to go . 
The waitress was not much help and really apparently non existent . The check was left on my table way too early and so was she ... 
Don't go in with too high expectations and you'll do fine ..."}
{"text":"I guess Ihop is what it is; cheap, fast average bteakfast food. Service on weekdays is fast and great. Sat and Sundays are a lot slower and a bit frustrating. They could also do a better job keeping things clean. Highchair was filthy. Overall they do a great job"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years! 

Service was good, our server was overly energetic and compliant. Yes mam was the quote of our dining experience. Too bad his order taking skills were not up to par. We aren't really sure what he heard while any of us in our party were ordering but the fact he messed up 4 of our 6 orders was a lol questionable. (Hence the 3 stars)

They have definitely upgraded and enhanced their menu since I had last been there. Specialty pancakes, French toast and crepes. There were actually a lot of things I wanted to try, decisions were hard. Lol."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came in this morning around 7 to eat.. We waited about 9 minutes before we decided to seat ourselves. We thought maybe it's cause it was busy, but there were literally 3 tables, all clearly served. Nelly was our server and right off the bat she had an attitude I'm assuming from us seating ourselves. She took our drink order and when she came with them - somewhat slammed my fiances water down. So now we were a little annoyed. He then finished his water and for 11(we timed everything at this point) minutes we waited and he finally got up and asked who what we assumed was the manager by her uniform - for more water. When our food came - we had no silverware or plates.. We weren't checked on once and the shitty part is - during the him getting up to ask for water and watching us grab silverware off of another table - our server was standing there watching us. We will not come back to this IHOP and that's frustrating because we typically come once a week in the morning when we both have off together. Such a letdown! And watching her be very tentative to the other tables was beyond annoying."}
{"text":"Slow and expensive. Food was normal ihop."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need some pancakes.  IHOP delivers pretty good food and pretty good prices.  I always leave  feeling satisfied and the kids love it here."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here but stood in line waiting to be sat in a half empty restaurant for 10 minutes and finally gave up! At 9 months pregnant, I couldn't wait any longer...."}

{"text":"Pumpkin  pancakes are the bomb diggity!!"}
{"text":"Today was pretty crowded but only because it's Sunday morning and people are just getting out of church lol but it's no big deal it actually brightens up the atmosphere of the place. The food was perfect, the waiter Martin was always attentive and made sure everything was good with our breakfast. I will be coming back soon !!"}
{"text":"It was awful 35 mins for a drink  and the waitress was over welm the manager never came to apologize and when. I brought it up to his attention he seemed mad like it was my fault ! Never going there and telling my friend avoid this location !!!!"}
{"text":"Came here in Father's Day and I must say it was quite and not packed at all. I really enjoyed this spot. I tried the watermelon summer splash drink and loved it, if you like lemonade and fresh watermelon fruit then this drink is a must try. Recently went to Cracker Barrel and had the biscuits and gravy and was disappointed. IHOP brought my love for the recipe back to life. Saw the combo on the menu and jump in receiving four soft biscuits smothered in gravy not given to me on the side in a bowl. My daughter had the Nutella Crepes which she loved and I gotta say was pretty good as well. I also could go to IHOP without getting pancakes! So I threw in a stack of raspberry chocolate chip pancakes and it was heaven. Sorry Cracker Barrel I WIN, YOU LOSE, THIS GAME!"}
{"text":"Good location right next to Walmart, it really wasn't that packed for a Sunday afternoon. We were seated quick and easy with no hassle. Our server Michael was really good; he knew a great deal of the menu and was responsible enough to make sure all our needs were meet and was really good with the kids. Our server was very lenient with us and our order; cheerful happy and professional. I had biscuits and gravy blueberry pancakes and a steak omelet; I know I'm a fatty!! Lol!!  We sat near the kitchen and staff was a bit loud and lots of plates and glasses rattling and banging around.Yet I sort of lost my appetite the place needs a serious remodel and cleaning. The booth back splash had coffee stains and crayon marking all over the wall which made me look around a bit more. The wall just above us was covered in a thick layer of dust like nobody cleaned these wall in months and the vent just above us was dirty as well covered in thick black mold. This is all pretty scary sitting with my food just above all this dust and mold. Place has potential but they need to clean up their act, better yet just clean up.  Our server MICHAEL WAS GOOD!! You can be extremely great somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"So I came here today and it was alright but the only problem I had was with the host named marisela she was a very rude bitch who has staring problems lol but yeah that's the only problem I have eating there. Anyways I love the server named arcy I do recommend him to others as he is very nice :))))))"}
{"text":"Thank you Miss Dee for being such a great waitress! Even working on Christmas you where happy peppy and had the biggest smile in the room! I hope everyone around you picks up on how good your customer service is. Food came out nice and hot and super fast!"}
{"text":"Well some call me a perfectionist but when I pay for things I expect to get great customer service, and a great product. This place met the first requirement no problem. From the moment we walked in we where taken to a table with lots of leg room ( I am 6 foot 7 so leg space is important) lol. The tables where clean and the dining room was free of clutter and dirty dishes (so far so good)! 

Our waitress was real upbeat and took our drink orders while smiling at my little niece. After only a few minutes our drink orders were placed in front of us and our meal order taken. Now up to this point I will say that everything was looking good. The smell of bacon and buttermilk pancakes was making my stomach growl and my mouth water. 

The raspberry tea I had ordered was sweet and cold just the way I like it. I sat there thinking could I really be happy with a meal from a chain eatery? Then with the sound of a plate being placed in front of me I was snapped back to a dreadful reality. My steak sandwich had arrived looking large enough to justify the price ($7.99 and includes fries) but it looked like it may have been made a few hours before hand and just reheated. The meat was over cooked and cold. The cheese was not even melted all the way and the bread was kind of hard. I could only handle a few bites before I gave up. 

The fries on the other hand where great. Crispy, not oily and with a touch of seasoning salt for flavor. Almost like my grandma 's fries from when I was a kid. So would I eat here again? No not when I do not eat breakfast food and can still get a better sandwich from Red Robin."}
{"text":"Food was fine but service was horrendous. Wanted to leave but we're there so long we couldn't. No one in the place."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous it was 10 minutes before we even saw someone that does the seating and then 20 minutes passed and we just left... HORRIBLE SERVICE! There was a line out the door of people waiting to be seated and no one in sight... I ended up telling the people waiting behind us that we had been waiting 30 minutes and they decided to leave too... they should check their management... and employees... shame!"}
{"text":"I toat and water my room mate had pancakes it was too high pics we could went to Denny got better food  service was ok"}
{"text":"I tried the new steak burger special. I was more than pleased with the size and quality of the sandwich. I substituted hash browns for the french fries and had sweet tea with it. For the bargain price of 6.99 you can't possibly go wrong. The restaurant is clean and the service was quick and friendly"}
{"text":"As I'm eating breakfast. I hop decides to have construction workers drilling in the restaurant . very annoying. I swear every time I'm at an I hop they're doing some construction. Do that shit when you're closed and there's no customers"}
{"text":"Best IHOP experience! The waitress, Tamara was really great. She was very accommodating as I had a special request. The drinks came out promptly, the food was served shortly thereafter and food was exactly what we asked for."}
{"text":"The server forgot us and when we did get our food it was cold her name is robin t 2005 I will never go back to this ihop."}
{"text":"Every iHop experience I feel is a bad experience but today was probably the worst. Pancakes with a side of curly black hair worse to be exact. Then checking a review from 7 months ago with the same experience. Disgusting to say the least."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad breakfast here. The service is always good and friendly. Very affordable. Love the fruit toppings."}
{"text":"This place is okay.

Not in love with anything except their weekly specials.

Every time we come here with family the service is mediocre. They constantly forget to fill our drinks. I ask for all well done bacon and instead i get 2 bacon (half cooked) and 2 sausage. *smh*, and wheres my ranch i asked for TWICE?! ugh!

The last time i went there though i had a delicious meal that i couldn't stop thinking about. I guess there's a 1st time for everything!

The dish was scrambled egg ontop of a tortilla, that had enchilada sauce ontop with green onions and sour cream. It was amazing. so flavorful. i ate until i felt like throwing up. you could choose different options.

you could have it with;

-bacon, sausage, pancakes & hash browns
or
-bacon, pancakes and hash browns
or
-sausage, pancakes and hash browns.

i exchanged my hash browns for french fries :)

in the end i couldn't even eat everything. my pancakes were left untouched. every thing else was eaten..

look online, see what their specials are, then come here."}
{"text":"Good food, waiter Jonathan was very sharp, professional, knows his job well.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"On Saturday Jan. 20, my husband and I went here for lunch. Now we have been going here for the last 12 years, but usually on a weekday or in the evening, always have had  good service.... but on this particular day it was very busy, people lined up but not that many really. Here is the problem 3 waitress standing at the cash register counting their tips I assume. Some kid taking names and writing them on scrap paper, ask names 4 times which he had already wrote down. Now the manager was cleaning a table left everything just stacked at the end. The time we were there which was about 30 minutes 9 people walked out that already had a table but no server. This was the most and the worse organization I have ever seen. We went to Denny's on 7th st. was seated 2 minutes after we walked in food was really good. We will not be going back to this IHOP anymore. But I do really enjoy IHOP just not this one.
Sincerely Mrs. Lillian Rollo"}
{"text":"Came back for breakfast. Last time we had dinner and wasn't a great experience. This time every thing went perfectly. Everyone got everything they were suppose too. The food tasted good. The service was good.  It was packed on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Came here for free pancakes!!! Their pancakes are delicious!!! I love the strawberry syrup! Also they have really good food. I believe ihop taste better then dennys, depends what your eating though. I love getting omelettes for breakfast & burgers for lunch & dinner. Their crepes are pretty good as well. They have many choices."}
{"text":"Decent meal if you're up late. I like their breakfast meals and chicken fingers are a sure solution to your hunger. The employees are working hard and getting your orders quickly and do check on you.

My weariness is after midnight there is some undesirables in the restaurant. Like cursing almost starting fights.

Many times I felt bad for the employees with the idiots eating here and also staying way over the necessary time to have their meals.

It's a restaurant...not your hangout!"}
{"text":"Food was decent. Waiter was such a sweet kind boy but instead was viciously yelled at by manager, who proceeded to harass customers about leaving tips. Made it a point come out of the door on the way out and yelled at crowd of kids.. the disrespect."}
{"text":"The pot melt was horrible, service was horrible, and the venue was very dingy. One of the worst iHops I've been to."}
{"text":"Ordered upside down pineapple pancakes, tasted good.. Neatness of the restaurant was average as it was very busy.. Food arrived quickly.."}
{"text":"Awesome location. The management does a great job of keeping the kitchen and dining room fast and efficient. 

Food has always been hot, accurate and served up quickly. Which is a huge improvement for me from other local IHOP locations. 

Service here has always been spot on and very friendly. I have never seen an upset or disgruntled employee. It seems like this location is a very well run machine.

I will only eat at this IHOP location! :)"}
{"text":"This IHOP gets a 5 star review from me! Visited Charlotte from Raleigh for a Carowinds trip and had to find a place for myself and 4 hungry kids to have breakfast fast. I haven't been to IHOP in years because the ones in Raleigh are a hot mess but this one looked clean and bright so we stopped in. Service was prompt and friendly even though the place was packed, pancakes were perfectly cooked and fluffy, bacon was crisp. I was really surprised at how good all of the breakfast food was! The best part of all was our server LAMONTE. Our drinks were never empty, he engaged with the kids and made them smile and laugh, and even brought more crayons and paper for them to draw. Thanks Lamonte!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I thought going to ihop in the first place was a good idea. I went at lunch time, on a weekday because I was craving some pancakes. The place was mostly empty, but they still couldn't be bothered to have good service. I was sat at a table and waited, and waited.. finally after I stared down a waitress was I finally able to place an order. My food came and it was alright, not sure how anyone could mess up pancakes. I didn't see my waitress again until she brought the check. No \"how does your food taste?\" or \"can I get you anything else?\" Actually yes, I really wanted a glass of water but I couldn't get one until the check finally came. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"i prefer breakfast its plentyful and the price is right, however i sometimes do dinner. i am really not a fan of dinner at ihop. not a lot of selection and the price is higher than i think it should be for an ihop. service is great though, i have been going for years."}
{"text":"The International House Of Pancakes has breakfast all the time, so weather you feel like breakfast in the morning, afternoon, night, or even at 2AM, IHOP is the place to go. Very simple food, with better quality then Denny's, and about equal to Blueberry Hill. I docked them a star because Blueberry Hill is a bit cheaper, and equal in selection and quality, still worth a go though."}
{"text":"Have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this Ihop.  Large line on a Sunday morning but it didn't take long to get seated.  Food was very good, service was excellent, and the pricing was acceptable."}
{"text":"I went to Ihop after being in the hospital all day and did not eat all day. I'm pregnant and had a hard day and I can honestly say that I was so IMPRESSED with Ihop last night! The food was delicious. Everything was perfect. The service was great and our food was hot and fresh and the waitress kept up on our drinks! The eggs were the best I've ever had! They made my bacon the way I requested. Everything and I mean everything was amazing! I complimented the waitress and told her Thank you because I really needed that! 
Thank you Ihop for making my night better!!!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting menu. Usually eggs are gluten free, except IHOP adds wheat pancake batter to their eggs. 
Can it be they're afraid gluten sensitive people will try to eat here. 
After 60 years IHOP can try to be sensitive to its patrons allergies. 
Let's try Kneaders next door. Maybe they're enlightened."}
{"text":"SO YUMMY! 

First off I will say it is very clean, and the staff is very nice! Also, the booth that I sat in was very comfortable. 

I got the Carmel Bon Bon Pancakes (seasonal-$2.99), and the Toasted Marshmallow Hot Chocolate (also seasonal). 

The pancakes were DELICIOUS! I added chocolate chips to them for 89¢ :) There was a choice of two or four, I got two (pictured). 

The Toasted Marshmallow hot chocolate (also pictured-$2.49) was some of the best, if not THE BEST I have ever had! AND YOU GET TWO - *FREE*- REFILLS!!! WOAHHHHH! :P"}
{"text":"Ok, ok. It's IHOP. How in the world can a place like this get 5 stars?! It's the service!!!

Lisa was great. When my wife got seated (the kids and I were in the car looking for parking and she got off first to get a table since it looked crowded from the outside), Lisa saw the 2 kids menus and automatically brought out 2 adult glasses of water and 2 kids cups of water. Great!

Then, when we ordered, she was quick to get our food out to make sure the little ones were happy and when we needed more apple juice for one, she brought a refill for both.

My wife's wait to get seated was about 30 seconds since we beat the rush, but we were checked on numerous times and were served quickly. The food was flavorful, especially the new tres leches pancakes.

My wife loved the egg white vegetarian omelette and she said it was very flavorful for being low calorie.

The prices are better than anything in any of the strip hotels and the gas prices on the way are way better, too.

It's location near the mall is dangerous, especially if your purchases dip into your gambling money (lol!)"}
{"text":"Finally had a time to catch up with bestie after we picked out my bridesmaid dress. So we picked this IHOP on a Sunday to brunch.. Greeted and seated right away at about 1:30pm. It was fairly busy. But understandable because of a Sunday! After 20mins. We finally get to place our order. Then here come the problem. People started clearing out. 10mins pass. 20mins finally 45mins passed. We asked our waitress. She said they're backed up so it will be a bit. After an hour of waiting for our orders, the manager came by to check up on us. And apologize. We asked how much longer. That's when she cut us off got short. Said some cooks walk out and the ones working is in training. So she can't help us. Her tone and how she reply with the attitude jus lead to me either 1) just quietly leave or 2) disrespect her. Bestie picked option 1. I left our waitress some tips and walk out hangry!"}

Four great breakfast experience"}
{"text":"It's Ihop so you really cannot expect Gordon Ramsey to be the chef.  Had breakfast there this morning.  Had the strawberry and cream crepes.  They looked an mess when the plate arrived, absolutely nothing like the menu picture.  My wife had the cinnamon french toast.  The menu would lead you to believe this was cinnamon swirl bread made into french toast.  What actually came out was sourdough french toast with a very thick and cinnamony syrup type substance on it.   The service was very friendly but inattentive.  Perhaps they were short staffed?  Again like I said it is Ihop which is basically a step above Dennys,"}
{"text":"Food came quickly and service was pretty good. Loved the tiramisu. Will definitely come back to this IHOP! It's the best one in las vegas because it's right next to the mall. So load up on the carbs and then go shop!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided pancakes sounded great for a dinner date, so iHop it is!  We went around the dinner hour but location was not very busy.  Our waitress (I am so sorry I don't remember her name because she really deserves a shout out) was super excited when she greeted us.  She was on top of her service, refilling our drinks, and even accommodated a special request.  No complaints about the service.  The only reason I cannot give 5 stars is because the food quality was poor.  We were both so hyped up for some good breakfast and both ordered the cream cheese filled strawberry crepes (mine with a side of sausage) and they were not very good at all.  We didn't bring it to our waitresses attention because she was so nice and we didn't want to bother her with it.  We are what we could, but wasted most of it.  Next time I'll be sticking to French toast, waffles, or pancakes."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. We caught our millinial waitress playing on her phone instead of bringing us our food, utensils, the drink she forgot, & finally our change."}
{"text":"Quick service, quick food.  Marina was a great server! She was friendly and efficient!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to IHOP in a long time so we decided to go here one morning. The wait for 4 people wasn't too bad, about 25 minutes. Finally got to the table, we all ordered coffee/orange juice. Coffee wasn't that good, I only had a few sips from mine. I ordered the country omelet which had ham, cheese and hash-browns inside. It tasted pretty good, hot sauce made it taste better. I do wish I would have asked for some salsa to go with it to give it a little more flavor. My friend ordered an omelet and she had asked for no mushrooms and when hers came out...it had a lot of mushrooms inside. She decided to just pick them out instead of making a big deal about it. She didn't even finish half of it because she said it was too bland."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of food missteps here, but this IHOP's saving grace is its ambience. The facility feels clean, modern, spacious, and (yet also) homey - it is a surprisingly peaceful respite from its more chaotically busy competitors, and leaps and bounds better beyond any other IHOP I've dined at.

For years I've come here on weekdays (avoid the weekends) for a simple sit down lunch or dinner with family or friends. Over that time, I've had decent breakfast and diner food + friendly service that I'd highly recommend."}
{"text":"Generally IHOP is standard fast food fare. This place is slightly better than mediocre. The service an coffee was good. The cinnamon french toast was not very good, far too much sugar and very little flavor. The sausage was done but cold, the eggs didn't have any flavor."}
{"text":"THIS RESTAURANT HAS CLOSED to make way for a 27 story high rise apartment and retail building.  The convenience store right next door has closed as well. Development along Green street will soon see a 5 story, a 14 story and two 12 story buildings add to Champaign's skyline."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. We went yesterday for father's day and our waitress was very rude not to mention she kept passing by without acknowledging we were still waiting for our waters and to get our orders ordered.. I kept seeing her sit at the adjacent room messing with the silverware.. After 30 mins I had to get the manager who was very sweet and a new server. We waited a very long time for our food which was NOT hot but warm. I will never return here not even for a last resort dining!"}
{"text":"Normally I give extra stars even when it's not good service or food. This is the second consecutive time that I've come to this location and had horrible service. No refills, no checking up on how things are going. I truly believe with the right management, this place can find its roots again and become a true IHOP. The food was good but the service just sucks. I'm hoping that a manager sees my Yelp and change a few things"}
{"text":"Bad. I will not waste my time listing the what is wrong with place. If you need ihop, go to the Robinson location. 

A waiter named Deez is a bad sign."}
{"text":"We stopped here for some coffee and a small bite to eat after a day at Carowinds. We waited 25 minutes to get our drinks after ordering. The waitress after finally bringing them to us took our order, and proceeded to go talk to the other employees for 10 minutes before ever entering the orders into the computer. BTW we were the only table she had. While waiting on our food for over half an hour we watched as 4 of the employees attempted a birthday song for the table near us and failed miserably because they didn't know the words and acted like it wasn't important anyway. The restrooms were disgusting, overflowing toilets, trash over flowing onto the floor. They weren't even busy for the hour and a half that we were there. This place is in need of some serious management. I'm not sure how it's still in business."}
{"text":"Went in for all you can eat pancakes on a slow Monday night, can't complain about the food but the service was a little annoying, our waitress was a sweet girl but she made our experience seem rushed by bringing us the check real early when we weren't even halfway done with our meal. When it's all you can eat pancakes you can't expect us to be done so fast lady. Then she came around 15 min later saying that she'll be the cashier when we're ready like ok we know already. She also forgot our second round of drinks and it wasn't even busy. Then while eating they were cleaning in the kitchen and vacuuming so it was real loud and disturbing. I'm just going to pass on coming to this IHOP for a while."}

I read a lot of IHOP hate in the reviews.  Based on my numerous visits for a fast, cheap and calorie-laden breakfast, I respectfully disagree.  

The service is solid.  I never had to wait long to get seated and waitresses (not being sexist, just never had a waiter there) have always made their first visit within 2-3 minutes regardless of how busy the restaurant is (it's usually pretty busy).

Breakfast is always great.  I would NEVER consider going to IHOP for any meal that did not involve eggs and/or pancakes.  It just doesn't make any sense. 

They have a wide variety of omelets.  Since I am taking an egg beater to my calorie counter, I go for the Colorado Omelet. It is loaded with bacon, sausage, shredded beef, ham, onions and green peppers and cheddar.  For reasons unknown to me, I checked the nutritional information... YIKES
Total Calories: 1110 
Calories from Fat: 730
Cholesterol: 910mg

Add three pancakes and syrup to that -- it's a day's worth of calories.  

*Segue Alert*

The pancakes... YES!

I've had the following:
- Buttermilk
- Chocolate Chip
- Red Velvet
- Cinn-A-Stack
- Pumpkin Spice (seasonal)

Yesterday was my 1st pumpkin spice adventure.  I was concerned that the pancake would be overwhelmed with \"pumpkin spice\" and it would taste like potpourri was dumped into the pancake batter.  It was not the case at all.  IHOP did it perfectly.  There was a pumpkin flavor and the spice was subtle and incredibly flavorful with the spiced whipped cream and a syrup.  It was my favorite pancake I had there.  Even though I was completely stuffed after the omelet, I HAD to completely stuff down the rest of the pumpkin deliciousness! 

My other experiences with their pancakes were nearly as good except for red velvet and Cinn-A-Stack.  The red velvet was okay, but it was a little drier and less conducive to syrup because of the cocoa in the batter.  The 1st bite of a Cinn-A-Stack is amazing with the whip cream, cream cheese icing and cinnamon roll filling, but it is TOO d%^& sweet and heavy after more than a couple bites -- it's so heavy and sweet it gets nauseating very quickly.

With all that aside, enjoy IHOP and appreciate it for what it is... a semi-busy budget breakfast chain with fun and delicious pancakes plus good omelets. The service and consistency of this location is better than most IHOP locations I've dined."}
{"text":"I've grown to hate all ihop because of this location. The servers isn't nice, they take forever to finally take you order then when they do they always take over 30mins to get the food out regardless of the time of day or amount of customer . If you come here be prepared for the a very long wait. They food 1/2 the time is gross cold and not and/or not cooked to order. Many times not even given what you order. And they don't seem to care don't even offer a complimentary item for the inconvenience or a discount. I ordered cheese sticks here once and they were still frozen and the chicken strips were under cook when served. I've ordered scramble eggs and received runny sunny side up orders. Ughhh so bad they've truely ruined iHop for me.  DON'T come here!!!"}
{"text":"I love IHOP, but today was odd.  First, I liked our waitress Emily, but... I was given a coffee cup that I sipped out of and then realized had red lipstick on side I drank from, and I don't wear any lipstick.  Ok. I missed that pic, because I was disgusted, but THEN I get my food and the plate isn't clean and had dried grape jelly.  I'm thinking what in the world.  I sent my food back and the turkey sausage looked rare done, my eggs were cold and I just didn't really enjoy my meal.  The pic is my first plate that was dirty and the cup I was given as a replacement. 

The back room staff should be more aware of dirty dishes because whom ever is washing the dishes are not checking for cleanliness.  Such a shame because this minor stuff could've been avoided.  Again, our waitress was very responsive, nice and very apologetic.  She even said that it all falls on her, but sometimes it doesn't because your cooks, preparers and servers bringing the food out should do a QA check that would only take 2 seconds. The stars don't reflect the waitress, and is to get the establishments attention management on  cleanliness of dishes."}
{"text":"Most food was good. The buttermilk pancakes were rather chewy. Although friendly, Service slow to start. Waited about 15 minutes to be visited by our waitress. It was medium busy but had plenty of staff. Wife never offered or received a refill on her coffee. Prices on high side [for the amount of food on the plate]."}
{"text":"Another visit, perhaps my last. I arrived at 10:30 AM on a Monday and there were three small parties waiting. I was told five mins but ended up waiting 20. Once again, the host station was being handled by the village. Once again, utter chaos. I thought 10:30 would work well. 

I gave up after the 20 mins, since I was still second in line and there were six other parties behind me."}
{"text":"The most disorganized breakfast place. They desperately need a Manager that knows the restaurant business. 
The food is over cooked, over salted, under portioned,  and just lazy. 
The service is good, the servers try their best, however, with poor leadership and crap  kitchen, not much they can do. 

The \"may you have a blessed day\" lady in the front is rude, loud, and is not helping. 

We will be trying somewhere else."}
{"text":"Silver ware was dirty had to ask for a new set. Then when I got my food there was a little piece of plastic in it! I sent it back and the waitress response was \"sorry that sometimes happen from the bag\" so I'm guessing it happens a lot here ?? If you know it happens do something! The worst iHop I have been to.. and everyone is just talking, flirting and fooling around way to much that's probably why no one is doing this job correctly here."}
{"text":"The food was good. Waitress was courtesy and check on us. The reason they got 2 stars was due to the bathroom. 
After we ate I went to the bathroom,  and the smell was atrocious.  It smelled of sewage, just disgusting."}
{"text":"The service was really slow. They had plenty of empty tables and empty booths but it looked like they were shorthanded because the same lady that took our name to be seated was the same lady that was clearing off tables and checking people out."}
{"text":"Not really much to say about this place.  Standard IHOP, standard IHOP food, standard IHOP service.  Felt that the portions might have been a bit small, but left full which is really what matters.

Was really quite loud when we were there, lost of kids - had a woman doing balloon animals, which was kind of neat."}
{"text":"I went here tonight with my best friend and we were excited to have some good breakfast. Being that there were only two other people in the restaurant we were thinking that our food would be fresh and good. Unfortunately, that is the opposite of what had happened. Our server was friendly, but not very professional. As she took our order, the manager was hovering over her and making funny comments as we were trying to speak and order our food. She forgot to bring our condiments after being asked twice. We then got our food and they put the BROWN in hash brown. My hashbowns were super burnt and hard. My friends pancakes were also very hard and my toast was cold. It felt like no one cared if we were there or not. No wonder this place is so empty. The server asked us to cash out early and told us she is leaving behind us out the door because she didn't want to \"bus our table\". I am very disappointed and will continue to travel the distance to go to the ihop I like on Bell road!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 11:15 and was seated right away. My waiter didn't come to my table until 11:25. I ordered coffee, an omelette and hash browns. Finally got my coffee at 11:35 after asking the waiter again. My omelette arrived at 11:55, but without the hash browns. It's now 12:20... Still waiting on those hash browns. There are several open booths, so no reason for them to be overwhelmed.

Update: it's 12:23 and the hash browns have arrived! Waiter was nice and apologetic, but I'll still never come back."}
{"text":"TL;DR I got food poisoning and it was awful. I went around 1am on a Wednesday so I wasn't expecting much. I got the steak omelette with hashbrowns my girlfriend got the appetizer sampler platter, and our friend got an iced coffee and a bowl of fruit. I stopped eating the omelette halfway through because the eggs tasted gross and the hashbrowns were burnt. I ate a bit of the sample platter but the onion rings were doughy and the chickens was undercooked. The iced coffee was stale coffee with hazelnut poured in and not nice at all. Once we got home my stomach started cramping and my girlfriend threw up. Don't eat here. At least at night."}
{"text":"This location is nasty. I have personally watched employees use restroom then leave without washing hands (yes, I said something!!!) Or they sit out back and smoke, and then go back to the kitchen to cook your food! Ive had floaters more than once in my glass! Just a dirty location!"}
{"text":"We in yesterday for breakfast.  Were seated and looking at menus.  After about 5 minutes a Hispanic family was seated behind us.  Mind you we still have not seen the waitress or gotten drink orders or anything.  As soon as the family was seated then waitress, who was Hispanic, walked over to them and took their drink order then disappeared.  Again, never having talked to us or taken our drink order.  About 5 mins later she came back with the family's drinks and then asked if they were ready to order.  Mind you, she still has not talked to us and we have no drinks roughly 15 mins time has elapsed.  After a few minutes of the Hispanic waitress making small talk and taking the Hispanic families food order my wife and I got up and left.  This feels like total discrimination and racism. I have complained to corporate and will never return to this establishment and I recommend no one else return here either."}
{"text":"The service at this location was very slow but we didn't complain because it was New Year's Day and we figured the employees were probably all hung-over- we were after all! I came in knowing exactly what I wanted- the Colorado Omelette. It's my go-to order when I am in Colorado and it was exactly what I was craving. Unfortunately, the CO Omelette is not served with green salsa like it is in CO. In fact, the waitress had never even heard of it before!! I was so bummed but I ordered it anyways. I wish I hadn't because I soon realized that the green salsa is what makes this omelette delicious. Without it, the omelette is dry and pretty tastless. Luckily I was able to fill up on my pancakes and side of sausage. IHOP is an OK breakfast option if you can't find a local place serving breakfast at 3pm, but I definitely will not be ordering the Colorado Omelette anywhere other than Colorado!"}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast! Nice service. I love the 2x2x2 order with coffee! Came here by some Sundays."}
{"text":"This place has their shit together! Staff works together in a very organized and efficient fashion that is rare! Love it!"}
{"text":"Decent place to eat a quick meal. Food is okay and fast to come out. I do recommend re-training the staff though. I don't enjoy rude and pushy service. Oh and some smiles would be nice."}
{"text":"This place sucks and so does management! I came here as a big party and they took forever and the food was cold. The waitress did not apologize for anything and management was incompetent. Do yourself a favor and go to Taco Bell that's how bad the service was!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised that no one's bothered to review this place. I'm not even from Vegas, nor did I actually eat anything here!

That disclaimer aside, I'm giving it three stars based on the following:

*The waiter may not have understood what 'vegan' meant (when I was trying to explain to him why I wasn't going to/couldn't order anything) but was ridiculously kind, and even offered to bring me a bowl of grapes.

*The BF discovered that unlike all the IHOPs in CA, this IHOP had no vegetarian omelet on the menu, nor avocado as an ingredient in the create-your-own department. So he had to order a country omelet, and substitute tomatoes for the ham. The waiter looked confused, but did his best to accommodate him.

*Dirty bathroom. Ewww...

*Cherry Diet Coke = Yay!"}
{"text":"Came in to have a birthday dinner with the kids and had a blast ! Our server was great and the manager was very friendly."}
{"text":"We had a late Sunday breakfast here (08/17/14). Restaurant was clean and not busy. We got greeted and seated next to the check out. Waitress was nice and food was the standard Ihop food. We had nothing to complain. 
***I'm giving only one star because of one employee (Malcolm) who was standing around at the checkout and decided he needed to burp out loud while we were eating right next to him. What was disgusting and respect-less!!"}
{"text":"Ask for Jessica if she's working. She's sweet and she'll take care of you. This location is not my go to ihop but that's just bc sharon amity is more convenient to go to and quieter in the evening. It is open 24 hours which is nice when you're hungry at 2AM. I've never had issues with the food. I would say that if you see people lining up outside, get ready for a wait. It might not be worth dealing with rushed staff and long wait for the food."}
{"text":"went in the evening hardly anyone inside . waited forever in lobby forever and we're not seated. page looked like crap very dirty. none of the employees paid us any mind even though many saw us up front waiting. ppl checking out process was extremely slow. place just sucks every time."}
{"text":"First time at this IHOP. Arrived at 8 AM on a Tuesday and it was as half full - encouraging. 

I was seated right away by a pleasant hostess. My server (Sherwin?) greeted me quickly as well but he lacked any personality. I ordered Country Fried Steak, Hash Browns and water. The tab came to $7.58 plus tip. 

My water arrived in five mins and my breakfast in another five. It was disappointing. I had asked for crispy hash browns but they were way not crispy. It also looked like a half order, even tho I eschewed the eggs and pancakes that come with the order. The Gravy on my steak was very skimpy as well but since my server disappeared, I just made the best of it. Perhaps the cooks didn't like him either?

Not a recommended location."}
{"text":"First time at this IHOP. Been going to them for decades though. 

I arrived around 8:45 on a Monday morning and it was about one quarter full, which was good to see.

My server quickly greeted me, offered coffee and asked for my drink order. After she brought my juice and water she took my order. 

I got the country fried steak and eggs. I asked for extra gravy and toast instead of pancakes which she efficiently complied to. The order took 12 minutes, so I guess they had to batter the steak since it should only take about 4 minutes to fry it. 

My plate arrived with the steak on top of the hash browns. At first I was stumped but then realized that there wouldn't have been room for the large portions otherwise.  

The eggs were fluffy and buttery, the steak was fried to perfection, the hash browns were nicely crisped but tender on the inside and there was lots of gravy. 

Good meal."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love IHOP there's nowhere I would rather go for breakfast, but customer comfort is lacking, it's 69 degrees out side and raining and freezing in side, we mention it was cold here in the restaurant, ho well! The server said she was sweating."}
{"text":"This place is small and the service was so so the last couple of times. Expensive if your not an egg person."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, it's something you always know what to expect for taste.

Julie was our waitress, she was very prompt and managed her busy section well.

I wish the loud mouth male stripper behind us would have shut up or at least lowered his voice and kept his f-bombs to himself. Not everyone cares to know you learned so many moves from magic mike. PS you're not going to get famous being a male stripper at some low budget club. Yea I heard every word you said. PSS don't bank with wells fargo, they suck.

I had to red velvet pancakes, they were sub par compared to babystacks! 

Return factor: meh, maybe...just maybe."}
{"text":"Went there today. In the mood for some red velvet pancakes.. Weekend are a bit busy so our waiting in the front was about 20mins. We were seated and hosted by Tyonne M. Very sweet, mild and low voice young lady.. She took our orders... After that since it was sooo busy. Our food seem to take forever to get to us. I think I drank 2 cups of coffee before our food arrive. That's how busy IHOP is today. I sure know how to pick a day to want some red velvet pancakes. Our food is the typical pancakes, eggs and sausages. Came hot. I hate powder sugar on my red velvet but I worry that if I send it back. I will never see another pancake til everybody is done eating so I dealt with it.. We later order some toast for our eggs. Of course I was right.. It did take forever for the toast to get there.. But Tyonne complimentary us the toast since it took a minute. Overall.. Even though it was busy.. Our waitress was great.. She checked on us often.. Make sure we have everything. Surprisedly the services here is even better than my experience at CO.. So I'll be back.. Maybe not on the weekend when it's this busy!!"}
{"text":"Lets just say I will never return, to this location at least.
I already go in with this feeling of the restaurant being not so clean but my kid wanted Ihop so Ihop it was.
To be honest my meal & service was ok until I found the gross strand of hair at the bottom of my meal!!!!
The end result was the manager apologized, offered me another meal, (of course I did not want it) and took the price of it off my bill. 
So gross!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, but the most wonderful experience  was with Nayeli. She  deserve 10 stars!!  She is an amazing waitress. I recommend her as the best!!"}
{"text":"The service was slow, we came in and no one seated us. We had to find someone and then had to prepare our own table. The time to order till when we saw food was over an hour. They were rude right away till the end. Go somewhere else. If you want terrible service, come between the hours 12am to 2pm."}
{"text":"Service was okay, but like most breakfast spots the wait between getting seated and ordering the food/drinks was longer than I'd prefer.  The food was decent. However, the biscuits were undercooked as well as the hash browns being too soft for my taste. The benefit of coming here is that its open 24 hrs. Nothing else around the area was open at 5:30 am."}
{"text":"If you want food poisoning, eat here! f No Joke. Beware!!!"}
{"text":"Excessively slow. Got a table and ordered right away. We waited for our food for 30 mins before our server came out to say our order wasn't even on the list yet. The place really isn't that large to be backed up this long. Not impressed. 

Food finally came 40 mins after ordering. They brought out a pancake that looked like someone had already taken a bite out of it. All three of our dishes were cold. Wont be coming back."}
{"text":"We had the best IHOP experience. I came in very skeptical and upset over the recent name change and the new emphasis on burgers, but our waiter, Gino, made the experience so amazing. Our food was piping hot, and the pancakes were practically sizzling on the plate. BEST IHOP EVER!! 10/10 would recommend to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"This place is beyond a joke. Waited 10 minutes to be seated which would be understandable if they were busy but we went at 9pm, only one other couple in the place. Should have been a hint to just turn around and leave. Waitress finally comes to seat us, she was extremely nice but the whole experience went downhill from there. As soon as we actually got into the dining area, there was a stomach turning scent floating through the air (the bathroom smelt better) As we were sitting waiting for the waitress to come back, we noticed food all over the floor, looked as though a food fight had taken place prior to our arrival. There was a questionable substance smeared on the back of our booth. Hair hanging from the syrup container. During the middle of the meal we heard a brawl going down in the back between co-workers. Words being exchanged such as \"OH SHIT! WHAT THE FUCK!\" The bacon was stiff as a board. Questionable green thing on the French toast. Stomach hurt so bad afterwards. Never going to that location again."}
{"text":"lmao so I have a nickname for this IHOP. I call them the (DO-OVER) I've been in a few times. And no matter what I get breakfast or lunch it's always great after they make it the 2nd time around. I have no idea why they can't get it correct the first time however after the do over its great. They get three stars from me total. I did provide pictures. The over all service is just ok however once the employees saw me doing a review on yelp they did pick the service up. My group went from not being seen to over kill service once we got our food noone asked us if we needed anything at all. But once they seen me on yelp...it was...oh can I get you something anything at all lmao. Like they asked us this 60,000 times. AFTER THEY SEEN ME ON YELP...Id like to stress that very much. Will I return? Maybe."}
{"text":"My husband and I are quickly becoming regulars here. The staff is really inviting and make sure all the customers are happy even when it isn't their own table/section. Menu is diverse which is a big plus for me as I don't care for traditional breakfast foods."}
{"text":"Lets just say i do indeed have a love hate relationship with ihop based on either the day i go and the location( i have never had problens with this particular location).  Trust me when i say some locations are better than others, when it is cooked right i do love the new york cheesecake pancakes."}
{"text":"Michelle was great our meal was very good. We also want to thank Asia the manager for professionalism"}
{"text":"This is one our families' traditional go to places! Love their menu items. Food is always Delish! Your coffee cup is always full! Love their omelettes and the Swedish Crepes!"}
{"text":"You just can't beat a classic like ihop. Why spend more when you can get perfect pancakes, crispy bacon, excellent eggs, every time at ihop. Wonderful service with a smile every time that makes you feel at home no matter which location you are at. Customize your order as you please, this place has it all. Good for breakfast lunch or dinner, or, better yet, breakfast for dinner! I love ihop and this location in particular is awesome. It's been recently remodeled which gives it a bright cheerful atmosphere. They've decorated for the holidays and they are currently offering a \"fluffy the snowman pancake\". It's as adorable as it is delicious!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and it doesn't even have to be eaten in the morning.
The three of us dug into omelettes, hash browns and pancakes. It was a massive amount of food for just $30 with drinks.
I had a ham and cheese omelette and it was delicious. It was exactly what I was wanting and cooked perfectly. The hash browns weren't as amazing but the omelette was so big I didn't have room for them anyways. Our son had the silver dollar pancakes and my husband had the country omelette.
Our server was fast and friendly. The restaurant itself could use a deep cleaning and a remodel due to showing its age."}
{"text":"57 cent short stack today celebrating its 57th anniversary. My junior high school graduation dinner was at IHOP."}
{"text":"I'm sitting in Ihop right now, a chain I hadn't frequented in years, and I felt compelled enough to write a Yelp review about my experience.  I'd written off the chain years ago, largely because I don't really frequent chains, but mostly because of the apathy towards food quality and in service I'd grown accustomed to expect at their locations.  Today, that changed for me.  ...At least for this location.  Grudgingly I found myself wandering over for a late breakfast/brunch while I get some car work done nearby and figured I'd suck up their wi-fi while I wait.  My server, this young guy named Bradley, is easily one of the most professional, pleasant and accommodating servers I've ever experienced.  I won't tell him this, but he could probably be earning more somewhere else higher in the experienced server food chain.  I'm sitting here with my laptop open and I notice all the servers here seem to be intuned to the same idea about customer service, and the customers reciprocate.  I'm hearsing sir, ma'am, yes please 
- flowing freely, reciprocally from customers.  Maybe it's the location?  Maybe it's time of day as well.  Most of the people here are seniors.  Whatever the reason, I think the team and management here should be proud of the customer experience they create.  Today Ihop won back a customer."}
{"text":"I am here at I hop on Maryland .this is the worst visit ever !!!! We came at 9:15 am it is now 10:30 and still waiting on our food  to come out for two people they suck here !!!!!!!! Sitting here without me ng checked on not one time !!!! I will never come here again"}
{"text":"The wait staff is young, and mine was very friendly. Although I was a solo and eating the 55+ breakfast, she was very attentive, friendly, and helpful.  The service was good the food was only so so.  The pancakes are tasty, the bacon very greasy. But Hey, for 6.50 (or whatever it was), what do you expect??? I would not go back, but if you like pancakes, you can get inexpensive pancakes here. 

(ate here October 29, 2013)"}
{"text":"As IHOP goes, this is one of the better ones around. Great for a late meal. I have to say though that most of my review is for William. He was bussing tables and waiting tables by himself. He says he does it most nights with just one cook. My hat is off to the guy because he has a great work ethic and he is excellent at his job. Whatever they are paying him I am sure it's not enough. 

Anyway, back to IHOP. The best of the chain breakfast joints in my opinion. The pancakes at this location are particularly good. Not five star cuisine or anything, but this location is better than most."}
{"text":"Over 2 hours for food.  And the  food was less than desirable. Friday night home football games plan for it manager. It really is not that hard!"}
{"text":"What happened to the good ole days?! When IHOP used to be affordable and you could bring your family and feed them without breaking the bank?! -__-

I stopped going to IHOP years ago when they raised the prices ridiculously! I didn't think the prices matched the quality of the food! Fast forwarded some years and moving to Nevada, my mom has really been craving their Cheese Blintz and they changed their menu so drastically along with their prices! First off, I didn't even see it on the menu, you have to ask for it off menu!

I saw an omelet combo for $15.00! Seriously, this is a bit outrageous! This isn't a gourmet restaurant, pretty much everything on the menu is $11-$16.00 dollars. Don't expect a 2,4,6,8 menu like Dennys! If the quality and the quantity matched up with the prices I wouldn't mind paying these kind of prices but its IHOP for goodness sakes!

My mom order a side of ham and it was the tiniest piece of ham I've ever seen! My hash browns were $3.99 plus another $1.19 for cheese! Sounds like highway robbery to me! Her blintz weren't the same as they used to be, the filling is so overbearing and so thin! Reminded me of goopy soup! Not sure what the mixture is now but back in the day it was thick and tasted better!

I can't say if my moms craving was satisfied but I know I won't be back again! -__-"}
{"text":"The service was slow and the waitress was rude. She took a really long time before taking our order. Then she brought out the wrong food. I watched her pull two omelet plates and head to her section. She switched mine with another table's order. The other guest was talking and didn't notice at first. She put the plate down and quickly left before I could let her know there was a mix up. We waited another 13 minutes for her to come back. My husband finished his plate because I didn't want him waiting and having cold food. I didn't touch the omelet but the guyvat the other table did. He picked off a few toppings before realizing. When I was finally able to get the server's attention she was very annoyed. I nicely explained and she just replied \"So...you don't want to just eat this one? I explained the one I ordered was preferred. She grab the plate from me and wentvand got the other one. She placed the 20 minute wait omelet, ftom my table in from of the other customer. She then brought me the other one. Then I got pretty irritated. I let her know it wasn't at all acceptable. Not only was it old and cold but the guy touched it! She asked if I expected a new one. I let her know I didn't want it any more I just wanted the check. I then had to argue to get the omelet removed from the bill! We won't be going back to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Waiting for the hen to lay the eggs? 

I sat at this restaurant with empty drink cups and 3 starving children for 45 minutes waiting for my food. The server never came around after bringing out drinks. She finally comes and drops off a squeeze tube of apple sauce and tells us 'the rest of the food will be coming shortly\". This place wasn't even busy when we went and the table next to us had the same complaint. They let a dollar tip to make a statement, so I did the same. My kids asked why the food was taking so long so I told them that this restaurant had to wait for the hens to lay the eggs! I see why the overall rating is so low, should have done my research first! Save your time and money"}
{"text":"This place has fewer special options than other ihops and in definitely understaffed. Food was below average, price was standard IHOP price. I wouldn't recommend stopping by - there are other better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst service if you even call it that. My girlfriend, SLEEPING newborn and I come in to get some breakfast before church on 10/8. We were seated on the side of the restaurant around 8 am. We literarily weren't talked to, asked if we wanted something to drink or eat NOTHING... We sat there and watched 6 other tables get sat, and 3 of them get at-least talked too and asked if they would like something to drink. I could not believe the service and as we got up and left I gave my girlfriend our baby and asked the host if I can speak with the manager as she went to the car. I politely told the manager what happened and showed her the area in which 6 others came after us and the only thing she has to say is \" would you still like to eat here\". I laughed and walked out.. pathetic establishment."}
{"text":"My family was looking forward to enjoying pancakes for lunch today at our local IHOP, but unfortunately due to \"technical difficulties\" (which is what we were told) we did not get to enjoy any pancakes. We kindly waited 15 minutes to be seated and another 5 minutes for the server to greet us and take our order... and he started by saying... \"before I take your order, the wait to have your food reach your table is 30-45 minutes AND the Resturant was less than 1/2 full! I had read some negative reviews about service at this IHOP when they first opened and I thought... enough time had passed things should surely be better now. I found that NOT To Be The Case.  Don't waste your time!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. The employees gossip a lot and it is just ridiculous. The food takes forever for it to come out. I used to work at this IHOP and they don't even train the employees. They favor various employees and it is just unfair."}
{"text":"I liked eating here because the staff was welcoming, kind and communicative. We didn't have to wait too long for our food. 
The food was good. Well, some of it.
The hamburger here was absolutely delicious and the side salad was huge and yummy! But ... the Cobb salad and dinner salads ordered lacked quality. Hardly any lettuce, any chicken and any tomatoes or anything else. It was very, very mediocre. 
Compared to Village Inn's salads- IHop is in the dust!
However, when it comes to their hamburgers combined with a side salad - I have to say they're pretty equal. 

Therefore, I was pleased with the customer service here, the hamburgers but not so much the dinner salads."}
{"text":"Food was what I expected from I hop, not good but not horrible. The reason for the high reviews is Blanca B was a fantastic server. She made our morning with her attentiveness and kindness as well as always keeping a smile even when she was busy. Superb job and thank you for being so polite and courteous.  She even ran over when she saw me reaching for the coffee pot just to pour me my next cup. She went above and beyond. Thank you again. Great way to start my morning."}
{"text":"Grossest restaurant I've ever been in, ever. Service, horrible. Waitress looked like she'd been on heavy drugs. Our food took forever and there was barely anyone in there. When the food arrived it literally looked like it had been microwaved and thrown on a plate... egg juice, grease and squeezable flavoring was all mixed in. 

Never. Ever. Go. Here."}
{"text":"A good solid breakfast. Service is always on the spot and food is pretty good but not spectacular. They have Cholula hot sauce, which is a necessity with this type of food.

This place jams on Sundays; it seems that if you are not here by 8:30 you are waiting outside with the crowds. 

I would eat here more; but can't eat gluten and everything here comes with pancakes. Yes, I know it the IHOP, but is it too much to ask for more than one option with out the flapjacks? They even add batter to the omelets. Pity too; there are more options for me at Denny's,  but the food here is better."}
{"text":"The little blurb when you select your star pretty much sums it up...Meh. I've experienced better. 

While the place is usually packed at breakfast time, the service is blah and the food is a bit pricey considering it's just IHOP. The healthy choices are limited and like I said...meh....whatever."}
{"text":"I have no idea how I ended up at IHOP in Vegas it was a choice given to me the other option was Denny's. Bad food bad service. Stay away."}
{"text":"This place is pure crap! I brought the family here for a late breakfast/early lunch. My wife and I each ordered a Belgian waffle combo. When it came out the eggs were barley even warm. The waffles were both almost cold! There was butter on top of each that wouldn't even melt. I asked the waitress if the waffles are even fresh and I was assured they were. Well long story short I asked for new FRESH and HOT waffles for myself and my bride. 10 minutes later we were given one slightly above room air temp waffle and 5 minutes later the other one came out. Same condition. If I could only give 0 stars I would. 

Funny thing happened after I got my bill. They had a survey available and I took the 8 minutes to call and answer the questions. 10 minutes later I was contacted by the regional manager! Asked why I rated the survey the way I did I was completely honest and he wanted me to come back and spend my hard earned $$ in his store again and give them another chance. I told him there was no way that was ever going to happen. Never going back!"}
{"text":"Well let's just say ihop has taken last place in food. I came here for breakfast and the fruit that I got well was. Gross.. Both gross looking and tasting. You can tell it was frozen. The eggs are not real eggs they are a fake gray looking color. The only thing that was good on my plate would be the toast.. Not going back."}
{"text":"**UPDATED** I wrote a letter to IHOP about this encounter so they would know what a great employee they have (Kevin). They sent me a gift certificate asking me to give them another chance, which I did. They were attentive - I'm not sure if this is because they knew about the previous encounter (you have to present the pls try us again certificate before your meal) but still - props for a better experience. I increased my rating to 3 stars as a result. Original review follows:
This iHOP is notoriously slow and I like to keep my reviews positive so I've avoided leaving one until now. But this is a 3rd strike so here's my honest review. Dirty tables everywhere (that STAYED dirty for a long time), some employees wearing appropriate work attire and some not, long waits for EVERYTHING: being seated, getting drinks, getting order taken, getting your food, having it be correct. Good heavens! I even had a man mouth \"thank you\" to me from the register when my server asked if I needed anything and I said, \"No but that man has been waiting to pay for awhile, will you help him?\" However, despite this last in a series of really bad experiences at this location, one thing stood out as a positive: an employee named Kevin. He was running around like crazy but every time he stopped at a table (including ours) his pace slowed way down, he smiled and was polite, apologized for any wait, made amends, did his best to cycle back to refill drinks and check in. Then off he'd run and I'd see him directing other employees (who had a snail-like pace of which I have never seen in my life...please clone Kevin instead!). There was one other employee who was great - it appeared that he worked in the kitchen because every time he came out he had an apron on. I didn't get his name but he came out from the kitchen and helped Kevin out with everything: bussing tables, delivering food, checking people out at the register. The two younger servers: one a boy and one a girl - those two either need to be let go or they need more support in terms of learning how to do their job and do it well."}
{"text":"Service is awful had to wait for over 10 minutes to be even approached by a waitress and then she made me wait even longer to even get a drink.  I just left without even placing an order."}
{"text":"Horrible. Waiter had no personality and seemed really annoyed he had to wait on people. Was told repeatedly about the no split checks after 10 policy even after we told him We had no problem putting it all on one bill. It was like he was trying to prove a point of how right he was. We decided not to stay and he he made a point to tell us we need to pay for the drinks, as if we were going to walk out without paying. Went to pay and he pointed to the small sign on the register that said no split bills after 10 and said \"see?\" I told him not splitting the bill wasn't a problem we we're trying to figure out who would pay and how we we're going to pay them back when he just wouldn't shut up about the policy and how he follows ruels. Then he accused me and my friends of being liars...will never go back."}
{"text":"Quick service. Standard breakfast food. All-you-can-eat pancakes is a huge draw for young and old alike.

Happy server that gets you what you need, but moves along since it looks like they have way too many tables to be in charge of. 

The fresh strawberries photo on the kids menu is deceiving, you get the strawberries that are frozen in the strawberry sauce. 

Good enough and will probably return when my mom is craving pancakes again."}
{"text":"I ended up at this IHOP early morning after hanging out with friends.  Unfortunately, it's one of the few places in the area that serves food at random hours of the night/early morning.  

The service was slow.  The waiter forgot our order twice, and the food came out somewhat cold as if it were prepared 15 minutes ago but was sitting around waiting to be brought to our table.  

I normally enjoy IHOP, but unless you have to be here at 3AM, I wouldn't recommend this particular location.  Perhaps the service is better during regular business hours?"}
{"text":"Blah food. Decent service. Just had to wait forever for the food to be delivered- possibly short staffed? 
Usually IHOP is my favorite place but this place did not justice. My server was very nice and checking up on me in a timely manner.  I tipped her a 5 for a $12 meal, her efforts and smiling demeanor were great!"}
{"text":"This place is a sorry excuse for a ihop. If it wasn't for the name, I'm not sure where this place would be. The prices are extremely higher than normal ihops. When I first arrived I asked what specials they have and the waitress said none. Even if they didnt have specials they could have offered the best values or most commonly ordered dishes. For what you get, it was crap. I didn't take a pic but the fruit was exactly as one yelper posted, not fresh and saturated in sugary juices. I got my son the chicken strips and fries and they certainly jipped us in value. Nothing looked like the pics I'm surprised they are still letting them call this a ihop."}
{"text":"Since day one I have had a problem with this place. First experience I ordered pancakes which were all you can eat and they told me I can only have one. The second time the waitress was very very rude the third time they told me I could not place an order over the phone then this last time they charged me $18 for two stuffed French toast bacon and a hash brown. This place sucks I would not recommend it to my dog."}
{"text":"Where to begin.....first, we had 10 people in our party.......after waiting at least 25 minutes for our food, 9 out of 10 of the meals were served and 2 of the 9 orders were wrong........the 1 plate had to be taken away and redone!  After another 20 minutes, the replacement plate came and 5 minutes after that.....the plate that never came finally arrived.  The server did not offer any compensation for any of these issues. My friend had to let him know this...."}
{"text":"The server was slow. Lord I had to tell her everything for a up-teen time ok I know I made up a word so...I told her everything for fifty times how about that.
 The poor child just could not get I wanted milk w/ Ice but I only want it with my meal. Id like ice in the glass w/ the milk. (LMAO) I say it. You guys read it. But she still stood their like... huh? (Rubs my head) Id like Ice & milk when you bring out the breakfast. Lord Jesus she still don't get it. 
Ok lil sistah let me help you ok...so take a glass add ice then the milk don't bring it to the table until u bring me my pancakes and the rest of my food. (She still Looking at me) Just standing here as if we have a failure to communicate.
 Ok my good brothers and sisters of yelp...I'm sure you guys are sick of reading it just as i'm sick of explaining it. But guess what I have to tell her again. She still here looking at me like I'm stupid. See now I wonna grab my hair and rip it out. (smiles at her kindly) Miss pretty please just bring me ice in a glass and another glass with milk ok :) Ok this time she walks away. I just look at my husband and make a joke....Thats your cousin who didnt pass the 2nd grade. I tell him. He jokes back with me. No you know that's your long lost cousin. Twice removed from the family.  
No she got a attitude with me like im the slow one! Really she got her nerve. So she comes from the kitchen with our breakfast and lord and behold...I have orange juice on ice. Ugh at this point I just am afarid to say anything she stood over the table and had hands on both hips with that motherly look. Like u gonna drink it or I'm going to slap you into the middle of next week. I took a long look at the juice and then at my husband and I said to the cant get right server....Ughhh this milk has a lovely tan it look orange ta me. So I can only guess you forgot my milk. Well, long story short she never brung my milk. I drank some of my husband milk. The food was great the service sucks."}
{"text":"Went to IHOP with the family for a late night dessert. When we got there, the waiter went to seat us but the table he was seating us at had a sleeping kid on the seat. He had to seat is in a location that was towards the back that was empty. We were given menus but the waiter didn't come back to take our order for at least 15 minutes. We thought he forgot about us. So I stood up so he could see me when he passed by. When we ordered, we asked for a sundae and we were informed that there was no ice cream. So we ordered something else from the menu. I felt something crawling by my foot. Looked down and there was a HUGE cockroach. My son squashed it with a napkin (see picture). The food came out within a reasonable amount of time but the waiter didn't come back to check on us. After we ate, we waited 20 minutes but he never came by so we went up to the front to see if we could get his attention and pay. There was a group of 6 people there waiting to be seated. They had been there 10 minutes and hadn't been seated. When the waiter finally came out, he asked how everything was. We told him about the cockroach and he said \"I'll tell my manager\". Definitely not the response I expected. This was a horrible experience all around. I wouldn't recommend this place. They don't seem to care about customer service at all."}
{"text":"Didn't even get seated. There were only a few tables taken. It took 5 minutes before someone said we'll be right with you. When the hostess came, she barely acknowledged us, and definitely not with a smile. Then another sever yelled from the back and said they can't be in my section, I'm not ready. So we turnd around and left."}
{"text":"The restrooms were so dirty. Me and my son could not stand the smell. We were not happy with the cleanliness of the place at all."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends last night - waitress, Terry, was the best!! Friendly, took our orders by memory & everything was on point, constantly refilling drinks. The food was tasty & the room was actually not too cold! We had a good time & left feeling like we had been cared for like family!"}
{"text":"Food was good. We we're told there was no coffee yet watched people be served coffee. Also, we were told there was no silverware available because it wasn't washed yet, so we were given flimsy plastic silverware which was impossible to eat, eventually we got silverware when we inquired further after nearly being done eating. Won't be returning anytime soon, if ever."}
{"text":"Worst IHOP I have ever been to. I have never had service like this from an IHOP. Went tonight (Wednesday) at about 9pm. Young guy seated me and my son. Few minutes later he came back and ask \"how are the drinks\" as we sat there with no drinks. I told him no one got our drink order and then we ordered a milk and an iced tea with lemon. Few minutes go back and he comes back and asked\" did you want half tea and half lemons\" um no . Got our drinks which was fine he took our order . Food came out and was fine except he just dropped the food off didn't ask if we needed anything else and just left. We had no silverware, no ketchup for my hash browns. The loud mouthed managed Nicole even heard me tell my son we needed silverware and she just walked away so I had to go steal from another table. We got no refills and not once did this guy ask how everything was. So at this point I knew I wasn't going to tip. He brings me my bill I give my card to pay and then he brings the receipt for me to sign and a pen and is standing there stretching at the table and waiting. For me to put a tip and sign. I told him I was waiting for my son to finish eating and he said oh after you sign u can stay as long as u want. I have never had someone stand there waiting for me to sign. So I told him I was going to wait and then he walked away and $0 is what he got for a tip. Maybe if Nicole and the other staff weren't to busy chic chatting at the top of their lungs I would have go better service."}
{"text":"Went here the other day with my family of 5. It was pretty dead there. Only 2-3 tables were being used. Instead of being seated right away, we had to wait for the only two waitresses to ring up one customer. I'm not sure why it takes two of them when there was no problem at all. We're eventually seated and I noticed the cushion on one of the booths had a huge rip all the way across the top. You can see the yellow stuffing coming out. The one we sat on was on its way to looking just like its neighbor. It's clear that whoever owns this place doesn't care about maintaining the looks. The service after we were seated was good, the food though was not. Part of my omelette was cold when I received it. My son enjoyed his food there and wants to go back again, but I told him that if he does it won't be with me. Perhaps we'll try a different location. I'm pretty sure I won't be going back to this one though."}
{"text":"The food was ok but I was turned off by the group in a booth with a nervous & skiddish poodle! It was 10:00 am today, a busy Sunday for staff & guests. The hot pink & rhinestone collar & matching leash didn't prevent this pooch from going for food droppings. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for dinner because we were starving and because the wait time at BJ's across the street was going to be about 50 mins. It was pretty full on one side of the restaurant but no wait for our party of three. Our waitress was really nice (Shianne?) and the food came quickly. The place was decently clean. As with many IHOP locations, the hash browns were dry and inedible. Eggs were fine, sausage and coffee were ok. Brioche french toast was great! I probably wouldn't come back here again. Oh, and the hostess was really nice as well."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The servers can't ever get the order right. Been waiting for my food for about 30 mins. Btw inspect your silverware first"}
{"text":"We waited this morning for 25 minutes to be seated, okay, Saturday morning breakfast rush. After we were finally seated (wordlessly, not a single \"follow me\" or \"your server will be right with you\" from this grumpy hostess, just some grunting and a wave of her stack of menus), we waited another 15 minutes. When nobody even came to our table to offer water or coffee, we decided to leave. If it takes them more than 40 minutes to get you seated and even bring water and say \"good morning\", God only knows how long it would take them to return with pancakes and eggs. We love IHOP, but we won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"I have to be honest IHOP has really stepped up it's game the last 2 times I've been it has been pretty darn good and though everyone talks about how great Cracker Barrel is I was just there and IHOP was much better! Now it had slipped for a few years and I wasn't interested in going but we had a gift card and we did. I had the country fried steak and egg breakfast the portion of steak was huge with yummy gravy 2 eggs hash browns and pancakes. I opted for the Cheesecake pancakes because they make a delicious dessert (or I think so anyway ). My dad got the steak tips dinner with corn and mashed potatoes which he said was very good as well. We left full and happy."}
{"text":"When it comes to food, basically an IHOP is an IHOP.  When you have a hankerin' for breakfast at 3 PM but you can't be arsed to mix up any pancake batter, you go to IHOP.  It's not the best stuff in the world, but it's cheap, fast, and when you're in the right mood it can be the perfect thing to sate you.

Anything located on Boulder Highway is special though.  Boulder Highway is like a little land that time forgot.  The sweet sounds of Journey and Kansas can be heard floating through the air.  The wait staff at this particular IHOP all have one thing in common:  A distinct lack of urgency.  Or quickness.  Or...well, caring.  I don't know if if was our lack of mullet, but my friends and I spent 2 hours there yesterday.  At 3 PM.  It wasn't full.  Two full hours is far too long to be in an IHOP.  

But hey, I got those pancakes I was longing for!"}
{"text":"It was ok I did have to send my eggs back, too overcooked and the cheesecake we took to go was crepes and it took a long time. The waitress was nice though and food was pretty decent. A little expensive compared to Denny's though for the same food."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst IHOP we've ever been to. 

We got there on a Tuesday morning after seeing how packed The Egg & I was and while most tables were full, there was no reason for the horrible service we got. Our waitress took a long time to even come over and get drink orders and then even longer to bring them. Then, when all of the food came out (we were a party of five), my husband's never showed up. She came back twice during the meal to tell him that it was coming, but it never showed.

The rest of us were done eating, plates cleaned when we finally told her to just forget his omelette meal. As usual, she made up some excuse that the kitchen was understaffed at the moment--though the other four of us and everyone else around us (most who showed up AFTER we did) got their items. 

Just avoid and try one of the other breakfast places around. It's Vegas, you're bound to find something."}
{"text":"Service is great. My wife and I try to make it once a week. Food is great and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"I suppose like many of the large chain restaurants, it is a hit or miss. Today, this IHOP was a miss. This was mine and my wife's experience at this place. 
After we were seated at the table, my wife noticed that the silverware was not very clean, they had spots all over them, we had to wipe them down with our napkins. My wife ordered the \"build -it\" yourself frenchtoast combo. She ordered the eggs, hash browns, and bacon. I ordered eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, sausage, and pancakes. Both my wife's and my hashbrowns and bacon was horrible. The bacon was not crispy at all. It seemed that they were soaked in greese for a very long time. The hashbrowns where over cooked and hard, they tasted like they were several days old. My pancakes were undercooked, very doughie. My wife asked for a glass of water. When she finally brought it to our table, it looked like there was lipstick all over the glass. 
We expressed our disappointment to the waitress about our food, and our dirty dishes. Her excuse was that it was very busy. Does this mean that because the restaurant is busy, the silverware and dished does not need to be clean, and the food does not need to be properly cooked? I don't think so! 
However, to give credit to our waitress, she did take  my wife's meal off our check after we made our complaint."}
{"text":"I came in through the front door, asking the two teenagers who are chatting that I want seats for two people. The girl had dark red hair and was wearing glasses. While I was standing there, they continually chatted for a second and told me \"No\" and I asked \"what\" I was really confused and the girl laughed at me. I asked again, \"what?\" And then the girl said, \"We don't give seats for two people\", by this point I was just clueless. The guy told the girl while he laughed, \"I like your joke\" and the girl continue to sit me and my brother down to a booth. Just really disappointed that this establishment allows such rude, unprofessional behavior. They did not even say sorry or anything, completely rude."}
{"text":"Food OK.  Really empty here. Out of drink flavors for special drinks.  And who would serve fish and chips without having vinegar available?? These guys!  Dumb."}
{"text":"Got  there early in the morning on Monday, 8 January 2018. Food was fantastic service was great. Cannot ask for a better place to eat. Place was clean."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst ihop I have been to, I walked in waited in line to be seated, as I was waiting two American women walked in who were seated before us once they decided they where going to sit they said they would be back to find a table but sat the women down right away, racist yes , unprofessional yes disrespectful yes!!! No one should eat here no wonder they have two stars, if I could give them 0 I would!!"}
{"text":"Reading all of the negative reviews here actually baffles me. I go here sometimes with my girlfriend as it is near where she lives. We have ordered everything from breakfast to dinner menu items without issue. The one time I did have eggs that seemed a bit runny? The waitress apologized and got me another set of eggs for free.  The wait staff is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Our server Bonita was FIVE stars! She was lovely, sweet and beautiful, she represented our Polynesian culture perfectly :)) 
Had to rate food 4 stars, eggs weren't fluffy and the hash browns were burnt..."}
{"text":"Came here with some family who live locally for  some after-church breakfast recently. 

IHOP's are pretty much the same all over, so I won't go into detail on what was ordered, but what  is worth mentioning is the service.  It sucked.

Our drinks took forever, it took way too long to place our order and it took even longer to get the food to the table. Apparently the waitress that we had that day was notorious for being sub-par. During a previous visit she had forgotten about the table all together. 

At the end  of the day if you actually LIKE what  IHOP has to offer (mediocre food, atmosphere and service) than look no further. But should you happen to actually care about the the quality of  your experience, try the Omelet House."}
{"text":"on a very slow saturday night we waited for at least 5 mins until someone finally asked how many was is on our party.  Again it was slow the place was 1/3 full but i could already tell they were short staffed and i can understand that.  When someone finally told us we were to wait 15 mins to sit.  I asked politely why the long wait as there were lots of empty chairs.  The waitress replied we are short staffed so we cant provide you the best service right now.  So she was rude and didnt even bother to apologize that they were short staffed.  even the curly haired guy manning the register rolled his eyes and was surprised of her response to me.  I didnt catch her name but she was a young short hispanic girl.  So if i already know that the staff will intentionally not provide me good service then Im sorry but i will dine elsewhere.  If she was sincere enough to tell me that they were short and will try their best even though they are short then I wouldve understood that.  At least even though I know Im not getting the greatest service i know that they are at least trying, but for her to just tell me straight up that me and my family will not be getting great service due to them being short is a big no no!!!! Went to Red Dragon Buffet instead.  Their customer service compared to IHOP is night and Day"}
{"text":"For an IHOP this place is da bomb!  Food was great, fresh, and fast.  And the PANCAKES are super yummie.  Why the 5 star review for just breakfast?  Our server Milen!  So friendly and awesome!"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY. I dropped by on Friday morning which should be prime breakfast time but, once I sat down, nobody acknowledged I was there. 5 minutes went by, and still nothing. Glad I left because for some reason, this location has higher menu prices than the Henderson location I normally frequent. I assume the higher prices is so they can gouge the tourists from the Strip.....sad."}
{"text":"1 hour later 1 coffee, if your short staff or whatever be honest with your customers check on them make sure they have silverware didn't have that and refill their drinks, don't leave them unattended"}
{"text":"The IHOP menu is average, at best. Breakfast; hands down they are awesome. But, lunch?? Nope! Salad...lettuce, tomato and onion. If you don't want one of the two toppings, you really don't have much of a salad. It seems EVERYTHING they serve has pancake batter in it. I can't be certain of that (other than what they tell you on their commercials. Putting pancake batter in their eggs to make them more fluffy and cause their gluten-free customers a painful afternoon.), however, my bun for my burger was oddly heavy-hmmm...perhaps pancake batter??
Our server really needed a lesson in proper customer service. She wasn't mean or nasty. She didn't mess up the order. But, what did she do..well...She brought everything to the table's edge for us to pass out to the appropriate people. She brought a hot plate and told us not to touch it, but, didn't put it in front of the customers. She expected us to know what we wanted almost before we sat down. It was odd. Not accustomed to being waiting on in that fashion. 
I might be old fashion, but I like when the server puts the plate in front of me as well as collect it from in front of me instead of me doing the work for her to come by and grab the dishes. It was just odd.
I don't expect much, but a little more goes a long way."}
{"text":"this place was ok, service was alright, just too busy and crowded, food wasnt that good, was just hungry and it wanted some breakfast food..."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE.....
My boyfriend and I came in at about 7am for breakfast before a day full of errands.Got there,waited at the podium dor 5 min before a girl came in,clocked in and with her jacket and purse still on, she finally found a booth for us.So after being seated for 5 min, a server came by took an order a from the table in front of us and a table to the right of us, but didnt even say 1 word to us, not I will be right with you...NOTHING.So after 27 minutes of sitting there with not even a glass of water, we decided to leave.I stopped by the register to tell the 2 people there about what just happened and they both just looked at me and never said anything, no apology....nothing.And this used to be our favorite IHOP. Same thing happened last week with the long wait, but we just thought it was an isolated incident.Will Not go back,cant image how service is when they are busy."}
{"text":"I enjoy I HOP.  They have fantastic pancakes and love the scrambled eggs.  Also, it is a nice option that you can request egg substitute and turkey bacon for any meal that includes eggs and bacon.  The menu gives a lot of choices and our server was great.  My only complaint is that I picked up the Butter Pecan syrup (the best one IMHO) and the bottom of the container was stickey and hard to get out of the holder that has all the flavored syrups.  I would rate IHOP as a dependable place to eat."}
{"text":"Eventhough this is a chain, I feel the staff are excellent.  We had very attentive service ( helpful when eating with kids) and the food was great.  I do not eat pancakes often, so it is always a treat to eat at IHOP.  Their scrambled eggs are out of this world.  I have heard that they put pancake batter in the egg mixture to make them super-fluffy.  Great family time and value.  Thanks IHOP."}
{"text":"Steak was tender and gravy well flavored. Eggs and hash browns prepaired properly. Brioche wonderful! Did not disappoint! Julie did a great job of keeping my drink refilled which was no small task."}
{"text":"Great service and food was great. Had one tiny issue and they fixed it quickly and sent over the manager which I appreciated very much. I'd come back. Our waiter was very attentive."}
{"text":"Questionable service, always loud but not very busy, and I've had to send food back for being incorrect or terrible twice. 

I only go here if my workmates insist and I'm not the one driving."}
{"text":"I love IHOP and this being the closest location to me is the one that I always go to. 
Their food is delicious! I mainly go for breakfast or brunch.
This time we went for brunch around two and we were afraid of the line but for our surprise there was no line and we sat right away.
The waiter was really attentive and polite. The food was delicious and we did not have to wait long for our food.
They have a special combo now and I decided to go with the Strawberry cheesecake one.
I had hash browns, bacon, sausage links eggs and my strawberry cheesecake brioche. Everything was amazing! 
My husband had the smoke house combo which was also really good. 
They redecorate the place and I felt like the staff is better trained now.
My favorite spot for breakfast!"}
{"text":"After getting into Vegas after dinner time and checking into Circus, Circus (Ahh! Yuck.), my boyfriend and I were hungry. It was close to 11pm and we'd been driving for what felt like all day. He's not really a fan of trying anything local when we're traveling (much to my disappointment), so IHOP was the way to go (and Denny's for the next four days--yay). 

We stopped in here and it was relatively busy, but this was Vegas and drunk people need to eat.. so it made sense. There was one woman dressed as a waitress with two cooks in view. There was a younger girl there seating people, taking orders, and bringing food. This one turned out to be the waitresses daughter and she'd employed her for the evening to help out. She (the waitress/mom) was very friendly and the food was brought out quickly. 

I'd wanted their Country Omelette but didn't eat meat, so I just wanted cheese, sour cream, and mushrooms. She found a way to ring this up so that it was cheaper and when it came out it was bigger than any omelette I've had at any other IHOP (or other breakfast chain for that matter). I ended up taking the rest of it, along with the pancakes back to the hotel with me. 

Good food, good service. It didn't look like much, but give it a try if you absolutely NEED to have chain-restaraunt food on vacation."}
{"text":"Me and the boyfriend decided to do a date night at IHOP tonight. It looked like they closed the right side and only serving customers on the left. We were greeted right away with the server as soon as we walked in. Everything went great the first 10 mins until a group of hs kids decided to walk in. It was prob 15 of them. Being noisy and loud while everyone else are having their quiet dinner. There were 5 other family next to us and everyone seemed bothered by it. We were so bothered but didn't wanted to say anything and it kept getting louder and louder. Until 2 of the ladies decided to get up and move but they couldn't bc IHOP DECIDED TO CLOSE ONE SIDE. I understand that you guys had to everything ready to close at night but if a customer isn't happy with the environment they're having dinner in, it's your job to fix it. I work under restaurant customer service industry and I know that as a place that serving customers, you gotta make sure they are happy and enjoying their meals. Or atleast speak to the kids to know how to stfu because it's a restaurant. Unconsidered assholes.  The dinner were ruin and we rushed out there bc we didn't wanted to deal with it any more. We just felt bad for the people that were having nice little family dinner. When we got out and pay for the check, the host wasn't even giving us an atleast thank you or a smile."}
{"text":"Came out within minutes after ordering it's always a good idea to come in at certain times when they don't have rush because we were eating by the time rush began so that was a relief. It wasn't expensive and is very good in portion I also received a crepe but I was sad due to the fact that I was to full to finish it"}
{"text":"I think it's universally agreed upon that the service at this joint leaves something to be desired.

Overall the food is fine. It's a chain restaurant, and that's the quality you should expect. Last time I was there, however, some very simple orders seemed to give our waitress a hard time. 

In short, one of us ordered a stack of pancakes for our meal, while the other got a side of pancakes with their other food. First, we were given crepes instead of pancakes. It took a little bit for our waitress to understand what was wrong, but ultimately she said she would leave the crepes there for free and go get the side of pancakes to correct it. She came back a bit later with the pancakes, and let us know she took off one of our meals from the check as compensation. Honestly I think that was a bit much, as we just wanted the correct food, but it was a nice gesture. Except she brought the wrong kind of pancakes. Once again, not a huge deal - they just had some fruit that the person did not actually like on it. We finished the meal and sat having some coffee and chatting. After some time, the waitress came over and started clearing off the table, which I overall wouldn't care about but she made it clear that she was leaving soon, hinting that she wanted us to go so she could too. This became quite apparent when she also took away our coffee carafe without asking. I get that you want to go home, but we've already settled up and just want to hang out for a bit, so pass us off to someone else and get out of here. Don't take away items that I've paid money for just because you're impatient.

TL;DR Place has aight pancakes but you should probably just go to the Koffee Kup instead."}
{"text":"I recently came to IHOP for their burgers since they are also the international house of burgers (IHOB), ordered the mega monster and it was the juiciest , soft bun , delicious steak pattied burger ever and the fries were crispy and golden yellow just how it should be. I was not disappointed they got something going !"}
{"text":"My husband and I went in before 6pm and ordered coffee and a soda he requested a BLT sandwich and I asked for their fish tacos, which is on their special new item menu.  We never got refills on our drinks.  My husband never got the glass of water he requested.  We kept seeing customers that were being waited on by another waitress getting their food.  One group of four came in 15 minutes after we had ordered and they were served their food. At this point we had been there an hour and 5 minutes.   We saw our waitress as we were leaving she told us our order would be ready shortly.  Unfortunately this is not our only bad experience with service at this location."}
{"text":"I took my mother, father and great nephew out for breakfast this morning. I'll say the food was good. But...

My mother had to leave for an emergency and we asked for her food to go.  This was about ten minutes before the food was ready.  They brought her food out with everyone elses food set it on an empty table for over thirty minutes. When our waitress finally returned I again asked for the food to go. 

I asked for Tabasco sauce but was grossed out by the crusty stuff around the top of the bottle.  No Tabasco for me today!

It only takes a little bad customer service and lack of cleanliness for a good trip to go bad!"}
{"text":"On my last trip out, I was stuck in traffic outside this IHOP.  The signs on the door were promoting fresh strawberry pancakes.  Yum!

I parked, walked in, and waited.  Waited.  Finally someone showed me to a table.  No menus, no coffee, no hello.

I waited.  And waited.  Have you ever said to yourself \"if a waitress doesn't show up in the next 3 minutes, I'm walking out?\"  Well, I did, and I did.

Sorry IHOP.  You were the bee's knee's when I was 5, but I just have higher standards now."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast about 9:00 AM on a Monday.  It was not crowded.  The service was quick, but not really friendly. The food was typical IHOP - tasty.  The noise level in this place was awful.  The music (50's music) was so loud I couldn't talk to anyone or hear the servers.  Made me want to eat and get out as quickly as possible, which I did."}
{"text":"Horrible staff, horrible management and horrible cooks that NEVER make your food to order.

Its Ihop, so the flavor is decent enough but when your order is usually messed up with either missing ingredients or flat out incorrectly cooked to your specifications, well it drags the whole experience down...way down.

The company needs to do more background checks on the characters showing up for a paycheck at this location because these are some of the most suspect scalywags I've ever had the displeasure of being surrounded by. You've been warned."}
{"text":"This IHOP has terrible service.  My wife and I went for dinner, as it wasn't very busy and it took over 30 minutes for us to get our dinner.  When the food arrived it was cold.  We took a couple bites, asked for the check, I paid the bill and we left.   We went to another nearby restaurant, had a great dinner and went home. If you like cold food and bad service, this is the place."}
{"text":"i didn't want to write this since it is memorial day and it was really busy. but it's over two hours later and i'm still pissed about what happened. i ordered a to-go order online, scheduled an hour in advance.   i get there and my pancakes were dry af. they didnt have the blueberry topping that was supposed to go on the blueberry pancakes. so its whatever right? no. i wanted the damn blueberry topping. so i go back in, and i wait for around 10-15 minutes just for them to tell me theyre out of it. so yadda yadda, i ended up getting blueberry syrup. BUT then i get home and i see the hashbrowns!!!! wtf!!!! DO YOU SEE THE PICTURE ON THE LEFT!! thats what i was expecting and i got like 2 tablespoons of hashbrowns!! what a misleading picture!! and by the time i got home it was cold!! so overall, im pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Though there are some very good breakfast places closer to our home, my husband is enamored of IHOP pancakes. So when we get coupons in the Sunday paper we come here for breakfast. 

They underwent some sort of change last year. The place closed down, then seemed to reopen almost immediately - hiring new people (judging by the help wanted sign on the marquee) and redecorating. 

The decor is bland and unremarkable - standard American Chain Restaurant style. We never had any problems with the food before (we go maybe four times a year). The food is still fine. I personally wish they had more crepes on the menu but will survive with my lingonberry sauce. 

As others have mentioned, you do need to walk through a narrow wait station on the way to some of the tables. I don't like this, but the staff all seem used to it and so it isn't the worst thing ever. I've never used the restroom so can't comment on that."}
{"text":"This restaurant experience occurred on Father's Day, June 18, 2017. It has taken some time to review the events and remain factual in this Yelp review. 

I had just returned from a long Army Reserve weekend and my family wanted to eat out to celebrate Father's Day. They said it was my choice, and due to recent positive experiences at this location, I selected IHOP near my home in Peoria, AZ. We used to frequent this location a few times a month and even celebrated my daughter's 8th grade promotion there a few weeks earlier in May. 

So, we, the family, loaded up and went down the street to the IHOP location at 107th Ave and Olive Ave. We were greeted by a previous server we had, who seated us in a busy part of the restaurant. He informed us our server was Maria. Maria came over after 10 mins or so and took our drink order. Mind you, I hadn't seen my family so we were visiting and talking about our separate weekends. No big deal on the wait and we really didn't notice the delay. Maria returned in what appeared to be normal time with our drinks. After another approximately 20-25 minutes Maria came out with more drinks and apologized for the delay, saying the kitchen was backed up. She rushed away before we could say anything. This was the LAST time we saw Maria. 

I begin to notice other customers that were being sat at tables around us with different servers and in short order, those customers were getting their food. 

At this time, we have been there over 45 mins and we have only seen Maria twice. My wife leaves the table and asks about food order and asks for Maria. The front server says he doesn't know where she is. My wife asks for the Manager on Duty and she is told there isn't a Manager tonight. Again, she ask for Maria and she appears. Maria says the food is coming out. My wife waits and asks Maria why it took so long. Maria responds with a severe and nasty attitude that she had other tables, pointing to the other side of the restaurant. At this time my wife observes those tables were being cared for by the other servers. 

Maria then asks my wife \"What do you want of me?\"

My wife responded \"Decent service and the food we ordered. \"  

Maria gives more attitude and says the food is coming out. 

My wife then asks Maria what is her name. Maria says it's Maria Gutierrez or something.  Maria then walks away and goes to the back of the restaurant. My wife then approaches our table and sees there isn't any food there. She is upset and fills me in the detailed conversation.  During the exchange with Maria our food was prepared but not delivered by ANY server in the restaurant. No one.  

There was NOT any effort by the staff to save the experience for the customer. 

Needless to say, the Mrs is livid. She returns up front and asks the one server up front where our server, Maria went. He replied he didn't know. Somewhere in back. My wife then asks for her name. He says oh.... it's Maria Theiss. So Maria Theiss tried to blame a different server at the restaurant or avert the blame all together!

At this point, I am exhausted and extremely angered by this experience. The Mrs returns to the table and I say let's go.  Mind you the food is ready but we don't know how long it has at there or if it has been tampered with because of an immature, irresponsible server. A server named Maria Theiss that tried to blame another server to escape a complaint!

My wife, children and I are exhausted.  We wanted a relatively short, enjoyable meal to celebrate Father's Day. It was an hour exactly. We walked. No one apologized. Customers sitting there apologized to us. One table even said they were sorry that that had received great service and wished me a Happy Father's Day. 

So, do you know what? We went to Jack! Jack in Box!

Milkshakes for everyone and drive thru fast food. 

I will NEVER step foot in that IHOP again. It was terrible service by Maria Theiss, no Manager on duty during the chaos and lastly, NO ONE, not a single server tried to fix it. 

Good-Bye IHOP. I spent over $230 in one sitting in May for my daughters promotion. I will take my hard earned military pay and spend it at your competitors. 

I imagine this review will fall on deaf ears."}
{"text":"If you want very slow service, bad attitudes, your order wrong, not once but three times and expect to be very disappointed, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"06/22/18 ~ I met a friend for lunch on Thursday. They weren't very busy, so seated and waited on fairly quickly.  The server was friendly and attentive.  My friend and I both ordered the Colorado omelette.  Our food was delivered and it didn't appear as I thought it would.  Well I just chalked it up to use chit chatting while reading the menu.  It wasn't until I went online to check the menu that what was delivered to us was not what the menu described.  The omelette was supposed to come with shredded beef and sausage.  It did come with the sausage inside the omelette but not the shredded beef.  The beef was not shredded but more cubed pieces of beef.  The beef was not tender and moist though it had a nice flavor.  If I had known at the time I would have said something to my server."}
{"text":"Food was very dry.   My omelet felt minimal and small compared to other location.  The Philly cheeses stale sandwich was dry as hell and my hash browns were way over cooked.     Hot chocolate was good. But most the powder most was at the bottom of the cup.  Didn't even check up on us to see how things were going."}
{"text":"Ah iHop...this is a regular stopping place for us on a Saturday/Sunday morning before hitting the movie theatre at Norterra.
The food is generally good, our son loves the pancakes here, and I am a big fan of the crepes. 
The service is typically good but can be a little slow."}
{"text":"I love when chain restaurants can still produce homemade tasting items and provide excellent service. Their seasonal breakfast items, iced coffees (with to go cups!), and friendly staff will have me coming back."}
{"text":"I'm only giving a 5 star based on the service, not trying to come off rude or anything, but the food is generally only ever about a 3.5 stars, but it's good enough for me to keep coming back. But back to the service; I came in a little over a week ago with a very large group, about 22 of us at once. Our server was named Victoria, (if I'm remembering correctly) and I just wanted to post and say that she was incredible. Seriously. It was myself and 21 teenagers ranging ages 15-18, and she handled the group like a pro. She was very kind, funny, and patient with all of us. We all got our orders quickly and correctly, bringing us all drinks almost immediately. Seriously, she killed it and I hope upper-management reads this and gives her, at the very least, a pat on the back for being great at what she does. I sincerely have to say, you're all lucky to have her as apart of the staff there.
I will happily be coming back to this location specifically because of her, whether it be myself, or a large group."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with a friend. My friend was late, I offered my table to the next couple waiting but was told their table was ready as well so I went ahead and say die.  My friend came 30 min later. We ordered, ate and sat and talked for over 2hrs!!! Food was as expected....I don't expect too much from ihop..but nothing bad.  Served was attentive and polite.  What I was impressed about, was that we occupied that table for so long, not once did the server or anyone express any impatience. Great experience!!"}
{"text":"Meh this spot is kinda miss and hit went here a few times when fam was visiting for the holidays. I usually seek out my pancake needs from small businesses with phenomenal breakfasts. However they wanted to go to old reliable for some reason so i obliged. Went for brunch wasn't too crowded and seemed like there was only one server working. After a long while finally got my dish which was ok, took forever to get refills on my drink. Went to go pay the bill up front and for 5mins or so not a soul was at the register. None of the other employee's seem to care that I was just standing around so.. meh. On the bright side this spot is open 24hrs so i much rather dine here than denny's but for the most part i will stick to the small businesses which provide great grub and service."}
{"text":"IHOP is everything you need to start your day. Had triple stack pancakes. Made fresh with nice crispy bacon on the side. Was simply amazing. And unlimited coffee too went down very nicely! It can get busy but it's no surprise. The different flavoured syrups on the table were a nice touch. However the put a bit of butter on the top, not cream! Lessons learned! Would recommend going here"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Food is IHOP they all the same. But my service that day was excellent, person who is helping me was an elderly hispanic man. He was awesome. Thank you very much."}
{"text":"I don't usually eat at chains unless someone gifted me with gift cards or unless someone else chose and I'm tagging along. It's how I ended up at iHop on my annual trek to Las Vegas, this past Thanksgiving. 

With chains, I expect consistency from both the food and the service and I will admit, this time around, both were fine. I ordered a steak omelet and the portion size was decent for my appetite and it wasn't under or over done. Add some seasoning for added flavoring and I didn't leave any leftovers. The service was also pretty decent. With how busy the restaurant was, she was attentive and friendly. 

The one gripe I have about this location is that customers are packed in like sardines. Looks like it's time for this location to expand or move into a larger space."}
{"text":"My parents love IHOP as they're offered a senior discount - something I'll appreciate when I get older; however, for the time being, I'm content with spending more money on food I actually enjoy. That just wasn't the case this past weekend when I stopped in for breakfast with my parents.

Why 2 stars then?

1 for the service. It was awesome. Friendly. Efficient. Attentive. Overall: really nice. 

Another star for the prices. Well, that was including the discount so if there wasn't a discount (thanks to the parents), I wouldn't have gone. 

Why?

The food was not very good. Not at all. I feel bad for the servers as they run around like crazy (place was super busy) only to be let down because the cooks don't have their act together. How does one mess up a ham and cheese melt? Not so fresh ingredients; inexperienced cooks; either way - whatever the case may be, the food didn't make me sick but I have no intention of going there again. 

Even when I'm eligible for a senior discount."}
{"text":"Guess they forgot that this was supposed to be a flourentine. Thanks a lot guys. Pretty sad looking to say the least. I flipped one over hoping to find the spinach or basil to no avail."}
{"text":"Went to IHOP around 11:45 pm and as I walked in the server told me they were closed . I guess because the night server didn't show up ... The least she could have done was stay an extra 30 min to serve us and and satisfy us. Instead when I responded \"I don't understand you guys are open 24 hours\" she got frustrated and repeated that someone didn't show up in a negative tone. I've worked in the restaurant all my life and I know I would have stayed the extra 30 min and for me being the customer I would have tipped her graciously for going the extra mile and staying past her shift . This will be the last time I go to this I hop ."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Long wait time and tables are always dirty. Came here with the place basically empty and all the tables still had plates in them. Really disappointed in this place. All I wanted to do is eat while I was drunk but instead this disappointment made me sober."}
{"text":"I have never had any issues with my food, but there is a long wait time on weekends."}
{"text":"Love the stuffed french toast combo :) However IHOP is more a convenience joint. If other places were open 24 hrs and on every corner I'd probably got here over IHOP. If you're into breakfast brunch lunch spots then definitely check out egg works, the cracked egg, omelete house, and Jamm's!"}
{"text":"We just moved to this side of town and we wanted ro try this Ihop. Even though it gets busy during the morning, they always give you great customer service. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"The worst IHOP ever, and I've been to a lot up and down the east coast.  Service was the slowest I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! I just moved up here from AZ, and this is going to be my regular pancake place. I decided to write this review before I even left the restaurant  because our server Cathy was amazing! She was SO sweet and attentive and I appreciated her service so much :) it's nice having a server be so sweet especially this late at night. Most certainly coming back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This location is ALWAYS crowded and customer service is mediocre.no one goes out of their way to make your visit great! The food was just okay...I mean it's a IHOP...how great can the food be. Well I've had better from IHOP. My hash brown tasted days old and it's not the cleanest location. Won't be back! I'll just go to the grocery store and make my own breakfast :-)"}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times, get prepare to wait at least 20 minutes, I think they definitely needs more staff, as after you get your meal you are literally \"abandoned\" but your waiter magically reappears to give you the bill."}
{"text":"Our server Jami was awesome personable and quick to respond the reason I give it only 3 stars is the food was mediocre even for ihop the French toast wasn't even cooked through it was mushy and I wasn't going to eat raw egg on bread.  The egg was supposed to be over medium and was Runny and the coffee was so weak I should have drank water.  All in all I comet I this location all the time and I probably will continue to but they definitely did not have a good day today"}
{"text":"I'm so happy to finally have an IHOP so close to my home.  Yeah, it's a chain so there aren't really any surprises.  But I have been to this location several times since they opened and I have to say they have outstanding customer service.  And being open 24 hours doesn't hurt, either!"}
{"text":"Our Sever was sooo painfully slow, it was too much to take on a not so busy Wednesday morning.. His name is Tracy, steer clear of his area if you want to eat while your food is hot and you would like coffee to be refilled on a timely basis.
Overall bad"}
{"text":"On my first trip to Vegas, April 2009, I tried various restaurants from cheap fast food to expensive fine dining. Overall, this place ended up being the best food and best table service during my entire stay. This is an older IHOP, but appeared to be well maintained.
 
If you're up towards the north end of the strip and want a nice sit-down meal, give this IHOP a shot. I was very pleased."}
{"text":"I had not gone here because of the bad reviews but my better half wanted to try the place.  I was totally surprised. Food was good. Service excellent . Restaurant very clean.  I will return."}
{"text":"Last week me and two friends stopped in at this particular IHop to have breakfast. We were seated at 10:09, I know because we were all playing Words with Friends on our phones. 
The waitress came over promptly and took our drink orders, returned promptly with those and then we placed our order.

At 11:10 we left. We still had not received a bite of food. The waitress did come around a couple of times and say that there was a problem in the kitchen.

But two tables(with larger groups than ours) that came in after us had already gotten their food and was almost finished. 

We offered to pay for our beverages, but the lady at the register said that was ok. She also said that she could not find where our waitress had entered our orders.

Will not be going to this IHOP again."}
{"text":"This location needs a lot of help. My dad and I sat at our table for close to 20 minutes before we even spoke to anyone. If they were busy, I would understand but they were close to dead. We ordered our food and coffee at the same time and when they brought us our coffee, the container was almost empty and the coffee was watered down. We informed our server of it and he said he would bring us more. Well, food came out, we ate it all and still no coffee. Then they had the nerve to try to charge us for it. The food was terrible. Hash browns were raw. Won't be back because this isn't the first time I've had a bad experience at this location. Prices keep going up, quality keeps going down."}
{"text":"Nastiest restroom in the world!!! I have to call corporate. Manager has to know but does not care. Place if filthy. I'm getting my money back and leaving before I catch something!#"}
{"text":"A terrible experience all around, it took forever to get our drinks, and it took around 50 minutes to get our food even though the place was not that busy. On top of that the manager was having a discussion with the servers near the kitchen door because the servers were complaining about the cook having an attitude (couldn't that be done somewhere besides the dining area?) and being slow. Our server had an attitude the entire time as well, and even heard him complain about getting new customers and not wanting to clear off the tables next to us. 

Negative experience all around, our food was OK but everything else was not pleasant to say the least."}
{"text":"The staff here has a high turn over rate, which is good and bad since the decent servers leave but the bad ones leave too. Lately they have had people that must have some type of problem dince even when you tell them the order they write it down and than repeat it to you they come back and ask what you ordered fifteen minutes later to clarify snd still it comes out wrong and incomplete. Worst is the manager is involved  for some reason and mentioned the delay when no one at the table said anything. When food did come two of us didn't get our order, So we nicely let her know what is missing since people don't have plates in front of them. The manager checks with the waitress finds that things are missing, goes into the kitchen with her and talks about how the order is complicated and  acts like its our fault to the cook and waitress . We got pancakes with flavoring, eggs, and hash browns. Plus, There was only four of us and three other tables in the place. If they think our order was hard when it wasn't busy, I would hate to go when it is. 

P.s. If the table is only one seat away from the kitchen, we can hear you very well. Just an fyi."}
{"text":"It's always a hit or miss with this location.  Sometimes we get a good server sometimes we get a sucky one.  Tonight's was pretty good.  But the dishes was filthy! Black things in my water!  My fork had leftovers on it!  The menu changes and looked a little different.  The only thing I enjoyed was the soup."}
{"text":"Having the carmel bob bon pancakes with eggs bacon sausage ham and homefries. If you haven't tried the bon bon pancakes then head over to Ihop you won't be disappointed.  Staff. Is always friendly here"}
{"text":"Airways a great place to stop for lunch love the cob salad with grilled chicken.  Hubby ordered the hamburger club has been off the menu for years but they still make it for him"}
{"text":"A Friday morning 6:45. Only a couple tables full. Greeted immediately. Coffee brought quickly. Food was cooked to order requested. Had quick 2 egg combo. Over medium eggs spot on. Many places struggle with eggs. I like my hash browns a little more extra crispy, but I didn't order that so they were fine as served.  Service was good. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Worst iHop ever!! Horrible customer service. I was scared they were going to spit in my food since I kept complaining about how long I was waiting. Not only that, but when the food did come out it was cold, which doesn't make sense, if it was ready why the heck didn't they bring it out. No, instead they wait for it to get cold and me complain some more than they bring that sh** out cold.. . 
No one would come to our table to see how we were doing. They forgot to bring one item I asked for and then gave it to me as I was leaving. At least they comped me for it but I dumped in the trash as soon as I left (was not risking any \"extra\" ingredients inside).  I was being a bi*** but they certainly deserved it."}
{"text":"It's IHOP.  My little kids love the chocolate chip pancakes.  I tolerate the place.  Not that expensive.  Good service.  In and out.  The food is general chain food quality."}
{"text":"I ordered the manager special and the hash browns were charcoal, our waitress never came back after we got our food. My boyfriend ordered the California scramble that came with homefries and those were ok. Basically save your money and go to the Marriott cafe down the street. Their breakfast, coffee, and prices are better."}
{"text":"Excellent service by our server, Christia.  She was very efficient and super nice.  Great breakfast."}
{"text":"Came in almost 20 mins ago after getting seated... the waitress never acknowledged us... did not greet us or ask us to wait a moment.  We just sat there for over 20 mins... no water nothing just to see people just come in after us and get their order taken as soon as they sat down. A lady who seem to be in regular clothes possibly a supervisor finally came over.  So I complained and told her what happened with the people who got their order taken I told her I'm just going to order everything now.  Today is ihop's sweet 56... which I just turned sour for.  56 cent pancakes...  it was probably worth it just to run over to dennys.  There is no excuse no matter how busy... and slow your service is and understaffed for the event that you cannot greet everyone when they sit and let them know u will be with them shortly... its just common courtesy.  A guy behind us was upset and got out loud about it.  Some people just left their money at the pay counter because nobody was there to ring them up.  What an easy opportunity to get robbed.  Ihop get your sh*t together and all your staffed properly trained because your horribble service is insulting and degrating to customers like me who go and eat out a lot."}
{"text":"Singly the best IHOP I've ever been to full of white folks The service was really slow but the white people made it worth while"}
{"text":"Came in on a Thursday evening. Waited about 4-6 minutes before being greeted to be sat. the server sat me, and took my drink order. 10 minutes later she came back with my diet coke, and I ordered some mozzarella sticks for an appetizer, and the pot roast sandwich for my entree. She informed me that it would \"be a while\" for the appetizer due to the fact that she just put in a \"bunch of orders.\" Okay...whatever. So about 15 minutes after that, I get my mozzarella sticks, a few of them are still cold in the center, the marinara had very little flavor. I asked her to bring the sandwich out if it was ready, I didn't care that I had just received my app. I know a lot of times if the app is ready at the same time as the food, they will let it sit for a few minutes. She informed me that she had just now put it in. Whatever...15-20 minutes later I get the sandwich. At this point I have about 10 minutes left before I need to leave for work. The sandwich...it is BEYOND salty. Inedible. Needless to say, server was whack she only had 5 tables and couldn't keep up I was sympathetic because I know what it's like, but I won't return. The food sucks and the service is lacking."}
{"text":"I went there around 10am and it was really busy but I only had a 5 minute wait. I ordered Belgian waffles with strawberry and bananas on the side . The food can out relatively quickly and my waiter was friendly."}
{"text":"We were sitted immediately upon arriving. Our server Ramiro brought us coffee,  creamer and water quickly. Our food arrived in a timely matter and exactly as we ordered. We didn't have to ask for any refills Ramiro was on top of it. I was impressed with our experience today especially since it's been a very long time since we visited Ihop."}
{"text":"Went to this location to get breakfast with my kids because my car was next door at Firestone. We were seated quickly after we entered.
I want to give them no stars but that's not an option, so I am giving them one star because I was never approached by a waiter/waitress after we were seated. We were seated in a booth in the corner and it was a little a busy when we arrived but the patrons that we were seated by had all been served and we're getting ready to leave. The table that arrived after us and were seated next to us were approached first. The waiter took their drink orders and left. He returned and delivered their drinks and left again. By that point we have been sitting there for more than 15 minutes. We waited a couple more minutes thinking he was going to come back take our drink orders and he didn't. So we just got up and left. 
I will not be coming back to this IHOP again. None of the waiters acknowledged us at our table even to say we'll be right with you. We had the menus open and the kids were doodling on their kid paper kid menus asking when they will get to order their food. I had to explain to my kids why we were leaving because they asked on the way out the door. I told them it seems like they don't want to serve us so we're going to eat somewhere else. 
If you are the management of this establishment you need to teach all your employees customer service. If someone at the restaurant came up and said someone will be right with you we probably would have stayed. The restaurant wasn't packed so there is no reason for no one to not acknowledge a customer waiting to be served."}
{"text":"I'm so pissed! I placed an order for pick up and they got it all wrong!  When i called i was put on hold for 7 minutes just to be disconnected. Then when i call back they ask for my number to call me back!  What the hell makes them think I want to eat cold food while i wait for everything else that is missing!  So upset.  Missing fruit, missing toast, & missing everything in the egg omelet! I hung up the 2nd time and drove all the way back to get a full refund!"}
{"text":"As far as I am aware, this is one of the few times that I went out and bought something, because of a marketing campaign that appealed to me. IHOP now sells Burgers! As of now, there is a $7 burger combo deal, unlimited fries and drink special going on to promote it.
The burger is tasty. The fries are awful, nearly hollow.
The waitress plops the food down and asks, \"Do you need ketchup or anything?\"
Sorry to impose... Yes. I am the only person in the US that would like to have a bottle of ketchup with their burger and fries.
And, they're messy as...
Access to an extra napkin would be appreciated too.
We had Good Burgers... Horrible everything else.
Once the prices go up,
My prediction is that no one else will want to repeat the experience.
I applaud their effort to break into the Lunch enterprise,
but their service is aimed at high pace, slop & go, in the mornings,
or late night munchies..."}
{"text":"I came in after a long late shift of work. Lady told me go sit anywhere. Got no menu. Then she goes to whom I'm assuming was the night time manager and asked her if she could take care of me and I overheard the manager was not very happy and didn't want to serve another table. She agreed but I got no service for close to ten mins. Another group came in from a night of partying and they got seated with menus and asked what they wanted to drink. All right next to me and I am still waiting. I got up and walked out. Awful"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, never end up having good service. The waiters(apparently we had 2) either bug you or forget about you. It's just shitty service, hoping I remember to avoid this location from now on."}
{"text":"I honestly didn't expect anything more from IHOP. We had a big party and the food came to our table in about 25-30 minutes. The food is just okay. Nothing special, but it's edible. The lemonade tasted off, but the hash browns were decent. The music they played was great (classic rock). I won't be returning, but it was nice to check out a different location. On the bright side, the service was very friendly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for breakfast and were greeted and seated promptly. We waited watching many servers walk by, look at us, but never greet us. Both tables next to us had servers stop and chit-chat with them, ignoring us. After 10 minutes without even getting water, we asked a server if she could find out who our server was. After five more minutes of waiting, we still were not greeted and walked out."}
{"text":"Everyone was really friendly and seemed to have smiles on their faces. They greeted us when we arrived and thanked us for coming when we were done. My only frustration was that a majority of the crew seemed young and inexperienced. The waitress kept putting the hot plates in front of the baby and when we went to pay there was something goofy with the check and you could tell it completely stressed the kid at the register out. I know everyone has to start somewhere but maybe keep someone experienced by his side."}
{"text":"Good old IHOP!  Although you can eat three meals here, the breakfast and lunch menus dominate.  And you can mix and match however you like.

Service is very good, prompt and accommodating.  They are not messing around as they have a lot of tables to serve and the turnover is pretty regular so they are moving fast.  Likewise the kitchen must be a mad house churning out all of those orders.

And they actually have real hash brown potatoes.  Many restaurants have hash-browns on their menus, but end us serving potato chunks pan fried or deep fat fried.  I appreciate hash browns.

Soups change daily.  And they have special menus highlighting something, like pumpkin pancakes or shrimp, or egg benedicts.  And desserts are regularly featured and are very good.

An American tradition which continues to be enjoyed."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place 2 stars was becuz our waitress was so apologetic about everything. Our table was in a corner that smelled like someone had peed in it. The table and the high chair were sticky. We wiped everything down with a baby wipe. After a 10min disappearing act from the waitress who stated she was working another area across the restaurant, we ordered.  After another apology that she couldnt get anyone to help bring our food out, my scrabble eggs were runny and my hash browns were burnt on top and mush underneath. The SplashBerry drink saved the day! The waitress was so sweet as to give us one to go. No one should have to apologize every time they come to your table. My family and I will NOT visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"My family and I were sitting at a table for over 20 minutes and three servers came by to ask what we wanted to drink but no one brought us anything. The restaurant was not busy at all so there was not really an excuse for the bad service so we walked out."}
{"text":"Sometimes we have late night cravings.... and my neighborhood IHOP is just a few minutes away... Yippy Hooray!

We ( my date and I ) used to be regulars here, since it's the nearest 24hr. place to eat when he gets off work late and he doesn't have much of an appetite to eat alone unless I accompany him, so usually around 4a.m., we eat together for early breakfast/late night dinner 3x a week... yes the pounds did catch on, but luckily we don't have our ritual of weekly IHOP anymore or we would be in big trouble.

Our server Monica usually takes care of us... She's upbeat, great sense of humor, cheerful, and loves to sing out loud... which I actually admire. It really puts us in a extra happy go feeling to witness it. One of the reasons why we always go back there :)

This visit... Monica remembered us after being MIA for the whole summer, which was really nice to hear her say \"how you guys been?!?\" Love her warm welcome and remembering our fruit drinks order every time. I asked her how the new Pumpkin Pancakes are and she was so animated and held her hands to her chest and told me it's to die for. So by that remark... I ordered the Pumpkin Pancake Combo - which comes with eggs, hash browns, and either sausage or bacon. I ordered mine with egg whites only and sprinkled with cheddar cheese, since she asked if I would like some, but was charged an extra $1 for that cheese, which wasn't worth it, since it was just a few sprinkles. 

The Pumpkin Pancakes were not huge in size, but almost the same size as a hamburger patty if not a bit bigger. I drizzled some Pecan Syrup and didn't really need butter, since it's the salty kind, not rich and creamy. It was flavorful and the notes of cinnamon and allspice danced in my palette. My egg whites were fluffy and good. My sausages and hash browns were all quite tasty and yummy. 

The second dish we ordered was the Build Your Own Omelet consisting of: Provolone Cheese, Ham, Green Peppers, Onions, and Over-Roasted Tomatoes. I believe it was very hearty and delicious since he didn't offer to share a bite... usually that means too yummy to share. 

We always seem to enjoy our time here with the service and food. If you're ever craving late night food or just Pumpkin Pancakes that's only being served for a limited time... please take advantage of this before it's off the menu. I don't usually like pancakes, but this one was tasty and fulfilling. We left as happy campers as always...."}
{"text":"Just wanted to let you know that the customer service skills of certain individuals at this particular location are outrageous! Let me start off by saying I heard of a deal in which if you order online there's some kind of promo. I tried it, it worked for me, no issues. A friend of mine tried the same deal, she goes in to pick up and they told her that she owes more money. Then she asks for a refund for the amount she's paid already through the online system and they tell her to call corporate. Then they insist she pays the difference because they called the cops on her! If this promotion was an error, why was it still active as of this morning!? And why wouldn't you call them, or send an email prior to the customer getting to the location only to be made a fool of!? She paid the difference and then never picked up her food because she was embarrassed about the whole situation. Talk about terrible customer service. They should apologize for their errors! I for one, usually love going to this location on the way home from a late night, not anymore! You're losing customers! All because you wouldn't honor a promotion that was apparently your company's error! This is just plain wrong!"}
{"text":"Not surprising, the food and service were terrible and my husband got severely ill after consuming what they said was a T bone steak.... Although he did wonder if it had come from a cow.... He wasn't  sure... He said it came from some sort of an animal, however was not convinced it was beef. Needless to say, after 3 hours in the bathroom last night and still sick today likely from food poisoning, we will never return to this crap hole of a place ever again."}
{"text":"We were actually leaving the restaurant as no one had come by our table for at least 15 minutes from being sat. However, the assistant manager Bella actually came outside to get us, asked us to please come back inside and she would personally take care of us. Had it not been for the amazing customer service shown to us by Bella this rating would have been a 1 if that. Thank you Bella!"}
{"text":"This location needs to hire a front cash hostess who is capable of directing traffic during busy times.  I came in with a party of 5 today around 11am.  Jessica didn't greet us or acknowledge our presence whatsoever.  I waited over 20 minutes before over hearing her speaking with another guest, saying there was still a 30 minute wait.  Then I asked her if the 30 minute wait applied to everyone who had already been waiting and she said yes.  We ended up walking out.  This IHOP location showed us today that they do not need or want our business, so we will take it elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food was great.  We were seated and served in a timely manner.  Our server was Mackenzi and she was super friendly and polite.  She also came back several times to check up on us through out our meal and refill drinks!  We would definitely revisit this location."}
{"text":"I always get some sort of meal deal that has the Multi-Grain pancakes, and those are always solid.  Either that, or the Turkey Breast sandwich with avocado, and this is the main reason I'm shelling out four stars here.  For the cost, I honestly don't think you can find a better fast food option on the South Strip.  I almost never touch fast food, except for this and this other place near the main LV Strip called called Kimchi Sports World (too bad that place dissapeared...)"}
{"text":"No gluten free options as they put their pancake batter in their omelettes (gross!)  Denny's is better.  They have gluten free options."}
{"text":"Slow........ Service. 

Food has really taken a turn for the worse. I'd rather eat a McDonald's breakfast. At least it's consistent.

I ordered the Eggs Benedict. Didn't realize they changed it up. The sauce was a tasteless cream concoction. I knew I was in trouble when the server asked how I like my eggs. Runny yolks, firm whites. I got a tennis ball of hard egg. What they serve as EB is nothing like it should be.

This place is a train wreck. Be warned."}
{"text":"If I could leave less than one star I would. This place was very unclean. I waited for 15 minutes with the menu and no one came by to take the order.there were only, maybe five people in the entire restaurant.

All I heard we're wait staff arguing with the kitchen, complaining how they wanted to go home. Really professional. 

IHOP used to be pretty decent. No more."}
{"text":"Really bad place to eat..worst place is like ghetto the food taste bad the service is bad... The place is dirty doesn't have air conditioner.. I don't recommend to anyone.."}
{"text":"The manager on Halloween night was a joke. When I first came in they were only serving on the left side of the diner and it wasn't full. It took an hour to get our food. The people who came before us only got half their food and had to get the rest to go because it took so long. Another table left after getting their drinks. When we got our food the over easy eggs were solid, no juice. We asked for new eggs (easy request) but we're told that they would have to ask a manager if they could do that and the manager was going to come out to talk to us. The waitress walked over to the manager and they looked over to our table and talked/pointed. 20 min later no eggs. We had to flag down another waitress and she said the same thing. No manager ever came out and by this point after an hr and a half I wanted a manager, all of our food was eaten except for the eggs we were waiting for because we were so hungry so what were we going to eat the eggs with now anyway?! The eggs came out but instead of the three there was only two! Upon paying we asked for the manager. She came up and said that no one told her about the eggs or told her to come to our table but we watched the waitress, both waitresses tell her! She lied and then I called her out on it and she denied it again with an attitude in front of everyone. Then the waitresses came over and ratted her out! So she finally came clean in front of everyone. We got the meal for free but the people who had to take half their food to go paid full price."}
{"text":"This is a well-managed IHOP that can get pretty busy on weekend mornings. The service I received was great even though our server had quite a few tables. There are lots of families that come eat here, so don't forget to mind your language around the kids and the elderly.

I had a BOGO free meal coupon from my Las Vegas Entertainment Book and they accepted it happily. *saving money dance*

Also, kids eat free every day after 4:00 PM. This was true when I checked on 05/26/10. 

IHOP is classic and a great place to eat! Their crepes are my faaaave."}
{"text":"I normally avoid IHOP like the plague...my brother on the other hand is a french toast fiend, so this is where we went for breakfast...and while I certainly won't be singing IHOP's praises anytime soon, I can honestly say that on this visit, I had a pretty good time...I had forgotten that they have a variety of syrups...I remember as a kid always going with maple and strawberry, which is what I totally did this time...server was quick, which was impressive considering how busy it was...Price I wish had been a little cheaper, but it was what it was...not a bad visit by any stretch, and perhaps good enough to make me reconsider IHOP in the future...,"}
{"text":"My granddaughter and I frequent this location for breakfast before school. The service is ALWAYS top notch, and Maithe is sooooo friendly, with such an amazing positive attitude and genuine happy smile, who goes out of her way to accommodate. The food is always served the way we order it.  The place is clean, and bright, and we are always glad we stopped in."}
{"text":"If there was 0 I would give them that. Cuz they don't answer there phones at all. They don't make he food right. They don't check it before leaving the store with a delivery all around mess. I will never return to any ihop cuz of this u guys are the definition of garbage."}
{"text":"I have been seated almost one hour. I have been waiting for waitress more than 20 mins.They took my order about 10 mins ago when I am ask them. They don't give me any drink yet. They are not busy.
They are lazy."}
{"text":"This IHOP is amazing.  Been here twice with my elderly dad.  He walks with a cane, and today as we were walking towards doors, the manager came out and held the door for us.  And a lovely employee was inside holding the second door open for us!  My dad walks slow, and it was so sweet of the to do that!!  We felt very special and welcomed.  The food is amazing and each visit we had great service.  This is a great place !!!"}
{"text":"Great food but the service is literally so terrible. As soon as you walk in, the host is a b****. She seemed like she didn't want us there. It took us about 20 minutes to just get our drinks then another 10 to actually get it. I hate the workers there. Worst location I've ever been to!"}
{"text":"Enter at your own risk! I checked the reviews of this restaurant and they weren't so good.  I work in Food service and have for many years. So I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I also know how people can be.. contrary to popular belief people in the service industry are there to serve help and assist people in a courteous timely manner yes !! We ARE NOT however your servant slave nanny housekeeper babysitter or punching bag! And for the amount we get paid don't push your luck! Anyway I wanted an early start because I had a busy day ahead of me. I walked through the door at 6:38 am and was seated quickly the waitress was friendly but running around like crazy. I would feel empathy for her except for the fact that at that time of the morning the restaurant was pretty empty. I counted 7 tables including mine with people at different stages of dining. And as far as I saw there was 1 table with 4 - 5 people and that was the biggest one. And on top of that there were 3 servers! I ordered my food a vegetable omelette with Swiss cheese instead of cheddar + onion and side order of strawberry cream pancakes. I waited and waited at 6:56 another table was seated next to me and less than 5 mins later another gentleman behind me to the right. More time passes and they bring the food for the 2 tables with the gentlemen who were seated after me. Then my food came out and of course omelette and pancake orders were BOTH WRONG I told the gentleman who served me about the pancakes he quickly took them away to correct them and I took a piece of my omelette and of course I get cheddar cheese and no onion told the waitress and she apologized and took it back. Waited and waited and they brought my pancakes which were now what I ordered but with no butter. Ok no biggy I ate all my pancakes and was still waiting on my omelette and waiting finally I get my omelette and again it's wrong no tomatoes and the onion was so infintessimal it was ridiculous and they charge $0.99 for it. The broccoli some was cooked some was raw. I like raw broccoli but not in my omelette. I prefer hot cooked food to all be cooked. There is a picture on the wall that proclaims there food is \"FROM THE FARM TO THE KITCHEN TO YOUR TABLE\" if this is indeed true I shudder to wonder what kind of chicken \"FARM-COUP- or Genetically jerry rigged chickens these eggs came from if indeed they were actual \"CHICKEN/HENS  Eggs at all. They were Absolutely awful! Now it's 7:32 am and I'm waiting for my check and waiting and waiting and staring down my waitress who is avoiding eye contact and repeatedly saying in a loud voice to no one in particular how management didn't listen when she said they would be busy on Good Friday and now they are \"SLAMMED!\" REALLY??? 10 - 11 tables and 3 servers is slammed???? Correction 4 servers by this time another had come in to join all the pandemonium of people who were breaking down the doors desperately trying to be seated.  Finaly the waitress brings me a bill but before I can even look at it she takes it back and says she's going to take something off my bill. Nice gesture for her to do so and. She scampered off to fix it so I thought. Waiting and waiting and watching as the waitress is running back and fourth serving others taking orders and seating people while the other 3 servers are calmly taking care of there less than a handful of customers. Still waiting .... finally she gives me a bill that Is folded in half so all I can see is the total. $13.00 and some odd change. I put out my debit card with the bill and waited and waited finally it was taken to be rung up they brought my card back with the 2 copies 1 for me and the other for me to sign and add the \"TIP\"  I was about to write down a dollar or 2 just because I always tip like I said I know how people can be but then I noticed the total !! Somehow it WENT UP! $6.00!! And I had not written a tip in and not purchased anything else!! I looked at the very first paper she gave me UNFOLDED IT and when I looked at the top part the food listed that I was supposed to pay for wasn't even what I ordered!! So now I have 3 bills 2 for $19.00 and some odd change with NO items on it no list of what I ordered and another for $13.00 for 2 items I never ordered! NOW I'm annoyed! I ask the first employee I saw to please get me the manager she went in back to get him came back and said \"HE WILL BE RIGHT OUT\" so I waited and waited and waited no manager now I'm about to make a scene. Girl walked by again and I asked as politely as I could to go back to manager and tell him to please HURRY HIS ASS UP! He finally comes out and speaks to me and I told him the scenario he apologized sincerely said my money would be refunded to my card and told me my meal was free and asked if there was anything more he could do and apologized again. And said he would speak to the waitress. This was acceptable to me but as I was leaving I heard waitress proclaim \"WHAT WAS HER PROBLEM?!\" It was now 8:47 am"}
{"text":"I don't go to IHOP often, but I was craving breakfast food and found this where I was at.  IHOP is overpriced...  For a $15 meal, I feel I can get it for half the price at Denny's.  If a meal already comes with multiple sides, then it's already pricing.  Otherwise, to add sides, everything costs money and the cost adds up.  I had a spinach, mushroom, and sausage omelette with egg substitute with hash browns and it was good, but not filling enough.  My friend had some french toast, pancakes, sausages, eggs, and bacon, and did not enjoy most of the stuff.  It was just ok.  Service was fine.  They do give you a whole pitcher of coffee which is nice."}
{"text":"Would be a better if the new servers would pay more attention to their tables. I sat at my table for 15 before we were offered to order drinks. The food was served fast and was good as always but was not impressed with the service. Had to ask twice for silverware and the sides we had ordered."}
{"text":"This location lacks on service.  They brought out all of our food separately.  The food wasn't that good.  I've had better.  To top things off our waitress left our cups empty and it took a manager to be called before we even got a refill."}
{"text":"I ate here number of times and I never had a bad experience. Their breakfast are the best around. Only once did I ordered a dinner meal (it was OK), but I prefer their breakfast."}
{"text":"Awesome ! Always fast service and good food. Average menu just like every other ihop. 
Enjoy"}
{"text":"OMG, is any restaurant in Primm good?

Food: 2/5 stars
Service: 2/5 stars
Presentation: 2/5 stars
Price: 3/5 stars

How do you burn pancakes...and then serve them? Wow, just wow. We figured we were safe eating at the IHOP in Primm...won't make that mistake again. The folks who give this place more than three stars must be 1) employees 2) nursing a hangover or 3) have the munchies...if you know what I mean. While the service was slow, but acceptable, the restaurant was clean and we were seated right away. Our server was polite as was the cashier/hostess. This was a big upgrade from the zombie like experience we had at Buffalo Bills. On a positive note, I took my pancakes home as they will save me a couple of bucks on my next skeet shooting experience. Word to the wise; if you're planning a trip to Primm...pack a picnic basket."}
{"text":"I love IHOP and no matter what state I am traveling I can count that the menu is the same and so does my favorite items taste the same.
I love my country fried steak.
Service for me was fast and I didn't have any problems with anything.
Food was fresh and the pancakes were nice and fluffy.
Good job IHOP, so far my best place for a fast and affordable breakfast."}
{"text":"I have frequented this location and have had a pleasant experience every time.  I can say that the food always looks tasty and the service has been adequate, without any problems.  Any time there's been a situation with needing another set of utensils, or a change in something that has been ordered, the servers and waitress have been pleasant in doing this. I am big on looking up Yelp reviews as I continue to maneuver around Las Vegas and was, myself concerned about the low reviews of this facility as it is located in such a beautiful place.  I can say that I have visited multiple times and have received the same type of service."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food love coming here after our son's hockey games. Thank you IHOP"}
{"text":"OMG! I'm terrified! Their wait staff lacks major customer service skills. Tables smell like mildew. Servers are inattentive to guests and unprofessional. Condiments were placed on table looking disgusting and almost completely empty! I'm not having a good morning here at all. My husband and I can't wait to get our food so we can leave. It's IHOP. But I will not be coming back to this location ever. The manager really needs to get it together here because if you're anything like me, I expect a pleasant dining experience with customer service and a clean envioronment, which I'm not being given here."}
{"text":"I am giving this IHop a mediocre review for many reasons. First off, the food was as expected. It was good, but nothing exceptional. It did its job by filling me up, so there isn't much to complain about in this category. I got a savory breakfast crepe and my girlfriend got a sweet crepe combo that was served with sausage, eggs, and hashbrowns. Our food was served hot and arrived in a timely manner. My crepe was simple enough to make at home. My girlfriend's crepe was delicious, but small. I can understand the size of her crepe because it is accompanied with more breakfast items. Unfortunately, the service wasn't the best. Our server did the best they could with (what I noticed) a large section during a busy holiday morning. The server was nice, but forgettable; however, my coffee stayed hot and filled. I did have to snag coffee creamer from neighboring tables. I cannot complain about the server. They were friendly and weeded at the same time. They did their best. I wish the host stand did a little better. The hostess seemed uninterested in working. She walked us past at least five empty 'two-top' tables and sat us at one in the back corner that was still being cleaned, soaking wet, and missing silverware. She plopped the menus on the table and hurried away. The table stayed wet without anyone noticing. Nobody walked by for me to ask for help so I took matters into my own hands. I was happy about the timeliness of the service and food, but I never saw a manager in the restaurant. I wouldn't have mentioned anything about my experience. I have worked in the industry for seven years, so I understand that sometimes things don't go according to plan and employees don't always perform their jobs at their highest capabilities. I will return to this Ihop. I encourage other people to dine at this Ihop if they are nearby and are craving a decent sized breakfast. They even have a girl who makes balloon animals and paints your face! All in all, I spent $23 in total on two meals and two coffees. As a college student, this is exactly the amount of money I would like to spend on a breakfast. Next time, I am sure the service will be better."}
{"text":"We had Emily as our waitress late at night and she made our experience wonderful. Also the kitchen staff did a good job on our food. Best IHOP I've ever been to"}
{"text":"You know when it is midnight and your hungry you are limited to 24 hour breakfast dinners and 24 hour mexican food"}
{"text":"It's late. You are hungry and everything is closed. Look up. You're in IHOP. 

How did you get here? 

Don't worry about it. A dejected waitress will lead you to a stained booth with a slightly sticky table. 

Get a coffee. Yes, it's mediocre, but it's late. There's nothing else to choose from. 

Ask the waitress if there is red #40 in the strawberry topping. 
\"What's that a dye or something, hunny?\"
\"Yes.\"
\"Probably. Everything is processed here\", said the waitress in the same tone as if to?say \"do you want the slop or not, piggy?\"

You do want the slop. You are desperate. It's late. 
Order something.
It's gonna be bland or slightly plastic-y tasting. It's better than the emptiness that was there before. 

Your waitress keeps the drinks filled and stops by a few times. She does the minimum without a smile or kind word. You wonder if this is standard service or if something happened to her. 

You get up to pay and see a customer loudly complain that his takeout meal costs too much (it doesn't). The waitress calmly responds to this nonsense, gently telling him to pay or kick rocks. 

Now you understand the joyless waitress and just hope to make it out of the restaurant without laughing in the face of Complaint Man when he asks the waitress: 
\"Can you break a $50?\""}
{"text":"This particular location is horrible. The staff is always unfriendly and they never get our order right. On our LAST visit, they sat us next to a table where the table next to us had an obviously sick customer. The restaurant was empty & they sit my family next to someone coughing up a lung. Seriously?! We immediately asked to be moved and the service went downhill. Took about 45 minutes to get food. Items were missing and we had to chase the staff down for that & drink refills. This has been the case every time we've been here. We will travel farther to avoid this location in the future. 90th & Shea or Cactus are worth the extra travel time."}
{"text":"We actually drive further to go to this location. We were here on Saturday and really enjoyed our meal. The staff here has consistently been better than the IHOP located off of Pima & the 101. They are friendly here and we haven't had issues with them getting our orders right. The restaurant has recently been remodeled. We are looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Me and my family eat here once a month. We have always had pretty good service. Sometimes I have to ask for a refill, but that's ok. I am not expecting a waitress at my table every 5 minutes. Just want them on the floor when I need to flag them. They always give me a to go cup of coffee when I ask and I have never had a problem."}
{"text":"ZERO....horrible service... Not coming back and not recommending it to family and friends..."}
{"text":"We visited IHOP on a Sunday afternoon for an early dinner. It seemed like we were seated in a section which wasn't being taken care of. We waited for quite a long time but eventually gave up and actively sought out wait staff. The waitress we were eventually pointed to had been in the area. When she was notified by another employee that she had a table, she seemed annoyed. After a few more minutes our waitress came to take our order.

It took a long time for our order to be brought to us and when it did the entrees came out one person at a time with a lot of lag in between. The first order to arrive was an omelet. It was cold and the cheese was dry on top. The next person's chicken fried steak and eggs were cold. My chicken fried steak dinner was served after my broccoli was finally cooked but most of the meal was really cold.

When we complained about our meal the manager asked \"What do you want me to do about it?\" We certainly didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for them to re-cook our food so we just stated that our food is bad and we won't eat it or pay for it. They said fine and we left hungry."}
{"text":"I love breakfast food, I only eat out since I dont like to clean up the mess I make. It is very easy to make the food they make at these places but if you want a meal that is as close to some home cooking as you can get hit up your local Ihop. I love the pancakes and the omlets with a big glass of milk. Being open 24 hours mean no matter what time of the day its always a great time for the most important meal of the day :) Breakfast."}
{"text":"The food probably is the same processed crap as other IHOP's.  I can't verify this because no one came to our table 15 minutes after getting our drinks, so we walked out."}
{"text":"Today, 12/16/17 the waitress was nice the food came quick however the grapes had mold on it, really?!! The manager said sorry and took $5 off bill. Yikes!"}
{"text":"I called to place a to-go order on Sunday morning and was left on hold for about 10 minutes. Eventually I hung up and called another location; I was able to place my order without a wait. Didn't want to believe the Yelp reviews but I can tell the customer service at this location is lacking."}
{"text":"Wish I had read the reviews before we settled on this place. I usually don't eat iHop but it was close to out hotel; bad idea. Restaurant wasn't crowded but the service was still extremely slow and our food came out cold."}
{"text":"This the same as any i hop that you go to it  does not really change unless you are at a place where you might get shot. there food is alright the only thing that separates i hop from denies is the syrup they have better syrup."}
{"text":"The food quality changes from week to week, varies from great to very bad. They must change kitchen staff often. The breaking point came when my kids sent me a $50 IHOP gift certificate that came as a photo on my cellphone. When I tried to use it by showing the IHOP barcode on my iPhone none of the cashiers knew how to deal with it and I was forced to pay cash. I emailed the gift certificate back to my daughter. Maybe the servers in California are smarter than here and will know how to process it."}
{"text":"This is the nicest and friendliest Ihop I have ever been to.

This place is fairly new and in a pretty decent location. It's 24 hours and kind of small but the inside has a great modern look to it. 

The wait staff was very welcoming and made you feel like family. They are super sweet and honestly gave me one of my best experiences at an Ihop to date.

I got the double chocolate chocolate chip pancakes since I've been craving them for weeks. They were cooked perfectly and brought me back to my childhood. My hubby got the pumpkin waffle sundae and it was amazing! Definitely worth a visit to Ihop."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of IHOP but a coworker wanted to go for lunch. 
We were being served by Angelos.  That was the best service I've seen in a while.  Great job Angelos! Keep smiling and you'll do great."}
{"text":"Please have a 0 star option. This is the worst IHOP ever. Every time I come here either they bring you half the tables order and forget the rest or tell you we can't give you food for an hour. I hate Denny's I hate Del taco but if you're in this area go there or go home have cereal save your money. Do they know how to run a business?? F this place."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 breakfast samplers on Uber eats and asked for white toast. They replaced my pancakes with the toast instead. I call, a guy answers and tells me he has no idea what I'm talking about and that there's not a manager on shift.. How do you run a restaurant with no manager? He asks if I want to go pick up the pancakes. I ordered delivery for a reason, no I do not want to go pick them up. He keeps telling me he doesn't know what's going on. I just hung up. Please take a look at what you're sending out before you do. I spent $30 for an order I'm not satisfied with. That's good money going down the drain. Thanks, IHOP.. Your incompetence is brilliant."}
{"text":"Sat here for 15 minutes and did not even get coffee brought to us, water, nothing. Flagged down another waitress who said ours was getting our drinks. Nope.  Got up and went to panera instead. Many empty tables and lots of servers.  I will never in life return!"}
{"text":"July 7 was there 60th anniversary and .60 pancakes all day , safe to say we left pancaked!"}
{"text":"Best hangover food at any hour !  Bacon scramble is the way to go"}
{"text":"Having a great experience at Ihop so far. Reyna is a great server. Very attentive.  Food was great and good follow throwgh on the service all night."}
{"text":"It's IHOP so you know what you're getting. What I don't understand is the service. There must be about 15 people running around looking busy but nobody cooking because it takes forever to get your food. And why is it always cold?  Every time. And the coffee is weak and lukewarm."}
{"text":"I love IHOP but this location is simply not the best. One hostess named Corine made even seating us seem like a hassle and was sassy when I asked (again) for the kids menu. The hash browns were burnt and my daughter found a hair in her fruit. not to mention it took 25 minutes to get the bill. Wont be returning to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"Great service, IHOP food standards, and a location right where I needed it. My only complaints were that we had business to do, and they sat us at a table that could barely fit our plates (it was soooo small). They also had run out of whipped cream (take $5 out of the petty-cash and go get some at the store across the street). 

On a more positive note, Gabby our waitress was very personable, and attentive. She made sure to come up with a couple alternatives for us, because of the no whipped cream situation. Great job."}
{"text":"This place is ok. There's really nothing that actually stands out here. Their service is ok. Their food is ok. The prices for their food is a bit high but when you're hungry and that's all that's open, you might be willing to spend a little. 

Normal breakfast (split decision) but customized it. You get 2 eggs but I added an extra. You get 2 pieces of bacon and 2 sausages but I swapped the sausage out for more bacon and then you get French toast and pancakes which I swapped the pancakes out for hash browns. 

She initially got confused with the sausage swap but immediately fixed it. My hubby got the same w a coke while I had water and it totaled $33.00. 

Again, not bad but ok and it's what I expect at an IHOP."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of chains, however I made an exception for IHOP and I was pleasantly surprised. The server on St. Patrick's day was great. She let me order off the kids menu and I was very grateful. The food was normal quality chain food, but it hit the spot."}
{"text":"IHOP is one of those places that you always know what you are going to get. Personally, I always end up there after a long night so I rarely have to deal with the real breakfast crowds. The late night servers are very laid back and friendly. Probably due to the fact that they haven't seen a customer in hours when I roll in. I go simple here, eggs, pancakes, bacon, that sort of thing. It always comes out as ordered and fills up my drunk tum tum. Is it the best food, no. The classiest atmosphere, no. Is everything delicious and reasonably prices, heck yes. See you after the next night out!"}
{"text":"My family and I eat at this location on a regular basis. Every time we visit we are met with great food and incredible service. Everyone is always very happy and willing to help. The last visit this past Saturday we arrived with a larger than normal party. The manager, Cassy, was very helpful and pleasant."}
{"text":"Service is slow, coffee is water down and salad is stale, not fresh and soak with dressing."}
{"text":"My fav late night breakfast spot. Not busy & waitress is alone but on point. Always remembers what I had. Very relaxing & food comes out good."}
{"text":"Service was slow & the servers were very unprofessional & childish. Good was okay for an IHOP. Need a more mature staff.   When we left like four of them went out to smoke!!!"}
{"text":"Several visits have been horrible. Don't ever come here unless I have to. Last time we walked out after 40 min waiting on breakfast food and a horrendous waitress that never checked on us. HOWEVER it's next door to my mechanic and sometimes we just come over when waiting on the car. The ONLY SAVING GRACE IN THIS PLACE IS SEAN. BEST WAITER. GREAT ATTITUDE AND VERY ATTENTIVE.  if I ever come here I will only ask for him. He deserves better than to work in this location. Great job Sean. Thanks for being a great server."}
{"text":"Ok its off the beaten track as far as the strip is concerned. It's close to Sam's Town and a couple other casinos. The neighborhood is pretty abysmal and tragic but lots of different parts of Vegas are.

I am a Vegas native that moved away as soon as I became 21 and never looked back. Other than to visit family friends and have the occasional bachelor party bender I avoid the place like the plague. BUT... U gotta eat sometimes right? 

IHOP. Dependable for breakfast. Service was adequate but considering the area, I was quite satisfied with this place.

A couple things to note... Strong institutional coffee, only non-dairy creamer, there is buttermilk added to omlettes, great BOGO coupons are avail in the local coupon clippers (thanks mom).   

If you need to grub then this IHOP can fufill that need. Not a great neighborhood but like another reviewer, this place does not necessarily reflect the sadness of the area."}
{"text":"This has got to be the most professional and well managed iHop I've been to in Vegas! 

We got there on a Sunday morning at around 10:30. Even though there was a lobby full of customers waiting,  we were seated within 10 minutes.  Every employee that we came in contact with was courteous and spoke to us in such a professional manner.  

Our server promptly took our order and had our drinks to our table.  We ordered French Toast,  International Passport,  and the stuffed crepes combo.  Our food came out just as ordered."}
{"text":"The food was brunt on one of the sample breakfast, then we ordered it again and then the eggs were under cooked and they gave us rotten grapes and the pancakes were burned. The food was utterly disgusting."}
{"text":"Kay was our waitress was awesome!! The food was great, but the water not so good, but they can't help where there water comes from. Yes I will eat here again most likely tomorrow and Saturday morning. Lol"}
{"text":"From 9/15/15

Came here because every now and then I need an IHOP fix. This IHOP is located on Decatur BLVD and is surrounded by restaurants plus a ton of construction going on. When we came in it was packed, we waited to be seated which only took a few minutes because the couple ahead of us refused a small booth- hey their loss!

We got to our booth and ordered the two pancakes, hash browns, fruit instead of eggs and of course bacon! I got the Double Blueberry Pancakes, which were what you expect IHOPY- delicious. Hopefully, when we come back, it won't be so crazy at this location"}
{"text":"Ok just came in..hope it gets better..I will finish review after we eat.. uggh wait time was forever... but food was good my hubby loved his so much he must have mentioned it 6 x ...."}
{"text":"So me and some  friend went to this I hop today. I have the worst service I have ever had in my life. My friend had to wait about 20 more minutes for his food to come while we had ours ready. I had to remind the waiter that there was still an order missing. He brought it right away so we could tell it had been ready all along. He just forgot it. He didn't ask my other friend what kind of sauce she would like for her chicken. He didn't bring us syrup for our pancakes until much later. It felt like he wasn't all there. The wrost thing that happened was he didn't let us pay at the front so we could all split our tabs. Because of this,  he confused our payments and i ended up paying more than i should have. He was unprofessional and seemed like it was his first day at the job. I think he shouldve comped one of the meals to make up for the mistakes. Me and my friends are not satisfied with that waiter and it has made us not want to go to that location anymore."}
{"text":"It's IHOP. For some people, that phrase brings dread and disappointment, for others joy and find memories. After the recent remodel, this location brings more of the latter than the former. The most recent specials, with the brioche French toast is amazing. The service is fantastic, the restrooms are acceptable, and the place is easy to find. The one downside is that for the last three weeks they have been playing nothing but The Beatles. Whomever is in charge of the music may want to change things up on occasion."}
{"text":"We arrived today at 915 am we walked out an hour and 15 minutes later with no food. We had to ask for a waitress to help us after 10 minutes. Poor service and very disorganized!"}
{"text":"This IHOP location gets people because it's at a great spot.  So I guess they could care less about their reviews.  Somebody else was already complaining when I came in.  She was extremely frustrated because she ordered take-out and her bill was wrong and not being fixed right. Anyway, my complaints.  The waiter was pushing me to order, I guess within his own time frame.  It's $3 for crappy coffee.  IHOP does not stand for creative cooking but their only dish with egg whites is so unimaginative my dog could have cooked it.  I gave the waiter a $100 bill.  I was owed back $87.31, and the waiter gave me back only $87.  The manager? noticed I had a quizzed look, I told him I wanted my 31 cents, so he went to the cash register and gave it  to me.  He said there was no change, so he gave me a dollar bill instead. The waiter was laughing.  So I decided to laugh back and gave him no tip.  Hahaha, Carlos!
You shouldn't be in the service industry, amigo!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Hostess was rude. Waitresses never offered refills. Quick to bring check tho. Came in for dessert. Never again."}
{"text":"Came here at 9:05 pm and there was 1 party in the dining room....left at 9:20 after being blatantly ignored by the servers"}
{"text":"Our server has been with IHOP for 22 years and did cool cup tricks! Best service ever. Wish I could remember his name!"}
{"text":"The food was disgusting. My woman ordered a steak omelet with no mushrooms and hash browns. The omelet, tasteless and it had mushrooms in it. Hash browns were not cooked as instructed and when it was \"corrected\" the food looked like it threw it self up and died, than they fried it up and put it on the plate and added cheese to the top. My food was missing ingredients. Looked NOTHING like the photo on the menu. That omelet was tasteless as well. When I explained to out server that we were dissatisfied with our meals he insisted that we'd speak with his manager like he couldn't handle the situation himself."}
{"text":"We had Gladys as our waitress and she was on top of everything . Food came out hot and it was delicious ."}
{"text":"Stopped by this morning for some breakfast.  It didn't look that busy and there were lots of employees hanging around.   We stood by the host stand for a while but eventually sat down in the waiting area.   THREE separate employees came up, one took a phone order and two others were looking through some stuff under the counter.  None of them acknowledged us at all and then they strolled off without saying anything.  There was also a plastic bag just sitting up by the cash register for what I'm assuming was a pick up order.  They didn't keep it in the back or anything.  It was just dropped off and then left unattended the entire time we sat up there waiting.   We ended up walking out and went to a different restaurant.  Definitely won't be returning when there are plenty of great places on the same street."}
{"text":"This IHOP reinforced my opinion of this chain as one of my least favorites. My family likes it, but I do not. Sara, our waitress was pleasant, though obviously rushed and overworked. We overheard the manager publicly shaming an employee in front of other employees. Food was adequate. Men's and ladies rooms were embarrassingly dirty and had clogged toilets."}
{"text":"Changing to one star for pure incompetence. After I got my food home. THEY DIDN'T EVEN GIVE ME WHAT I ORDERED. Can you read?!?!  On top of that my food was undercooked. Save your money and do to McDonalds."}
{"text":"The only asset to this restaurant is Chico.
This guy was so ridiculously awesome as a server it was mind blowing.
I have never had such great service at a chain restaurant in my life.

Thats the only review I will give of this place. 
It was New Years day, packed as hell, line out the door. Every server has a sour puss on their face. I'm sure they were all busting their butts that day because it was so busy, but Chico had the best attitude. Make that guy a manager!"}
{"text":"I showed up this morning. I was really craving a milkshake and French fries. I ordered my shake and fries. I never got my fries because she never wrote it on her pad. She comes back 10 minutes later and tells me the milkshake machine is broken. I responded and just asked for a Sunday. They come back and ask me if I would like hot fudge and I say yes. Then, 10 minutes later they come back over and tell me that they are out of hot fudge. The service was very poor. I will give you one more chance IHOP. One more chance.."}
{"text":"Walked in on Sunday evening with my dad wasn't that crowded but only one server. Waited for about 5 mins when finally the cook came and sat us said it wouldn't be very long(should of been our first hint) Afrer sitting for another 5 mins server came by said she would be right with us didn't even take a drink order. After another 10 mins or so we finally walked out. In total we were there for close to half hour and never even got to order drinks. 

Last time we were at this location waitress brought my daughter over a pancake (she's two) while we waited cause they were busy witch I thought was nice. That's until I found out she charged us for it. Also my wife's food was wrong and it took them 15 mins too bring her food back correctly. Food is always good but it's a pricy especially for bad service."}
{"text":"We came in late at night. They seated us right away, but it took half a hour for water. The other drinks didn't come until the meal did a hour later. My pancakes were wrong and and so was my Fiance' drink.The checks were promised to come soon but didn't. We had to start walking out to finally see the checks. The staff was friendly but that doesn't change the bad service overall."}
{"text":"The food was OK not the best. The staff aint really helpful... There was two that was just coming and asking the same questions after the other just left. (As in our drinks & order) Onces we order nobody ever came back to our table."}
{"text":"So I went to this location this morning for the first time. Not the best IHOP I ever been to. First of all, our server Austin got our order wrong. My girl ordered pancakes with hashbrowns on the side. He brought her scrambled eggs and bacon. Plus the pancakes were on a plate to small to eat off. The plate (saucer) was the same size as the pancakes. If you pour syrup on it where would it run. I also noticed Austin didn't write down our orders, he relied on memory which isn't always a good thing. That's probably why he got our order wrong. Other than that everything was cool."}
{"text":"The wait was 15 minutes. The location is quite good. Serves classic American food. Serves good pancakes. The staff is nice and courteous."}
{"text":"Goes to show that you can get 5 Star service off the strip. I dint fo into restaurants looking for flaws, but this visit this morningvwas flawless. The restaurant was clean, all staffin my view were professional and attentive to the guest needs. Great Job Janet and entire staff."}
{"text":"My family always looks forward to eating at IHOP. I love that we can choose between breakfast (which is what they are known for), or lunch. And best of all THE KIDS EAT FREE after four pm!!!!!!!!!!! The price is still over $30 but most of the time under $40- and that's for two kids and two adults.
The pancakes are the BEST!!! The consistency is on point, always fresh food and cooked to our liking. Eggs with the yoke running and white cooked.... They make them the best!!!!
One plus is a nice waitress that works days. I have no clue her name, but she is a young, light skinned black lady there. She was always smiling, keep making sure we are okay. She was very sweet."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean.  Service was too slow for us.  After waiting a while after being seated, we never saw a server.  Then we noticed several tables around us also had not ordered.  We finally left without ordering.  10am on a Sunday morning - steady but not slammed.  Not sure if we walked in on the front side of a rush, but it wasn't good timing or a good experience for us."}
{"text":"If you want a crape go to the Paris Hotel ... you will spend the same amount if money and get a much better meal! I paid 55.00 for 4 people for breakfast. I received two tiney crapes with stawberry syrup & 4 previously frozen strawberries on top... waste of time and money! ! I thought this place was cheap... I guess the food is... save your money, go to the Paris Hotel and get a decent pastry! 
The waitrss was sow embarassed when I inquired about my 9.00 crapes ... she tried to make it better by bringme some fresh fruit. Save yourselfthe headache keep on driving!"}
{"text":"Horrible Sunday morning visit to IHOP. Waited 45 min for food which included raw bacon!!! 5 tables around us got up and left after waiting so long for their food. Asked to speak to a manager and the manager never came over to address the long wait and undercooked food. Our server was wonderful and he is not at fault. One of the workers busing the table walked by and made the comment \" IHOP is some bullshit\". While I agree, the comment was inappropriate and unprofessional as there were children around. This location needs some serious attention!!! If you live in Charlotte or visiting the area DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast at this location today.  Our server was Anne, and she was extremely nice.  She even suggested a different order that would save us money and give us more food!  This location is cleaner than all other ones in the Charlotte area (Kannapolis, Univ City), and is very large.  The staff was friendly, and they seemed to enjoy working together too.  Food was standard IHOP fare, and came out hot and exactly as we ordered it.  The highlight of this visit was definitely our server.  Kudos to Anne."}
{"text":"Considering the recent name change to IHOB, I expected to be impressed with the NEW BURGERS. Went there 15Jun2018, around 4 pm.
Alas, that was not the case. The online menu listed 3 slider hamburgers, but they were not offered at the Power Road location. 
The Cowboy BBQ Burger was ok, but nothing to brag about.

For some reason it is always very warm in there, like maybe the A/C is broke, or too costly to run."}
{"text":"BY FAR THE SLOWEST LOCATION EVER!! Just save your time drive the extra couple miles and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"This location is horrible! Went in for breakfast, it was so hot inside my youngest daughter got sick, had to ask to turn on the a/c. Service was super slow, had to ask for everything, refills napkins and got the order wrong. We will never stop here again!"}
{"text":"IHOP is the same everywhere which is good, you can't go wrong. I'm a fan of the breakfast sampler but no pancakes just toast. My husband loves the cheeseburger. Never greasy! If you haven't had the cheeseburger, we highly recommend you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong at IHOP, great food, good service. This location had a women making animal balloons for the kiddos which my kids loved. 

Only thing is this location is always busy, it's close to the strip so you'll get all the tourists."}
{"text":"Just your standard Ihop. I like to meet my family in Gastonia here for breakfast because it's so close to 85- I can get here and home quickly.

I remember when they first opened up- I was in high school or had just graduated and we loved to call to hear them answer the phone, \"IHOP on Cox.\""}
{"text":"My first visit went well, but I returned a second time and was very disappointed. The server tried to be nice but between her non-understandable \"accent\" and inability to multi-task our breakfast was not a very good experience.There were only 2 of us. One ice tea came in an almost full glass and the other about 3/4 full. Weird! My food came out and maybe 5 minutes later the other food came out. I opened my utensils and there was hardened food all over my knife. Then thirdly my bisquits & gravy came out ice cold. When I sent it back for heating, I also asked for a second plate. The bisquits came back hot, but the plate never arrived. Finally the busboy got it for us. I spoke with the manager and he apologized but I have made my decision about the likelihood of returning there. Maybe they were having a bad day but i was not the only one complaining. Have been to other IHOPs and never experienced this."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my breakfast the food was very good the service was excellent I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"You can smell the dirt the moment you walk in! I'm an IHOP lover,  but this location should have it's logo ripped off!
Let's start with the lady who called herself the manager,  she was the nastiest person I have ever encountered for no reason, no smile,  no joy,  no customer service skills,  no \"Hi, welcome to ihop\" just a look like she can't take the smell of the place either!
The waitresses looked like they were miserable as well. Had the \"help me\" look. 
I couldn't even bring myself to order. Was scared I would catch the misery bug!!
By far the worst location I have ever been to without ordering food."}
{"text":"If you're starving and in a hurry to eat do not come here. It's quite a wait to order and for food. The AC does suck. However the food I ordered was really good."}
{"text":"Order one cupcake pancake for pick up was told it would take ten minutes and 30 minutes later I'm still sitting here waiting. There's a ton of workers a zero minute wait time for people dining in the restaurant. It's my first time coming to ihop it's a terrible first impression."}
{"text":"It's always nice when your food arrives hot and fast. The service needs some work. 

Came in with my friend Mike for breakfast before I had to work. It was last minute and down the street. Totally forgot it was Veterans Day. Tons of people waiting to be seated. Couldn't find the hostess because lots of people were paying their bills too. Finally the hostess waved us over. Asked the hostess how long the wait was for 2. She said 10 minutes. She wasn't kidding in 10 minutes we were seated. 

Our server was promptly at our table not once did this woman smile. I get it you hate your job it's Veterans Day and it's busy. Well pretend your smile means more tips because it does. Any ways we ordered coffee and waters. When she came back we were ready to order. We both had the perfect combo with regular pancakes. Our food arrived in 5 minutes. My eggs over hard hiss scrambled everything cooked perfectly even the hash browns! 

And when our food arrived the server came with the check. Talk about eat and run! I'm ok with that on my lunch break when I'm short on time. But that seemed a bit like eat up and get out. Well Mike was buying and I'm sure he barely tipped if he did tip. 

Smile act like you are happy we are here. Because some of us tip good for good service."}
{"text":"Been waiting for food for 45 minutes.  Now told they only have two cooks.  Also told they had an order printer problem.  People around me have waited for over an hour."}
{"text":"Well... IHOP is IHOP, or as they are now saying IHOB... but it is usually satisfying... unless you stray from your norm. I did that today by ordering an omelette... not realizing they will throw some pancake batter in there. Mind you, the idea of some pancake batter mixed with the omelette doesn't sound so bad until you realize... they cook the omelette then put a nasty slather of batter in before they fold the omelette. The omelette was actually pretty good until I unearthed the goo waiting to overrun the omelette... like breaking open that blister and spilling out the.... well.... you get the picture. It was quite disgusting and unexpected. Not sure who thought this would be a good idea, but I'm sure it came from the parent company, Applebee's. Sad to say, but this was a total surprise and want to be sure others don't want experience the same \"puss-filled\" reaction. Stick to the pancakes.... the ones they actually cook through and through! Ugh!!"}
{"text":"I gave this place 3 stars because our server (Charolett) is awsome! However  while waiting to be seated this time I had a view of the kitchen. I watched as some dropped  a fork and knife on the ground. After 9 people  either  kicking walking around or stepping on them, stone finally  bent over and picked them up. Got to wonder if those 9 thought it Wasn't there job or if it was beneath them to do the right thing."}
{"text":"Horrible service!  Took almost an hour to get our food, when did finally get it the food was barely warm then we had to wait for someone to wash silverware (that is exactly what she told us when we asked for silverware), 3 of us had coffee 2 had sodas....no refills!  To top it off, the place smells like raw sewage.  The manager DID cover our meals."}
{"text":"They get one star each for the pancakes and the hot chocolate. I wish I could give another half a star just cause it wasn't \"good\" but it wasn't \"meh\" either. That is the extent of passable stuff. It really shouldn't take 45 minutes to make stack of pancakes. It was dead, the restaurant was less than half full. I understand the service being slow, since there were two servers for the entire restaurant. They also only had one cook working the entire restaurant. Kudos for those three employees keeping it going. However, management needs to step up their scheduling game and make sure they have enough people working."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in IHOP this morning. Ordered biscuits and gravy with hardly no gravy and on top of that it was cold. Spoke with manager, instead of offering to remake my meal right, he offered to put it in the MICROWAVE!!!!. I POLITELY LEFT THE PLACE. HORRIBLE SERVICE THIS MORNING. RUINED MY MORNING!!!!"}
{"text":"Generally a decent location. Today there was hair in both mine & my friend's food :( it was the servers first day so we didn't wanna tell her :/

Service was good."}
{"text":"This was the worst i hop i ever went in my life it took 1 hour to get us ower food and the waiter \"angle\" was the worst waiter in the world"}
{"text":"Stopped here after having an MRI done to get some food as my sugar was getting low.

We were seated fairly quickly which should have been as it was fairly empty.

Once seated we ordered an appetizer sampler platter and the childs food as he was very hungry and usually order like this so that he can eat and not be freaking out due to hunger.

It took at least 20 minutes for the appetizer to arrive and at least 10 minutes more for his cheeseburger. 

He was happy playing and loved the fruit.

Wifey got the new sweet crepes combo and loved them.

Daughter got double crepes turkey bacon and eggs.  She has no idea that you say without specific amounts they always give you the larger most expensive size.  Of course her meal was the most expensive.   Oh well at
lleast this time she ate most of it.

I ordered a simple double cheeseburger no onion or lettuce and add mayo and pickle.  The toasted bun was burnt all around tge edges making the taste totally unacceptable.   After pulling apart the bun and ripping it to shreds I was able to eat a portion of it ending up with about 2/3 of 1 bun as my top and bottom. 

I had ordered the potato bacon soup also and it arrived after reminding the server she was apologetic and brought me a bowl that was scorching hot.  You can tell it was microwaved and the look was very very yellow.

Not one cent was taken off of our check of 53.38.

I have eaten in many ihops all over this country and can say this was the worst I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"finally we went here on Friday morning it was near where we went shopping for the skechers shoes. I totally wanted something different besides fast food in vegas.  our waiter had a sense of humor which was pretty cool of him."}
{"text":"Its interesting what one week can do. Came to this location again for the holiday. It was Night & day from last week...... Super slow on seating, understaffed on waiters, phone at the front counter rings and rings with no sense of priority of answering it, and my order was wrong but I was so hungry from the long wait I did not bother sending it back. Our waitress came to the table took our order without introducing herself. We came back solely because of Daija, but she was not working on New Years day."}
{"text":"Came for early morning (pre-dawn) breakfast with 5 other families. They only had one server but seeing this large group, manager stepped in. Our orders were taken in no time and food coming out without any delay either. Really appreciated the good service and keeping up with our large group. Definitely great service. Food wise you know you are getting pancakes and eggs, so they are same as any other IHOP or Denny's. For me service was exceptionally great. Definitely would recommend this particular location."}
{"text":"We love coming here. We had Stephanie again she is awesome. It was a nice surprise to see her as she usually works the late shift.  Best waitress we have ever had and we have been coming here since they opened the doors."}
{"text":"Update: we will no longer coming to this location. We were sat immediately and our waiter Xavier came over and asked for our drink order. Apparently I didn't answer him fast enough to order my coffee and he said ok 2 waters and started to walk away. My girlfriend said he would like coffee, he gave out an audible sigh and snatched the coffee carafe off the table. He comes back dropped off the drinks with an attitude took our order and we haven't seen him since. He went on break and never said a word. Awesome so we've been sitting here wonder why this lovely young lady has been so nice and waiting on our table. The best part of this is the face I went to put syrup on my pancakes and there was a hair. A long human hair on the syrup server. DISGUSTING!! Paying my bill and getting out ASAP! Save your self the trouble go elsewhere!


This is our second trip in the last 2 months. More than likely our last as well. Food is ok no more no less, coffee has no flavor, and the service is fair at best. So I bring my girlfriend in for her free birthday stack. We were greeted right away and she informs the hostess about her coupon. We get seated and the hostess informs us about all you can eat pancakes, awesome! Our waiter comes over, and I ask him if we can use her birthday coupon with the all you can eat pancakes. Got told no, this is now the second time this has happened. The first time we both ordered specials and were told we couldn't use a coupon either. IHOP is so money hungry it's insane. Our food was ok nothing extravagant but it's IHOP no big surprise. Eggs were watery and runny not unusual, French toast was over cooked, bacon burnt, and pancakes fall apart the minute you put syrup on them. Again awesome! Our server came over all but once to check on us and when we mentioned a complaint about the smell of a dirty du in our section we were asked if we wanted to be moved, um no we're almost done eating, please go address the problem. End of meal table gets cleaned off our waiter takes my card and runs the bill, then somebody we haven't seen the entire time we've been here brings my card back and tells us to have a nice day. Yes thank you IHOP have to pay for under portioned food, the smell of a loaded diaper all while the child screams. I'll make sure to have a great day."}
{"text":"This has been our go to spot for breakfast since we've been coming to Vegas, and we've only cheated twice. However, today we were VERY disappointed! Usually our wait is 20-30 minutes and everything has been good to great. Today the wait was 5 minutes and the food was cold, undercooked AND the service was horrible. I guess IF we go back again, we will go when it's super busy!"}
{"text":"Very slow servers. Kitchen is slow. Woman in the kitchen talking loud enough for all the customers to learn all about the latest gossip of the goings on at the local IHOP"}
{"text":"Based on our experience today, things must have changed around here since people wrote those earlier, negative reviews. (It's a pretty new location and it probably takes a little while to get things up to speed.) 
Anyway - we LOVED it. It's a beautiful location -- clean, big, airy and sunny. We've eaten at a lot of iHop locations, and this is by far the nicest. The food was also excellent. While it's the same menu of course, we thought the food was actually better than usual. Finally -- the service was so friendly all around -- starting with the people who seated us, our lovely, bubbly waitress (Leah) -- all the way to the manager who stooped by to see how our meal was. 
Highly recommend this iHop. We will DEFINITELY be back!!"}
{"text":"we had a good waitress and it was busy bc it was sunday morning but when we checked out the girl ally i think her name was was soooo rude to us and treated us very unkindly. she treated us like we were stupid and it made the 4 of us really mad. we felt hurt."}
{"text":"Came in at 10:45 PM with a group of six.  Messed up our order after a 1 hour wait and said they had to remake 2 of the orders because they were now cold .  Total wait for order was 1.5 hours. Then manager tells us that she can't split the ticket after 10PM. But would give us a discount!! Worst experience I have ever had at an ihop."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and atmosphere. My daughter and I ate here two days in a row while traveling. Sharon was our server both days. A manager visited our table both days. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Everything was messed up but the quality of the food. No server, no silver ware, got order wrong, then server offered discount and then the manager declined. Not trying to get free food but common how hard is it to make couple eggs right?"}
{"text":"40 minutes of wait time with 7 open tables. Explain that. Then, we sit for another 25 minutes just to get our food. This is the norm at this location. We've talked to managers and it never improves. Unfortunately, this is walking distance from our house. Please, drive to a different location cause the service and quality of the food isn't worth the convenience of the short trip."}
{"text":"As far as an IHOP goes, the food was hot and 
good. The best part of our breakfast was our waiter Shaheed. He was very friendly and prompt. We will eat here again!"}
{"text":"Food was below average.. my gravy was cold, the Avocado on my omelets had brown spots.the service wasn't pleasant.. I wouldn't recommended this location"}
{"text":"Horrible, waste of $, better food and service at the local homeless shelter! I would rather eat \"slop\" at one of Sheriff Arpiao's county Jails than ever be subject to the horrible service and microwaved food at this sorry excuse for a restaurant, seriously! I should have known when we arrived and there was an elderly couple leaving with a disgusted look on their faces. Upon entering this substandard, nightmarish restaurant we waited five to seven minutes in the lobby (with no line ahead of or behind us) before anyone even bothered to seat us, when the hostess finally decided to approach us, she nonchalantly told us \"pick any table you like\" so we did. We sat and ordered coffee for my wife and I and hot coco for my step son we also ordered two vanilla shakes for my stepson and I. The coffee was the only item that we didn't have a problem with out of the whole meal, the waiter was young, poorly groomed and extremely rude. 15 minutes after ordering our shakes he informed us that they ran out of ice cream so he brought us our shakes in one juice cup and one water cup and assured us they would both be on the house - due to their lack of ice cream. We ordered our food and waited a good 45 minutes and just as we were frustrated enough to leave our food arrived my stepson's chocolate chocolate chip pancakes were surprisingly perfect, my New York Cheese Cake Pancakes were hot on the outside and frozen in the center, as was my strawberry topping, my bacon was burnt and my hash browns were also fairly cold. I ordered a side of smoked sausage which was supposed to be two links but was only one when our server delivered it to the table. My wife's pick a pancake combo was more of the same - pancakes were half cooked, topping was so cold she broke a tooth, hash browns cold in the center, eggs were barely cooked, and bacon was also burnt - she ordered a side of Canadian bacon and not only was it half of one slice of Canadian bacon, it was also half frozen. When we asked to speak to the manager we saw a woman promptly walking towards our table dressed in a sweat suit? When we explained everything that went wrong with our meal she tried everything within her power to not refund our money and when she finally did - all 4 employees in the store hovered around our table as if we were about to rob the place, while we waited for my stepson to finish his food. If I could give this I-hop a negative amount of stars it would have 20 or more. This was by far the worst dining experience of my entire life to date, I would rather lick the bottom of a street beggar's shoe than ever subject myself to such substandard service, ever again!"}
{"text":"Very slow service...Been sitting for about 45 min now and still no food. Never coming back to this location FAIL"}
{"text":"We pulled in here pretty late. We weren't sure if they were open at first because it was so quiet. Sad a few people so decided to go in. Hostess greeted us by opening the door for us, she was very friendly. Waitress was very friendly too. Restraint was clean and the food was good."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom, grandpa and two kids this morning. Everything was spot on. The service, food and atmosphere. We saw managers helping our their employees. Our server Valentino was amazing. Super sweet, super hard worker, we will definitely be back and sure to ask for him again."}
{"text":"I wish so very badly that I could give this particular location a 0 Star review. As soon as we entered we noticed many different groups of people needing to be seated with plenty of seats we also noticed that the hostess stand was a mess. there were a few orders, menus scattered all over the place that were dirty, and they were writing names down to be seated on sheets of napkin.... when we did get seated we were given one menu to share. There was 2 of us. We sat for 30 minutes while several different servers walked right past us. Especially because we we were literally seated by the kitchen. When we did get someone's attention he took our order without writing it down, came back to hear it and write it again, then came back a third time to ask what kind of omelette my dad wanted. Three times we told him our order. During all this we asked for water and coffee. Which we didn't get either. The table next to us offered their coffee pot because they said they were leaving and we probably won't get ours for another 30 minutes. During this wait more people were cleaning tables than serving and taking orders. Priorities completely wrong at this place. When we asked our waiter again for our coffee and water he told us he was new and he doesn't know what to do. We know it's a management issue but come on first thing someone would at any bar restaurant etc is drinks and water. We get our drinks finally then the food comes, still no silverware so we wait again while our food sits. He comes back and we remind him about the silverware. He says no is clean right now. I'm likeeeeeeee.. okay?????? Why is he telling me this but when we could eat the food was good. So was coffee. Avocado on my omelette was hard and the waiter told me it's because they aren't ripe yet. (So why you serving them?) but food was decent. Terrible terrible poor service. And from our table we could hear the workers and cook and manager all yelling at each other in the kitchen. Someone telling the other to act like an effing adult and so on. Terrible. And I believe it all starts with the management. About 15 servers running around like chickens with their heads cut off but not knowing what to start with first. I stayed and ate truly because i was curious how bad it could get from there. Honestly amazing"}
{"text":"What can I say, it's Ihop. Food is nothing spectacular, but the service was awesome! I had a very pleasant dining experience here."}
{"text":"Terrible place, terrible service, terrible food. Steak omelet was supposed to have only steak and they had sausage mixed in. Dirty Place"}
{"text":"Food is good (it's IHOP, i mean if you want real breakfast food go down to the Strip) but you can definitely tell their staff is just all over the place. We waited 10 minutes to be seated-waiters were just looking at us and walking by. There's a \"please wait to be seated\" sign so obviously we were waiting. Finally, we got seated. Our waiter was really nice, you can tell he was trying to do his best. Apparently the kitchen staff didn't know what to do. Got my coffee (which usually takes like 5 minutes) right before my food which probably took an hour. Again, the waiter kept apologizing and it wasn't his fault since he kept going back to check. If i had to go here, i guess i would again but i definitely would go to Bob Evans next time before i chose IHOP"}
{"text":"Good place to go for a quick breakfast. Nothing really sticks out on their menu. Mostly breakfast foods but there are sandwiches, burgers, & salads if you're not much of a breakfast person.

The pancakes are ok. The beau usually gets the chocolate pancakes with chocolate chips. Pretty darn good. They also have 4 different syrups at the table: regular, strawberry, blueberry, butter pecan. Those are the usuals. 

Service is usually on the slower side at any location I go to. And don't wait for the waiter to pick up your check, you gotta go up to the cash register to pay. 

Not my go to breakfast place but it'll do."}
{"text":"First and Last time going to this IHOP. They were not very busy while we were there, but took over 30 minutes for them to bring us our food. Many tables still had dirty dishes that had not been cleared. 

1st waitress when bringing my side of salad dressing served it with a side of her finger in it after i saw her handling money... needless to say i did not eat the dressing. My child got a bowl of fruit after they  did not even ask him what side he wanted for his kids meal and gave him fries. Waitress number two had her fingernail stabbed into a slice of his fruit and pushed the fruit off and left, this occurred right after she was sweeping and using a dustpan. Again, i would not let him eat this fruit with a side of fingernail scum. 

Upon leaving we told the manager of the unsanitary condition and he acted annoyed that we dare bother him with a complaint, needless to say he was not helpful and must enjoy eating contaminated food. 

WIthin an hour of leaving, my youngest was vomiting out his drink and burger that he ordered. He vomited several times till all his toxic lunch was removed from his stomach. I did not see what happened to his food that was prepared in the kitchen, but apparently it was made under very unsanitary conditions."}
{"text":"Worst patty melt ever.  Giant slice of toaster toasted bread with meat patty to cover half the bread and teaspoon sized fried onions and cheese."}
{"text":"How does IHOP mess up breakfst? Like no service. Place is run down-outdated. I sat 25-30 mi- till the waitress said the computrr went down..lost my order. Shld've walked out. Re-ordered-waited 10 more min. Food delivered cold - waffle,  sm. portion eggs, wierd texture, 2 strips cold fatty bacon! Stomach ache.MANY places + service have lost it--is it just not getting the customers? No apology or thanks. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Ok so here's how you should have done it:

You seat customers at clean tables, with a friendly smile on your face.  

You take their order accurately, repeating it back to make sure you didn't miss anything.

You put the order in and the kitchen staff cooks it accurately and quickly, especially when there are only 4 tables in the whole joint.

You deliver the hot, fresh, correct order with another smile.

The customer doesn't get up and walk out because you're a bunch of gross incompetents and doesn't leave you a 1 star review on yelp.

Better luck next time."}
{"text":"I came here with my in laws and had a pretty good experience. My sister in law is very particular to how food is cooked and is blunt about it to. However the waitress we had handled it with grace and was able to fix her order in a jiffy. Food overall was good. Our table was sticky which we wiped down with wet napkins we had in our purses. I was really impressed with the waitress's calm and polite demeanor which seems to be a rarity with wait staff now(even without the in laws being picky)."}
{"text":"This is a somewhat painful review to write because it means finally coming to terms with the loss of a childhood love. I am a breakfast food MONSTER and I had a craving for pancakes a few weeks ago before fueling up for a shopping trip in Robinson.  I should have gone with my first instinct, a local breakfast diner, but I decided we'd come to IHOP because I hadn't been in such a long time and I do enjoy their variety of syrups.  It wasn't very busy when we arrived, and though we were seated right away, it took an inordinate amount of time to get water and our coffee carafe.  I was *thisclose* to suggesting that we bounce and get breakfast at a certain Swedish furniture chain when our harried server finally appeared.  Now, I will say this: the food service industry is grueling work, and our server was doing the best she could.  She was friendly and apologetic for the wait, so I can't fault her.  It just seems like this restaurant is poorly managed. When the food eventually did come, the omlette was decent, but the pancakes....ugh...I couldn't taste them.  Choc full of blueberries and I felt nothing.  No stir of emotion, no tingle of tartness.  At first I thought it was the nasty head cold that I had at the time, foiling attempts to taste food.  But my healthy boyfriend finished my pancakes and he said they tasted bland too.  IHOP, you have ONE job.  And that's to serve baller pancakes.  And you failed.  I wanted to enjoy the experience, but on the whole, it was a flop.  I'm so sorry for both of us."}
{"text":"Both times i been here staff are always very outstanding and food has been made to order hot and fresh. Have not had any issues at all. Both the inside and out has been very clean."}
{"text":"Poor service and dirty pretty much sums up this experience. Asked for a water with lemon. No lemon. Lots of staff working here just walking around attempting to avoid the 6 tables in front of them fill with garbage and unfinished plates. The service here needs a facelift."}
{"text":"Pancakes cold. Country fried steak over cooked. Only good thing about this place was the kind server. NEVER come here again."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with my daughter. Ashley had a cheese omelette and I had the beef tips, hash browns and blueberry pancakes. Well my beef tips were good, pancakes were good but my hash browns were burnt. I could not eat them. The wait staff was very friendly and we were seated immediately after arriving. It was very cold inside though. Other than my burnt hash browns, it was not ok."}
{"text":"This IHOP tends to be both crowded and slow.  These don't work well together.

Aside from the service being friendly but the food coming slowly is the parking.  The parking is a disaster and I have almost been hit by a car while walking, hit by a car while parking, and hit by a car while just driving.  I really don't like how it forces all the traffic into a narrow U shaped parking area.

On the bright side while you are waiting or recovering from a near death experience you can peruse the used bookstore next to the IHOP.

This IHOP is about mid-range when it comes to how new and clean looking it is.  I have seen some fancy IHOP locations and some ones that look like they haven't been renovated since the 1970s.  This one looks to be about the middle of the pack."}
{"text":"Just paid $22 for what was suppose to be a 5 egg California scramble with tortilla, pancakes and a side of toast. It took 8 minutes just to place the order bc I asked for my food to be cooked in a skillet that isnt cooked with meat (which I always do) this call was 4x's as long as it usually takes me. I go in to pick it up asked for condiments on the side and the guy comes out with my tortilla saying he forgot to put it in the bag. I commented on how I'd have left without it and if I need to check if any other parts of my order were left out, to which he replied no no it's all there.

30 mins later Im in my hotel hungry and excited to eat and there's no pancakes and the scramble doesnt have the salsa it's suppose to have, looks like it's missing two eggs (that I paid $4 extra for). Looks like it's just a few eggs with cheese thrown on top and a fee sliced of avocado. I get this order regularly and neeever had something like this.

I honestly don't think my request was that difficult since I get the same thing the same way each time. To charge me more the usual and give me half the meal is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I had come in really early after dropping off at the airport. Once again, the staff is attentive & courteous! John was excellent! I told him I would be here for a few hours until it was time to leave for work. He switched out the regular coffee carafe for the large one! Checked in on me a few times and was quite pleasant. 
The food is always yummy and the music selection pleasant but not too loud."}
{"text":"Very poor service by Mary Jane she is very slow and inconsiderate to her customers and very rude waiter if you get her just leave"}
{"text":"I don't think so. 

IHOP used to be better--now it's just become another homogenized chain restaurant serving a mild variant of what comes of the Sysco truck, just like Applebee's, TGIF, Chili's, you name it. Last time I went here I received impressively anemic pancakes. If you want real pancakes (and other delicious options) try visiting an Original Pancake House, which has great-quality food and perhaps some of the spirit that IHOP used to have. I think something went wrong when they lost the big blue roofs."}
{"text":"Excellent food and the quality is top notch. My Son and I had breakfast here and really appreciate the fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Came @4pm on weekend and service was great. Food came out promptly and waitress kept refilling drinks and checking in on us."}
{"text":"I came in the store wanting to buy a gift card. I was inform that you can ONLY get a gift card with cash. I asked why and the manager said that someone came in there with a stolen cerdit card and got a $1,000 gift card. He shift manager called the GM and the GM said I could only get a gift card if they could take a copy of my ID and Credit card. Why is that? That's to much person information. I HAD MY ID!! THATS NOT MY FAULT THE EMPLOYEE LET SOMEONE BUY A $1, 000 GIFT CARD WITH A CREDIT CARD WITHOUT CHECKING THE ID!!! And for the GM, who know all about credit card fraud asking me for a copy of my card and ID in order to buy a gift card is unacceptable!!!!! The GM name is Bobby Williams WHAT STORE OR RESTAURANT DOES THAT!! BTW I ONLY WANTED A DANG ON $20 gift card! I could even see if I was trying to get the gift card and NO ID ... BUT I HAD MY ID"}
{"text":"Visit on 7/7/17 around 8 pm: I was trying to call in a to go order and I was on hold for 9 min. I hung up the phone and decided to just go in and order (thinking they was busy)... to my surprise they ONLY HAD ABOUT 3 or 4 tables.  Soooooooooo why was I on hold for 9 mins. Anyway my husband LOVED HIS FOOD. Mine ..... was a greasy. I only ate a little bit of mine because it was toooo greasy. My husband was going to eat mine and he had one bite and he also said it was too greasy( happy to know it was not just me)"}
{"text":"Was planning on taking my family out to a late casual dinner. We arrived at this location at about 845pm and had to wait 15 minutes for someone to finally acknowledge the fact that we were there. She welcomed us, asked how many people were in the party then walked away, muttering something under her breath about finding a table big enough to fit my party. Anyone that would have looked around would have seen how empty the place was. This is the second time I come to this location, only to experience horrible service. I wish this place would get their stuff together, because the very first time I visited, I received amazing service."}
{"text":"If I could give a 0 star review I would. We just had the worst experience tonight at the IHOP on Power and Baseline in Mesa Arizona.  I will never be there again and possibly never at IHOP do to the experience and the management that was involved in the experience.  When we got there they were about 3 tables that had people at them  we were seated and our server came and took our order , and that was the last time we saw her as our server.  I had to use the restroom so I went in to use the restroom and the restroom was disgusting there was toilet paper all over the place, 2 of the stalls had toilets needing to be flushed, and the bathroom stunk horribly. Lydia took our order and disappeared and then nikki came and brought us our food after an hour and she said she was going to bring us our condiments and then never came back so I had to go to the kitchen and request them. And then our drinks didn't get refilled for another half hour and then Alek came and refilled our drinks and checked in on us and make sure we were doing okay. At the same time He checked in on a party that ordered right after us, and they asked where their food was. He came back right out immidiately with their food. One of the girls was saying the eggs were cold, and the pancakes were not warm either almost as if their food had been sitting on the counter but their waitress could not be bothered to bring it to them. Their \"waitress\" was the same as ours. He did his best to calm down the upset tables and was explaining why it was taking so long for service and said something about Friday nights being busy, but they only had two servers as staff and that was not enough for a busy night. By the end of our dinner there were 14 tables occupied. Normally probably doable, but if the 2 servers you have are too busy dodging tables onto each other and trying to get off work by not taking care of the tables they have, not so doable. Alek was actually off the clock, but he was the one that took care of us and the other tables in our area for the rest of the time we were there. We kept seeing our server off in the corner (they had the side wings blocked off and weren't seating anyone there) talking to A group of young adults-one of which we later found out was the assistant manager. About 4 of the tables were having to get up and ask for help and ask for things because Lydia/Nikki were both too busy talking to the others back in the corner to help their tables. Alek stepped up and was literally running around the 3 aisles taking care of us all. A couple of us tried to tip him, since it was not our waitress that took care of us, but he said he was not allowed to accept it. At one point a screaming match broke out between some of the customers and the assistant manager and his girlfriend. They were screaming and yelling back and forth across the restaurant about getting dirty looks for us talking amungst ourselves about wanting to tip Alek, and leaving reviews on yelp about our experiences tonight. An older Gentleman in a plaid shirt came out of the kitchen and approached the table with the customers the assistant manager was yelling at was trying to handle the situation, and the assistant manager approached the table also and was waving his hand and pointing at the table. Then Lydia and Nikki went back in the kitchen while the assistant manager and the gentleman in the plaid shirt were speaking to the table that had been yelling back and forth. About that time a plate went flying in the kitchen and Nikki was angrily mumbling and swearing as she cleaned it up. We had lost our appetites at that point and left.There were multiple tables that were ignored All Night Long by our servers. And Lydia only showed herself at our table once or twice and was listed as our server even though she wasn't the one that assisted us the majority of the night, it was Alek. We were there for over 2 hours and we barely saw our \"server\" twice. Later we found out that Alek was actually off the clock but had come back in to help because it got busy and he knew one of the girls wanted to go home and didn't even want to be there and was trying to get off. She kept seating everyone in the other girls area so she could leave. The two girls were at each other and not working to take care of the customers.  This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had eating out. An off duty employee and his girlfriend picking a fight with a customer, and the staff so wrapped up in their own issues with each other that they couldn't take care of the customers who had paid to come to their restaurant and be served. Alek was the only member of the staff that was helpful and seemed to actually care about taking care of the customers. It is just a shame that we could not leave a tip for him. He was amazing during all the chaos. I have had bad experiences at this location before, but was trying to give them another chance. Nope."}
{"text":"No service, sat for 40 minutes got water and tea no refills. Left without seeing server and no food. Family of 6 next to us were seated when we arrived got no food or drink refills when we left. Manager too busy hanging with serving staff to check on customers. Have posted this on our community website and will never return."}
{"text":"I was a little surprised when clicking on this site how low the rating is because my experience was very good. I went in on a Sunday morning (02/11/18) with moderate expectations, and they were more than exceeded. My service was terrific. The spicy poblano omelet might be the best omelet I've ever had. Be warned though, it really has some heat! I think the only reason my rating is not a 5 is the price. However, I will definitely be revisiting to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Ok ... Dining companion had Pancakes and they are fantastic... But the bacon was quite greasy.  So I give one star... 

I was with other folks for dinner and I just wanted a snack. Ordered the mozzarella sticks... Simple enough.  They came out looking fantastic! Golden brown, nice round shape... One bite and three things were clear... 1. The consistency is wrong 2. The flavor is wrong. 3.they were barely warm.

The server never shows up to refill water, the weak coffee, or to check on us.  Only 6 other people in the restaurant! We had to flag her down. She admitted the sticks need to cook longer to melt whatever that scientific mess is they call mozzarella... But if they do - the outsides become very dark and inedible.  Kudos that she owned up and credited it off the bill.  That's the second star.  IHOP ... You know better."}
{"text":"Liebe den IHOP hier. Wenn man Glück hat kann man einen Fensterplatz bekommen und beim Essen auf die Berge im Hintergrund schauen... Dinnerfeeling pur! Essen ist top nehme immer die Pancake Combo. Danach ist man satt bis zum Abend! Am Wochenende ist hier immer die Hölle los deshalb zeitig da sein. 
Wünschte in Germany gäbe die Kette auch! 

Also Gute Wahl für ein Frühstück"}
{"text":"The food was very good and fresh, place just opened recently. The bad... the inside smelled like a mixture of cleaner & a dead body.
Staff very friendly!"}
{"text":"I call to make a to go order when they answer they put us on hold and took them 10 mins to order our order then we got to the restaurant the food wasn't ready so we wait another 20 mins for the food to be given to us then they came out told us the food is almost already took another 15 mins for the food to come out. It doesn't take that long to cook 2 orders."}

{"text":"This place was awful.  1) Empty hostess stand, but big sign says \"please wait to be seated.\"  Long wait even though three tables in whole place occupied.  2) inside temperature was roughly 62 degrees. I raised this twice with waitress, who said she agreed and had told manager, but manager said it was hot. 3) Ordered eggs but no salt on table or on any others; no waitress to ask for this without eggs getting cold in freezing restaurant.  4) Eggs only lukewarm when they arrived.  To top it off, one adult diner let her kids scream their behinds off and throw their toys. My waitress was nice -- this stuff not her fault -- but the s place should be closed."}
{"text":"Really sad that the few times i have come here there are no workers. i think there are only two workers and a full house! Terrible service because you wait forever. Management should look at hiring more staff. Food is decent, typical of what you expect at Ihop. Make sure you have lots of time and patience when you come to this location."}
{"text":"Fairly disappointed on how this locations service standards are taking a turn for the worse. I used to always come to this location and the service used to always be amazing, but for some reason it has just taken a turn for the worse. 
There aren't any new faces serving so I'm wondering why every server is so inattentive.

I get here at around 8:30ish and I have to wait to be seated for about 5 minutes. Sure 5 minutes isn't that long but it's pretty long when you stand right in front of the host stand and no one greets you or tells you it'll be a few moments and will turn their head as if trying to avoid you when eye contact is made. Not okay. 

Once seated my drink did come out right away and it didn't take too long for my server to take my order. My food came out exceptionally fast which made me almost forget what had happened when I had arrived but of course something went wrong. Someone, please, explain to me how you are supposed to eat pancakes smothered in strawberries with no utensils? I asked for hot sauce and syrup and my waitress said if would be one moment. Again about 5 minutes pass and she's walked past me about 3 different times with no hot sauce nor syrup. I actually had to ask a different diner if I could use their condiments and when she walked past and saw this happening apologized still with nothing in her hands! I couldn't believe that had happened. 

Overall the food was the normal ihop quality that I remember but the service will keep me away for some time, or I'll take the drive to go to another location."}
{"text":"I have been to many Ihops since I am a fan of the pancakes, but never experienced such great customer experience.  I wish I would had kept my recpt with the name of the waitress who assisted us.  As expected at an IHOP on Sunday morning the restaurant was full and there were people waiting to be seated.  However, I bleieve it was the manager who noticed just the two of us waiting and was able to seat us ahead of the party of 10 in front of us.  So, we got seated within the first 5 min of being at the restaurant.  We order our food within the next 5 min or so and then we started to wait.  10 minutes later and after already having apologized one time the waitress -very apologetically- offered us a small bowl of fruit to hold us up until our meal reached our table.  Throughout the whole visit she was very attentive to what our table needed and was happy to accomodate.  I would certainly go back to this IHOP if I was ever in AZ again."}
{"text":"Dirty location.  Need to find a newer IHOP in Las Vegas.  The only thing positive about this location. Is the food.  Bathrooms were filthy, floors are filthy.  I can go on and on, but won't."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in for breakfast before an eventful morning. After we sat down it took a waitress 10 minutes before she even noticed we were there. After she took our drink order it took another 10 minutes before she took our food order. After 45 minutes of waiting for our food a manager said that she was sorry and food would be out soon. 5 minutes later we finally got our food. Worst experience ever. Will never return."}
{"text":"Good friendly service. Food was good. I have been in food service 30 yrs. so I can give accurate ratings. Some places are understaffed at least if they are friendly about it and food is good thats what counts."}
{"text":"Came here late at night. Service was awful! Food was burnt ... used to love coming here but I won't be back"}
{"text":"This IHOP just opened. The place is all new, clean and has comfortable modern decor. The food was cold and the service colder. Our orders was wrong, had to repeatedly ask for water refills."}
{"text":"I like this IHOP a lot. The food is great and the service is excellent as well. We're almost always seated right away, even if it's busy. The servers seem to never forget anything, whether it's ketchup or some special request. The food is always great. I particularly like the chicken fried steak and the chorizo burrito.  The coffee is always hot and is fresh. I like their orange juice too. It seems like this restaurant is very well-run and well-managed."}
{"text":"This IHOP is a joke.  Horrible service and horrible management.  Ordered take out with a simple order and after 45 minutes waiting, the order was wrong. Was not shocked.  No sense of concern from staff.  Will NEVER GO TO THIS IHOP AGAIN."}
{"text":"IHOP is a classic breakfast/lunch/dinner location in town.  The chain of chains offers 24 hour meals for cheap prices.  If you stick with the basic items on the menu you really can't go wrong.  Some are fans and some aren't, however, IHOP has always delivered in the few times I've visited."}
{"text":"They took over 2o minutes just to offer us something to drink and bring a menu.  And took more time to cook the food.  That we lost our patience.  Came with a group of 4 people. Just left. Shm  need better service."}
{"text":"Awesome service I was greeted with  friendly smile and seated immediatly very impressed with the new menu selection, my wife and I will continue to visit team Nazim. Great family restaurant. Definitely 5 stars see you next visit. Thank you Eddie Valdez & family."}
{"text":"If you feel like waiting over an hour for your meal , please come here! Some customers get special treatment and server's will make sure their needs are met cause they friends or family while the rest of restaurant suffers. As well as bathroom s are disheveled and soap dispenser is half off wall. One screw will fix it! LAZY management. Avoid  this hott mess of restaurant if at all possible."}
{"text":"My experience here the other day was just annoying the waitress tried her best but I don't think there's enough communication between the the boh and foh. I won't be coming back here again ."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming to IHOP, but decided to come eat at this location, I arrived at 10 and left about 1 am. They are seriously understaffed it took about an hour for them to take our order and another just to get our food and drinks it was very disappointing and the girls aside from maybe a couple have this very bad attitude and just a bad experience all together. The cooks by the way are good at what they do cause the food was good but service sucked."}
{"text":"It's IHOP, it's breakfast food.  I actually like IHOP a lot.  I don't know what it is.  I like the hash browns and the sausage links.  The trick with IHOP is to always order the special.  If you order off the menu you can easily walk away with a $30 breakfast bill.  I don't know about you I don't really care to spend that much on breakfast.  So order the special because it is usually $6 or $7 and you'll get some special pancake or french toast.  
With the food aside, this is why I like this IHOP.  First off this is the closest IHOP to our house so we end up here every once and while.  The thing with this IHOP is it is the tourist IHOP.  So when you walk up you can freak out by seeing how many people are in the restaurant.  Let me tell you what though, this restaurant is top notch with turning tables!  In fact they should teach other restaurants how to do what they do.  You can walk up to this restaurant and see a long line but still be seated and walking out of restaurant in 30 minutes.  In fact sometimes you leave and not realize that you have eaten that fast.  So don't let the line scare you.  Most of time they are really fast.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"You know, I used to have this out of town romance that left a sweetness in my mouth.  The only way I could get a fix was if I left Pittsburgh behind me and headed for warmer climates.  Not so much anymore, you made me happy IHOP with finally opening your doors a few years back here in the region.

As for the most recent visit to your lovely location outside of Greenfield/Squirrel Hill, there were many ups, and a few downs.  

I was going to do the ups first and then do the downs, but they kind of mix together so I'm just gonna go through it all at once.

Congrats on finally being open 24 hours!  Not so big congrats to advertise it.  I didn't notice it on the sign if you were open 24 hours, and the parking lot looks shady when you pull up and see no cars in the lot and you have to do a parking lot circle to make sure.  The lettering you use on the door is quite small too.  Even with my glasses, I was still squinting to see if you were open.  As soon as I saw '24' on the door, the car went into park and I was heading for the door.

As late as it was at night, my friend and I were the only two people besides the workers in the building.  Big plus for us, no wait.  Service was super fast if you couldn't have guessed.

Here's something I learned as well, the menu changes at 10 p.m.  Not a big deal for me as I was getting pancakes, as it is the International House of Pancakes.  As for my friend, she was really hoping to get the garden crepes.  So when the server came our way to take the order she went back to ask the cook if she wouldn't mind making it for her and the answer was something along the lines of 'Sure, I'll make it.'  Big props for making these two customers feel happy about that.  One thing, my sausage did end up looking like bacon...but I ate it anyway.

OK, so this has to be categorized as a down, there's no way to put a happy spin on it.  The bathrooms...what in the world went on in the bathroom?  It looks as if somebody was having a battle royale in the one.  Maybe somebody was fighting a demon much like they do in the show Charmed.  I mean thank god I didn't mistake the Styrofoam cups for having anything else but soap in them.  Also, this place is really showing it's wear.  It hasn't been open that long, but it sure needs a bit of TLC and updating."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience that will make me not want to return here ever again.

We showed up after a concert to decide to grab some food and head on out quickly.  That however was not the case.  We waited ten minutes by the door just to be noticed.  After we were seated it took a few more minutes even to have our drink orders taken.

There were three of us in my group, when we got our drinks we ordered at the same time.  Twenty minutes later and nothing showed up.  It wasn't just us, it was every table around us, no one had food.  Another bad thing, everyone that was seated after us got to order before us.  Another fifteen minutes passed and one of the servers finally came out to give some sort of explanation.  Supposedly there were only two servers and one cook working that night.  Well, tell the cook to stay in the kitchen and get behind that griddle.

When our food started to trickle out of the kitchen, nothing showed up together.  My sister ordered turkey bacon and pancakes, my mom ordered the two egg breakfast with toast and I ordered the pick a pancake combo.  The two egg breakfast and turkey bacon showed up.  Then came my pancakes.  Then the toast.  And finally the pancake stack.  Yes, I did say finally.  I never received the rest of my combo.  By the time the server realized this I had finished my pancakes.  She came over and asked if I still wanted them.  I politely said no, I don't want to wait any longer.  The server took my whole meal off the check and gave the rest of what we ordered twenty percent discount.  Oh, yeah, never got a refill either.

There is no fault to the server here, we didn't hold any of this against her and we left her a generous tip after we finished.  

The management should be ashamed at how they are running this place.  They are definitely going to lose business."}
{"text":"Went to breakfast on a Sunday prior the first Spring Training game of the year.  We had ninety minutes to eat and travel to Tempe.  At the host stand the young girl told me it would be a 15-20 minute wait.  I gave my boyfriend's name and last initial \"Jim O\" and said we'd be outside, as all of the seating inside was taken.  We were the only two people outside.  We passed the time talking.  After 5 minutes the same host I gave our name to came outside and looked  at us.  \"Jen B\"?  she asked, and I said no, Jim O.  She went back inside.  another 15 mins. passed and I wondered if I should have said we were Jen B.  After another 5 minutes passed I went inside to find out where we were.  The manager was at the stand and I asked, how long for Jim O.  He looked, and said we don't have a Jim O on the list.  Awesome.  So we've been outside all this time and Jen B was the name the host recorded for us.  She was standing right next to the manager while he explained this and never owned up to her mistake.  

Manager sat us along the wall, right next to the kitchen.  I thought that would be a good thing as breakfast is usually served quickly.  About 5 more minutes passed before the server came to take our drink order.  Took another five minutes to get our food order placed - omelette for my boyfriend and a ham and egg sandwich , no cheese for me.  After what felt like a long wait (at this point everything should have felt like a long wait but I had managed to keep myself calm as the time keeps ticking away and we haven't even had breakfast yet) the food was finally delivered (boyfriend said it was 12 minutes).  Picked up my sandwich to eat and was surprised to find something missing -  the ham.   Egg on toasted bread - which I could have made at home for a lot less money and a whole lot less aggravation.  When the server stopped by he offered to have it remade but at this point, the option of lingering over breakfast was used up - I had no choice but to eat what I was served.  He went to the kitchen and brought me out some ham slices to add to what I was eating.  He apologized numerous times (believes the kitchen misread his \"No cheese\" for no meat) and I told him it was fine.  I really just wanted out of there.   When we walked to the front to pay, the server told the manager about the mixup with the ham so he credited our drinks which was nice of him.  

The purpose of this review is to ask that a little more training be spent with hosts.  All of this could have gone much different, if that same host who took my name scanned that list looking for the name I gave her.  To go back inside and then seat someone else (who came in after I did) and let that be the end of it is completely unacceptable.  I understand a busy front end (I have worked all aspects of hospitality and worked as a trainer in all FOH positions) but there is zero excuse in this case as a mere five minutes were all that passed from my initial visit to the host stand & her asking if I was \"Jen B.\"  This could have been a 5 star review of how great it was to be quoted 20 mins. and only had to wait 5."}
{"text":"I've been here before but this last time I went sucked. Why you may ask?It was the waiter being rude, ignoring me, & food was cold. Plus he kept looking at me every time he passed by our table. Not checking me out or flirting but ugly looks. He's lucky I didn't have a little walk with him outside the ihop for disrespecting me. Lucky for him I was with my sister."}
{"text":"Friendly people but very slow service and mediocre food. It was definitely below average for an ihop and seeing that ihop is already kind of basic anyway, that's pretty bad. Also, our waitress appeared to be helpful and attentive at first but disappeared after that. All that being said, we probably just should have driven thru at McDonalds."}
{"text":"All I can say is coffee is good and server was very nice. Food came out cold. Sent out new order of eggs as first were slimey, actually raw. Just overall bad."}
{"text":"Pathetic food, slow service! The oil they use is gross, I ordered the New Sliders and they were absolutely pathetic. I left it after the first bite. The fries were horrible too. The omelette tasted like a wet blanket. The service was painfully slow took hours for our order to arrive and when it did, half the order was missing. We got no forks or spoons, so had to wait for another couple of minutes for that and Our food went cold. Worst IHop Experience ever!!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on a Saturday morning, fully expecting it to be busy. Waited 10 minutes to be sat. Waited 10 minutes for drink order to be taken. Waited 15 minutes for drinks. Waited 10 more minutes for food order. Waited 50 minutes for food with no table touch or explanation. I actually watched another table get sat, order, eat, and leave before we even received our food. When we left the cashier asked how our service was and I said I would likely not eat there again, nor recommend it to anyone. I also told him it was about the worst service or food EVER! The teenager just looked at me blankly and ran my card. I asked to speak to a manager. I waited about 10 minutes and spoke with the FOH manager and she in turn introduced me to the General Manager. He apologized, comped my meal, and gave me a card for $20 off the next time in hopes we would come back. That was over 6 mos. ago and we definitely haven't returned. 
If we had been told that something was taking an extra long time, I would've been okay. Our server never said a work. And when we did get our food, it was incorrect and cold. I can't do cold food after a 50 minute wait with no explanation. 
I will not go back here and think less of IHOP as a whole due to the endeavor."}
{"text":"Does not use the waitlist check in says no line. get there and lobby is full. Ask why, manager says very snotty- our franchise does not use that."}
{"text":"So I'm gonna get pretty specific in this review because the other nights meal at this ihop branch was pretty insane and incredibly frustrating! 

My fiancé and I went on a Tuesday night hoping to get some pancakes! 
We arrived and waited a good 10 minutes before being seated in the near-empty restaurant. 
Once we were seated the waiter came and asked, \"is water good?\" He seemed pretty frazzled so we just stuck to water. When we were ready to order he seemed confused by my request to substitute pancakes for waffles on a dish and just said it'd be easier if I ordered a bunch of sides instead of the meal. 
I was skeptical of what it would all add up to but I didn't want to make things more complicated for him so I just waved it off and said sure. My fiancé ordered a chicken fried steak dinner and when he'd ordered the waiter asked if he wanted gravy (which is pictured with the meal) and when my fiancé said yes, the waiter asked \"what kind??\" 
When my fiancé said whatever's normal the waiter just nodded and then left. 
Then we waited for close to 45 minutes before we got our food, watched as 3 different groups were seated, received their food and then ate and left before we received our dinner which came out all sorts of wrong. I was given too many pancakes, my fiancé's gravy wasn't there, I was missing sauces, butter, and my fiancé's dinner was missing the pancakes that were supposed to come with it. 

When we finally got all that was originally ordered we started to eat. My fiancé's food was cold and then as he tasted the \"gravy\" found out it was actually just warm caramel sauce..... 
When we finally got the bill we were overcharged for 3 meals when we'd just ordered 2 and when we brought it up to the waiter he asked us if we wanted the extra meal brought out for us to go...... 
When I told him no we'd just like him to change the check he said we needed to go to the front desk to change the check and pay.
So when we took the check up and waited at an empty front desk for nearly 5 minutes next to a man who was waiting to be seated, he looked like he'd been there for a while waiting... 
Then when someone finally came up to the desk she seated the man waiting. When the woman at the front finally came back I explained what had happened and she took the check and disappeared into the kitchen for almost 10 minutes. When she came back she was rude and dismissive as she closed us out and basically shoved the receipts at us. 

We left the restaurant nearly two and a half hours after we'd been seated."}
{"text":"Food was tasty but portions way smaller than the IHOP in Santa Monica. There, the  pot roast was about double the amount that I was served today. Check out the picture I've posted. I don't believe it's worth the $8.49 they charge for it!"}
{"text":"The rest room smells bad big time! They really should do something about the smell.

Everything was delish as usual!"}
{"text":"Eh. Coffee was gross. Waiter got my order wrong (which he never wrote down). Service wasn't that great and food was crap. Rather go somewhere else. 

On the plus side...Military discount..but not much."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Let me just say that my family has eaten at plenty of IHOP's,  save your time and money... this one is a disappointment.  Ordered biscuits and gravy and the biscuits were not cooked all of the way. My son and husband ordered country fried steak and the steak looked like it may have been cooked the day before... just not good."}
{"text":"We were at IHOP for Easter breakfast because our big plan for going to Matt's Big Breakfast was squashed when we drove by and discovered that they were closed that day. So, a little disappointed, we turned around and hit the IHOP on Central that we had passed 5 minutes before. We already knew the quality of the food would be fine, as all IHOPs are fairly consistent. But what impressed us was the friendliness and happiness of the staff that morning. We walked in and were cheerfully greeted by Anita at the front register. She looked around and seeing all the staff was busy, she bussed a table for us and sat us immediately. We were impressed right there. Then we were served by Kamal, who was super friendly, attentive and in a great mood. But it wasn't just the 2 people we had direct contact with. Must have been the Easter spirit or something, but the whole staff seemed to have smiles on their faces while we were there. We kept noticing and commenting to each other how odd it was to see happy restaurant staff (how sad is that?) I can't remember the last time my boyfriend and I went out for a meal and called the manager over to tell her that we were thrilled with the service. On a $22 check, we left $35. Well worth it."}
{"text":"Had the cheese burger omelette.  All I could taste was ketchup and mustard. I also had the tres le he pancakes nothing special. Next I'll have the omelette ad ask them to hold the ketchup and mustard"}
{"text":"Not all IHOPs are the same. This one was amazing.  We had to wait less than ten minutes, the place was packed. We were worried that we would have wait for service and food. Neither came true. Great service and food was hot when served."}
{"text":"We have dined here quite a bit, as it is close to my apartment.  The seating has always been quick, the service superb, and the food very tasty. We went here for Thanksgiving dinner and couldn't have asked for a more tasty meal. We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"The place is too crowded. Had to wait 30 minutes for my order to come. However, the food was delicious."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Went in and ordered the turkey bacon avocado wrap. My boyfriend ordered bottomless pancakes (we WERE both going to be ordering food to go for the next morning as well). While we are eating our appetizer the waitress came out to tell me it would be a 10 to 15 mins wait on the wrap. In retrospect i realize she was trying to convince me to order something different. (Which i would have happily done, Im in the industry i get it. Had she said so I would have) anyway, i tell her that was fine to just bring my boyfriend's food and I'll be happy to wait. She left the table and then YELLED to the kitchen \"she wants to wait\" loud enough for me to hear her, of which was followed by loud groaning from the kitchen. That of which, made me very uncomfortable about eating the good that would be coming to our table, therefore we left. Someone should probably remind the kitchen and wait staff that they can be hear from the dining room, and to not groan and complain when asked to do their job. This location is officially on my \"do not go list\". Such a shame seeing as I get off work late and frequent often as it is so close to my house. Don't waste your time here, the place was also dirty, as bugs were crawling on the windows right next to me inside the establishments."}
{"text":"Been here 30 minutes and we still don't have water. There is one slow lady by her self in this entire restaurant."}
{"text":"I hate writing a negative review dang it. But, I hope that it spurs a change bcuz I live so close by and my husband loves breakfast. When we first entered the wait area, we found it...well, not exactly sparkling clean. I remember thinking it needed a good once over on doors, windows and floors. As we waited , what seemed a long time and quite annoying as two staff members were trying to figure out a check at the register, and didn't greet us or acknowledge us at all for like 5 or 10 minutes. Finally they figured it out and sat us at our table. I nearly left bcuz of that. We had to move tables bcuz it was extremely cold! And I like cold! But this was painfully cold. Finally our food came and this is the most disappointing breakfast ever. Eggs were way over cooked, and that's okay...I can handle that. The bacon way undercooked, and the fat was what I call \"wiggly\". Okay, so that may be a matter of taste? But the hash browns tasted like very old oil or an old pan with rancid oil. They were not edible, and I so wanted some good hash browns. That was it for me. Pushed my plate away and we left. Never to return. They desperately need a good cleaning and staff needs better training on customer service. They need to use fresh oil or to get new pans or grills. ICK. Sorry...hope this helps make a decision to step it up, clean it up and serve it up a little better. Well...a lot better. I had just spent 3 days moving and didn't want to deal with a new plate of food or complaining at the time. We had an appt also, otherwise I would have spoken to someone."}
{"text":"Oh My Yes!!!!!!!!!! I have been ordering from uber eats and my food is always cold or nasty from all the other restaurants. Thank You Soo Much the food was fresh and amazing. Definitely made my night!"}
{"text":"The most horrific service ever , First, we didn't even see our real waitress until the food came out , someone else took our order , never even gave us a name or came to say hello . Second, they didn't have the right order for me ( pancakes instead of toast not a huge deal to be honest ) . Now for my daughter , we ordered a create your own smiley face and paid extra to make it a cupcake pancake instead of the plain one . They sent out a plain pancake with sprinkles on the whip cream , I had to explain myself 3 times to the waitress why the order was wrong , then she said to me with a horrible attitude \" I mean you know that the cupcake pancakes are just regular pancakes with sprinkles in them right . ** Quick edit ** Changed from a 1 star to a 3 star because of the fast response from the manager who was not in at the time of the incident, but she was called and took action very quickly  , and the other server Lyndsie ( sorry if I spelt it wrong )"}
{"text":"4 stars for IHOP?  Yes.  I always get the SAME thing and yes, I know what to expect!  

If you've never had the harvest grain & nut pancakes, you haven't lived.  I swear,  I CRAVE these things.  I have been to MANY small business pancake places and while I always find something I like, I really just crave these dang harvest grain & nut pancakes.  I like how they have 4 different flavors of syrup.  I don't really love the eggs or omelets.  This review is solely based on this particular flavor of pancakes."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast with my husband and 3 year old son. We were sat promptly at a table. Our waitress was friendly. It took a little longer then expected to place our order but that was really the only negative to our visit. I order the buttermilk pancakes, since I  had a free plate of pancake from my birthday. I planned to share my pancakes with my son and asked the waitress to just bring a second plate, she was thoughtful enough to bring him his own plate with 2 pancakes on it which made him extremely happy.  My husband chose to get the all you can eat pancake special. Pancakes were hot and cooked perfectly. Overall a good meal."}
{"text":"Don't come for the service at breakfast time.

Me and the Hubby went a few weeks ago and I wished that the review would show up on the check in date instead of the write up date but...
We went for breakfast, were promptly seated, then waited, and waited, and then our waitress (I usually call them servers seeing how I was one for many years, but not in this case) finally gets to us and takes our drink order and sighs because I wasn't quite ready to order.
When we did order, my hubby was asking me what he should get out of 2 things and all she heard was him saying something, heard it was a menu choice and decided he was getting that for breakfast.  Meals came out timely, they weren't the greatest things ever, but it was IHOP, and didn't expect them to be; however, they were pretty good, he had gotten some moons over my hammy type thing they have at Denny's and I got the double BLT and was happy that they didn't make my bacon crispy.  Finally got a drink refill and with it came the question if I needed a box...not if I was going to  need one, as I am still eating the last half of my sandwich and fries are gone, but the question wasn't brought up to the person that still had half a sandwich left and was no longer touching it.
The bill came early almost the same time the food was dropped off and I guess that is protocol for them and by the service I guess she felt that since she dropped off the ticket that we no longer required service.  Talked to the guy in charge at the time and he made excuses and so I told him that we wouldn't be returning to any IHOP for a while and never again to this location"}
{"text":"A lot has changed at this location in the past couple of months. We were about to stop coming to this place all together until we decided to give it one last chance last month. We have always been regulars here on the weekend. If you ever go here on the weekend before 3pm go see my man Jorge López and make sure you tip him well he'll make you feel like you're right at home. Management has really stepped it up at this location and hired a bunch of great employees. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"(7/23/16) Stuart is our server this evening. He has a lot more personality than Zaire  did at the Pineville  iHop. I think we've  found  a  new  home.

So I  ordered  a Denver  omelet  burger with  fries  and a lemonade. I'm  hoping  that  it will be good. The atmosphere  here is definitely  better  than  Pineville.

The burger  reminded  me of why engineers  should never be allowed near the finished product. The omelet  and the burger  are great in combination  but not between  the  same  buns. I had to pull the omelet  out of the burger to be able to  enjoy both of them. The fries were nicely  seasoned  and I  found the platter very filling. My wife  was overjoyed  to discover  that  biscuits  with sausage  gravy  is still an offered  item"}
{"text":"(7/16/16) So we're  here for brunch. I'm   having a country omelet with a side  of  grits, unsweetened iced tea to drink. My wife is angry  that they no longer have sausage  gravy and that you have to ask for biscuits  as they are no longer  on  the  menu.

So the current  manager  has metallic  gold hair, whoa am I back in  the  70s? My country omelet was hearty and the grits were fine after a bit of sugar was added. My wife, on the other hand was not happy that her eggs had been cook over hard rather than over medium. She had them re-cooked then had words with the server about the rest of the plate going cold. She took it back to the kitchen to be re-heated. The other issue that my wife had was that she ordered toast and no pancakes and wound up getting served both.

I think that we'll wind up trying another iHop. As other diners have remarked the service has gone downhill at this one. What a shame."}
{"text":"The worst service ever waited over 15 minutes to be seated even know there was no one in front of me and the restaurant was empty waited over 20 minutes to get just coffee and then when I went to pay the cashier spent 20 minutes talking to the gentleman in front of me while I waited right behind him. Do not go here! There are printing of other IHOP and breakfast places in the area
It's an embarrassment at this I have is in the Summerlin area"}
{"text":"Pancakes were not steaming hot. They give one small hard as a rock ball of butter that punctures the skin of the pancake. Hash browns were not served with the pancakes. The wife's French Toast was obviously frozen and not served hot.

A little advice for Ihop management. Have an Ihop management type that likes pancakes order pancakes with one hard minuscule piece of butter on barely lukewarm pancakes and see if he/she enjoys that meal. Then go  over to the Waffle House and learn how butter should be served. For those management people that need the cliff notes version, you serve the butter soft and the pancakes hot so that the butter melts on to the pancakes.

I've heard some scuttlebut over the years that there are health code regulations about serving butter soft. I find that hard to believe since every other restaurant I visit seems to have soft butter.

This will definitely be my last visit to Ihop."}
{"text":"I had the three egg and three pancake meal for lunch today. The food was good and my server was attentive and did a great job. 

The Manager/Cashier asked me how was everything. I told him that I had a thimble of butter that was as hard as a rock. And maybe IHOP should consider softening the butter and also give enough butter to cover your pancakes. He channeled the Corporate Voice of IHOP and proceeded to apoligize about the rock hard butter and it's the health code that requires restaurants to serve rock hard butter, blah, blah, blah. I told him to check out The Waffle House, they know how to serve butter with a meal. This guy just decided to continue to be part of the problem instead of part of the solution by continuing his spiel about the health department. 

So, I'm going to apoligize in advance, I won't be dinning there anymore."}
{"text":"Pros: New burger was tastier than before. Big portion and not over cooked.
Waitress was super nice. She tried to get our items to us as quickly as possible.

Cons:
Breakfast portion was pathetic. The hash browns were tiny, the eggs were questionably small and bacon was undercooked. Pancake portion was much smaller than our regular IHOP too. 
SLOW. It took nearly 45 minutes to get our food. The kitchen was horribly slow and backed up. The waitress was back helping the cook. 

This location was not up to snuff. Go to another if you want decent portions and reasonable wait times."}
{"text":"First off I will say that nothing seems to be fresh here. When I received my food, and I regret not taking a picture of it which is weird cuz I usually do, the fruit was brown and old. Egg white omelet had really soft and mushy tomatoes and the spinach was very wilted. Should I eat it? Yes however, she did take the food away and replaced it with hash browns which was a delight. My server's name was Bane and she was very courteous with great customer service. However the food is left to be desired."}
{"text":"I was more than unimpressed when I came here last night. We were seated quickly, however despite the place being empty, it took 30 min for us to receive our food after we ordered. We sat close enough to the kitchen that we were able to hear the kitchen staff, laughing and shooting the shit, as we sat there just waiting. I still tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and figured maybe they were behind a bit, or something and tried to be patient. The food finally came out and it was good, I cant deny that, however the waitress failed to bring out one of my items. I asked to substitute the meat on my order for English muffins and the waitress said that it could be done when I ordered. When it never came out, I asked for it and every one who worked there seemed to be confused, including the waitress who told me when we ordered that it was okay. We even heard the cook say, \"I thought I made those\".  They finally came out, I finished my food and I went on my way. We paid our bill and didn't really pay attention to at the time, which is our fault, but when reviewing the receipt the following morning they charged us for a side of English muffins. I'm honestly a little confused as to why I was charged for a substitute , that I was told could be done at no extra cost, and then was forgotten...... Long story short food was good, and service was crappy! I don't plan to come here again!"}
{"text":"I come here on a weekly basis. Couldn't imagine my life without pancakes with extra butter =). The service is amazing. Kara and Hanna have been my servers for good few months and they will be for a long time.  =)"}
{"text":"This Ihop has had consistent food quality and consistently good service.  Even when it is busy we have not been disappointed.  The cleanliness is also very good here.  There are Ihops in other parts of the valley that we have visited that had sticky tables and smelled like dirty dish rag.  We have yet to have that experience at this location.

My husband and I have tried two of the new kinds of pancakes, the tiramisu and the banana graham nut.  The tiramisu was too sweet for me but the flavor did remind me of my mother's homemade tiramisu.  The banana graham nut were very tasty.  My husband liked the texture of the graham crackers with the mushy bananas.  I hope this helps!"}
{"text":"This place is busy, but the kids love the pancakes so much food for the price."}
{"text":"We come here during random times we crave breakfast food. Even when it is busy and there are only two servers working the service is never bad. Friendly servers. Good consistent breakfast at this location."}
{"text":"This place is crap very dirty and service sucked and food was like it wasn't even seasoned I gave 1 star cause I couldn't go any lower"}
{"text":"Terrible. Literally the worst dining experience ever. IHOP really isn't the greatest place to begin with but this location was absolutely awful. There was one thing that was correct about my order and that was it. The service was awful and what I got was barely edible. The waitress messed up drinks and/or food for everyone at the table. I would have complained about my food but honestly it would have wasted my time. I would not recommend this place to anyone and I will never be coming back. Not even worth the one star."}
{"text":"Waited 5 minutes to be seated. Finally after sitting down this guy came to help us (jared)  turned out to be pur waiter. This guy is horrible. Got our food wrong. Food took forever. Flys around our table.  Not a good experience."}
{"text":"pretty good food here,  but I guess all i- poops ( our nickname for ihop) are good,  the only complaint has been the loud music,  but when we were seated under a speaker one time they turned it down,  they need to get some other play music like from the company musik I think its called and not play a radio station with commercials and stupid ( bad)  songs!    otherwise I think anyone will enjoy the stop at this I poop!"}
{"text":"I went with my friends at 2 PM, there was only one other table and about 10 servers running around stocking condiments.  The hostess was no where to be seen and the cashier would not seat us.  It took about 10 minutes to be greeted by the hostess who was completely confused as to where to sit us because all of the tables were filthy.  It took about 5 minutes to be told that our server would be with us in a few minutes and then another 5 minutes before someone stopped by and asked if anyone was helping us.  We gave this nice lady our order and proceeded to listen to the other servers discuss why they were fighting with each other.  The manager was wondering around and completely ignoring this inappropriate behavior of his staff.  When we finally got our food the quality was nice but we had already been there for a good 30 minutes.  After the food was delivered we never saw our server again and the other servers would not acknowledge us.  We didn't get a single drink refill nor the check so we could leave.  We bussed our own table to try and get someone to acknowledge that we were finished and even tried to waive down the manager who was chatting with all of the servers about 10 feet away from our table but we were ignored.  Finally we just went to the cashier and they had to build the check so we could leave.  If you want cheap breakfast food in Charlotte go to one of the other 20 IHOP's before you go here.  You can get bland poorly prepared food at any of them and their servers actually want your business."}
{"text":"Had such a great experience today. Food was hot and fresh. My kids ate everything up. So satisfied!"}
{"text":"I placed an online to go order. They didn't give me the pancakes I paid for & I ordered strawberry banana pancakes and they just gave me banana pancakes with no strawberry syrup or anything. Didn't even realize until I got home. All the rest of the food was awesome, but disappointed it wasn't handed out correctly."}
{"text":"Bad service just come today, I make my order they give a coffee first but no spoon how can I mix the sugar and cream? Then they bring my food and strawberry banana French toast, without strawberry and banana how they do that and then I tell them I order strawberry banana French toast so they take back and they bring me back but looks like they are really worry about they food cost and also they didn't provide silverware I just wait when see the guy pass around me and request the silverware. Not recommended and for sure I'll never come back. They need to working to get better service to they customer"}
{"text":"So what's not to love about IHOP? Cheap American comfort foods served in a no nonsense unpretentious atmosphere by a friendly and attentive staff. How can one go wrong? Sure, the coffee's a bit weak and the eggs are sometimes overcooked, but c'mon. This is IHOP. You pull up to the bright blue-roofed building with those four letters beaming down upon upon you like some sort of otherworldly deity and you know one thing's for sure - you won't leave hungry.

9 times outta 10 when we go to IHOP it's for breakfast food, even if it's not really breakfast. My wife dreams about their fluffy pancakes (should I be jealous?) and there's just something about the stuffed French toast that makes my pancreas squirm with anticipation, that crispy toast forcefully injected with sickeningly sweet cream cheese filling and drenched in movie set fake blood syrup. You know what I'm talkin' about. My blood sugar just spiked as I was typing that...

Every now and then, I love to feel all high-brow. That's when I head over to some hipster eatery in Tremont or Cleveland Heights to plop down $15 for eggs Benedict and a mimosa. But when I just want to challenge my body with good ole American fatty eats that won't leave me hanging, I go to IHOP. Oh yeah, and the drool is free."}
{"text":"Our waitress was ok. It took what seemed forever for our food to come out. We ordered the roastbeef philly, and the meat was tough,dry, and tasted like pepper, NOT good. It would have been a LOT better with a side of au jus. We then ordered a sunday (due to the picture in the menu) and when it came out, it was NOTHING like that shown on the menu!  What came out was one scoop of ice cream in a little tiny pudding cup.  Needless to say we were NOT going to pay over $4.50 for this!!( I believe the price was $4.99?!)  We spoke to the manager who in turn advised us they did NOT have the same sunday dish shown on the menu.  To charge over $4.50 for this small pudding cup of ice cream is crazy!  All of us at the table felt the same way.  The manager went on to say they would charge us  $1.99, but when our tab came, we were charged $2.49.We were there almost 2hrs just to eat lunch.  Its no wonder this IHOP  is never busy.  The management is horrible as is the food.  We WONT be going back!"}
{"text":"Me and two of my coworkers came here at 1:30 am to eat but as soon as we got there the place looked so outdated and there's only three employees working. The server greeted us and told us that if we are willing to wait an hour to be seated before the food is ready. She even told us that she have to do dishes because they're out of dishes. Liked wtf !! How can you run out of dishes if there's only 6 people on the table eating ? We moved right away to the Denny's to eat and this place is better than IHOP"}
{"text":"For years we have been going to different IHOPS.  Sadly, this is one of our least favorites.  Not only was it so cold inside, but the air-conditioning actually made our food cold too!  I had the stuffed french toast, which has always been my absolute favorite.  Unfortunately, this time, (while I was sitting there freezing) it tasted like it was stale and over cooked.  It was actually terrible!!!  My partners breakfast was \"uneventful\", but cold too!  I dont know why IHOP feels the need to freeze their customers out!  I realize we live in Arizona, but having to take a jacket inside to keep warm!?  There is no excuse for this!   Our waitress was nice, but not too terribly attentive.  I would have returned my meal for something that was fresh, but she never came back by to see how everything was.  We didnt understand this, since it was the middle of the week, and not even half full with customers.  Management needs to take a good hard look at why their IHOP is not only freezing inside,but their food is cold and stale. I even had to sit on a lumpy seat that was full of torn up duct tape. NOT impressive!! Being one of the larger Chains, one would think these types of problems shouldnt happen. Just reading the other reviews, I can see we werent the only ones that had problems.  What a shame!  We wont be returning to this location."}
{"text":"5 tables seated and were asked to wait!
Table was never washed! 
Cafe mocha tastes like warm water. Cup has run all over. What a mess. 
We'll see about the food. 
 Bacon, eggs and hash browns all cooked to perfection. 
Coffee grounds in the bottom of my cup."}
{"text":"Bad service we waited for 15 mins to be seated even tho they wernt busy and there were multiple employees around doing nothing so we ended up leaving"}
{"text":"I will never eat here again!! We waited 20 minutes for our table and then we were finally seated across from a table with 2 small dogs at it. They were sitting next to their owners being fed just like it was nothing. We got up and asked a waitress since when are dogs allowed in the restaurant and she replied with she thinks they are service dogs. I have never seen 2 chihuahua sized dogs be service animals and the fact that the credentials weren't verified was disturbing.  We were so disgusted we left immediately!"}
{"text":"To quote the rating scale \"Meh.\"  How hard is it to cook eggs and pancakes?  This place always seems to be pretty busy, but never seems to be all that great.  

I've been there a few times, and never noticed that it was dirty or had really bad service (as noted in the previous review.)  With that said, my breakfast was nothing like the tempting photos on the menu, and was heavier on grease and salt than anything else.    I ordered the strawberry banana pancakes - and got 3 thick, sorta dry cakes with some mushy bananas baked inside.  They were topped with a couple of banana slices and some strawberry syrup, including 3 (yes, exactly 3) strawberries and a huge pile of whipped cream.   And - you know how they're famous for having multiple types of syrup and keep those syrup caddies right on the table?  Well, we had 4 syrups on our table, but unfortunately 3 of the 4 were original.  At least the 4th was strawberry.  My husband's sampler breakfast was equally mediocre, with eggs drenched in oil and embarrasing bacon.  

The one thing IHOP really has going for them is their sourdough bread, it's actually pretty decent.  I do think it's funny though that a breakfast place like this feels the need to ration jelly - each toast order comes with 2 little tubs."}

{"text":"Worst service ever. I went in with my family at 8:20 am our server took our order which she got wrong. We ordered my daughters eggs over easy came put scrambled. But after she took our order we didn't see her again with the exception of her walking around the back passing the doorway with a little like salad dressing to go container drinking soda or something. When she finally brought us our check is the last time we saw her even though we asked her for refills on our drinks. I serve at a casino here in town. I understand if you are busy or other situation is going on but they were not busy she had 3 tables including ours. Didn't see her  at those other tables either. Because I am in the same industry of work it takes a lot for me not to even want to leave a dollar well she accomplished that. Service was so terrible I will not be back be warned if you go to this location because you will not be helped at all just get your order taken and ignored until they want you to pay"}
{"text":"Came here on Christmas Eve to eat brunch with my family. We were seated after a short wait. The server and waiter were both friendly. I was surprised on how the waiter memorizes everyone's orders and knowing who's food it belongs to. The food arrived quick, and the environment was really small and a little crowded. The waiter came and checked if everything was okay and made sure that everything went well. 

Overall four stars, because my strawberry Creme crepe was flooded with strawberry syrup. Other than that, everything was good."}
{"text":"This place deserves 0 stars. I'm incredibly surprised that based off the reviews nothing has been done about this establishment. I came in with my friend and stood at the front counter waiting to be seated for 10 minutes. I could understand this kind of wait if they were busy, but it was silent and all we could hear standing there was the obnoxious chiming bell in the back notifying the employees that customers came in side. Even after hearing the bell repeatedly no one came to seat us. Finally a employee comes strolling out of the bathroom and her response is \"oh, no one seated you\"? Finally she walks us to our seat and hands us menus telling us our waiter will be with us soon. So we sat for a few more minutes  and heard a few employees talking about customers behind us. Our waiter finally appears walks by our table shrugs and says \"ehh I'll get them in minute\". We instantly decided to leave because it was apparent this restaurant didn't want our money. As we got in the car I looked in side to see 3 employees at the front counter all smiling and talking about the fact that we left. 

Drove a few miles down to the IHOP on power where we were seated right away and had great customer service. Our waiter here was actually professional. Even watched him help an elderly woman out side."}
{"text":"We were told the wait would be 20 minutes and ended up being an hour. I think they under estimate wait times that's for sure. When we were finally seated it was in two separate booths which made it impossible to talk to each other.

Slow to get our drinks but once we finally ordered our food came out quick. 


Bathrooms were dirty and outdated."}
{"text":"IHOP 1105 N Higley rd mesa, Az 

Is the most disrespectful service ever!!!! They put (us) the black family in the back of the restaurant. My family and I had a waiter name Connor. Rude attitude. He was so in a rush to take other people's order but rushed passed us. He served 5 people that just started showing up and has their food ready like THAT. We asked for a manager and He snapped at me and my family about how our order is now getting prepared. When he brought our food and it was cold and we still had some food missing. We demanded for the manager and once again got an attitude with me and ignore the fact we asked for the manager. We finally got the manager and thankful she let us have our despicable meal for free. Luckily, Mindy took care of us. She was amazing."}
{"text":"It's IHOP - and in a nice location - but the service time is awful. Went on a Sunday around 10am, no line, seated on the patio. It was 10:18 before we even had a waitress get our order for drinks/food. Over a half an hour for our food from the time we ordered. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good service, not too busy Saturday morning. 
Pretty new; not sure how long it's been open. 
Standard IHOP fare.
Parking out front is limited, but lot stretches on both sides."}
{"text":"I normally have breakfast when I go to IHOP, but decided to try something new.  Instead of ordering the breakfast sampler I ordered the combo.  I had a cesar salad and the pot roast sandwich.  The salad was severely over dressed.  The sandwich on the other hand was delicious.  I wish I had skipped the salad and just ordered the full sized sandwich.  My son kept taking bites out of it. I have never hated sharing so much. :)  

Service was just a little slow.  We had to waive another server down to get refills and to get out check.  Our server was very nice, just hard to find."}
{"text":"I always go to this IHOP and usually have an amazing experience.  Well today Monday June 4th at 11:30AM, I came in expecting the normal experience I always get. Food is always on point and customer service is usually 4 out of 5 star. Mind you I am Japanese and black, I take a seat and wait to be seated. Im the only one waiting at this point. An elderly white gentleman walks out the restroom and basically cuts infront of me. He is greated then seated. No big deal, clearly he was there before me and just needed the restroom. As I'm still sitting there waiting, 2 elderly white women walk in. No regard for me and cut me as well. I stand up and before I could say anything, they are greated and seated. I even said excuse me and got ignored. The manager was the one seating everyone (I assumed he was the manager as he was wearing a blue button up oxford)  what upset me is that when he sat the gentleman before me, we made eye contact. He knew I was next and was the only one waiting at that point. He still sat the 2 women ahead of me when he returned. I NEVER pull the race card but was this all just coinsidence?  That being said, I'm done with this IHOP. That wasn't cool at all. Food has never been bad here but the customer service was terrible today. Again this was the first time something like this has ever happened to me here."}

Finally writing this review because my server, Asher was amazing. He was was genuine, friendly and had an awesome sense of humor!

Thanks for another great start to my morning IHOP!"}

Excellent service.
Great food.
Hot coffee.
Great pancakes.
I love the fact that they have 55+ on the menu.
The portions are not so big....just enough!
I'll remember this 55+ option the next time I take my mother
to breakfast or lunch.
Great location too, right across the highway to the theater. 
I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Sunday February 25, 2018, my family and I visited this IHOP location at 4:45pm on a slow Sunday afternoon to satisfy a pancake and Crepes craving.  By 5:25pm, our food had still NOT arrived. It was only TWO families seated to eat, 3 dirty uncleaned tables and still no food. What a crying shame that it takes over 30-45 minutes I'm waiting on food in a Chain Restaraunt- with NO other clients to justify the slow as molasses service!"}
{"text":"IHOP's should not be allowed to close!

Ok maybe they were waiting a while to build a customer case but they've been around quite long enough to staff 24/7.

I am so severely disappointed. My friends and I showed up around 2.30am on Saturday night, not even thinking that an IHOP could be closed but it was closed!

And now reading the Yelp page, I see they close at midnight. Big FAIL IHOP, big FAIL. For goodness sake, I had to go to Eat 'n Park instead! Oi vey."}

{"text":"Our first full weekends with our foster daughters. The youngest wanted pancakes! Well I really don't like IHOP or Denny's, but we went ahead and tried IHOP?
SERVICE:
 It was crazy busy, but we were seated within 15 minutes. Besides the girls getting impatient it went by fast. We did have a little issue with our server, don't know if she was over whelmed? But we had to ask for refills our our drinks twice, and to get our bill.
FOOD:
I just wanted pancakes, my wife had Belgium waffles, daughter #1 had pancakes, and bacon, daughter #2 had chicken strips? It was an enjoyable morning, my pancakes were just fine! You would really have to try to ruin pancakes! The girls seemed to enjoy it, especially #2! she also ate some of my pancakes, wife's hash browns, and daughter #1 bacon. Would we come back? If we didn't have the girls! The answer would be no, but since we have them! Most likely we will."}

Sinks in the women's restroom don't work, syrup bottles are sticky and covered in finger prints, served molded lemons in our waters. This was our third time giving this place a chance and never again. I assume because there isn't much competition around they are able to get away with this sort of thing so be aware!"}
{"text":"As a restaurant owner never had An experienced such horrible service and cold food!!! Bruha manager said I had to pay for a meal that was cold and not correct!  I did eat because I was starving but left 1/3 of to show them!  Never will I go to an ihop again!  No stars for this place rude untrained and very disrespectful!  No wonder this place has a 2 star rating!!!!"}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but this IHOP was great and after the GM was promoted to Regional Manager, things started going downhill.  The food is okay, but the wait is a lot longer than it used to be, the staff are not as attentive, and there are less of them, which probably explains the longer wait times.  I miss Mario!  Bring him back!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I decided I wanted to try some IHOP today and I haven't ate it in a while wich I don't know why? 

However, now I remember why. This ihop was so dirty they never cleaned the table old food from passed customers next to me , I just wanted to see how long until they clean it . 

Well, 30minutes passed still not cleaned and also my service was very poor. My waitress never came by to offer me a refill even seeing me drink my last bit . 

After watching her stand around letting the food get cold for 15minutes after my food arrived it was cold and wasn't any flavor at all. 

Also, I've seen one if the waitress poor something into a glass from a container under the sink, not sure what it was also served it to a customer. 

Really grossed me out ... will NOT return. 

The food my look good by the photo by trust you me , it wasn't at all very poorly made ."}
{"text":"I appreciate how ihop has added value to their meals by offering different taste combos with quality ingredients, but  what truly separates 1 ihop from another is service, so that's where this one fumbles the ball. It was busy for a holiday wknd but it wasnt the 4th and it didn't justify having to wait over 50 minutes. The excuse that we received was that people kept on coming in. ???( there were only 5 of us). I'm not in the service industry but it wouldn't make $ense for a restaurant to continue ro seat people if theyre not able to fulfill the orders that they had to begin with, so go elsewhere unless you have your tablet handy and you're trying to watch movie!!"}
{"text":"I wish the manager was better about planning for a busy day like mother's day. We didn't anticipate a two hour wait, and that's with our order being placed 52 minutes ago. My son has diabetes and I now have to ask my husband to go get food for my son to eat before his blood sugar drops anymore. The manager told people to stop seating people even though there's a long line and tables of empty seats. There's a guy that's been bussing the same table outside for 20 minutes to avoid helping everyone.. My dad had to scream about a table that sat after us with as many people as us getting served before us because I'm guessing omelets take longer so let's ignore our order before the easier ones. The waitress was super sweet, I will be tipping her well. The manager should get some training."}
{"text":"Yes, agreed, it is a chain restaurant.  However, it is convenient and the food is not bad.  I must say the servers must be challenged by the crowd that flocks in, especially during the weekend.  I have never seen a server just hanging around, they are always moving.  Ok, occasionally they may make a mistake, so what?  Who hasn't?  I love the patio, eating outdoors has a special feel to me.  I have been a goer of IHOP for many years.  I hope it i s around for a long time to come."}
{"text":"I haven been at this location in a while, and as soon as you walk in, you notice that they've changed the place quite a bit. They definitely did a little bit of remodeling and I like it. 

My friend and I were seated promptly, drinks were brought out right away and orders were taken right after. My friend and I ordered quite a few things and everything took longer than I expected. The sample platter wasn't too bad, the onion rings were good but the mozzarella stick were a little too burnt for me. I also ordered the country fried steak and eggs and I liked them; the gravy on top wasn't too salty unlike some places I've tried.

Our server was friendly enough, but definitely not as attentive as I felt she should've been given that the place wasn't busy when we were there. My friend had to ask her for water twice on separate occasions because we didn't get any refills. I don't remember her checking on us either once we got the food. Overall not a bad place, wasn't expecting much in the first place anyways. Will only go back if we're craving breakfast food for late dinner."}
{"text":"Been here many times but tonight was a huge disappointment. They weren't busy so you would think that we wouldn't have to wait over 30 minutes for the food to arrive. They brought the wrong food for me and then corrected my order. By the time I got my food,  55 minutes after we sat down,  my husband was just about finished with his food and I could barely eat because I had filled up on my drink. Not a happy camper today. The waitress didn't even bother with a drink refill until we asked twice!"}
{"text":"My first experience at this place was... Not  the best to say the least. The chicken was over fried, the corn tasted funky, and the service was SOOO slow! There was maybe 3 other tables and even they were waiting for what seemed like forever. I had to shout out and flag down the manager on duty (who seemed like he was dodging us). So when I decided to take my family to breakfast this morning, I was a little hesitant to bring them here. But I'm glad I did!
We got there just before THE breakfast rush and were seated by a young gentleman who was also our server. 
My mom doesn't get out much and was finally able to eat \"real\" food after her tooth surgery so she took her time going over the menu. The server was very patient and accommodating. He brought my son another kids menu for extra coloring fun.
When the big breakfast rush finally hit, another young gentleman server stepped in to help us with our order and what not when the first sever was busy. 

Those guys were just so nice and so friendly. We felt they needed to know how much they rocked and each write a thank you on the receipt for them. They really made our little breakfast outing as smooth as possible."}

Applebees is the only thing keeping them afloat!"}
{"text":"Six am on a Sunday morning and I had just finished some 5am shopping at the Riverview shopping center. The place was already half full of  hungry customers. This IHOP replaced the one on Main and Dobson a couple of years ago, so I expected the look and feel of a new restaurant. Oddly enough, the carpet is already threadbare in high traffic areas. The walls and booths and table are still in good condition and are typical IHOP, Dennys, Cocos style furnishings. 
The place looks clean and parking is close to the door. One cleanliness issue did emerge--the knife had food still on it from a previous customer. Fortunately, the hostess has left the second set of eating utensils on the table, so I just swapped the icky ones for other set.

So, how is the food?
Coffee--piping hot with thermal carafe back up left on your table. I hate bitter coffee (yep Starbucks, I am looking at you). This coffee tasted fresh, not bitter, but did have a slight acid taste.
Belgian waffle--cooked through, but so cold the the clump of butter on top did not melt at all.
Sunny side up eggs--cooked to the correct consistency but cold. Cold eggs, really???
Bacon--I asked for extra-crispy bacon. Two-thirds of the bacon was indeed crispy, but about 1/3 of each bacon strip was pretty chewy.

Service--Excellent and saved this from being a 2 star experience. The server checked back several times to see if I needed anything and anticipated items I might need for my meal, such as condiments and cream for my coffee. She came with the bill just as I was finishing my meal and even offered more coffee than what was in the thermal carafe.

I think that next time I get the urge for breakfast at Riverview, I will skip the IHOP and just go to the Cracker Barrel across the parking lot."}
{"text":"Thursday, 9:30am, April. 

Good experience here, everything came out in proper time and glad they had harvest grain pancakes. Seemed clean and active. 

Negatives are that it's small and under staffed."}
{"text":"Food was good except the pancakes oddly. The hostess in the server will extremely efficient. And they were crazy busy. On top of which even when the register went down they were consistently very customer service oriented offering us free drinks or water for waiting. Very pleasant attitude amongst everyone working there."}
{"text":"Arrived late morning on a Sunday. Quoted 20 min wait time for a table of 3. Hostesses were quick on seating us and we only waited about 10 mins. Obviously the noise level on a late Sunday morning is high. This happens to be one of the nicer ihops I've been in, clean, organized and have yet to touch anything sticky. The bathrooms were surprisingly clean with the amount of people. Food runners kept visiting our table with others food, runners need to learn table numbers!!! Now we've been sitting here for about 30 mins, our drinks are empty, no setups (fork, knife, spoon and napkin is a setup) so my friend could stir her coffee.... still no food. Finally, food arrives, about 35 mins and we have no set ups still. Sitting here staring at our meal. Food is luke warm at best. Still tasty since by now we are STARVING. Server was nice but scarce. Would rather skip the crazy Sunday's here and hit the diner instead...."}
{"text":"Well, we got there and we were greeted immediately, which is awesome! Our waiter was amazing, which happens a lot. They have a lot of good waiters there and we would never knock them. However, we went there today and there was a deaf couple sitting across from us. Well, we noticed that their waitress just flat out stopped coming to their table, which bugged is a little, and we couldn't figure out why. Then, as they got up to go pay, the store manager came around and asked them if they wanted to pay. They didn't know what she was saying, so she repeated it three or four times. They finally realized what she wanted, so they gave her the money. She came back with change and kept trying to talk to them. She never picked up on them being deaf, it never crossed her mind. Well, they left and we continued to eat. The manager then sat down with a couple and started IMMEDIATELY talking shit about the couple. She said \"you pay at the table, we haven't had a cashier for a year and a half. No matter how many times you tell people at the table, they still try and get up and pay at the front.\" She kept talking about them a it was really irritating... I mean, I work in the customer service industry, and it doesn't take long to realize someone is deaf. She just kept trying to talk to them and never thinking about reasons why they were confused and not responding. Either way, when she started talking shit about them we were done. So, in reality, there is nothing wrong with the restaurant or the service, the manager is just kind of an asshole."}
{"text":"We went on Saturday at 10 with reservations for 14. 15 of us Showed up, were seated on time, and had one of the. Best casual dining experiences! Not only was our food amazing, but we had a fantastic waitress.

Cheryl treated each of the 5 children like they were angels and put their order in immediately. (If you've ever dined in a group with children, you will understand the immense value this provided us.)

She then memorized each of our orders and got them all perfect. At the end we realized we forgot to ask her for separate checks...\"no problem!\" she said and promptly split the check into 5 different portions.

IHOP, to me, it just a typical breakfast restaurant. Cheryl, however, blew all of us away. Kudos to her!"}
{"text":"Your average IHOP, they need to train the staff to be more friendly and helpful. The food is almost the same but I didn't  really like the customer service we received so I'll just go to other ihops."}
{"text":"Very poor service, I was seated for 20 min before they took my order or even offered me a beverage. I would have left but did not want to deal with a disappointed 3 year old. I will not return to this location and will not leave a tip of any amount. I have been here before, with good service, not sure what happened."}
{"text":"Part of my complaint is not IHOP's fault, but part it.  I asked for bacon crispy and it came out half raw.  They forgot to bring my toast and forgot to bring utensils to eat with.  I went to the bathroom and it had to wait behind 4 employees all in line for the toilets.  

After my food was brought to me I had to track down someone and tell them I was missing my toast and untensils to eat with.  I had to wait while my eggs were getting cold to get them. 

As always in IHOP I was seated next to tables that each had 3 screaming babies. 

What a miserable place to eat."}
{"text":"Why is it most women, on Sundays anyway, have this expectation you're going to take them to breakfast as some kind of post-coital reward?
First it was snuggling.
Then snuggling followed by chit-chatting.
Now, they've added one more thing to the list...breakfast.

You need to reverse this trend, and quickly, before she starts demanding you spend the day with her, probably at Costco or Home Depot.
Here's my recommendation.

If there's no Waffle House in the vicinity, the next best thing is IHOP, particularly this IHOP.
Between the slow service, indifferent servers, botched orders, and flavorless creations, you'll marvel at how IHOP has remained in business for this long. 
Here's the best part.
The next time she says, \"take me to breakfast,\" merely invoke the term IHOP and you're out of the woods.
I can't help you with the snuggling or chit-chatting, unless you're the type of guy who can muster up a brain-damaging fart at will, which should stop her in her tracks.  
Now you're really home free. 
Literally."}
{"text":"Are you uncomely?
A frightful excuse for a human? I am. And that's precisely why I come here to eat.

Much akin to how the human body is unable to discern hunger from sleep deprivation, so goes it with the waitresses at IHOP, routinely confusing my beastly cast with old age.

\"Will you be ordering off of our Club 55 menu today?\" her inflection almost shrapnel-like and every bit as piercing.

\"Why yes...yes I will be, thank you very much.\"
                 
I can get a three-egg omelette with two fillings and two pancakes for $5.79. A glass of water and a twenty percent tip and I'm out the door for under seven bucks, and all without a visit from the manager. Cool, eh?

Anyways, if you're a hi-miler like me, or, you're just plain homely, give IHOP a try.
It also helps if you're devoid of any normal levels of shame and guilt.
Black stretch socks, flip-flops, an oversized Ed Hardy shirt and New Balance Cross Trainer's also play a vital role.

Cross Trainer's...yeah, right."}
{"text":"This IHOP has so much potential. There is som much room in here, so you don't feel like you are packed like sardines. That is unfortunately where the positives end. 

This is probably the dirtiest restaurant I've ever been to.  We have been sitting here for over an hour and the floor and tables near us are still filthy. 

The restrooms were even worse. Really makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like. 

Service was just as bad. We ordered right when our waitress came by. Once she brought our waters out to us, she never came by again until our food came out. It took over half an our for our food to come out, and even then one of our entrees was missing.


I definitely would not recommend this IHOP!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the new hamburger. Have to say it was not bad. Would say it compares with other family type restaurants. 

With all the advertising  about I hob it would make sense to me to spend some time training the staff about the new offerings. Our waitress new about the $6.99 price only because she saw it on tv. All the menus and our bill shows $8.49 but we were told there is a discount at the register. 

There was only one waitress/hostess working during our visit. Got here at 6:15 pm. Would think they are wasting the advertising money if the don't staff. She did a good job for one person and had a great personality."}
{"text":"All IHOP restaurants are good food and pretty good coffee. This one is located in an outlet mall parking lot and near a time-share resort. The prices are higher than any other IHOP I have ever been in. $13 is about average for breakfasts here. I believe other IHOP locations are about $8 for the same dishes.  Way overpriced for nothing extra."}
{"text":"Not bad a little better cleaning in the booths would be nice but over all good. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Right off the bat I get hot tea spilt on my leg and shoe. No big deal mistakes happen. Didn't offer towels or more napkins to clean up. Still not a big deal to me. Had to ask for straws, kicked my foot again coming up to the table no big deal. Coffee brought out was warm and filled two cups then was out. Then brings out the wrong meals for my brother and friend because he wrote down the wrong thing. After he realized he wrote it down wrong he slams the kitchen door open screaming the f word. Must not have been the first time because the cook actually came out and asked what they ordered in front of the server. To be fair he did offer the food they got wrong so that's plus one point. Then come time for the check we ask to split and he somehow messes that up while swiping all of our cards multiple times. And you would think a discount would have been added for all the mishaps but instead he charges me for a more expensive meal then I ordered. If you get Adrian as your server I suggest you just walk out."}
{"text":"I expected a long wait on a Sunday morning, so that was not a surprise. The server was friendly, but there's plenty of room for improvement in other areas.

1.) Feel free to take menus away once an order is placed.  They just take up space on the small area of table real estate. 2.) Be sure trays are filled with alternative sweeteners.  Not all people want sugar.  3.) Be sure creamers are provided in a variety of flavors at all, not just some, tables.  While others around me had their pick, I was restricted to only French Vanilla.  4.) Join the ranks of other Phoenix area IHOP restaurants and offer Boysenberry syrup.  When patrons visit with this as their primary reason, it's disappointing to not have it available.  5.) Basics like silverware availability should be obvious.  I had to wait to stir my coffee.  I had to wait again to cut my food.  Patrons shouldn't have to ask for it and servers shouldn't need to make three trips to a table for this purpose, alone.  What a waste of labor hours.  6.). Don't bring the check until you know the patron is done ordering.

There's nothing here that can't be easily fixed, as long as someone at this location is determined to do so.  The question is ... will they?"}
{"text":"Service is at an ALL TIME low for this place!!
There is never anyone at the front to seat people and when you do manage to get seated, trying to put in a drink and food order is like pulling teeth. 
After letting our initial waiter know we were in a hurry and would like to get our food order in, we placed our order with our 2nd waiter (first one was MUCH too busy to be bothered with us because there was a whole two other tables in the ENTIRE restaurant). We managed to get our food after only waiting an hour. They sure were quick to drop of the check though once our food came out.
The did re-do their menu a bit which is the only plus."}
{"text":"Unbelievable poor service!    Came here with my grandchildren who are 2 1/2 and 1.   It's Friday they have plenty of open seats so they aren't slammed. We have been sitting For 25 minutes waiting for our food.  Ever sit with a 2 year old waiting and waiting and waiting ?     Still waiting no one stops by to explain or say anything the food finally arrived 40 minutes after we ordered 

When the food arrived it was stone cold and at this time the waitress explained they were slammed due to a big party.   Hmm. That big party that is paying now they appear to have been served and are done!!

I have to say the manager called us as a result of the survey I competed on the receipt and she was wonderful and offered to make it right for us  based on my interaction with her I raised the stars from 1 to 3.  We didn't go back but I felt her offer was sincere"}
{"text":"The most slow service you can ask for! Been waiting for our order for almost an our! They only have 1 cook, i look around they only have 3 customers."}
{"text":"So far. .. horrible. 
Waited about 20 min just to get seated. Ordered our drinks and the girl didn't bring out what we wanted we had to get the managers attention just to get a water. Our waitress was frustrated  just fixing our order for entrées . I won't be back to this location"}
{"text":"I have to agree this Ihop is very well managed. Even though there were a lot of people waiting, the hostess, took names and everyone was seated within 5 minutes of arriving. This is not the most modern restaurant in the chain I've been to, (it could use a remodel) but these employees work so hard and they had excellent customer service skills! These days that is hard to find, but I'd have to guess with all the competition in Vegas, they have had to be this good to stay open. Our waiter, Scott, was courteous and fast. His questions about our order were clear and to the point, like a quiz show, lol. He got our order in and on our table lickety split. Very impressive! I have to add it's not a great place for large parties, only because the setup of the seating is very crampy and is not spacious for groups.

We ordered the breakfast specials that come with the special pancakes. The eggs were made to perfection and the sausage tasted so fresh; even the hash browns were cooked crispy, the way we like them! Even the coffee tasted good and I'm not usually a coffee drinker, but I liked it (had good flavor-better than the hotel we stayed at) and I only added cream.

I guess they have frequent (food supply) turnover going thru there. No doubt it's one busy place. Just wished my own local Ihop was as good. We have a newer Ihop restaurant where we live in San Diego, but the service and the food isn't near as awesome as this Vegas location. It's obvious the Vegas location has a cook that puts \"love\" in the food!"}
{"text":"Friendly, fast and fun.  Red Velvet pancakes with bacon, hash browns, eggs over easy and biscuits and gravy.  I'm totally satisfied.  Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Awww! I wanted my plate to look like what I saw in the commercial! lol but I'm still gonna eat this! Lol but I guess ihop is ihop so I can't complain thank u smooches!"}
{"text":"Why oh why can't I get any consistency at restaurants! 
One day it's excellent the next not so much!!! Why!!!

So I go back to this IHOP because today is 60 cent stack of pancake day (http://ihopllc.fbmta.com/members/ViewMailing.aspx?MailingID=30064797049)

I walk in and am immediately seated by a young lady who seemed like she was just there to do her job and would be so happy if it were the end of her shift. This was all subtle. 

We are seated, and in less than what felt like maybe 2 minutes, little Ms. Jazmin came to get our drink order. As usual, I got water and my daughter decided to try their new Watermelon fizzy drink which she liked, btw. 

When she brings our drinks back we order 2 stacks each of the promotional pancakes. 

Meanwhile, a Hispanic couple comes in and is seated at the opposite end of the room from us. About 20 minutes later a couple of middle-aged women come in and our seated in the booth next to us. 

My daughter comments that the Hispanic couple just received their order. Giving the situation the benefit of the doubt, I explain that maybe they put in their order before us. 

Then a few minutes later, the two middle-aged women received their food. I jumped out of that seat and with aggravation and disdain, asked them where in the hell are me and my daughter's pancakes. I told them that we have been waiting 30 minutes for pancakes while these other people have their food and our already eating. 

The waitress grabs a plate of pancakes and says to me their coming right out so I go sit down but get right back up and ask for the Manager. I could see that the pancakes she grabbed were not actually ours since she was not on her way to our table. 

In the end a young Hispanic guy around 20 yrs old came to our table and asked what happened and I explained and he said that we didn't have to pay for anything and asked did we want anything else from the menu. 

I won't lie...The pancakes were still very good. My daughter and I even took an order each of pancakes home. 

I never did get that business card Jazmin promised. 

2 stars for the free food, the apology and the pancakes to go.

Side note: Everyone waiting tables and the hostess were all very young women. There were no authoritative figures anywhere in the restaurant. Management was not there.

WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY, THE MOUSE WILL PLAY!!! THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY!"}
{"text":"IHOP is my sons favorite place to go and of course the pancakes are always great but today was a little better than usual. Our server Scott was extremely attentive he was very sensitive to the fact that there was a little bit of a wait so he kept checking in with us every few minutes. I have never been to a one with a balloon maker but there was an awesome one at this location today!"}
{"text":"It was labor day 2014.  We arrived at 9:30 am to a packes restaurant.   Simple breakfast food was ordered.  It took half an hour before some of our food was brought to us.  We all got some of our order, but had to wait for things like bacon, sausage,  and my toast which took 20 minuets to get to me.  Our server was very good, and very apologetic.  Thank you Nadira D.  She was able to discount our meals for the lateness of our orders.  We heard others around us getting discounts for having to wait also.  
Hey management,  you've been there a few years now, have more cooks on holidays."}
{"text":"I think IHOP is a great restaurant for families.  They seem to always have some sort of \"Kids eat free\" promotion going on.  They have good food and I love that they serve breakfast all day long.  I have been to this location many times since they opened and I have never had a complaint about their service."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. This was my first time coming to this IHOP location and I was very hungry. I ordered a big steak omelette with French fries and when the food came it looked like the egg was burnt. After taking my first bite of everything I noticed that the hash browns were burnt and the French fries did not taste fresh at all. I continued to take a couple more bites and I found a hair in my omelette. I proceeded to inform the waitress about what happened and she sent the food back. I could then hear her scream back to the cook about what I had told her and I'm sure everyone else heard. When she came back I informed her that I did not want it anymore and paid for my partners food and our coffee and then we left. I assumed that they would mess up my food again because of her yelling it to the cook as well as her tone when informing them. Also the cooks kept trying to see me as we were paying which made me feel uncomfortable. I do hope IHOP's management sees this and retrains there cooks and waitresses."}
{"text":"Went there this AM, got seated right away. Then we eat unnoticed & unattended, while waitress bussed three tables, over a period of 5 minutes. We walked out. As regulars for years to this location ( 3 times a month) we are shocked at our experience today at 9:15 am. We had the table that had four empty coffee pots on it when we sat down. Glad there is a new Waffle House in Gastonia. Come try it, they actually serve you."}
{"text":"They don't make whole wheat anymore:(. The pumpkin are cinnamon with a fancy name and even at times they are empty they undercook the pancakes. Gross!  
Sadly it's the only place open after 9pm so I may have to return."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars I would. Today was my second time visiting this location since moving to Surprise and it's also my second bad experience with them. The customer service was crappy. I placed my pick up order at 8, was noted that it should be done by 8:15, I arrived at 8:20, had to wait an additional 20 minutes just for my food to be cold yet overcooked and dry ( how's this even possible?) and they forgot to include my salsa. I even witnessed a waitress give a little attitude to another patron coming in to pick up an order as well. Don't see myself visiting this location ever again."}
{"text":"Not a clean, or organized IHOP that's for sure. The servers were arguing over who's section was who's. Hair balls on the ground, which is disgusting. It took 45+ mins to get our food. They kept apologizing every single time they came over to check on us, but an apology can do so much. Learn to not argue in front of customers, and to sweep the place up."}
{"text":"Old reliable \"IHOP\".  This location has friendly wait staff and the breakfasts are always well prepared and tasty.

Much better than other places like \"De**ys*.  Much cleaner and better quality."}
{"text":"It's close to home so I had to go back. Seated immediately & the breakfast was hot and very good. Butter pecan syrup wow what a sinful topping hahaha"}
{"text":"I do not see why people are so quick to judge an IHOP so harshly.

It's an IHOP for Pete's sake. The service is ok for being a chain breakfast place. But it is nice that this location is 24hours because my friends and I need a place to eat whether it be after bar hopping hours or not.

The food is consistantly not too bad (again for a chain) and I've gone back several times. Besides, it is great for people watching at certain hours of the day/night! :)"}
{"text":"If i could give this place zero stars i would. \"Server\" came to our table and instantly had an attitude. \"I guess I will be your server today\" Gave us the wrong drinks too after waiting for an hour! Have been here sitting and not once has she checked in or offered refills. I work in a restaurant and know what good service looks like and this absolutely is not. Extremely disappointed and will not be coming back. IHOP needs to hire a new staff. Terrible. It seemed as if they totally forgot about us."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible place to eat! Worst experience ever I will definitely not be coming back here service and food was horrible. Any other breakfest place is better than here"}
{"text":"Service is ridiculously slow the restaurant wasn't even busy. I don't know if they had to grow the wheat or milk cows but over half an hour for some pancakes and eggs seriously? Servers weren't very friendly either. It took a while to be acknowledged and seated when we got here (did I mention the restaurant wasn't busy)"}
{"text":"Poor service. Waited like 5 mins on a slow night to get seated another 10 for drinks and then waited 27 mins for no Mal. Yes I timed it. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Received the best service by Scooby do! Also there was a tall white lady, around 24-26range of age too and she served us a week before and she was amazing as weel
Food is ihop food so I would never rate a chained spot over the food"}
{"text":"I go here every Friday with my daughter before school. Consistently good breakfast, great service... Crazy 70's/80's music mix!"}
{"text":"Poor, slow service. Food that was just okay. A manager who didn't want to make an effort to address either issue. The worst part was when we saw another table's food being brought out, with one plate of food stacked halfway on top of another plate of food. I would have flipped if I'd seen that with my order.

I realize they were busy, I realize that our server was (by his admission) new. Doesn't excuse the fact that we didn't see him from the time we ordered to the time we got our check. Someone else brought our food. And the manager just blew off the mistakes. I wouldn't bother."}
{"text":"I give this place a three due to the bad service. But I really love the food. I had the tootie fruity and it never disappoints me."}
{"text":"This location is fairly new and I have ate here a few times now. Every time I come there is some sort of issue such as 1/2 the kitchen being closed, short on servers, out of bacon etc. They strive to provide excellent customer service but it falls short due to these little issues that seem to occur every time. This most recent visit I had to wait 45 minutes for my food. They offered to bring us some fresh fruit while we wait but wouldn't bring me another orange juice free of charge, doesn't make sense."}
{"text":"my wife and i went to ihop on our anniversary 5/28\14. not a normal anniversary place but we were in the mood for some IHOP. as soon as we arrived we were greeted by a delightful young woman with a sweet tone to her voice. we ordered, ate, and left. IHOP hasnt given us a bad meal yet, and the service was great, curtious, and simple. we were surprised it wasn't very busy. I suggest you go to Steelyard IHOP."}
{"text":"With all the IHOP I've been to, I can surely say that IHOP is your generic, American diner. The experience of going to an IHOP is consistent with every visit you make, making each dining experience safe and predictable. With a name like the \"International House of Pancakes\", you would only guess that their specialty would be pancakes, and you would be correct!

I have been at this IHOP on several different occassions, either dining by myself or with friends. Each visit I have made to this restaurant have been rather enjoyable. What I like about IHOP is their four syrups at every table that go great with any pancake, waffle, or anything savory for breakfast. The staff is attentive and sells the food well.

Although the food is nothing out of this world, the portions served are excellent and make spending money at this restaurant a great value. The seasonal specials they have during each holiday shows that they care about the current festivities and want to instill the holiday spirit to all of their customers.

IHOP is a great place for family and friends. I have yet to encounter a bad experience at this restaurant. Although the food is not anything special, it is served well and in good portions. Visiting IHOP may not blow your mind away, but will give you a reason to visit them again."}
{"text":"I've been here on a few occassions with friends on all times. We would be seated quickly, usually away from other customers. The waitress wouldn't need to write down what we wanted to drink, which I thought was pretty cool at the time. The food comes out together and it's nice and hot. The food is not absolutely amazing, but the sizes that the food comes in are worth the value. A great place to hang out with friends and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"We got there just before noon on a Sunday. We got there just in time because it was a packed house as we were leaving. The wife tried the new corned beef breakfast. She said it was good and the aioli made the dish. I got my usual sampler and it was as I expected. The coffee was a tad stout, but that's how I prefer it. The service wasn't the greatest, but they were busy."}
{"text":"Was decent for breakfast. We got here before the church rush, so if you're coming on a weekend be prepared to wait. All in all, a decent breakfast for cheap."}
{"text":"We came to I hop for Free Pancake Day ! It was not a disappointment. Lunch today was very good. Very pleasant experience dinning there today. 
The food was hot and served quickly. I did expect a long line and a long wait, but I was pleasantly surprised as to how smooth everything ran today. 
Service was great ! All the servers that walked by or  next to our table were friendly  and accommodating. 
The dining room was clean and we sat at a clean table. 
I know the negative comments and I can't comment on them. I just know that we had a great lunch, ate hot free pancakes and enjoyed it. 
I did give a donation to the children's miracle fun that I hop is supporting. 
We will return ! 
I hop at this location is 24/7"}
{"text":"As IHOPS go, they tend to be a bit busy, especially on the weekend, and such is the case for this location, but that is to be understood as their service and moreover, their food is excellent.  I was in on Sunday 1/26/14 for my fix of blueberry pancakes so I could properly represent national blueberry pancake day and was delighted.  A blueberry affectionato, they were melt on your tongue delightful."}
{"text":"Breakfast for lunch or dinner? What could be better?!!??! We have become regulars at this location being the closest to my house... pre-Yelp checkin', I have been here a TON of times!

I am not a morning person, and rarely eat breakfast. So, when I crave an omelette for lunch - this is the go-to place. I always tend to order the same thing... it's a craving right??? Bacon Temptation Omelette -- ya right! BACON! And this place knows how to make them.. because I think they put extra bacon...  crispy bacon, cheese sauce, jack and cheddar cheeses and diced tomatoes - and BACON. ;)

Service at this location has always been quick, efficient, and the servers know how to chit-chat while having a good time.

Lastly - and if you read my other reviews you will notice I always comment on bathrooms.... I have kids. The Bathrooms in this place have been clean on every visit! Actually amazing since most of the times we have been there were busy. Nice to know a place can maintain even with an overflow of customers."}
{"text":"Not in a rush to visit again.

I have to admit I am not a big fan of Ihop and after a disappointing recent  experience at IHOP, i was unsure if i wanted to go back.  However, I decided to give Ihop one more try. 

 The service at Ihop was wonderful, we were seated immedately.  Our server was great.  He took our order accurately, and was very friendly. 

I ordered the french toast combo  which came with eggs, bacon, hash browns and french toast. After my last experience, I ordered my eggs scrambled instead of over medium and my hash browns well done.

The eggs were very over cooked, and brown as was the bacon. The hash browns came lightly browned, I sent them back. The server came back with some the cooks had said were well done; they were browner on top but again were only cooked on one side. The french toast was okay but a little on the soggy side.

I am a big fan of breakfast.  However, based on my last two visit's to Ihop I'm not in a rush to visit again."}
{"text":"Waited 15 min to be seated in an empty restaurant.   Cashier so busy flirting with high school girls that 8 people were left waiting.  The other hostess was MIA.  We left and spent our money at Chick fil A.  TERRIBLE SERVICE."}
{"text":"Not quite sure why this place has such bad reviews.

It's an ihop people. Lower your expectations.

My food was fine, and the employees were friendly.

Who expects a 5 star dining experience at ihop? Get a grip."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday morning...what a mistake!  It took 36 minutes until our food arrived.  We liked our waitress, she was very professional, apologized for the lengthy wait.  We saw when we walked in that the restaurant was full of seniors.   Senior women playing board games, cards and table top games.  Looked like the neighborhood senior daycare center.  This is wonderful, however, both the waitress and manager told us that their dissatisfaction  with their orders was why our order took so long.  The staff had their hands full.  The manager did give us 10 percent off our bill.  Soooo...end of advice, don't go over to IHop on Monday mornings.  Or if you walk in and see all white hair at the front of the restaurant near the kitchen, walk straight back out!"}
{"text":"Crepes, just so good.

Fresh hot brewed coffee and free Wi-Fi aren't the only reasons I have to get my IHop fix. I go to IHop for their crepes.

 IHop offers a great selection of sweet and savory crepes.   From the Sweedish, Nutella, to the strawberry with cream cheese Ihop will surley have a crepe to satisfy your cravings . If sweet crepes aren't your thing Ihop offers a variety of chicken and spinach crepe options, that are equally delicious.  If crepes aren't for you IHop's variety of omelettes and delicious pancakes will surely hit the spot."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast, the eggs were cooked perfectly just like I like them , scrambled easy with cheese and the pancakes were of course perfect like always.. the waitress was kind and very pleasant! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered the most expensive thing on the menu a tbone steak medium rare I cut it right in the middle and it was beyond well done.... Then they remade it and it was rare but it's not the servers fault .... But I noticed that the steak wasn't red it was a brownish color so I wonder how long it's been sitting fit and if I'm about to get sick after eating this....... Service was good steak wasn't...."}
{"text":"Very nicely lit and clean place off the strip! Quiet and got service and food quick. Hot and tasty! Kim was our host and server...one lady show but she was great! Wish I could say the same for Denny's but all the ones we went to in Vegas SUCK! IHOP is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Really slow service. Even the people next to us said \" we put our order in last week, and still haven't received it.\" Servers are only friendly to make a tip. Also over heard the hostess complaining about her job while waiting for our seats."}
{"text":"Love this place! It is usually my go to sit down eatery. It's cheap, fast efficient service, friendly people and has amazing food! I am still going through the menus but there is not one item that I have friend that I would not recommend. Everything is amazing! If you like breakfast and dinner I would highly suggest the eggs and sirloin tips. It is so tender, juicy and has the most amazing flavor to it. Originally I would get the veggie creep which is also amazing. Full of fresh veggies and healthy. Recently I have tried the Colorado omelette and I must say it has great flavor too. It is for meat lovers and I would say well worth it. I have also tried their dinner menus and had their tilapia fish which I must say was very very good. Not fm dried out and had great flavor.

Unlike most places were you order hot chocolate and get a small cup. IHOP usually will bring you a huge mug  of hot chocolate and add whip cream on top. Especially on their holiday drinks. Can't finish a big one? No problem they have to go cups so you don't waist the rest of it you can take it home to finish later. 

The place can get pretty packed but honestly the people are usually very friendly and quick but if you need time they don't stay over your shoulder to rush you into making a decision. It's a pretty nice, calm , and enjoyable place to be. It is the second place in life like those who go to Starbucks and sit there and talk and drink in a nice atmosphere IHOP personally has the same feel and I absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"Ok so its Superbowl Sunday and we waited 20 min for a table for two. Reasonable given the day and location. Although this place was slammed they managed to handle it nicely with a smile in their face. We were seated and waiting for about 10 min as my husband and I already knew what we wanted we were approached by a very nice waitress named Lorena O. in a very busy section. She was nice, friendly, and and seemed calm for as busy as it was. She polity took our food and beverage order and was very quick to return with our drinks. Although we were surrounded by huge tables she was on top of our refills and food order. She was very prompt with our bill bit with out rushing us yo leave. Overall I enjoyed my Sunday morning breakfast."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in for a late dinner tonight and had such a great experience. When we walked in the restaurant was empty with the exception of an older couple. Right when we sat down people started pouring in. For late night on a Tuesday, I couldn't believe it. Tim had every customer accounted for and made sure everything exceeded customer expectations. I would also like to give credit to William and the chef in back because the food was almost identical to the photo on the menu!! Restaurant was also recently remodeled and very CLEAN!  I literally came home and created an account because I was so pleased with my visit. Thank you to all who contributed to the wonderful service we received!"}
{"text":"Worst iHop ever, food tastes like it's  second hand (;  No freshly made salad dressings, pancakes tastes like they made from 99 cents store mix... meat either burned or rough..,"}
{"text":"I love IHOP, but this location is always extremely inconsistent. While 7 times out of ten we have fairly good service, the food is constantly up and down. My fiancé and I had food come out cold after having waited for at least 30 minutes after placing our order. At that point we were so hungry we didn't even care. When the hostess asked how everything was when we went to pay my response was not good. Her response to me was well I'm sorry. No attempt to make me happy again. No asking if I wanted to speak to a manager. Very skeptical to give this place another chance."}
{"text":"I'll NEVER again patronize this place!

The T-bone steak I had for breakfast on June 23, 2014, was EXCELLENT, but that's the ONLY positive thing I can say about this particular IHOP location.

The waiter \"Roberto\" was the only server on duty, but he still took too long to take my order and it also took much too long for it to be prepared and delivered.  He was also very rude and disrespectful.  There was a female server there, but she informed me that she was off duty and couldn't even fetch me a lousy pitcher of coffee.

While I refuse to judge ALL IHOP locations by one awful place, I'll stay away from THIS one, for the remainder of my life and urge everyone else to do likewise.

If I want to be treated in such a shabby manner in the future, I'll contact my first mother-in-law, who was once awarded the MEDDLE of Honor."}
{"text":"The #1 reason to visit this particular location, is a server named BRENDA.

Yes, the food is terrific and the prices are certainly reasonable, but if the employees are not \"first class,\" the entire dining experience suffers.

Please don't misunderstand me.  ALL of the workers here are friendly, polite, cheerful and dedicated to customer satisfaction, but BRENDA will easily exceed all of your expectations, and her professionalism is why I keep coming back.

There is another IHOP location in Las Vegas NV, which I refuse to patronize, due to one very rude & impolite employee, so don't think that I'm enthusiastic about all of the IHOP locations, because that's not the case.  This review is only for this specific place.

Lastly, the General Manager (April) needs to be complimented too, because it is she who oversees the hiring and training of the staff, and they all are an excellent reflection of her instincts regarding people and her overall management abilities.

Dining here is an every weekend \"event\" for me and several of my friends, and it may surprise some to learn that it is a 28-MILE ROUND TRIP that I happily drive, whenever I want wonderful food and \"awesome\" service."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped at IHOP (now IHOB) last weekend to try their new burgers. We got there around 11 AM and the place was pretty dead, with only a few of the tables filled. 

We both ordered the classic burgers - mine with the \"special sauce\" on the side, and my husband's with just lettuce and tomato. It took over 25 minutes for our food to arrive and the orders weren't right. Both our burgers had the special sauce on it. My husband, who despises mayo and pickles (which were also incorrectly added to his burger), refused to eat his. I had mine and it was actually pretty good. Certainly not worth the 25 minute wait, but good. The closest comparison would be a Steak n Shake burger. 

It should also be mentioned that the only time we saw our server was when she brought out our drinks. Someone else delivered our food and that was it. We never had our drinks refilled and had to ask someone else for the check. The customers at the table behind us had the same issue with their server. 

At a certain point in the meal, a very nice gentleman (whose name I should have gotten) came over and asked how everything was. When my husband told him about his burger, he offered to make him a new one to-go. We were hesitant because we didn't want to wait another half hour, but the guy said it would only be a few minutes so we accepted. My husband enjoyed the second burger, but I doubt we'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service left more to be desired. We were able to be seated right away, but it was very busy. We had to order from 3 different employees and we were not given ketchup even though we had fries. There were wrappers from straws in the waiting area as well."}
{"text":"Waiter was awesome, they all are yet it's very unfortunate that the store manager decided to let her friend go before a lot of us on the list after waiting 20 minutes yet her friend just walked in n immediately got sat."}
{"text":"It's always busy here, but we thought we would give it a try.  I got the Bananas Foster French Toast meal, I liked the Bananas Foster French Toast and the bacon, but the eggs were scrambled and over cooked which made them hard and dry, the hash browns were ok.  My daughter got the chicken and waffles which you really can't go wrong with and she liked it she couldn't finish it so she took the rest home.  The waitress was very nice and polite and asked if we needed anything throughout our meal which was great.  I noticed that things were clean which was definitely a plus.  All and all the food for me was ok, but the service was good.  So I will probably go back and try something different."}
{"text":"Are you hungry?  Well if you are, go somewhere else because you'll starve here...and even if you are lucky enough to finally get food, it's cold.  IHOP needs to visit this franchise and either give them an ultimatum to start operating by their corporate standards or shut them down.  Bathrooms are filthy, when I told manager there was no soap or toilet paper in the men's room, he wasn't interested.  Nice...no soap...so you know the employees aren't getting their hands clean after using the bathroom."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour to get our bland and quite disgusting meal. Luckily the manager comped our meal, but I know that we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I walked in on a rainy night trying to avoid the traffic and folks who are skittish of driving in the rain. Rescue me iHop!  I just wanted a warm meal and to read my book in relative silence. Well, silent service is what I got. 

Waited at the hostess booth/register area for about 3 minutes before a sever rushed from the back and seated me. She gave me a menu and brought water. She came back about 5 minutes later and took my order. This is key: I saw her write it down. 

Let's see, hmmm. I've read about three chapter. Where are my pancakes? No sign of my server so I start doing that looking around thing hoping to catch another server's eye. They only other server in my area was scurrying around waiting tables and I swear she made eye contact and looked the other way. My mouth as open and ready to speak but she rushed away. Luckily she delivered food to another table close by a few minutes later and I asked her to please get my server and she did. 

In a flash my server appeared with notebook in hand. \"I'm so sorry I forgot to put in your order,\" she said. I said ok, but could she please ask them to rush because it was now 7:30 and I was starving. She said yes and then said the words that got me upset: \"What did you order?\" Sheesh! Are you kidding me?  I've been waiting a half hour for food, sitting there with water only and no one in the restaurant wondered what was going on with me? That is no kind of customer service. The place wasn't even crowded. I saw you write it down. Not only did NOT place the order, you apparently forgot you had a customer and LOST the ticket. OMG unforgivable...totally. 

I grabbed my phone and bag and told her I was leaving. I didn't look back at her. On my way out, I told the manger who was now behind the register,  what happened. She apologized. I was SO HANGRY so I rushed out. 

I love iHop breakfasts but this time it was not to be. Service is at the core of every business. I think they need to retrain staff at this location to be successful in the long run. I still want pancakes though."}
{"text":"Worst experience of my life on 7/12/17!!!  I am visiting from California and decided to come here after attending a concert. We arrived at 11:40 pm and there was about 4 tables occupied and there was one girl playing waitress and host. It took her 10 minutes to take our drink order, 15 minutes to deliver it and take our food order. It is now past midnight. We were sat next to a couple that ordered at the same time as us. By 12:25am the couple had already received their food and we're eating. I asked her when was ours coming out and she said a few more minutes. It was now 12:40am so I got up and looked into the food window and our food was just sitting there. The waiter was doing everything but delivering our damn food. I was very upset. In over an hour, our waiter had no voluntarily interaction with our table. So, I just had enough and got up to leave and she finally acknowledge us by saying, \"Oh, are you guys leaving?\" I said \"Yes we've waited over an hour and still don't have anything.\" Then she responded, \"But it's here now\"....No it's been there and you didn't deliver it. Never again."}
{"text":"I got here at 7:15am, not busy at all. I stood at the front for 15 min before anyone acknowledged I was there. 5 more minutes to be seated. I sat at the table for 20 minutes and no-one even took our drink order. Service here has been declining for about 6 months now. I won't ramble on about those experiences, but this was one of the worst. It's always been my and my boys' go-to for breakfast every Sat or Sun. Time to find a new place. - Oh and I left with no service and no-one noticed."}
{"text":"Another year, another birthday. A free rooty tooty (pancakes). 

My wife took the pancakes. She said they were fine, though she thinks they were smaller now than last year.

I had the Tuscan scramble. Never again. I tasted no seasoning and no Parmesan, even though the menu description says I should have. It was just eggs with a bit of spinach and pepper.  Probably too much compared to the quantity of egg.  Give this one a pass.  In fact, without a coupon don't even bother pulling into the parking lot.  You can do a lot better."}
{"text":"Customer service was great. Avoid anything that has to deal with meat. Bacon and steak taste terrible and make you sick to your stomach."}
{"text":"It's been quite a while since we've been here. I know why that is now. I've recently changed my diet from meat staple to mostly healthier choices and more play based. We came with a coupon and it was specific, so I broke down and got the sampler(meat), lots of very unhealthy, the healthiest was the crepes I got with lingonberries. 
   Two of us got the same thing as far as the crepes, the best thing I ate on this trip out. Coffee, to drink and water. The server was very informative and very attenitive asked how we were doing. If we needed coffee, broughtvthe bill with out asking. Service was the best thing out of the experience today. I personally won't be back."}
{"text":"Obviously a big chain. This location was very busy when we arrived. The offer crepes. Birthday gets you free pancakes.

\"IHOP\" is a shortened version of their original name.  I remember \"International House of Pancakes\".  And one thing they do well is pancakes.  Light, fluffy...nice.  My wife had that, and I tried a bite.  Yes, very nice.

I had the chicken-fried steak.  Totally underwhelming.  Even Denny's does better on that one.

So I suppose if you really want pancakes, this is a good option.  If you want something else, maybe not.  The free birthday pancakes are a good reason to visit, but otherwise I can't think of one."}
{"text":"Rude customer service! We sit and wait for someone to acknowledge us. Fifteen minutes go by and I finally ask for a server as no one was coming to our table. They bring our drinks and get our order taken care of. The soup arrives after the main meal because the server forgot about it. The hash browns which are part of the meal never arrive and as we inquire about it the server looks surprised \"Do you want hash browns?\" duh! It comes with the meal.... We didn't have enough silver wear. Our drinks never got refilled and by the time I got the creamer for my coffee was cold. Then the server has the balls to say \"Everyone happy?\" With an attitude. Bad experience! Nick, you need to have a more friendly tone. It's thanksgiving day, be grateful for having a job."}
{"text":"If you like waiting,  then this is the place for you.   Each time I've been here the kitchen was inadequately staffed.  The cosmetic changes to the interior does not make up for the extremely slow service."}
{"text":"Well I don't think they spit in my food, so that's worth a star.

I arrived on a Sunday morning at 11am and put my name in.  Table for three was available about 11:30.   Service was quick and we ordered immediately.

Despite the menu noting that my breakfast came with hashbrowns, the waitress returned 10 minutes later telling me that it did not.  I said fine, then tack one on.  10 minutes later, the hashbrowns showed up.  That was it though.  I let them sit, waiting for the rest of my food, waiting for my friends' food, and there they sat, cold and sad.

Another 10 minutes passed and the waitress came by, noted we didn't have food (she hasn't been by since telling me my blueberry pancakes didn't come with hash browns).  Another 15 minutes passed and then our food arrived.  12:05.  My pancakes were wicked cold, as was most of our food.  My friend received scrabbled eggs instead of overhard.  The waitress said she'd bring him new eggs but instructed him \"don't eat those.\"  Like what they were going to bring them back and serve them to someone else?  It was at least five, but probably another 10 minutes before his eggs returned.

We ate quickly (we had somewhere to be) and then spoke to the manager on the way out.  He did cut the bill in half, which was nice.  Otherwise my OJ, pancakes and hashbrowns would have been $15 or something.  Yeah, umm, no.  I wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"01/05/15  3:30 PM

Came in today to enjoy my free birthday pancakes. Sign up at their website for their mailing list. Retail $8.99. Your choice of World Famous pancakes, top with Peach, Cinnamon Apple or Glazed strawberry.


Juan was our waiter, he's very friendly.  Our drinks have not hit empty. I had the Cinnamon Apple compote it was very good. A bit on the sweet side but very good! Next time I rather get the Strawberries. 

Food was hot but NOT great.. it was edible that's for sure.  Juan was a fantastic waiter we tip him 26% since he did pay close attention to his tables. 

You can eat here for under $10 a person it's a nice cheap place.

I still rather go to the crap location near us on Fort Apache & Tropicana. It's busier, with a bigger staff. That being said I updated my profile to that location, until next year."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday and it was really delicious.  We had a male waiter tall fellow, Caucasian. He had the entire right side of the dinning area & was very fast hard working guy."}
{"text":"This blows Denny's out of the water.  I never used to be an iHop person but the staff here had always been pleasant when addressed any issue with the food. There here with big smiles to feed you. 

I think it's about the same price as Denny's for a combo might as well come here instead.  Tried their Nutella banana crepe combo, it was worth the short wait. We came here after lunch rush and the service was fast and friendly experience."}
{"text":"I recently discovered that IHOP mow serves Country Fried Steak and Egg for breakfast I have always loved that so..I thought I would give it a try.I requested a couple of special things...eggs scrambled well...toast instead of pancakes...and extra country gravy on the side...cause you know they never give you enough gravy. Anyway...the portion of the chicken fried steak was HUGE...and Very Good.  Eggs were cooked perfectly...and I got my toast instead of the dreaded and much disliked pancakes. All served with a smile...food was hot and just what I had been craving.  I am fortunate..I live close and will most definitely be going back for this great breakfast.  I also tried it as dinner one night when the steak is served with broccoli and mashed potatoes.  No complaints there either...steak was massive..cooked perfectly and I got my extra gravy with no problem...Can't say anything about the other dishes...but the Chicken Fried Steak for breakfast or dinner...hell yeah!"}
{"text":"My advice to anyone coming here in a party larger than 5 would be to separate your group into 2 parties than wait 30, 40, even 50 minutes and watch every smaller party who got there after you eat and pay already.  It's especially saddening that they tell you 10 min wait too."}
{"text":"I ate here last night and now I have food poising I haven't been able to keep food down and I had to leave work because of it this place is such a let down I have been here a few times and every time there something wrong between the gall of water that was smelling like old lake water to the omelet that was dry meat and soggy to the servers the can't get you water were your seating becuase it's not there side to water and look after ?? The need a retraining here and a good cleaning it's gross"}
{"text":"The best IHOP around, this location has even been featured on news channels for Dean's List during AZ Health Inspections. I don't know why others are giving bad reviews. This is a diner NOT a fancy restaurant. Sit down breakfast or maybe just pancakes and coffee any time of the day. 
Waitresses are friendly and have a nice appearance."}
{"text":"Ok, yes it's IHOP.  I don't expect 5 star quality food.  I do however, expect my food served to me hot and with the rest of the group I was with.

If you are in a hurry, don't waste your time.  The service here is slow and they never check back to make sure the food is right.  Having to chase down your server is never a plus.

If you want a special order, forget it.  And make sure whatever sauce you order is the right one.  I'm highly allergic to green peppers and when we ordered Mozzarella Sticks, our brilliant server brought salsa instead of marinara sauce and I had an allergic reaction.  The waiter and manager on duty didn't feel the need to offer me anything and then I had to rush out and get allergy meds and come back to get the rest of my group.  They never even asked if I was ok or offered me anything, not even a glass of water.

Why I made the mistake of going back here, I don't know but it is close to where I live so we stopped.  I got cold eggs, hash browns, bacon and pancakes.  The pancakes wouldn't even melt the butter.  I had waited over 45 mins for my food and then when I found it cold, I boxed it up so I could get home.  The manager then announced to my group that they do not give separate checks anymore after midnight (a new rule to us since we used to go there every Friday night after karaoke) and that this rule had been in effect for \"years.\"  The manager then asked if my food was alright, and by this time I had enough.  I flat out told her no, that my food was cold and asked her if she wanted to feel it.  She asked me if I wanted them to fix me a new plate and I said no because I didn't have another hour to wait for it.  I haven't been back since.  

I really don't recommend this IHOP as it's not up to the usual IHOP standards.  I love IHOP, just not this franchise."}
{"text":"Been here twice, the service is good and the food taste good. I haven't had a bad experience"}
{"text":"Came here with family while visiting from CA. I don't really eat at IHOP back home, but was so pleased with the level of service and quality of food! I got the international special: Mexican Tres Leches Pancakes. My server was very kind and probably one of the fastest services I've received at IHOP!"}
{"text":"I rather enjoy this location for a nice breakfast. The service is generally good, and the food is typically out in a timely manner, no matter how crowded the dining room may seem. Plus, as I mentioned in my earlier tip, they always play great music (Sirius/XM 70's on 7). 

Today's trip was no different. The only quasi-hiccup was that there was no hostess immediately available to seat the small congregation that had started to gather in the lobby. But the wait was minimal as soon as Lynn realized that we had been waiting.

Lynn is the first waitress I have ever encountered who could serve beverages faster than I could drink them...which is quite the feat, in my humble opinion.

All in all, rave reviews. Many thanks to Lynn! 

If you're looking for a healthy breakfast, try the Simple + Fit Two Egg Breakfast w/2 extra Egg Beaters (if you're looking for extra protein). It comes with dry toast and fresh fruit for around $12. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast but not as much as my husband does. I only came here for the family. Don't get me wrong. Food is always good I'm just picky and rather cook my own. I do love the Benedicts. All of them. And that maple French toast donut was bomb."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and ordered a vegetable omelet and turkey bacon.  The turkey bacon tasted so old that I could not eat it.  The omelet tasted OK. My utensils were dirty and I had to get set from another table."}
{"text":"We got horrible service before we even got sat. It was late and we worked all night. We just wanted some food and a place to talk. It is right across the street from our house so we thought it was perfect especially seeing it was three in the morning.  The server was annoyed that we were even standing there. We refused to sit and continue getting horrible service so we went to Dennys instead."}
{"text":"Rosie (Server) provided exceptional service by her attentiveness, friendly welcoming disposition, and job knowledge. She epitomizes what service should be.  The Manager (Trachelle) was professional in addressing the request for substitution but cited the company policy of not substituting one (1) slice of French Toast  for two (2) pancakes without a .99 up charge.  Recommend review of adherence to such policies and empowering employees to waive them."}
{"text":"I think this Ihop deserves a solid 4 star rating and given the overall 3 1/2 star rating I'm giving it a five today to help bring it up.
The service is always friendly and the food is consistently good. There are plenty of menu selections to choose from and they continue to update their menu to add more options. I specially like the half carafe of coffee that they place on your table the moment you arrive."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  The hostess told us multiple times she was alone.  When we were finally seated she went to a seated table 3 times and didn't even take our drink order.  We had multiple kids that were well behaved but hungry and she wouldn't even look our way.  Don't waste your time.  Denny's across the street was much better!"}
{"text":"After our last experience at IHop my family and I will never be visiting this location again. The service was horrible, the food was disgusting, we ended up sending back one of the meals and they have raised their prices to more than what a person would expect to pay at a diner.  To top it all off 3 of the 4 people i went with ended up with some type of stomach bug. I'm guessing it was the sausage links since i did not eat them and I was the only one who didn't get sick."}
{"text":"I didn't know that ihop did take out and Alisha was great! She helped get our big order taken care of."}
{"text":"The food is usually good, especially pancakes and omelets. It's usually busy, the booths are not that comfortable, but the service is friendly and it's a cozy place. I come here about once a month."}
{"text":"Came to restaurant at 9 with a party of 8. Didn't get seated until 9:35.  They took our order at 9:45.  It took 54 minutes to get our food.  There have been 3 other parties that have been a party of 6 that have been seated after we were seated. They have also received their orders of food.  We also sat here for 20+ minutes for water or drinks.  
Not a good experience."}
{"text":"This is a shout out to Devon, who is a superb server and person all around!! 

During the time of my visit. I was studying for my nursing state boards and met up with a couple of gal pals. As we were getting close to our scheduled exam dates, our nervousness and emotions were moderate and we were restless with lack of sleep from ongoing studying and focusing. Devon, who was a brand new server at the time immediately greeted us cheerfully. He has a natural gift of creating laughter and right timing too!  He had us LAUGHING throughout our stay and I remember asking Devon for lemon for my water, he shortly comes out and serves me a whole uncut lemon and I, along with my peers looked at each other and looked at Devon and were like what? He broke a smile and we all laughed out loud! He had some other entertaining quirks and he was fantastic as a server throughout our dining experience that I had inquired why he was in training? He needed to fly solo and I believe he has a future in management. I went ahead and spoke to the iHOP manager to genuinely express positive feedback about Devon and assured that he can serve on his own and perhaps train others. 

Continue your good nature and demeanor Devon. We appreciate you!! May your personality spread to many. You really do make a difference!  I look forward to enjoying another dine in experience as long as you are serving or are management! :)"}
{"text":"From the time we walked in until we paid our bill.  Nobody around to greet us, dirty tables, waitress took our order without writing it down, orders were wrong, took really long for food, had to send items back, the omelet was supposed to be egg whites and spinach however it was really yellow and the plate and omelet was drenched in butter, the pancakes were so big and thick it was hard to swallow."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying our meal of one waffle and a chicken fried steak breakfast took an hour to arrive.  Total dining time at this IHOP was an hour and a half!  There was one server, Christian, and one cook in a dining room of probably ten occupied tables.  While both Christian and the cook did a great teamwork job, there is no reason for a restaurant to be this short staffed. Several times the cook came out with the prepared food and delivered it to the waiting table.  During our visit, there were no tables cleared, and many were dirty, and several times the cook came out of the kitchen to tell incoming patrons to go elsewhere, as the wait for their food would be two hours or more.  When it came time to pay, Christian told us the system was down and we could only pay cash. I had an IHOP gift card and was not allowed to use it.  So, I gave Christian $30 in cash for our tab of $26.30.  He went in to the kitchen where between he and the cook, they made the change of $3.70. Absolutely unacceptable!  When we left at 8 p.m., they were still turning incoming patrons away and there were at least a dozen dirty tables. This was our experience at the 4860 S Boulder Hwy location"}
{"text":"It's a chain, so you can't expect much of an experience! The service is super slow and we waited almost 30 minutes for an omelette and chicken and waffles. Staff is nice, so again, just don't have high expectations for quality of food, and be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Everything was fine. As I hops go. Not much to say. Easy to get to off the freeway,  the staff was polite and efficient.  Maybe a little understaffed but I've seen a lot worse. Pepsi instead of coke."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this location no star at all. Was sat almost immediately in a nearly empty restaurant, then waited 20 minutes and no one came to take my order. I literally just walked out. Passed the host who sat me on my way out, no acknowledgement whatsoever. Way to bring in the New Year Ihop. I guess they're selective about who they serve in 2017."}
{"text":"Horrible food, horrible service. Got sat right away, there were 3 other tables there when we got there, one of which was leaving. There were 2 other parties who came in within 5 mins after us to eat and seated. We had been seated for about 15 mins at his point with no service. Finally the hostess comes over to take our drink order meanwhile the waitress was over collecting orders from one of the other two tables who came in right after my party. Finally get our waters and the second man who came in to eat got up and walked out pissed from having to wait so long but still wasn't as bad as long as us. Finally the waitress Crystal walks over and asked if we were ready to order. In the process there was a family of 5 getting out of their car to walk in. She mumbles under her breath \"ooh great they're coming in\". I asked her if she had a problem and told her we would leave especially after having to wait 20 mins before she even acknowledged us. She said no there's no problem and took our order. Food took another 20 mins and came out hardly warm. Food was just horrible and service wasn't any better. There were two other waiters in the restaurant just walking around the back room cleaning up in there when they should have been helping with all the tables who had them came in after my party. The manager came over to our table and I voiced my frustration and offered 50% off my bill and a coupon I will not be using to come back. Do yourself a favor and save yourself the trouble by just going across the street to Village Inn to eat!"}
{"text":"Horrible!  Was very happy to see this restaurant being built, sadly it's just occupying a space.  Went on a weekday morning, not really busy.  Waited several minutes at hostess station before anyone approached to seat us.  Then we waited and waited again before our server came.  We placed our orders as we had ample time to review the menu.  Again, waited and waited for our food.   My husband asked for ketchup and I asked for sugar free syrup.  After cutting into my pancakes, they were blueberry, not banana that I had ordered.  Tried to locate our server, could not see her.  Restaurant was not really busy, so not sure what was happening.  Finally I caught her attention and she came over and I pointed out the mistake.  She apologized and said she would take back.  Asked again for ketchup and sugar free syrup.  Several minutes later she came back with correct order.  Again requested the ketchup and syrup.  Again, waited too long for this, my husband had just about finished his breakfast at this point because he chose not to wait for the ketchup because his eggs and potatoes were barely warm when served.  Finally she comes with syrup and ketchup, but the ketchup bottle was almost empty.  He was able to get 2 squirts out of it.  By this time we had decided this was our first and most likely our last visit here.  
I will usually give a restaurant a second chance, things happen but after reading other reviews here, this seems to be more the norm and not the exception.  Before we left a woman who I believe was a manager came to our table and said they were short handed today and wanted to apologize.  I appreciate that but seems to be every day.  She also said we would get a 20% coupon for our next visit.  We never did get the coupon, but it's unlikely we would return.   She should have discounted today's meal.  With this level of service IHOP will be closing soon and hopefully a more desirable alternative will occupy this space."}
{"text":"The restaurant was less than half full and it took the kitchen almost 30 minutes to get breakfast food out. The eggs were way undercooked and couldn't be eaten. The meats were wrong also. We didn't dare send it back for fear of waiting even longer. The servers were fine but the kitchen was not and no Manager in sight. Never again."}
{"text":"Decided to have breakfast for dinner with my daughter and my grandson tonight. Pulled in at 6:00PM and there was maybe 2 or 3 tables seated in the restaurant. Thought \"maybe we'll get our food pretty quickly.\" That was the last good thought I had for the rest of the time there. We were served our drinks fairly quickly.....that's the best part.  :(

We order our food....2 country omelettes (1 with no onion and change the ham to sausage) and a rooty jr. Now we wait. There is a table that came in after us with probably about 6 people and they receieved their food before us. And we're still waiting. Now I hear someone yelling that they need the rooty jr with a scrambled egg. Out comes the toast and the pancakes. Next comes the two country omelettes.....but wait! They weren't even close to a country omelette. Have no clue what they were but they had every meat possible with salsa. WRONG! Now mind you, two adults have their food (or someone;s food) and my grandson STILL doesn't have his rooty jr. We sent those omelettes back and out comes the rooty jr. And here we wait for silverware. Now we are still waiting for the correct omelettes to come out and we have no silverware for the rooty jr, pancakes or toast. The server comes back to say they re making the omelettes. I said \" I need three things: 1. silverware 2. jelly 3. the pancakes are a short stack that comes with 3 not 2 pancakes.\" We received one fork for my grandson. 

Finally the two country onmelettes come out. Pancakes are now cold and still minus one. The adults still do not have silverware or jelly. Server finally comes back and I asked for silverware. My daughter informs the server that her omelette clearly has onions when we stated twice that it shouldn't have any. He suggested they make another and she declined stating she lost her appetite anyways. He then asked me if there was anything else and I stated \"no. I don't even want this now.\" He stated \"What would you like me to do about it?\" REALLY? WOW! I was floored. Now mind you, I haven;t seen the manager since he seated a booth right next to us....about 10 minutes prior to the omelettes finally coming out.

Server came back and asked if we needed anything and my daughter simply said \"can you take this omelette off the check since it clearly was not what I ordered and I didn't touch it?\" He said he would see what he could do. We got the bill.....yep, just the omelette was taken off the bill. No manager stopped by....no apologies......went to the cashier and she said \"I hope your meal was great.\" I simply stated \"no it wasn't\" and SHE apologized. 

I had the choice.....IHOP or Village Inn......I won't be making that mistake again. I would rather go to a Waffle House. If you're short staffed or someone is in training, i can see that. Tell your patrons what is going on. For the manager to never say a word to us about the service we had, I was dumbfounded."}
{"text":"If you are disabled and require a medical device to get around ( knee scooter, wheel chair or any such device ) you are not welcome to be a customer at IHOP. Today I experienced discrimination simply trying to get out of the house for a short period of time . Scott (the host and Assistant Manager) advised me as we sat down that I would need to insure my knee scooter was out of the way. I stated I would do my best.  As we were finishing up he came up to me and said I need you to move that so I can put a high chair at this corner booth. .... 1) I had the scooter up against the table I was at  2) there were other tables empty that would have also accommodated a high chair 3) another family had previously sat at the table while we were there and didn't have an issue. 
I advised him in a not so friendly manner that we were leaving . He had the audacity to ask me if there was a problem. So true to my standards I advised him that yes there was and that apparently he has had an issue with me being there with this walker since I walked in. His response ........ \" It is a fire hazard mam \".  So I advised him that the ADA authorities would be advised and that they would be in touch.   This battle won't be about me and my temporary condition this will be about those that stay home and don't even bother trying to get out who have permanent disabilities and are made to feel like I feel right now .  As for IHOP before they spend money changing the last letter of their acronym I suggest they get some sensitivity training and learn the law.

UPDATE: I did receive a call from the regional office that I didn't expect to hear from on a Sunday afternoon. George assured me that he would look into the situation and provide training regarding these matters."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for lunch this afternoon. The place was packed.

I thought we'd have a long wait, but we were shown to a booth in just a few minutes.

The hostess and our waitress were both very friendly. I appreciated them taking the extra effort to stay friendly when it was crazy busy like that. I deal with the public on a daily basis and know when it's super busy like that it can sometimes be a challenge to keep a smile on your face and a kind word on your lips.

All of our meals were excellent. If I'm ever in the neighborhood I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I love this IHOP, but only at non-traffic times. For example, if I want a yummy pancake (or whatever else) dinner after my evening workout (7pm) on a week night, they treat my daughter and me VERY well - extra attention, sometimes even extra food for the wee one! But if we try to come in during busy hours (say brunch on Sunday), then it only rates three stars, and since that's usually the case, the every now and then visit with the evening shift just can't make up for it, although they are very sweet."}
{"text":"Food is a solid 3.5 stars. Nothing too write home about, if you know what I mean. Very typical breakfast fare for a decent price. The pancakes are by far the highlight. At my table we had the chocolate chip pancakes and they were very good. Only downside was that they were slightly too chocolatey (is that even a thing; must be) because they almost borderline tasted cardboard-ish. Egg dishes are average; you could easily make them at your house. 

Service is like a 2, so borderline awful. The waitress we had was pleasant enough, but the host(s) were pretty bad. They had a bad attitude on a Sunday morning and weren't very accommodating to me when I told them I had a coupon. In short, I probably won't be returning to this location even though it is super close to my home."}
{"text":"It's been ages since I've had my lingonberry Swedish crepes from IHOP, so I talked my hubby into going this morning since I haven't been to this new location since it's opened recently. 

Our waitress was really nice. The restaurant was nice and new appearance wise. I just don't understand how it could take 47+ minutes to get food out. The restaurant wasn't full. They did not look understaffed. I don't think our orders were complicated. 

Steak and eggs and Swedish crepes. If they were things that were difficult to make, I'd understand but I should've known when the two tables who'd been waiting before we even got there just got their food a couple minutes before us, that it'd be a long wait. 

Maybe because this place is newer, they're still working out kinks in the system but there is just something off about this location."}
{"text":"Tried to have breakfast here this morning. Couldnt  finish  our food after watching the manager walk into the area where the waitresses were plating the food and he sneezed several times all over the plates, counters, food, everything and never attempted to cover his mouth.  Hope the corporation does something to remedy this.  It was disgusting!"}
{"text":"I would give this IHOP location 0 star! Their customers service is terrible and they serve you with you food! They look down on students as if students can't give them tips or something!"}
{"text":"I ordered my food and waited.  Half an hour went by and they were delivering to go food to the counter which was not being handed to anyone.  I finally tracked down the girl who took the order and she walked over and handed me a bag that had been sitting there for about 15 - 20 minutes.  I told her that was not okay as the food would be cold and she felt the bottom of the box and said \"oh it is still warm\".  I will never be going back to this location!  Useless staff who cannot do their simple job and not to mention the two useless managers who just sat there right next to the to go food without giving it another thought to check and make sure it was being delivered!!!  One had time to stop and chat with a lady she apparently knew who had a baby.  FREAKING USELESS EMPLOYEES!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great.... except for the dysfunctional management team, the \"drop a piece of toast on the floor & put it back on the plate & send it out\" occasions, the bandaids & hair that get dropped into the food, and the waitresses who snort cocaine while on the job."}
{"text":"Worst Service Ever!!!!!!!!! I got to IHOP with my family and waited 10 mins to get seated and once we got seated we waited 20 mins for our waitress to get us our drinks and once we order we waited another 30 minutes for our food. Our waitress Destiny was super slow , didn't check up on us, and brought us our food cold. I ordered the sliders with fries and the bread was hard and food was cold. Worst service we've ever received and by the way we asked another waitress for help and she had a really bad attitude. December 28th, 2017 . @5:58pm"}
{"text":"So I recently went here with a friend of mine because they were craving IHOP, and I didn't care were we went to eat as long is it had food.

I got one of there new healthy choice menu items the balsamic chicken and my friend got the club sandwich with a side salad and a side of pancakes...don't ask.

The food was surprisingly really good and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Getting into this place at 11am on a Sunday is harder than getting into  Ft. Knox! Sadly, the food is not really worth the wait, but it's IHOP or Eat 'n Park, so what you gonna do? It could have been my fault. I tried their biscuits and gravy, and they were destined to disappoint. Maybe I'll stick with just eggs and hash browns next time I have to go out for breakfast. On the upside, the service was quite friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends after a wild night and had *the* best service from our waitress, Emily. She knew what was up, and gave our table a glass of orange juice. She suggested caramel on top of my chicken and waffles. In all, she provided really good customer service that I'd come back for"}
{"text":"Hard to say no to a free birthday meal : )

Went here for breakfast on a Sunday morning and it was a fairly good experience.
I had chamomile tea and hubby had diet coke. I was adventurous and tried crepes for the first time in my life (Garden Crepes), they were good. Too sweet some bites but they were good. Hubby had the Colorado Omelette and he enjoyed it too. The only thing I can say is that it is usually bigger, but it was still a decent size. It was kind of plump on one side and the other side was wimpy.

Our server Brittany was nice and friendly and one other server helped keep my hubby's glass full. Nice team work.

Oh, and by the way... the New York Cheesecake is back : )"}
{"text":"order food offline and picked it up. and when i got home and was eating the food which was a omelette I found hair inside the omelette. I dont know if the kicthen where hair nets but they should because im not going to eat here every again because of that and when i return to the location. Daniel the manger hesitated to give me back the refund was trying to give me a new order. but then refund everything i order."}
{"text":"I love Ihop. We decided to have  easy breakfast
There was line which I understand. It is acceptable if you go there weekend. We waited about 10 minutes. I love their pan cake."}
{"text":"We ate here today for lunch.  It started getting busy when we got there.  It took a while until the waitress first came to us but after that, she was on it.  Drinks were refilled right away and food was fresh and good.  Best chocolate chip pancakes!!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to pop into our local IHOP to try the new burgers.  Seated right away, it was a bit of a wait to be served, only 2 servers working and it was a bit busy, especially since they need to buss their own tables and run to the front desk to cash out and seat people.  Need a dedicated host or manager from 6-10pm to greet and seat, cash out and wipe tables.
Both ordered classic burgers and fries, soft bun, crispy lettuce, juicy tomatoes, crunchy pickles and onions with secret sauce.  Burger tasted like it was homemade, 4th of July, cooked by my grandpa, yummy.
Fries were seasoned well and crispy.  Server didn't ask if we wanted more fries, we had to ask.  Server did check on meals and did offer 1 drink refill.  Overall impressed, but lose a star for lack of / short staffed."}
{"text":"Dyanna our server was fast and very friendly.  Order came out hot and correct. Nice job everyone."}
{"text":"Service was decent for an IHOP. Meal was delivered quickly and was pretty tasty. What more can you ask for from an IHOP?"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS IHOP. Terribly management, staff, food, etc. unorganized seated 2 parties of 2 that arrived after us, food came out cold, seating patrons at dirty tables, took 20 mins to receive water or service, a mess! Go to another location!"}
{"text":"My family loves IHOP... But how the hell you can run out of pancakes at a frickin IHOP!!!"}
{"text":"My server was great Maria T. but I can see how it could be slow by other servers.  My iced tea tasted like they makes it with Tap water which I really dislike.  
The food was fine. I feel the company has seen better days.  Won't return"}
{"text":"Even though it's meant for breakfast, this place is best late at night. I go with a few friends around midnight and the graveyard shift people are always the best. Clayton gives consistently amazing service and doesn't hover his tables. Best place to eat after 10pm on happy valley for sure."}
{"text":"My big special meal was not very.Rooty or tooty! the plate looked like it was anorexic! didn't look good at all"}
{"text":"Poor service . The servers can't see you waiting at the entry for a table. No greeting.

I've been there 4 times and same every time.

Food is blah, they don't use fresh blueberries in the pancakes, but a syrup mixture. Service for food is slow, sloppy presentation of food . 

Restaurant only has one server at night. The place is brightly lit inside and harsh for dining pleasure.

Expect loud unruly families here. Just be sure not to sit in a table after they leave because families are filthy Slobs, with crumbs and greasy food everywhere, on chairs, booths . Babies often sitting on tables , diapered and barefoot.

Being a cheap joint in a suburban setting lures families who are cheap and want their kids to eat quasi junk food"}
{"text":"I challenge you to find me anything that hits the spot more than a Migas with chorizo and tabasco sauce at IHOP at 3:15 in the morning after a drunken Friday night out."}
{"text":"Not sure if I came on the wrong day, but my experience wasn't as pleasant compared to the other reviewers. I'll make this quick and painless. My pancakes came out cold. I sent them back, and received a fresh stack. There was a shortage on coffee, so my sister had to wait for more to be brewed. I ordered ice coffee, but couldn't get a refill because they ran out. The server was friendly, but overwhelmed. The taste of the food was on par with all other Ihops that I have dined."}
{"text":"It for sure is Dennys-ish with a better selection of syrups. However, no one can topple the Grand Slam! How many nights I was totally jacked and the G.S. saves my rear...

Food was properly prepared and the fruit was fresh. My server \"Marko\" was very efficient and oozes customer service. Restaurant was clean and enjoyable..."}
{"text":"A little slow on Sundays (predictably so), but the food is great and the service, typically, is top-notch. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"We pop in here sometimes because it is so close to the house but this particular visit makes me rethink that plan. While there was no wait to be seated around noon on a Sunday, the service was less than stellar. It took 5-10 minutes for the waitress to ask for our drink order and another 5-10 to bring two ice teas. We ordered our food right when she took our drink order but that took another 10 minutes to come after our drinks arrived. And we had to ask for a second place setting. Attention to service goes a long way but this visit missed the mark in several areas. 

We ordered the big steak omelette and Tuscan scramble. Both come with fluffy pancakes. 

However, when I went to use the butter pecan syrup, it was in fact filled half way with butter pecan and the other half with boysenberry syrup! When I flagged the waitress she held it up to the light and the demarcation line was so clear. There was a quick apology but I should have known it would take another 5 minutes to bring back another syrup. And be careful if you use tobasco! The plastic regulator in the tobasco sauce was missing so it literally poured out all over my eggs. 

Our drinks were often empty and she asked every time if we wanted more. Every time she approached the table she apologized for how long it took for things to arrive but this particular visit it was the wait staff making the visit so painful. Despite the service and other issues, the food was fantastic; crisp hash browns, melted cheese, and fresh veggies."}
{"text":"One thing I should have remembered, dining out alone is a PITA. It was easy enough to get a table, should be for one, even on a busy Sunday morning. Waitress came over, as obliged, took my order, asked me if I wanted ketchup or hot sauce for the hash browns, had to come back to ask me again and then, the little conveyance comes out and has ketchup and hot sauce on it anyway so why ask?

Ordered the simple combo plate with buttermilk pancakes. When product came out, pancakes were lukewarm, at best and falling apart. Not as if in a flaky nummy way, as in a pre-made microwaved sort've way. Eggs, bacon and hash browns were fine and at least warm to hot. 

The lack of joy from eating alone is that you are some sort of pariah to the people working. \"Oh, I have to waste a table on one person\", \"Oh surely they'll be quick about it so don't come ask them if they want anything else so that they will leave quicker.\" And that is what this experience was like. Mr. Orange shirt manager went around to each table, save mine, to ask how their meal was. You see, if you eat alone, they don't really care for you. Well, Mr. Orange shirt manager. You may not care, but there are other places to tell people that you don't care thanks to the internet. Get your collective customer service arses together and make dining a better experience for even single diners. You never know why they are eating alone so don't presume. (finally, prices are ridiculous, 1.99 for coffee? You get a pot but I didn't drink a pot so don't charge me for the whole damned thing and if you offer something like this for 3.99 during the week, you're damned fools, to pay for it at the regular price of 6.99 or whatever on weekends). Obviously IHOP does not need to sell it at that price but I was hungry, it was Sunday and I used to like IHOP. I shall turn myself away next time."}
{"text":"We were staying in Las Vegas and were craving pancakes. Our intentions were to go go Denny's but we found this IHOP first so we decided to give it a shot. Boy was that something we regretted! After waiting about 20 minutes or so, we were seated. We had a very unenthusiastic server who absolutely hated her job. She didn't want to be there and was very unhappy to grab things for us when we asked. The pancakes tasted like biscuits. I got a vanilla iced coffee and it tasted like spoil milk! Gross!!! I requested 2 high chairs which never came til I had to ask again for at least 1. Definitely a mistake coming here! I won't be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I eat at IHOP, especially after reading so many reviews of great breakfast places in the Scottsdale area. 

I will try a local place tomorrow and leave this review alone.

Ewww to IHOP."}
{"text":"First, this location is always packed at prime breakfast hours so be warned. BUT, the service is great and the staff are cheerful and fast. They have a way of getting people in and out without making people feel rushed. The food is A+ as far as iHOP's are concerned. Our waitress was a hard worker and very kind.

Recommend if you do not mind a bit of a wait and crowds. Once you sit down, things settle down."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited IHOP tonight because that is where he wanted to go for his birthday.  It was 6pm and the place was almost empty. 

We ordered and got our drinks.  We were seated in the middle section where you could see the food prep area.  I looked up and saw our waiter standing on the counter where the prepared plates are put for the garnishes to be added.  He was walking, with his shoes on, back and forth cleaning the wall tiles above where the take out trays are kept.  This turned my stomach.  My husband walked up to the kitchen and told the waiter (Tyler) that he shouldn't be walking across the counter.  Tyler told him he would wipe it down when he was done.  He wiped it down with a wad of dry paper towels.  I could only pick at my meal.  Before we left a woman, not dressed in the IHOP uniform, came into the dining area with a bucket of water with enough bleach in it to burn your nose.  

Do Not Eat Here!!!!  There's no telling what you might find on or in your food."}
{"text":"Worse food worse service by old waiter with absolutely no personality. He was either a mad Mexican or bitter Arab..no smile no manners. Weird old goat.wouldnt accept coupon on phone and I still left him a $4.00 tip...never going back...Luke warm food and Everything is over $9.00 when did eggs become so frigging expensive ???"}
{"text":"what is wrong with you people, horrible horrible service luke-warm food, innattentive staff, understaffed, very expensive. never again.  you people must not be used to anything nice at all.never again, although all employees were still polite and smiled."}
{"text":"The egg white and vegetable omelet was very good and loaded with vegetables. Although, unfortunately the fruit on the side did not taste fresh. Our server Alex was friendly and attentive making breakfast with my family an enjoyable experience. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Waited over 1/2 hour from the time our order was taken until we saw a server again.  Finally got food after complaining, but my daughter's pancakes were cold.  No one offered to refill our drinks.  And the restaurant was not that busy.  I was told that when they get orders from Uber Eats, those orders go to the head of the line and the orders of customers in the restaurant get delayed.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"The best thing about going to IHOP is that you know what you are going to get and it's good!

I'm not going to lie, every time I come to IHOP its to get breakfast! Breakfast 24/7! 
Everything I've had has been great. By far my favorite thing is pancakes! My wife loves the biscuits and gravy. You really can't go wrong with IHOP. At this location I've always had great and friendly service, no matter what time of day I come in."}
{"text":"Always great service when I go to this location and better food than a few of the other ihops around the valley. Breakfast is always good, especially the pancakes and French toast.. also would recommend their chicken quesadillas"}
{"text":"This IHOP always accomodates our austistic boys without an attitude.  It's a great comfortable place. It's not fancy and you don't have to whisper."}
{"text":"IHOP definitely fills the need for breakfast food in a jiffy. But to say that it's good breakfast food is a hit or miss. 

This location is busy on Sunday mornings. I'm sure it's busy at all IHOPs on Sunday mornings, but it was especially cramped here. Not too bad of a wait - about 5 minutes. We were seated at a small two-seater booth an arm's length away from a table of eight. One of the members at this table was a screaming baby and his screaming kid older sister. The mum of the screaming tyrannical kids was completely ignorant while she chowed down on her food. Cue the migraine headache. 

Can't ding IHOP for the screaming kids. But I can ding them on their food and their service. My mom and I both ordered whole wheat pancakes with blueberries that came with scrambled egg white substitute and turkey bacon. She says that was decent. I ordered the Split Decision plate. Two buttermilk pancakes, 2 French toast triangles, 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon and 2 sausages for about $10. Simple, right? Can't mess this up too much here. Except they did. My breakfast plate came with a tub of butter right on top of my pancakes and french toast (or should I say my butter came with a side of breakfast?). I tried scooping the butter off to the side of my plate, except it melted onto my eggs and my bacon. Mmm. Bacon and butter - the ultimate greasy delight...not. 

Service was a joke. Our two-seater booth was very small. No biggie if there isn't anything else on our table. We didn't order coffee, but the coffee pot and the dish of creamer stayed on the table. I thought a server would be mindful enough to take that stuff away. Nope. It stayed until I flagged someone down to take those away so my mom and I could have some arm room to eat. 

I've been to this location a few times during late nights. Breakfast at 10 PM here is much better than breakfast at 10 AM. No questions asked."}
{"text":"It's about what you would expect from an IHOP these days.  Just feels like they are a decade or two behind on their customer service, decor etc.  food was pretty good.  Very slow as I expected.  All in all its wasn't a bad experience but didn't leave me wanting to ever come back."}
{"text":"The service was ok. Host took his sweet time coming to us at the front, even though they were lot busy at all. Our waitress was attentive for the most part. However, the food was a mix of bad and \"whatever\" for me. The appetizer sampler we all shared was good. Everything seemed fresh and tasted how id expected. However my main course and dessert were not to standard. While my chorizo omelette was a lot bigger than pictured in the menu, the spice was completely missing from the dish. Instead the sausage tasted supremely over seasoned, so salty that i barely touched it. My strawberry and creme crepe was not cooked right. It tasted like a slightly thin pancake, rather than a papery \"melt in your mouth soft\" crepe and again was over seasoned with the strawberry glaze. It too was barely touched. Overall, not a good dining experience."}
{"text":"I know it's just IHOP, but....from the prompt greeting by a fellow named Claude, through the ordering process (via Claude again), then delivery and consumption, this was a flawlessly executed experience."}
{"text":"Standard ihop. Service here was average. Food quality was routine and our order was correct. Which is a feat once my wife modifies almost every single dish she gets from breakfast joints! Her-\" I will have the hash browns, hold the oil, potatoe, and the heating source!\" Lol nah but hats off for them getting her order right on the first attempt. Bathrooms were ki.da filthy. Only really downside to this location."}
{"text":"I have been to IHOPs all over the country and this location is pretty standard, except for one thing, Ben's exceptional customer service. I have been a fan of the sirloin tips and eggs and New York cheesecake pancakes for almost a decade. That's my go-to order every time I visit. Lately we've been ordering out about once a week for breakfast and I get the same thing every time. Most of the time everything is great and I'm completely satisfied. Unfortunately a few days ago things fell drastically short. Our food was not up to the standard that we were used to, actually it was pretty sub par. Because it was so out of the ordinary we decided to call and just let management know of the decline. At that point Ben offered to replace our meal, great! This morning we put in for our replacement meal and I think they may have set the bar too high. Everything was amazing and Ben went above and beyond to keep our business. We will definitely continue to be regular patrons."}
{"text":"25 min after being seated, we got to place an order.  30 min later 2 of 4 plates arrived.  Pancakes had funk on them, and the french toast was burned to chared blackness.   10 min later, still no more food.  For his part, the waiter was very cool.  Looks like he is doing his best in a horrible situation    Worst ihop experience ever."}
{"text":"Omg, my friend and I have never had a worse experience at a restaurant than we did at this IHOP. Mid-week, late morning, nearly empty restaurant, so we were seated quickly. That was the only good thing that happened. We sat, and sat, and sat. The waiter (a 40-ish bald man) kept saying \"I'll be right with you\" over, and over, and over again. No menus, no water, nada. The waiter was more interested in talking and laughing with his co-workers near the kitchen. We didn't have anywhere to go, so we literally waited 30 minutes before leaving, still with no service. And as we left, he ran up to us saying \"I told you I'd be right there!\" We won't be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome  so upbeat and happy people.Eren  my server was so cool  she told me about her heritage and Christmas traditions.  The coffee was piping hot and my crepes were quick and covered with lingonberry goodness.  I'm not a chain type of guy but it's a nice staple place. Every one seems happy   give it a shot"}
{"text":"I have not been to a IHOP for at least 10 years... But sometimes I crave breakfast for dinner.  Or sometimes it just happens to be the most convenient option for food.  Well both situations (with big emphasis on convenience) is how I landed here.

Me and a friend ordered:  mozzarella sticks, steak and eggs, and Brioche banana french toast platter.  The mozzarella sticks were okay.  Not something I would order again.  Steak and eggs was another meh item.  My brioche french toast was actually good.  The eggs was decent and the hash browns were alright.  I ate all my bacon; its hard to mess up, but it wasn't burnt so I was satisfied. 

Our server was super nice.  I felt bad for him so I tipped him a bit more.  The restaurant was empty on a friday evening.  I don't frequent IHOP much, so I do not know if this was the norm, but if it is, no wonder he was all over us.

Overall, this place is a C- on my report card."}
{"text":"I'm living in the area temporarily and needless to say, the area doesn't have a huge selection of restaurants to choose from. For the past couple of days I have gone to this restaurant to eat. 

So earlier this week I ate in with my mother. The food and the service was good, so when our waitress came back to ask for the condiment caddy I didn't get irritated because she had been nice. I did feel some kind of way when she'd told us she was trying to clean our table before her shift was over because she wouldn't be able to leave. I was still cool, because I understood,besides I was finished with my meal and just drinking my beverage.

The next time I ordered my meal, it was take out. The food was spot on but the wait time was excessive.

The next time I called in my order and waited 20 mins prior to picking it up. Once again the food was prepared to my liking.

Okay last night, I go in with my mother and we order to go. There were no menus to look through so we had to ask for them. They were brought them out fairly quickly but it took a while for someone to come back to actually take our order. They seemed to be more preoccupied with the patrons arriving and departing. Finally the manager sends a young man that's in training to take our order. Let me point this out. I'm a Yelper, to be honest we all are a tiny bit anal when it comes to customer service because we care. So back to the review. I placed my order and my mothers. I actually ordered the same exact thing I'd ordered the other days. The Crispy Cobb Salad with 3 ranch dressings. Haha don't judge me. 
So when I get home. The dressings were all there, but when I opened my salad I was irritated. It was plain old messed up. It had grilled chicken not crispy and I didn't see any bacon pieces. To top it off, the grilled chicken costs more.

I knew the kid was new, and I took responsibility for not having him repeat my order, but when I called in and spoke to the manager that's when I was angry.

So I tell her my issue, and she says she remembered me and was surprised my order was incorrect because she was standing there with the new hire for most of the time. No, no! She left to seat the growing number of patrons coming through the door while he took my order. So I mention that, she rebuttals by saying I even asked a waiter and the cook! ??? Why are you asking them what I ordered! So I say he didn't repeat the order back because he had an issue with the receipt and went to get her...the manager. She didn't repeat the order back either. She gave us the receipt and we signed. Not once was the dang order repeated.

So she asks what can I do for you mam? How does a 10% discount sound, what about 20% or a side of chicken strips? I say just give me a side of chicken strips because I walked over and I'm not walking back.

So long review I know, but I am irked that the manager implied that I ordered something other than what I had. No! I'm so strict with ordering I need a therapist. Just the fact that she placed the blame on me had me heated. I have nothing to gain by making an order only to call and say it was incorrect.

I give this IHOP 2 stars. The food is fine and the customer service and wait time is fine so that averages to 2 stars in my book. Just an FYI, please don't tell a customer they ordered something else in an attempt to deflect your mistakes, take it as a reason to improve.

I will visit this location again because they owe me chicken strips haha"}
{"text":"So I used to loooove going here!  Now I go every so often and usually wonder why after Im there.  Went on Saturday night and wow...what an experience.  There was a group of teenagers there celebrating something. Now im not an old dud, I know teenagers aren't quiet and they are with friends and having a good time.  However, they were comlpletely disrespectful.  Yelling and singing and clapping so loudly that other patrons in the restaurant couldn't even hear conversations at there own tables.  Then they were actually standing up and walking over the tables while singing and cheering!  So while i understand the actions of these rude teenages is not the establishments fault, how they handled it is.  And they did nothing.  When our waitress came to out table we couldnt even hear her it was so loud and the manager just stood their and watched the show, did nothing and said nothing to them.  But as we had time to just sit and look around as we couldnt hear one another.  It reminded me of a really nice hotel that you felt special going to, then it gets super run down and no one takes care of it anymore.  As I gazed out the window to see cracker barrel and knowing we could've eaten better for cheaper just across the street.  This was the last straw.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Of course, this is not our 1st visit to an IHOP. We normally go on a bustling busy Saturday morning for breakfast fare.  This time however,  we went for dinner. The restaurant was super quiet and only 4 tables with patrons. We sat down,  waited for 5 minutes before being greeted by our waitress and placing drink orders. We perused the menu to find most of the dinner options had been removed . The options were limited. So we settled on meals that were mediocre at best.  The service was not much better. I think I will stick to breakfast only. Thats really all they have and do it consitently."}
{"text":"Just a bit of breakfast.  This is just a basic breakfast restaurant.   Not much extra can be obtained.  I do enjoy the omelets.  They are large enough for 2. Plus it comes with pancakes or toast.."}
{"text":"We drive out of our way just to eat at this I hop. We have never been to a nicer one. The staff is always friendly the service is great I wish they could train the other staff at the other I hops we have been to to be like them."}
{"text":"One server.  Food was cold.  Screaming kid.  Bad news"}
{"text":"Visited this location on Saturday May 7th at about midnight. The service wasn't good but the food was. When we walked in we told the host up front that we had a party of 9 and he rolled his eyes and said under his breath that it was going to be a long night. He was very rude and acted like we were a major inconvenience. I'm guessing he hates his job or at least that was the impression he gave. Absolutely zero personality!Once we finally got seated the waitress was nice and our food came out quickly. The restaurant seemed to be short staffed and it was prom night so I'm sure it was a bit overwhelming for the employees. I just didn't see a need for the young mans attitude."}
{"text":"Been a long time since we've eaten at this  IHOP because there are just so many options in the area that are much cheaper but our breakfast was good. Ordered the Breakfast Sampler which was eggs, toast, 2 strips of bacon, 2 pork sausage, 2 small pieces of ham and hash browns. Everything was good and arrived hot. Our server Joshua was great. However, the cashier Kaitlyn needs to work on her customer service skills or work in the back."}
{"text":"What bad service! OK, it late Sunday night, but still, I came in, sat down, and waited 15 minutes to be served. True, I had the time and space I needed to do some writing, but I did not need to wait that long for service, then again later to pay the bill. $7 for a cup of coffee and a grilled cheese? No. thanks."}
{"text":"We like to occasionally have breakfast at the IHOP on Central in Phoenix on the weekends because it's pretty close to home, and it's one of the newer IHOPs. Pretty clean inside,  We both like to order the Chicken Fajita Omelette with the wheat-grain pancakes...Very good.  I sometimes order it with all egg whites.  The poortions are are a nice size. Always feel full when we leave there.  The Good Egg just up the street...the portions are always small and I would not feel full when leaving there, and it's about the same prices as IHOP.  So, I highly suggest IHOP over The Goog Egg all the way.  So what that it's more gay at the Good Egg....These queens just don't know better!"}
{"text":"I was a typical IHOP experience. Food was decent, but we were looking for something quick before heading into downtown Glendale. The thing that set this experience above my expectations was our waiter, Michael. He was friendly without being awkward, present without being overbearing, and was able to predict our needs. His service was amazing and he was great!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location. As always, the food was great. However, the service was less than stellar. The waiters name was Ernesto and he was really creepy. He talked under his breath and he made checking in on us awkward because he kept walking away while talking to us. I just disregarded it because I didn't want it to get any weirder, but I ended up leaving him half the tip I usually leave an iHop waitperson. Also, when we first walked in, they were working on a vent towards the front door and there was cardboard and dust on the floor. That grossed me out. I gave it a high review because the food was good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is in business. We should all be writing corporate IHOP. The bacon was very strange tasting, like it had been cooked in a pan that had been sitting in dirty water. There were only two other people in the place. It smelled like an old cafeteria in the early 80s. Like cleaner and metal. Please don't go here just because it's close to your hotel. Please don't."}
{"text":"IHOP manager is solely responsible for everything under there roof. Multiple tables open, full staff and there is a wait Really!  Two hosts standing when one could be busting tables. The manager has absolutely no clue how to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"As with most IHOP locations, it was so cold inside. After the hostess seated us, our server, Efrain, quickly found us another table in a much warmer location. He definitely made what could have been a really bad experience, very enjoyable. Thank you Efrain!!!"}
{"text":"Only thing good about our visit was the service. Our server was a sweet young lady (Kathryn)... that's where it stops. The place was packed as a Sunday morning would be, and it was filthy, we finally get seated and the kid sitting a table over puked everywhere. It took a good 10 minutes for someone to clean it up. It took another half hour to get our food, my coffee was cold by the time it came. We sent our waters back 4 times because  3 out of 4 times things were floating in it,  (A fly in one) and the last time there was lipstick on one of the glasses,  no one in out party was wearing  any. Food was just ok... nothing special. We just couldn't wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"1h 45min waiting time. nobody says anything nobody offered a drink or anything to make the stay sweeter. The worst service I had in a fast casual concept so far."}
{"text":"Overall experience. The service was the best ever, our server Yamal was always smiling and worried about giving us a great customer service. The food was delicious, and on point, so fast and that was great because I was so hungry. I definitely will come back to this place. The price is good for what you receive. And finally, I need to talk once again about our server, my husband and I had a hard day at work today, but the server was a reminder for us, it's all about attitude :)"}
{"text":"Colorado omelet, very good but too spendy for what you get, restaurant seemed clean though,"}
{"text":"Well for starters we have been dining at this location for 20 plus years. Recently one of the associates is wearing way too much perfume. We address this with management a few months ago said they would take care of it. My wife is allergic to heavy perfume smell and can't breathe. Today we went in same associate heavy perfume same manager. Told us we were the only ones that complained about it. Does that mean that our business does not count to him. If so okay we will not be back thank you. That's a real bummer because we do have some very favorite waiters and waitresses at this location. As a manager myself I would not have handled the situation in this manner."}
{"text":"Sat down to find food on the bench seat and jelly on the napkin rolled silverware. Meal was served on a dirty plate (dried crusty food on plate) and new silverware had food stuck to it. Horribly filthy restaurant.

They also let a smelly homeless woman roam the restaurant."}
{"text":"the portions here are a joke. i usually order the straweberry crepes with bacon and sausage. was like a very small hashbrown crap was like a 3 bite. my kids eggs was like a spoonfull. ask the waitress what happened and brought out more eggs after i had to talk to manager. said was portions. i have had better protions here and better food sorry you lost my buisness. and only 2 other tables took 20 minutes for pancakes pathetic. left small tip shouldnt have left that.  NEVER TO RETURN"}
{"text":"Wish I could have reviewed the food. They never bother to seat me. Sat and waited 10 minutes. Watched a couple waiters come out and go to tables, look at me then walk to the back.
Never again."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast but there was soooooo much sugar in the iced coffee! We felt like we were actually hallucinating! Ordered a waffle with bananas and pecans, was disappointed to find out the pecans are also covered in sugar. Seriously, sugar everywhere.."}
{"text":"The oatmeal was awesome! Sliced bananas, butter, brown sugar. Perfect fuel for Vegas! Waitress was friendly and nice. They even let my forgetful bf plug in his phone to charge at the front desk. Did I mention he's forgetful? Five stars but just as I was going to the women's room they closed it off with a big bar for cleaning. Clean is good but dang, bad timing lolol

The manager messaged me the next day to thank me for my visit. It might be an auto responder but kudos for the great customer service!"}
{"text":"I gave them 3 Stars because it just opened and the customer service was great. The service was proficient and friendly...my main concern was the cleanliness. I don't understand how a new establishment could be so filthy. I arrived at 8am...the entry glass doors had finger prints and whatever else on them. Do they not wipe the glass doors before opening. So we get seated and out table had dried food on top. The glass that our water came in was stained with dried food as well. I didn't use the restroom because I was too nervous that it would gross me out. We requested new waters. Our waitress and other staff members were very friendly and professional. Overall...I think this IHOP has potential but they just need to clean better and move a little faster."}
{"text":"Our food took forever and the place was empty. As the kitchen door would open, you could see the manager socializing with 3-4 employees. Incorrect orders came and by the time they sorted it out, some of us were finished and some were just starting. A poor manager will influence even the best of employees to be lazy. Even with village inn next door, an IHOP could do well.... but not if they continue on with this service."}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh for the weekend and on our way home stopped at iHop. 
Erika was our server and she was great. We ordered the crepes, French toast & eggs. The food was awesome."}
{"text":"I was kind of surprised it opened so near the new Village Inn, but my kids like the pancakes here much better and like to come for dinner pancakes. Manager is nice and always seems to be visible."}
{"text":"Normally I hop is a quick go to when there are not other breakfast places around. You can get a standard breakfast and be on your way. Not today!  they forgot our food and then they did even try and rush it. All of the people who came after us or there food and continued to. We got up and paid hoping they would speed up the food since they had told us they were sorry and it was coming out....  it still took another 15 minutes after we paid. Then to top it off they barely served us any food and got the order wrong. We only ordered a meal and a kids meal. What a joke!"}
{"text":"Grate place new on my watch. I would come back agian. Good place be shore to come with friends."}
{"text":"I know they're trying to push the burgers--and the ones I saw sure did look good, but the pancakes still can't be beat"}
{"text":"Fuck This place needs to be closed down!! The waiter took forever to seat us & not only that but once we ordered our food they took 40 min to get there & to top it off my chicken was raw so disgusting I just lost all my appetite never ever ever going back to this shitty ass place again!!!"}
{"text":"We eventually got our food, it was delicious. The waitress didn't charge for our drinks, and did apologize again. The host told us about additional military specials they do. Overall, we are still abundantly disappointed; if only because she didn't come out right away to tell us she had lost her sheet and didn't have our order."}
{"text":"To start with there was a cockroach under the table where we were seated. We just stood up and changed our table and my wife experienced something crawling on her foot realized that it was a cockroach again so we asked the server she got us seated on a distant table then ... We would have left the place then but since it was 3am and we have to be somewhere so we ordered simple and fit omlette, waffle and milk shake. 
First omlette we got literally had water dripping from it we asked the server why its so watery she said do u want it well done we said YES PLEASE. So she got us another omlette which was not watery atleast but was tasteless ... Horrible experience wont be going back to iHOP ever ... There are many local chains like babystack cafe, egg works and cracked egg which are way cleaner and tastes better as well .... Stay away from iHOP guysss"}
{"text":"My daugther and I went here recently and received horrible service. There was not alot of people there but we had long wait time. The food was not good. The waitress asked if I wanted a refill but never came back until we were about to leave.  Staff from management on down do not know what they are doing. They are very unorganized.  I don't recommend  this location."}
{"text":"Not worth the old crabby waitress or the 45 minute wait for our food and food that's on the menu the never have! Last time ill ever eat at this location"}
{"text":"We have been to this location more than 5 times.  The food is always extremely satisfying, and very delicious however the service is what keeps us coming back.  We have had several different waiters who have all been a true delight. The last visit was on a busy Sunday,  waited less than 10 minutes, Victor was our waiter and did not disappoint. They were very busy and the food came out fast and Victor was so pleasant and checked on us many times.  Thank you ihop for the tasty food and thank you even more to Victor and all the helpful staff there for a great experience."}
{"text":"IHOP is good comfort food. This location is brand new and clean with nice staff. Have been here 3 times and the service is average  to good. The food is always tasty. A great place for breakfast any time of day."}
{"text":"The food was really good, the service was good, and its really close to where I live, ill be back :)"}
{"text":"First my menu was so dirty !  Then my pancakes were so cold and the butter did not melt :(  Long wait for someone to take our order and then people who order their food after us, got their food first !"}
{"text":"Long wait times, when we received our food my stuffed French toast was ROCK hard & cold. Couldn't even cut through it. My fathers meal had hair in it and didn't notice until he was almost finished. Service was subpar. I am a streetsboro resident and was super excited for this place to open but I will NOT return."}
{"text":"Please stop coming here, wait to be seated 30mins then wait 15mins for our drinks then wait for 40mins for our food overall took 1hr & 25mins before  we even eat, so if you think you're in and out,  wrong spot ... server is slow.. whoever there chef is slow.. better off somewhere take you business elsewhere, I love IHOP but not this one..."}
{"text":"I went to this local IHOP with my mates with the intention of getting a thicc stack of pancakes. After some consideration I decided to broaden my horizon and go with the waffle. it was a risky decision, I know. I mean they don't call it the International House of Pancakes for nothing right? But I am a bold person and bold people do bold things. So I took the chance and ordered the waffle, and I'll tell you what... that waffle was everything I hoped it would be. I was AMAZED to say the least! 10 out of 10 would waffle again. I even tweeted at the IHOP twitter account and asked them how many retweets I would need to get for them to change their name to IHOW. I'm still waiting for them to respond but it would honestly be in their best interest. I mean those things are THICC my dude. Also, the night manager on duty was top notch. We asked to sit in the non smoking section and he told us not to worry because the entire restaurant is a non smoking section. I was amazed. He made sure nobody smoked a single cigarette just for us. I mean, if that ain't service I don't know what is. Thank you IHOP."}
{"text":"I have no complaints on food or service. First time in an IHOP for me. We were seating quickly. Helped immediately. Waitress was extremely friendly, tables were clean, food came quick and was delicious. Price was was great for what you got. My drink was never empty. Only room for improvement is maybe the restrooms. On the dirtier side and smelly."}
{"text":"This place has the worst cooks I have tried this place five times since they opened and every time the food sucks cold eggs over cook hashbrowns can't even make a damn pancake
On the other hand the waitresses very nice but I come here for the food"}
{"text":"This IHOP has the best service I've ever been to this man named Jason is the best server I've ever seen he's been here since 8:30 last night and he's not off till 5! A 20hr shift that's amazing I applaud him so much and how he's taking care of my table it's just An amazing feeling to see how he's still smiling and helping customers with the joy! I recommend having him here and he Deserves a raise! Take this man places! - triz"}
{"text":"after asking for my salad and drinks that were included with my takeout order that wasn't presented right away I appreciated the waitress, Destiny, for understanding my uncomfortableness for returning to ihop for my drinks. So she accommodated me with a drink. By the way, it tastes like these new burgers' buns was dipped in waffle butter for it's delicious outcome."}
{"text":"Service was horrible! Only 1 server, he was trying his best but really rude. He had trouble with hearing and he told us to speak at him so he could hear. When we were trying to talk to him in respectful manner and loud just to make sure he could hear us He was very direct and super rude to each person at our table. Every time we come to this Ihop, they are rude. I won't be returning to this location. I'm rating 1 star because food was okay but definitely not worth the constant disrespect. \"Customer Service\" is something they need to train each employee on BIG TIME.

Ohhh also, when we were walking out we had asked him if there was a manager on duty.. he told us he was the manager so we then told him oh well survive could of been better, he then replied with \"FEAR ENOUGH\" just rude and very unprofessional."}
{"text":"I don't expect a lot from IHOP, just decent food, an attentive server, and decent coffee.  In all fairness, the food was not awful.  The eggs I ordered were prepared the way I ordered them, and the items that we ordered were correct.  Aside from the burnt coffee, the food was fine.  Nothing to be excited about, but nothing horrifying.  

The service on the other hand was deplorable.  we arrived before 7am, and there was on person in front of us in line.  The restaurant was visibly almost empty, yet there was nobody to seat us, although I could see people milling around inside the restaurant.  Eventually one of them came and asked if we'd been seated.  Seriously, if we had been seated would all of us had still been standing by the front door?  When we stated that we had not, we were told that someone would be with us in a minute, and she walked away.  

Eventually we were seated, given coffee and menus, and the waitress disappeared...poof.  After waiting several minutes, she reappeared to take our orders, and was again gone until the food came out.  While we were waiting however, we did see the person that told us that someone would be with us in a minute a the door...she was a server also, but apparently could not be bothered to seat us.

After we finished our food, we again had to wait, as the waitress was nowhere to be found, just to ask for the check.  When the check was finally brought to our table, you guessed it, more waiting.  Between waiting to be seated, and waiting to pay, more time was spend waiting than actually eating the meal.  So, although the food was palatable, the service level was completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Worst IHOP. Warning this is another novel like many of my reviews. There's a part TWO is in the photos 

Hey man if you like waiting...come on down to this IHOP!
If you like being served burnt food... come here boo
If you like being charged $40 for a $20 dollar tab...I'll save you a seat (:

Came with my boyfriend on Sunday at 9:45pm-10:00pm. I feel like people who take this job feel like \"pshh no ones gunna come to this 24/7 restaurant. I'm gunna be able to chiiiil\" 

The amount of costumers was pretty normal and a bunch of the servers were walking around in normal clothes. It started to get busy when were finishing up. 

I ordered the appetizer sample and my boyfriend got quesadillas and a side of grits (lmao I know weird ass combo). Our sever I'll call her Bambi takes our orders and then we wait, now that I think about it, it did take a long time to get our order but we were weren't paying attention cuz we were so hungry. 

I got the sampler: my mozzarella sticks & some of my onion rings were burnt & hard. I know Cuz I was like \"comeee on just give them a chance Kaitlan maybe they're not that bad\" (to myself) I bite into one & it was so hard the whole IHOP shook. Just playing but they were pretty hard, it scrapped the top of my mouth...you know when hard toasted food like scrapes/rips off the layer of your top gums and your skin comes off? Maybe that's just me. Anywaysss, my boyfriend didn't get his grits yet & neither of us got any dipping sauce. No ranch no marinara sauce just the sour cream and salsa for his quesadillas. So we patiently waited for those to come which never did. Our food was only warm upon arrival & since we waited to speak to her again it was getting pretty cold fast.

We thought \"oh Bambi's prolly busy\" which she did SEEM like it...I saw her sprint to the front register. She was talking to like 3 other servers doing something with like receipts. Then she was CHIIIIILIN bro. Bambi bent over, put her elbows on the counter and her chin in her hands straight day dreaming! Mind you my boyfriend still didn't have his grits. So I wait a few mins I thought \"ohh like Bambi's prolly tired or having a bad day\" so I was chillin too. 

We waited & waited Then I was like okay...I don't think she's gunna move so I raised my hand to try & get her attention. it was like she was looking right past me lmao she was hard core thinking bout something. So I start waving my hand at Bambi, she sees me and comes over. I say
\"Hey did you get the grits order in, also my mozzarella sticks and onion rings were burnt could you replace these & can you also bring us two ranches?\" She responded \"yeahh the grits are coming right up and okay sounds good\" 

So we wait some more, she comes out FAST with cold grits one ranch and two salsas. Me and my boyfriend start laughing so hard cuz we're like when did we ask for two salsas?? hahaha and the cold grits basically told me that they'd been cooked a long time ago and they were just sitting there waiting to be served. 

So now I'm just waiting for my replacement food & Im sure they don't take long to cook at all. But a while passes and I still don't have them or the two ranches so I wait to flag her ass down again lmao, I say \"hey you didn't forget the mozzarella sticks did you?\" Bambi looks at me with her big doe eyes saying \"oh no they're making them right now\" she goes straight to the kitchen. I say to my boyfriend \"I swear if she brings them out in like two seconds that means they just been sitting there like your grits were\". He bursts out laughing because sure nuff there's Bambi beside me with the mozzarella sticks and ONE ranch. AND the mozzarella sticks were deff just sitting there cuz they were warm not HOT and steamy haha. 
 We ate our lukewarm food and a different server asked how everything was as Bambi frolicked in regular clothes (non ihop attire) out the door. Then literally sprinted back inside still in her regular clothes. We asked the new server for boxes and our check."}
{"text":"IHOP is one of my favorite places for breakfast. This location seems to always get you seated quick when there's a wait. I have never had any problems or issues when I come here. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to this IHOP! People are friendly and the customers are not ghetto or inappropriate!"}
{"text":"It's iHop, what can you really say? Delicous buttermilk pancakes and all sorts of fatty crappy breakfast foods yhou know you shouldn't eat but do anyway. On the plus side they do now have some fit menu items for under 600 calories that are quite good."}
{"text":"Ben was a really great server! Will come back! Don't expect much for late nights but it was great!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to IHOP in years, my loss! Great food, clean restaurant and awesome service! Our waiter, Edgar, management and all staff were awesome and definitely on their game! Kudos!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here, great service, friendly staff. They even do special menu items to cater to my diet as a diabetic. Love it here every time!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dinner since it was right across the street from my hotel. Was greeted and seated promptly. I had been craving some french toast, so I was hoping this was the trick. My food came out within five minutes, although it was an off peak time. Nonetheless, everything was cooked correctly and tasted good. Will probably stop in here again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I have had the worst experience at this restaurant. They let my 9 year son order a 14 dollar steak without confirming the order with the table. My son pointed at a picture next to the steak and she put in a order for a steak. Which my son looked at it and said this is not what I ordered. Then we were told we cannot change the order on steak orders. So we ended up with a crappy steak. The egg orders were wrong and it took 25 my minutes for two orders of over easy eges which we did not get till after we were done eating. Every condiment we were given was out and we had to keep asking for a new bottle which was just about empty. It was packed and everything we asked for felt like 5 min before we got it. I did not like my service at all. Top it off their women's restroom was out of order."}
{"text":"It's a good place to try out, but I've never been wowed by it, but that can be because I pretty much don't like any conventional \"breakfast foods\" except for bacon.   Oh, their home fries are terrific! It's shredded potatoes, but chunks.  I always get it extra well done so there's a crisp to it that I can't resist!  I do like their pancakes, but only in moderation (because of this illogical aversion to breakfast foods).   The banana fosters was pretty tasty, but super sugary.  I would recommend getting the sauce on the side so you can have it as sweet as you'd like without drenching the toasts.  I would recommend this place, but I don't think I'd label myself as  \"Yay! I'm a fan.\""}
{"text":"Not the best place to dine at. Considering it's summer and it's 115 degrees out you would figure they'd invest in a good AC unit.... it was so hot in there. 

When we walked in it seemed like the hostess was saying by to her family who was dining there before we got there so we weren't even acknowledged until all her family finally left like 10 min later. Then we got seated accept the hostess failed to give us our menus or even make sure that the table had been bussed before we sat down. We had no napkins or utensils to eat with.

Our server came up greeted us and brought us our menus. First things first, we asked for waters because we were cooking in there from all the heat. So we ordered our drinks and waters he said he would be right back but he didn't return for another 15-20 min it seemed. Another table across from us that had been seated after us already had gotten their drinks and orders taken before us. Very annoying.

Finally, he brought us our waters and drinks and took our orders. At this point my ass is sticking to the seats (excuse my language). We wait once again for like another 20 min and our food all comes out at different times and we realize that we still have no utensils to eat with and our server walked off so fast that we couldn't ask him. Ohhh the frustration. So my friend walks up to the front to ask for more water, utensils, napkins, sauces etc. 

I don't even want to talk about the bill. It was as if we had to go out of our way to pay for it. No sense of urgency on bringing it to us or collecting it from us. We straight walked to the front and paid for it there bc we really had to go. Seemed to me that they had no sense of order and some sort of confusion back in the kitchen. They really should fix it because I don't even know how they are still in business. I won't be back."}
{"text":"So I don't normally expect a lot when eating at IHOP, but this one isn't that bad! And it's actually quite a busy location. I made the mistake of going here to eat during spring training season - it was insanely packed and we waited quite a while to be seated. However, once we were at our table the service was good and so was the food. This IHOP is open 24 hours, which may be good to know in case I get a midnight pancake craving."}
{"text":"For some unexplained reason, I was really hungry and just had to stop by the nearest place to eat. I haven't been to an IHOP in almost ten years so I figured, why not? I really wanted pancakes since it IS the International House of Pancakes, but it was close to dinner time and wanted something really filling.

I'm not sure if this location is new, but it sure looks like it the way everything was kept and clean. Everyone was really nice - from the host to the server. I ordered the pot roast sandwich which ended up being a really good choice, however I wasn't a fan of their french vanilla coffee. But all in all, I left full and my hunger was appeased."}
{"text":"The food was good and our service was great. My son fell and scraped his knee outside the restaurant and the manager Denise cleaned him up gave him a bandaid and gave him chocolate chips with his pancakes! She was sooo sweet and the waitress kim was awesome too. I would totally go back and gladly wait to eat because the service was so wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Great variety! Wonderful servers! Kids LOVE it! We come here often and absolutely love it.  So many family favorites. I've been enjoying Ihop food since I was little and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Much improved since the last time!  Great job!  Everything cooked correctly staff very pleasant and helpful.  Even though busy Sunday morning, they move you to a table pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Would give Zero stars if it was an option. We were sat right away but it took forever to get our drink order in. When we finally got our drinks, we hurried and ordered. We wound up waiting an hour for our food. Two different parties came in after us and were sat, they ordered, got their food and ate before our food even came out. We weren't offered refills on our drinks as we waited and the waitress avoided us till the food came out. We usually don't come to this location for this reason (this isn't the first time this has happened at this location), but figured they are just busy on the weekends. Today we came on a week day and same service. We will not be returning. Oh and as the bus boys were cleaning up a table behind us, they were messing around with each other and splashed milk all over my husband's clothes and hat."}
{"text":"I think you get exactly what you expect here.  The food tastes exactly as described on the menu no weird extra ingredients or what nots.  I appreciate that!  One of my often favorites is the chicken and waffles as listed. And the crepes Florentine - very tasty.  Recently I had the steak omelette and brioche French toast, maybe I was hungry, but I swear it tasted absolutely perfectly amazing.  Maybe that is what happens when you order what you want.  :)  
The new redshirts / uniforms are very sharp!  I think it could be kept cleaner, please.  :)"}
{"text":"Service is terrible at this location. My kids and I have been here an hour and we're still waiting on our food. It was 25 minutes before we got our drinks and an additional 10 minutes for our straws. It would be different if they were busy but there not. This is the last time I come to this location."}
{"text":"Arrived and was seated at 10:50am, greeted and ordered drinks by 10:53, 10:57 ordered 2x2x2 with an extra pancake. 11:15 told food would be right out, 11:30 still no food. Asked for manager and no manager ever came. Got up and walked out at 11:37. This place is ridiculous. Save your time go to Denny's."}
{"text":"Breakfast this morning was a good one
Liz was great as our server 
Not only was she nice and friendly
But she was also very prompt and made sure that we were taken care of
She got me coffee when I needed it
And made sure the food was to my liking
Even though there was such a big crowd
She always managed to check on me
The food itself was alright
Breakfast isn't a meal that I'm very critical on simply because I'm rarely up early enough to have it :)"}
{"text":"The service here is hit or miss. Usually a miss. For instance, right now, we are the only ones in the entire restaurant. Not sure why our server went MIA. He finally  came back with our check, but I needed a box and my kids wanted a dessert. He made it a point to tell me he would have to reprint my receipt. Cool. That's your job. Then the sundaes csme with no spoons!!Another time we came here late night and the only person we could see was the cook. We ended up leaving because no one ever appeared to seat us. The food is usually good...if you can get someone to take your order and actually serve it to you. Very inconsistent."}
{"text":"We arrived in town and we were hungry and staying at the stratosphere.  Our meal at IHOP was awesome.  The steak was delicious and tender.  Pancakes of course we're awesome.  Fantastic customer service  given by Caesar.  He was great and very courteous.  Wish there were more waiters like him."}
{"text":"Ridiculous. I called in an order at 10:28 pm (two items, an omelet and an eggs benedict). I was told my order would be ready in 10-20 minutes. I waited until 11:00 pm before I was informed \"we've been out of spinach for an hour, are you ok with us making it without the spinach?\" I gawked at the cashier when she told me this. I asked if they've been holding off on making anything while they waited to see what my answer was? She said yes. In the meantime I had watched her ring out person after person before she broke the news to me. It's ridiculous to think you can treat a customer this way."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of occasionally getting breakfast for dinner, and IHOP would seem to be a great place to go for that.  Unfortunately, this restaurant doesn't have a lot going for it.  For one, once you walk in, you'll immediately be hit with this bleach-like smell.  The smell is even worse if you visit near closing time, where it permeates the entire restaurant.  I'm all for cleanliness, but it's less good when it effects the dining experience and makes you want to throw up,  On the plus side, if you do throw up, I suppose they have plenty of bleach cleaner to mop it up and mask the smell.  Ugh.

Second, the iced tea is terrible.  I brought the issue up with them once:  They brew the iced tea in their coffee maker so--surprise, surprise--it tastes like coffee.

As for the food, one would expect the International House of Pancakes to have better pancakes.  They're a little bit fluffy, but definitely on the small side compared to the plate-sized pancakes you'll get at just about any other breakfast restaurant.  The selection of syrups--strawberry, pecan, blueberry, and maple--at every table is a nice try, but none of the syrups are particularly tasty.  I made the mistake on one visit of getting bowl of minestrone soup.  Not only did they screw-up the timing of the order (Protip: Soups tend to come out before the main meal, not along with it.), but the soup was watered down and grossly lacking in any taste.  A supermarket can of Progresso minestrone would be a substantial improvement.

There really is no reason to go to this IHOP.  If you're looking for some breakfast, you'd be better off finding a Denny's (ouch!) or going to the Bob Evans a little bit west on Detroit Road.  Hell, if you actually find yourself in the IHOP parking lot, just go to the Panera Bread across the way."}
{"text":"As far as IHOPs in the area goes, this one is one of the better ones. Seriously, I don't understand all the hate on this location.

Restaurant was clean and the staff friendly. The booth we were seated in had duct tape on the seats, so there's that. 

Food came out in a timely manner, was made correctly, and was pretty good. Wife wanted to try the new mango tea, but that was a no go as they were out of the syrup (two days after it premiers?).

Not the greatest experience, but certainly not as bad as other reviewers have noted."}
{"text":"Came in on a weekend (big mistake). The service was friendly, but still ungodly slow. Waited close to an hour for food and the restaurant was at about 50% capacity. How has this not improved after two years???

Food was fairly unmemorable, but cooked well. Place could use a major cleaning as it was dusty/sticky everywhere and the floors were slippery."}
{"text":"No one to greet you at the front and we stood there about 5-10 min waiting to be seated. Food was decent.. just like any other ihop. Service was just extremely slow. I went on a Sunday evening and there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. Think I'll just stick with the one on Independence from now on!"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst breakfast place I have ever been to. Food was absolutely horrible. Ordered French toast and my children had waffles. Both were extremely dry and came out cold. I realize it was a Sunday morning and they were extremely busy, however, that should not affect my service.was nearly impossible to flag down our server to let them know about our food and when she did come by she just dropped off the check. Extremely dissatisfied with everything about this place. Honestly for the price you pay for the food here you are better off going to a nice breakfast cafe in the area because it is not inexpensive like it used to be."}
{"text":"For the last few months I have noticed a sewage smell in the restaurant and it's really off-putting. I went so far as to ask a server there and she said something along the lines of that there's a sewage treatment something or another underground and they can't do anything about the smell. The smell is even worse in that bathroom! It's hard to enjoy your average IHOP meal while smelling sewage."}
{"text":"I stopped in late in the evening.  My waitress was attentive and super nice.  She forgot to order avocado for my omelet and felt so badly that she comped my pancakes.  You don't find customer service like that too often.  The restaurant was clean.  Service was quick.  My food was tasty (FIT vegetable omelet with pancakes) and a good value."}
{"text":"Just walked out of this place on my amazing Christmas Day start. Walked in with my wife at about 11:30 am, the place didn't look full. It was busy, but we decided to give it a wait. I have been here for roughly about 10 times before this last visit that will be my last. His name was Chase. I hate to write any review and mention names. It's just not what I enjoy. But wow was Chase a mess. First of all he was definitely annoyed by something, and I get it, It's Christmas. Second he was throwing these crazyyyy time frames at everyone including us. He would tell people that an hr. wait was to be expected. It was only 3 parties waiting. Third of all, he doesn't deal with customer concerns very nicely, several people had asked him why he was sitting larger parties instead of them. And trust me I get it. If u have a table of 5-7 u aren't gonna sit 2 people. But I decided to look at his hard work and organization and realized that he wasn't even crossing people off the waitlist and had a ton of people on there. He definitely wasn't organized. And lastly he invited a party of 2 to sit before us and after that, my wife and I got up and left. Awesome start. I just can't believe this guy is up in the front of an ihop working. Not inviting anyone to stay but giving them crazy time frames and actually inviting people to leave. Thanks again CHASE. Nice tattoos by the way."}
{"text":"oh now i remember why ihop is gross... i got the tbone steak and egg, worst steak ive ever had.. i think my daughters decent french toast was better..."}
{"text":"Chicken Fried Steak at the home of the Rutti Tutti Fresh and Fruiti? You betcha. The quest for the ultimate CFS led me to IHOP. Here it's called country fried steak and will run you north of eleven bucks before coffee and OJ. It comes with the standard eggs and potatoes. As always, and to maintain the consistency and integrity of the quest, I was going to inquire as to the possibility of substituting a pancake for my choice of bread. No need to.  It's on the menu as CFS, hashbrowns, two eggs AND two pancakes. The pancakes were outstanding. Hot and fresh. The hashbrowns were about average. The eggs were a little runny for over-easy, so keep that in mind. You might want to go over-medium. The CFS itself was man-sized and tasty. The breading was full of flavor and the meat could be cut with a fork. No need for a steak knife here. The Mrs. opted for the Strawberry Stuffed French Toast and was pleased with her selection. The coffee here is not going to win any awards, but was decent. The waitress was very attentive and the food was ready and on the table in surprisingly quick fashion. I have been to this location before, but never during daylight hours and never before for anything other than the late night food fix after an evening of fun. A few of the employees were heard discussing how a new place across the street had cut into their business, but  it seemed pretty busy to me. I don't think they have anything to worry about anyway. When it comes to breakfast, they've got the boys across the street beat."}
{"text":"Two words for you people...Strawberry Shortcake. IHOP is offering these new Pancake Stackers with cream cheese filling in the middle of 2 great buttermilk pancakes. The wife and I visited this location tonight for quick night out..not to mention my wife wanted to try these new pancakes. We were not disappointed we both had the Strawberry cream filled cheese stackers...she had her's with 2 eggs and hasbrowns...i had mine with 4 strips of Turkey bacon, 2 eggs, and hash browns. The whole meal was only about 14 bucks and the service was outstanding.

Now be advised the Pancakes do come in other flavors...but the strawberry one's are fantastic. So if you want a giant sized great tasting version of Strawberry Shortcake...then go and try this new treat at IHOP. Eat, Drink and Be Merry my friends."}
{"text":"Late night arrival in Las Vegas.  Starving and tired after a massive LVH screw up, we decided to find food.  Late night food.  What's open?

IHOP is!

This IHOP is just like every other one.  Menus are the same.  Food tastes the same.  But one problem.  I guess IHOPs outside of Los Angeles county serve Pepsi now, instead of Coke.  This makes me rage with fury like a dragon.  I am displeased.

Aside from the Pepsi debacle, I guess it's A-OK."}
{"text":"11A.M. on a Sunday is a busy time for most sit-down restaurants, I get that, but this was just something else.

For starters, we had about 4 different servers who couldn't really hear anything. It took our main server about 5-10 minutes to show up and when she did, she had attitude. She asked us for our drinks, we ordered and then we didn't see them for about 5-10 minutes. When we finally got them, they got the coffee wrong - no big deal, but when we asked, they sent us back another wrong one... asking a third time for what we ordered, the waitress gave us attitude when we asked if it's what we ordered.

We finally get the food and the pancakes are really dark annnnnd we don't have any silverware. Mind you, we had already asked twice for silverware, but to no avail. Waitress came to our table ONCE and asked if everything was good and if we had any questions - I asked for the check so we could get out.

In short, I wouldn't waste your time on this place. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast while out here on a business trip. I like IHOP's for their breakfast and really no complaints on this visit. Service was quick and friendly. We were here on a weekday morning a little after 7am and it was by no means busy. Getting out of the parking lot was a bit of challenge since I-77 is pretty busy, but other than that, I was happy with my visit here."}
{"text":"I like this new location.  The floor plan is more open and it feels bigger than their previous location on 19th Ave.  The food is the same, so if you like IHOP you will probably be satisfied on that point.  I've been here for five visits at various times and there are a couple of things that are consistent that rate a 2 or 2.5 rating:  1) parking is awful and entry is confusing unless you know where you are going.  2) They run out of food.  Twice I've been there and unless you get there really early, you might find that your favorite is no long available for the day.  3) The service is awful.  They seem to have a 1 to 3 ratio on employees to guests and still the service is awful.

If you need your fix of rootie tootie fresh n fruity (or whatever) pick another location and save yourself a lot of frustration."}
{"text":"This place is great but I wish the service would pick up the paste."}
{"text":"It was a long wait for breakfast and club sandwich....but when the food did come out the hashbrowns looked like they had not been on the grill at all?  They fixed it slowly upon request."}
{"text":"The store service was horrible! Bacon was so overcooked, eggs tasted very weird, coffee was oversweet and tasted nasty. The server was like half asleep and didnt even take the right orders."}
{"text":"Yikes. Party of 4, one meal included pancakes, which didn't make it out with the rest of the food. After all meals were eaten, we got the pancakes from the kitchen (cook had forgotten), and the waitress took 10% off the bill. In the meantime, a new guy said they were out of lemonade for my splashberry. I pointed out that the splashberry used lemon-lime soda, and he said they were out of it. I asked for a mtn dew as replacement. Later, our waitress said the new guy didn't know the difference between lemonade and sprite, and she brought me a splashberry refill. When the bill was brought out, it included the splashberry and the mtn dew. We pointed out the mistake, and the waitress said that the 10% she took off for the pancakes covered it! We insisted that we shouldn't have to pay for the dew, since I only ever wanted the other drink, and only ordered the dew as a substitute for the splashberry refill, and she snapped that it was fine, and she would take it off. This was around 11:30pm on a Friday night, fewer than 20 other guests in the building. Plenty of other IHOP fish in the Las Vegas sea, no need to visit this one."}
{"text":"I went to this IHOP as I wanted to see how it was and was doing after opening up some time ago. The restaurant is in a pretty easily overlooked spot and no other store before it has ever made it. When the space was empty - even in boom times - it stayed that way for extended periods between tenants.

The restaurant overall is quite clean and the people nice. There just seems to be some efficiency issues that end up affecting customer service and experience.

I went at around 11am on a Monday not wanting to get caught in any business rush crowd, should there be one. I expected it to be slow, due to the time but did not expect to be one of only 2 occupied tables in the entire (small) place. A couple of young ladies who seemed to be off from school for the summer entered after me.  We could not see anyone who worked for IHOP.  

We waited about 5 min but we kept hearing close conversation and banging in the kitchen, so we knew someone was there. A gentleman who looked all of 17 came up to the podium and took the two young ladies to a table straight away.  About a minute later, a man who easily could have been the young man's father approached, looked around and asked if I was next.  He led me to a table with a view of the kitchen door and the heat lamp station inside through the window.  Not much else but it's an IHOP; you don't come here for the scenery.

The \"17 year old\" came to the table and introduced himself and said he'd be taking care of me.  It appears that staffing is low this time of day.  So low, in fact it became apparent relatively quickly that they were understaffed even for only two tables being occupied.  At one point I heard some young ladies who seemed to be sitting at a table hidden from view whose only purpose was to visit the staff; namely James, my server.  He spent a fair amount of time over there talking with them. Don't get me wrong; I'm not complaining about this as with only a few tables occupied in the restaurant there will be some 'down time' where hanging with friends is not beyond the scope of things.  Besides, the girls could have been fellow employees who were visiting during their off time.

But this inattention does become a problem when commitments get dropped.  Well, some commitments were not met like a refill of my empty glass, delivery of a glass with no ice, ketchup (once my order had been tabled), etc.  Let's just say that response time on these promises were generally late, if even completed.  That was a little disappointing.  

I didn't see much of James during my visit as he was either out of range or at one of the tables where the young ladies were. He was polite and nice when at my table though.

While I sat in silence for quite some time and pondered the state of what seemed to be a \"Dad's great idea to open an IHOP,\" I noticed that oddly there was no background music playing.  I had plenty of time to finish the small amount of water that had been displaced by a cup full of ice. This is one of the main reasons I order water without ice - so the server doesn't get run to death and I have plenty to drink, as I am a walking water filter LOL. As I sat wondering if/when I'd get more water, about 20-25 minutes passed. I could see my order under the lamps in the kitchen through aforementioned door.  It sat there for about 5-8 minutes while my server was elsewhere.  I understand that young ladies are higher priority than old men to a young man but I could see my food yet no server...

I'd been in the restaurant about 30 minutes when I received my 2 eggs scrambled, bacon, hash browns, and short stack.  Thanks to the heat lamps, they were still remembering what warm was like but just. The food was delivered in a drop and go manner with a quick refill of my iced water at which time I asked for ketchup and an empty glass to separate water from ice. Ketchup showed up with the bill much later and said empty glass never manifested.  

When he finally came back to deliver the tab, my server asked how everything was.  At this point I was all but finished eating, kind of forcing down the last cold bites.  I responded \"It was OK...\" and he said \"Just OK?!\"  I told him that the food was barely warm on delivery but it was not worth the wait to get it corrected.  He was very apologetic and offered to have it remade, saying \"I wish you would have said something\" and I again reiterated that it wasn't worth the wait.  Besides, I couldn't have said something as I had no one to say it to most of the time I was there. 

His plight seemed heartfelt and I accepted his apologies.  When I got to the register to pay, I once again saw the older gentleman who didn't ask about my experience but simply checked me out with minimum conversation.

As it is now, I can't really recommend this IHOP unless you like short-staff induced long waits, cold food, and/or silence.  Perhaps this was just an off day.  For my money though, I doubtfully will be back to find out if that was the case."}

{"text":"Great experience at IHOP! The food was very good, some of the best IHOP food I've ever had (pancakes and omelet). The staff were very friendly and kind. The service was a little slow, but they were having a problem with their water being broken so I understand why it would have been a little slower. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Horrible! THE PLACE SMELLED HORRIBLE! Unsure if the filthy carpet needs to be changed, probably never been cleaned. Food DISGUSTING, given on DIRTY PLATES. The bacon was 60 % cooked.....The workers are nice but CLEARLY management needs to be removed and improved. Literally made my skin crawl sitting in there, but my car was next door at grease monkey for a good 2 hours and my child was starving. I will NEVER go back there because serious remodeling and cleaning needs to be done before serving food in there again. Also the \"cooks\" could use a cooking class or two....Disgraceful"}
{"text":"Received horrible service from our waitress Pasion. Waited more than 10 minutes after being seated to have our drink order taken. We were waiting on a friend to arrive so half our group ordered and the other half waited. When the first half received their food the order was incorrect AND missing some of the items. It wasn't until the second half of our group received their food about 10 minutes later that we even had someone come to the table so we could get the first order fixed. The food runner Andre was excellent, he apologized many times about the confusion and brought the correct items right away. He came back multiple times to check on us and was very attentive. I had gotten the chicken strips and one of them was mildly raw in the middle, which is almost impossible to even accomplish considering all you do is throw them in the fryer, however we were very over our visit at that point. We did not see our original server until she came to give us the check. It was fairly obvious she does not have much service experience and the establishment was not even moderately busy. IHOP is a last resort breakfast place for my group and this experience only solidified this idea with us."}
{"text":"Worst place ever! Went in at 10am on a Tuesday and the service was extremely slow, the food wait ridiculous and cold by time we got it, plus missing sides that we had to request.  They have ONE register and there was a line 15 clients deep waiting to pay. The man taking payments walked away to talk to someone and never came back, several waitresses said they had no idea how to work register. Everyone was pissed and unhappy. There was another couple seated next to us saying they'd waited 45 minutes for food. When they complained, the manager kept asking the waitress what their table number was. Seriously!?!? The MANAGER doesn't know the seating chart?!?! Poor performance on every level. Normally don't eat at IHOP but on a road trip and we wanted real food not fast. Do not recommend this place at all. If I could give no stars,  I would"}
{"text":"Our server Jewels was outstanding !! We got there at around 9am and were seated immediately. The food was excellent. Love the Salted Caramel pancakes! Definitely recomend this place! Especially if sweet Jewels is there!."}
{"text":"Eat at this IHOP often, Always late night and always have the same waiter, Ernie. He does a surprisingly great job, no matter how busy it is. Insures food is correct, cooked properly, and always friendly and courteous"}
{"text":"We stopped in here after visiting Kennywood's Christmas Festival of Lights, and we were totally underwhelmed.  To be fair, we didn't order on the breakfast menu, but I was really unimpressed with the dinner choices.

We had a good server, and I love that they bring you a pot of coffee for the table, but the good news stopped there.  I got a chicken salad, and it was full of those little nasty chunks of chicken you buy by the freezer bag at Walmart.  My husband got a cheeseburger, which was small, flat, and nothing to write home about.

I'll probably give this place another shot for pancakes at some point, as that is their specialty, but I'll not return for dinner.  I think we chose this place because we wanted something a little less expensive, but hopefully better than Eat n Park, and it was actually neither.  It was also a little odd to me that there's a huge \"NO WEAPONS\" sign on the door when you walk in.  I really hope people aren't bringing weapons into pancake restaurants."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service wasn't the best. The prices have gone up a little and the servings of food are fairly small. The restaurant was clean for the most part other than the condiments being sticky. I enjoy going to Ihop but I'll be going to a different location from now on."}
{"text":"I've eaten at several other iHops restaurants. We arrived from a long hike. The waitress was not very attentive. We did not get water and utensils until I asked for them. A table next to us was seated after us and got their food before us. The food was a disaster, the egg whites were yellow, the over medium eggs were over cooked, the avocado was too ripe. We never received our check so I had to wait at the cashier's for someone to find our check. We will never come back to this IHOP."}
{"text":"We have been here for over 30 minutes.  Walked in at 1145pm. Its now 1230 and our food is still not here. Our server is too busy to pay attention...."}
{"text":"They have good food , good drinks , good service also makes it better when the very handsome server take your order ."}
{"text":"Don't say anything...trust me.  I-Hop is the last place I would want to eat in Vegas.
My boys wanted to eat here.  I tried very hard to change their mind...they won...
After reading some reviews of this place, I was little concerned.  After we finished eating, it wasn't too bad at all.  There were a lot of negative reviews, but I think they were too critical...
I would eat here again if I was really low on cash..."}
{"text":"Christmas brunch was awesome! We were told 45 min wait only took 15 min for two and others were getting seated sooner as well. Food was excellent for both myself and girl friend. We got the Pumpkin pancakes (perfect taste not too sweet either) we both had bacon and I had scrabbled eggs and hash browns as well. Yes, I was full and a satisfied customer. Our waitress was great and kept checking on us even though it was busy so I made sure to hand her the tip personally. 
Only negative is it's a little cramped/crowded as the table are pretty close, but a counter positive is it's pretty clean for a busy restaurant. A guy was spraying cleaner and wiping down the restroom sinks when I walked in which really didn't look that bad so that was a bonus to see as I'm kind of a clean freak.
I've been here before and I would recommend this IHOP near PV Mall."}
{"text":"Ihop  is on the same level as Denny's. Cheap, greasy & salty food quite possibly sprinkled with crushed laxatives. I always leave  Ihop bloated and queasy.  I only go here because my daughter (2)  likes the create-a-face pancake.  I think their pancakes are too mushy and the bacon is way too salty. I've tried their lunch menu as well and found it to be just as bad as breakfast. There is always a wait, the tables are always sticky and I always feel rushed by the servers."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and it seems to hit or miss here. I've showed up for a to-go order to find that my order was never placed. I've waited over 30 min for a single order. On this visit in particular, it took 15 minutes to take my to go order and then they hung up on my twice. I arrive to wait another almost 20 minutes to get my food that I ordered in advance. It wasn't busy, it was late evening on a Monday, why did it take so long? Does it really take 35 minutes to make some French toast?... The staff are rude, the food quality is shabby at best, and the wait times are horrendous."}
{"text":"WOW it was so busy today and we were seated in about 5 minutes. I could tell the staff was running around to make sure that they can take care of all their customers. 
As soon as we were seated Daisy our friendly waitress greeted us and grabbed our drink order which we got right away. We also ordered our food and received it very quickly considering how busy they were! (I am really impressed how well this was handled) 

The food tasted like expected it was exactly what we ordered and it was very filling. My eggs,hash browns, and ham were cooked to perfection. Let's just say my plate was left spotless lol 

Now the reason why I did not give them 5 stars is because the restaurant itself needed some TLC,the silverware was placed in paper bag type of thing which was tacky to me even for an Ihop, and the tables were too close to each other (I get that they may have it this way because it's a busier restaurant, but should consider separating them because I could hear the surrounding people's conversations)."}
{"text":"They are awesome! I have ordered breakfast for our staff meetings for the last 3 months in a row. The orders have always been on time and of course delicious. I love that I can call in the evening before place my order get the price and be ready for pick once I arrive. Their awesomeness doesn't end there when I walk in the mornings for pick up I'm greeted right away not only with a hello, but an big smile. They have helped me with my order out to my car which to me that goes above and beyond. I will continue to order breakfast for our teammates from this specific location, because I have tried from others and they have told I can not order the day before. They say I have to go in the day of and they will prepare it at that time, and that's an inconvenience. Anyhow this location is always ready to accommodate me and they are very pleasant to talk to. 

BTW this location is well kept a HUGE plus :)"}
{"text":"Finally a local IHOP, great service and always delicious breakfast. Love this place and they got big screen TV'S always playing football, great idea. 

Also only IHOP I never had to ask for refills they were always on top of their beverage game.

Just hope non-Tempe locals stay out when I am getting my breakfast. So far they got speedy service and the place is still new and clean."}
{"text":"We were waiting for about 15 minutes before anyone said a f**king word then told us some bs about they were way behind. They were also out of hamburgers. Also, Randell, our server, is very unattractive."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few IHOP. Most are similar in food quality and service.... average.

Nothing was too exciting about this branch north of Las Vegas strip. It opened 24-hours a day. We went there at 1AM on a Sunday. That's life in sin city... hehehe... I will say no more!

It's very cold that night. It even rained with strong wind at 2 AM before we left. So I ordered hot chocolate (HC). Oh my Buddha!!!! It's $2.59 per cup (ordinary coffee cup), no refill. What a big rip off. I usually pay $0.10 per package. It's 26 times mark up. And my friends had the expected refill of coffee and soft drinks of the same price.

I felt the world has come to a stop when the price of refillable drinks going from $0.99 to $2.99 lately. And worse, people embrace it head over heel and most don't even ask for refill. Let's see if HC will catch on... $2.99 a cup (regular cup) with no refill.

The foods were OK at 1:30 AM. Edible. I gave our waiter a big tip for giving me a free cup of HC after I complained. But I will pay close attention to price jacking from now on... I do have a limit how much I will tolerate for this average chain. Sky is not the limit on my value land.

So diners, I have nothing else to add. It's not my first choice usually. I will still stop by any branch for now whenever convenient."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our visit to IHOP and did not have any complaints about the food or the service. Our waiter was very attentive and honestly, you have to be a total loser to mess up breakfast lol. I got the raspberry peach pancakes and they were very good...I don't visit IHOP often so it was a nice experience especially being on vacation, and a great way to start our day of shopping lol."}
{"text":"Worst shit ever the bacon was old the hash browns where in chuncks my food was cold my pancakes were old my steak wasn't even cooked the waitress was rude af and ill never come back here"}
{"text":"I ate here a few weeks back and the food was not anything amazing. The chicken fried steak breakfast was pretty dry and I really did not each much of it. Decided to come back and give it another shot since my car was getting worked on next door. We were sat down and after 15 minutes not even a drink order was taken. A table seated after us even got service before we did.  I approached a staff member who said were short staffed we will be right with you. I sat back down and ten minutes later still no service . The girl waiting tables around us acted like we weren't even there . We then talked to a manager and told her we were assigned to tables who obviously had nobody waiting them and other workers passed by like nothing was going on. She said she could get our orders right away but we declined so we could take our business elsewhere. The manager did not even have a name tag on and seemed sincere but bad service all around ."}
{"text":"I have no idea how we ALWAYS end up at IHOP every single time we visit Vegas. One would think it is the only restaurant available but more like one out of thousands of options. Still end up here. Anyway, we get off the plane and look for breakfast and end up here.

We were there early in the morning so it was not busy at all. Service was friendly and was pretty quick. I ordered the Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity and my husband ordered a Garden Stuffed Crepe. Also topped it off with much needed coffee. Mine was supposed to come with 2 pieces of bacon but it came with 4. Somebody was probably trying to fatten me up. As always, IHOP satisfies my hunger. I tasted my husband's crepe and was not a fan of the hollandaise sauce. It taste good since my husband scraped it off.

All in all we always come here. The price seems to get higher every time but still worth it. Thank you IHOP for being our go-to-off-of-the-plane restaurant."}
{"text":"I should've read the reviews first. The staff is all young kids, which is fine but it doesn't make them very knowledgeable about ingredients or options. Clearly there were too many of them hanging around, but never had my water refilled. I've heard good things about IHOP but my experience was nothing of the sort. Ordered crepes with eggs poached hard (the menus does say, anyway you want them!) when they arrived there was about a half jar of Nutella on top of the crêpes, which made them difficult to get down without scraping them off first. The eggs were not even poached medium. I had to send them back and reminded them to please poach hard. Almost like a hard boiled egg, they apologized and later retuned with the same eggs. Left them in my plate. Paid with a tip and left. Won't return."}
{"text":"This has always been my go to location. I hadn't been in a while and decided to take my grandmother out. When we first arrived, it was pretty empty however we still waited for someone to seat us for about 10 minutes. After being seated we ordered a tea and coffee. Then never saw the waiter until I got up to find him so I could ask for a fresh pot of coffee. We ordered our food; my grandmother a salad and myself the chicken fried steak dinner with no broccoli. We got our food and there was corn on my plate, the food was between warm and cool to the touch and I was missing sides. We again couldn't find our waiter so we let another waitress know. She returned our food and 10 minutes later our server brought the ticket for us to pay. He was unaware our food was sent back and didn't apologize for adding corn when I wasn't sure where he even got that from. I asked to have the food taken off and we would pay for the drinks. He left for 10-15 minutes and came back saying the manager comped our entire meal and we could leave. She never came out, never apologized nothing. In the multiple years of coming here the service has never been this terrible. We ended up leaving to Olive Garden which we waited for 15 minutes for a table and still had the most amazing service."}
{"text":"My son decided he wanted IHOP after his cross country meet. We were seated our drinks came in a reasonable amount of time. While we waited to place our order the Mgr and a server sat in the corner of the restaurant ignoring the phone ringing continuously. We place our order and waited we sat near the kitchen so we heard April the cook calling Ana several times to bring our food out, finally I had to get up and ask Ana to get our food for us by then the cook came out of the kitchen to bring the food to us herself. April the cook is the ONLY redeemable thing about IHOP."}
{"text":"Your basic IHOP, if in a somewhat challenging location on Hwy 74 and like every other greasy spoon in Charlotte, operated by Greeks.

Of chief note is that the ham-n-cheese omelet was a proper omelet -- multiple layers of beaten egg encasing the filling, not just scrambled eggs folded twice and dumped on plate. Also, the hash browns were cooked to crunchy in spots, rather than left raw in spots. My preferred approach.

Watch where you park and lock up as there are some sketchy motels about, but this'll do in a pinch."}
{"text":"I'm staying in one of those extended stay hotels and IHOP is a block away.

A week ago, I go in for breakfast and the pancakes could not come out colder....literally like they were in ice.

Today, I go in and ask for a combo plate..eggs over medium and pancakes.   The sausage is overcooked and the eggs are running like water.

Basic 101 breakfast and this company can't get it's specialization right."}
{"text":"Worst customer service EVER! To the server who \"served\" us last night: if you dont like to do your job find a new one. 
Honestly have never wanted to leave a restaurant due to lack of service more than last night..
Went in around 10pm literally just for some pancakes.. we were seated in about 5 minutes, she left and came back about 10 minutes later and asked if we were ready to order i asked about their special that day but it was no longer available so i asked for a couple more minutes to look over the menu. She came back after another 10-15 min and we all ordered short stacks and as she's walking back to the kitchen she comes back half way and says \"oh drinks?\" LIKE WHAT IN THE HELL YOU DUMB LADY that was the last straw for me but my daughter wanted pancakes so we stayed. I was nice the entire time and she still never came back to give us the check so i got up to pay and leave 

P.s she charged me for the wrong items lol"}
{"text":"Very dirty, unappetizing atmosphere. Un-clean-able  embedded dirt in bathroom. This place needs to be torn down and rebuilt."}
{"text":"I love this location. Christina was our server this morning and she was fantastic. As a former waitress I understand how hectic and overwhelming a morning shift can get but she was attentive and very friendly and always kept her cool even with the tons of tables she had. 

The food was brought to us within ten minutes of ordering (successfully taming the hangry beast that was brewing) and any modification to our order was done correctly! The food itself was pretty good. 
-- I highly recommend the banana nutella crepes. 

Overall I was very impressed with this recent visit. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Horrible service we put our name in never got called was skipped and host said he called our name when he never once called our name.... Will not be coming back after 30 min wait and he is telling everyone 10-15 min wait .... As he had already crossed off our name ...... Service was horrible
Does Not Deserve 1 Star only gave cause I had to..."}
{"text":"Haven't been to ihop in a minute, but the commercial the other day had me craving it so here I am lol... They were a little slow to getting a seat even tho it wasn't that busy.."}
{"text":"Just what I needed for my late night craving! The food was even better then I could have even imagined after a stressful day of work, aggressive divers and a Tiffany concert at The Rebel Lounge! Who would say no to chocolate chip pancakes that look like Kermet the frog then served to you!? The food is always fresh, bacon & hash browns crisp and the the eggs scrambled to perfection. What more do you want? Well I guess I should of had some of that amazing hot chocolate but I didn't want a coco overload at the time I normally would be going to bed.

You will run into a unique mix of customers at this time of night but the employees along with the amazing manager keep the place \"Hopping\" so there is no reason to go to the place that sounds like Lenny's. Blah!"}
{"text":"I used to love IHOP, but lately seems like the food quality is going down. Today we had breakfast there and the chicken fried steak I had was so dry"}
{"text":"I've been here before without any issue except for that the last two times I came with a service dog and the waitress made me sit in the seats sectioned directly to the right of the entrance where no one was sitting. I've a feeling it was because I had a dog. That, in itself didn't feel good to me. It could have been for the safety of the dog, but who knows. Was just here yesterday and there was no one around to greet and seat us for about 5 minutes so we stood there waiting. Was with a service dog and when the lady arrived (she wasn't a waitress, she was wearing normal clothes. Middle aged woman) she seated us away from all the people and then told us \"We can't take your order right now because our system is down. Would you like to wait 10-15 minutes? We just can't take your order right now without the computers running.\" -- seriously? You couldn't pull out an old fashioned pen and paper to take our order and have the cooks make our food? So, we left. Common sense lady."}
{"text":"I hate to give bad reviews but this was a terrible experience. We had a party of 10 and were sat fairly quickly because there was literally two tables in the restaurant. The silverware was a greasy and needs to be polished before getting rolled. Our first impression of our server was terrible. She walked in and instantly rolled her eyes. Not a good start. She got our drinks and took our order. It took about 45 minutes for our food to get out to us. Which if it was busy and we were a large party it's understandable. But there was literally two tables and us in the whole place. She simply forgot to put our order in or let it sit in the window. She put in two of our party's ordered in wrong and they got the wrong dish. Our party all sat their with empty drinks for 30 minutes. Personally, I got an iced mocha and the strawberry stuffed French toast. The mocha literally tasted like watery chocolate milk. And my French toast was cold when it got to me. You could easily tell the bread was heated up then sat there long enough to cool down before it got out to me. 
The most irritating thing of all was the fact I could literally see our server standing at the host stand or in the kitchen talking her brains out. The ONLY thing she did was greet us, get out drinks and order, and give us the check. She never checked to see how our good was or if we needed any refills."}
{"text":"I would give a lower rating if possible. We went here on a busy labor day sunday. We were greeted and seated immediately by the hostess at a two-top. We then sat there for twenty minutes without having anyone ask if we wanted a glass of water."}
{"text":"I just feel with all the better breakfast places nearby, why would someone want to come here? But honestly, it's not bad for cheap breakfast food that (usually) does not get messed up. Hard to mess up breakfast food, but the quality is mediocre. I would also say this - this is one of the better IHOPs I went to as well."}
{"text":"DONT EVEN BOTHER!! If I could give NO stars I would. So excited to see another breakfast place being placed nearby only to come in and have THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER! Front start to finish horrible. We waited over 45 minutes while everyone around got sat and received their food before us. When I asked to speak with a manager, they then realized our order was never even started! Our food came out one by one, Cold, unmelted cheese, forgetting half the order! Coffee was like iced tea. Everyone around us, came over one by one to apologize, these are customers not even service staff apologized!

UPDATE: after this e Perone e the manager came up to us at the front booth while we were about to pay and comped our w fire breakfast. We were grateful for the gesture and he asked us to please return and give them another shot. We waited a few weeks and returned, just the two of us... much better experience this time, the service was better and so was the food, it just isn't what we think IHOP's standards are, but better than last time."}
{"text":"I order a grilled cheese sandwich & this is what I got , the cheese wasn't melted & the fries tasted frozen . The food quality is of this place is horrible . What a waste of time & money $$"}
{"text":"Great service nice and clean place! Sarah H. Is a wonderful server too! I also like the way they remodeled the IHOP's they look a little more classier"}
{"text":"Stoppped in here on a Sunday afternoon with the family. The lot was empty, which was surprising on a Sunday. I thought they may have been closed. Upon entering, I realized why the lot was so empty; the AC was hardly working. The young lady at the front said it was because the sun was setting, but this was just lip service. Manager didn't seem to concerned. Food was meh. The cooks were probably irritated by the heat, as well. Did fine for something to stop us from starving on the road but probably wouldn't patronize again."}
{"text":"As a IHOP customer of over a decade (Sunday morning ritual) we went to try our new IHOP off Happy Valley.  When we arrived we were told they're not taking anymore customers at this time. It was busy but not to busy. I'm very disappointed. Obviously a lot more training needs to be done.

{"text":"I came here pretty early one morning with a friend. So of course, we were the only table there. I asked for chocolate chip pancakes and the server literally gave me plain buttermilk pancakes and sprinkled a few chocolate chips on top. 

My friend ordered an eggs benedict with a side of hash browns. Ten minutes later, the server came back with it and said, \"The chef didn't know how to make it, he doesn't have a recipe for it so he wasn't sure if it was right. Is this how it's supposed to be made?\" My friend and I gave each other a look like 'what the fuck'? 

After the server left, we realized he had forgotten the hash browns. We informed him of that and he said, \"Oh yeah, absolutely!\" Ten minutes go by and he comes back to our table with a stack of buttermilk pancakes INSTEAD OF THE HASH BROWNS and said, \"Here I bought you these for free because I wasn't sure if the eggs benedict was okay or not.\" He briefly walked away and my friend said to me, \"Okay so am I not getting hash browns? I've asked him twice already, not for a side of pancakes.\" 

Don't get me wrong, the server was a nice guy and all but you shouldn't inform your customers that the chef \"doesn't know\" how to cook an entree and had a difficult time figuring it out. The fact we asked for a side of hash browns twice and he came back with something completely different that we didn't ask for says a lot about his lack of communication and listening skills."}
{"text":"I am surprised that this restaurant gets a very low rate and many unhappy reviews. Every day I drive by, I always see a long line waiting outside, specially during weekend. Therefore, I think that it is supposed to receive high and positive rating on Yelp.

I have been here for 3 times. Everything seems great to me so far. In the latest visit, I came here at 3PM after picking up my sisters from school. We all were tired and hungry. Staff greeted us right away. She is very friendly. 

My youngest sister had Funny Face Pancake. She loves it. It tastes good and it looks good too. My middle sister had 2*2*2 combo and I had appetizer sampler, so we could share. 

It took a while to get the order, but the food brought out really quickly. Maybe because it was not busy at that time. Having food right away pleased us easily. Pancake is delicious, supper fluffy, soft, and fresh.

No matter how bad people think about it, in my opinion, it deserves to be 4 stars."}
{"text":"Crepes gave me appendicitis.  Ended up in the hospital for two days. 8/10. Would eat there again."}
{"text":"Upon entering to this location you are prompt to wait before being seated. There is a cute little seating area that has beautiful windows overseeing the front entrance. After the attendant seated myself and a friend of mine, Fabiola greeted us with warm smiles. Unfortunately that is the only positive thing I can comment and in truth I am truly unsatisfied with iHop, the customer service, as well as the quality of food was less than poor. Since this was my first time trying this franchise I was excited to see what the \"hype\" was all about. But, after overseeing the menu and locating my choices to order Fabiola persistently abused both myself and friend to further upgrade our choices. I understand that at times it is beneficial to notify a guest of better choices but the way in which Fabiola harassed us was unacceptable. She made me feel as if what I was ordering was not adequate for her own tastes. Also, we had a voucher from yelp that gave the option to either choose between a complimentary hash brown or unlimited pancakes. Fabiola clarified that the voucher was incorrect and would not honor the unlimited choice offered. That was fine but she has extremely poor representation for the company. If iHop hopes to keep further new coming guests I hope they choose wisely with their representatives. Because after this poor customer service, I was extremely frustrated, I also expressed to Fabiola that I was not satisfied and she did nothing to sway my mind. Aside from her poor service I ordered the banana Nutella crepe, two eggs and bacon, as well as an omelette. The crepe was undercooked, the bacon was not cooked enough, the bread was burnt, and we waited 20 minutes just for a refill of beverage. I would have loved to write a raving review about this cute breakfast place because I love breakfast but after today I will not return any time soon. The price's are unreasonable because of the quality and with such poor service I do not recommend this location. Maybe one day I will try a different location for a better experience but until then iHop did not gain but lost a future customer. Two thumbs down for this location :("}

{"text":"Rude service, poor management, cooks overwhelmed not cooking orders correctly and not enough staff to wait on customers especially during peak times. Whether it's busy or not the service sucks most of the time because there's at least one good egg out of the bunch at times, but odds are not good. Once your order is delivered to your table you probably won't see the wait staff again, not even to get the bill let alone a refill on drinks. I say after 10 minutes of finishing your meal and just sitting there waiting, you should be allowed to get up and leave without paying. Since they obviously don't care in getting you to pay if no bill or checkups are done in timely matter or at all. I shouldn't have to flag down someone so I can pay and free up the table."}
{"text":"No wonder this place has poor reviews!  They need new management and brains.   They give only partial orders but charge full price.  They seat people right near the loudest,  most obnoxious and nastiest ghetto girls that you can ever imagine!  I could care less which guy they did last weekend too make your effing boo jealous!!!  People should be fired for making people listen to this BS!!!  I don't like hearing F****, P**** and N***** while I'm eating my breakfast!  How stupid can you be.

I ordered a cup of hot chocolate. It really helped me warm up.  Food was okay, gave me the energy I needed. Standard iHop food.

{"text":"My wife and I dined here recently and had a good experience. The place was as busy as I'd ever seen an IHOP, so I thought we'd have some difficulty with service. Let me tell you, I was WRONG. We were greeted right away and seated just as quickly. This crew was on their game today! Annie (our server, pretty sure that was her name) seemed to be the only server in our section and whilst she clearly had her hands full, she made us feel as though we weren't on the back burner. The team in the back did  pretty good, we had a little bit of a wait on pancakes but for as busy as it was I'd say it was reasonable. Food tasted great and was piping hot.

Just wanted to shine some positive light on a good team. Thank you!"}

Chicken Florentine crepes next time, overall an average experience."}
{"text":"Don't order the steak tips and eggs bc they taste like you're eating pieces of meat that don't even taste like steak..... they taste like SUGAR (not beef) SUGAR SUGAR.  I usually order  this plate as it's fully loaded with protein (not sugar) I tend to give my pancakes to my son. Usually I try for high protein low carb. But today was very disappointing.  For a quick minute I actually poured some steak sauce onto another plate thinking perhaps someone was trying to be funny and poured maple syrup inside the steak sauce bottle. To my disappointment of a great laugh .... t'was not the bottle of sauce. It was in fact the steak pieces.  I mentioned it to the waitress that attended us and she mentioned that she's had this very exact complaint for a few weeks now ..... mhm interesting, yet seems like the issue has not been resolved.  I ate the eggs and hash brown --- ate the hash because I was hungry still from not finishing the \"steak tips \" ... Steak tips left on the plate. Waitress did not seem too concerned to be honest. 

I won't be returning here. Took a couple bites of the pancakes and they aren't like what they used to be.  I make better pancakes at home."}

Everyone at my table got their good and I got my eggs(which they had to take back since they were runny)!! And we all finished our food by the time she only brought me two links. And I waited another 15 for the other two so I just told her I didn't need them and she got upset with me. Not to mention a waitress spilled her drink tray and our feet sat in water for 20 mins!! Unreal."}

It took us 50 minutes to get two orders of pancakes- all the tables around us had eaten, paid and left by the time we got our food. We were never given an explanation as to why our meal took so long. This is the last time we will come to this location- thoroughly disappointed with the service. If I could give it zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Sat us in the corner then told us we needed to calm our 4 year old son down. Food was mediocre and server was way out of her lane as far as giving her opinion on our child. It is in dire need of a remodel also. 
We won't be back."}
{"text":"It's IHOP. What can I say? But this IHOP service seems to be better than ones that I have been to before. We had a party of 11 and they were very quick to set us up, take our orders and take care of us the rest of the night. No hassles.

The food was decent too. So IHOP met expectations!"}
{"text":"Your typical ihop although it looks cleaner than a lot of ihops I go to. The waiter was decent and food came out pretty fast. Maybe it was because it wasn't crowded... because it was 10pm.

Service at each location is hit or miss. My review probably means nothing since the people working at this location will probably be not working there by the time you go eat there anyway. lol"}
{"text":"They did it again. This is my fifth Friday in a row and the food and service were great as always. We had Edgar as a server again today and he always provides great service. He's polite, attentive, and very friendly. My wife and I actually live closer to the IHOP on Centennial, but prefer to come here because of the service. If it's hard to find a parking spot, you know it's not because the place sucks. The food is good and the service, better.
My only suggestion would be to get a hostess with a personality."}
{"text":"This location is ALWAYS dirty!  Everything from the front door handles, to the filthy restrooms. 
This location was remodeled a few years ago and it's looking as if it never took place. 
Management is seriously dropping the ball here."}
{"text":"This was horrendous.   Service was slow. Restaurant was empty. \"Food\" was beyond comprehension ... cold and burned. Not to mention oily. Please close this place down. No one deserves this."}
{"text":"Won't be coming back thanks to Yisel.
Rude and got our order wrong. I asked for something and she said it doesn't exist yet it's on the menu."}
{"text":"In the middle of fat America.  But okay.  My server was very nice.  He did forget my water though.  But it's an IHOP.  You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"IHOP isn't the best place to go if you are hungry! Its the worst place! I had to wait for my food after I ordered for 30 minutes and when it finally came it was cold!!! I had to send it back so it could be warmed, that took so long and I ended up leaving hungry!!

Augh!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great service love to dine inn at places were the staff make you feel welcome great service and great food ;)"}
{"text":"Walked on Sunday morning right after church service. They handed me a card with a Disney character name on it and asked how many. I thought it was the cutest thing ever. So as I waited they would be calling guest by the Disney characters name. I was told 10-15 min wait but I was seated before 15mins. The 2 host worked great together in getting everyone seated quickly. 
As I was seated the waitress came and took my order and less then 10mins I had my plate. It was delish! The waitress was very sweet. 
I have here before several times but I needed to do a write up after all the negative nellies out there that gave them a poor review."}
{"text":"Worst service ever at an IHOP!  There were only about 15 people in the restaurant, but it took us 40 minutes to get pancakes, eggs, and hashbrowns. Then, when the food finally came out, they game me bacon instead of sausage. The server took the entire plate back, and 12 minutes later it came back out with the same eggs and hashbrowns. At least I was given a discount...10%. Nice touch, Mr. Manager."}
{"text":"My meal was okay, but not outstanding by any means.  I asked for eggs over medium and they were more like over easy.  My friend ordered a stack of pancakes and they were undercooked with some almost-raw batter in the middle so he complained about them and was given another stack which was better, but with about a 15 min. delay, it spoiled his breakfast since I'd already finished mine.  How can a pancake house have a cook who is unable to properly cook a pancake?  It was a late morning time on a weekday (not a weekend) so it's not like they were stressed due to it being a very busy time. The manager offered an apology, but he never offered to discount the meal which would have made my friend feel better about the experience. We won't go back to this IHOP."}
{"text":"Went there this morning for a Memorial Day breakfast with my friend.  I had eggs, link sausage, hash browns and two strawberry crepes. He had chicken fried steak, eggs and hash browns. The crepes were so hard that they had a the texture of a corn tortilla. By the time we got to the car I was experiencing stomach cramping and I felt dizzy,  when I got home I barely made it to the toilet, and I have been sitting on the throne the whole day! My friend called me 1.5 hours later and he was sick with the same symptoms.  Obviously we have gotten some kind of food poisoning! I will be writing the company!"}
{"text":"Today 3/12/17 in our visit to IHOP AT 1:51 AM we placed our order, we waited 20 minutes and neither the waitres or the manager aproach us to tell us that there was a delay in our order.  Bad attituded from the waitress, and another person that only walked by to tell us not to record anything when we were just doing it as part of our blog. They forgot about our order. IHOP really bad service and bad attitude from the employees...!2090 E Baseline Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85042"}
{"text":"There was a time in not so distant history in which these breakfast stops were an American staple. IHOP, Denny's, Waffle House, Bob Evans... Sadly, however, it seems as though they've all but given up. It's a shame really because there is so much potential. The ownership of this particular IHOP just spent some money on renovations and the new place looks great. And that's where it stops. 

I truly hope the ownership interests and the on-site management read this review in the spirit in which it is intended. There's still hope. IHOP is one of the last breakfast stops that can still be successful, but it's going to take some work. 

I stopped in on a Tuesday night with my two kids for a breakfast dinner. The food was fine. Seriously, exactly what you would expect. The service was terrible. Not even friendly. And it took FOREVER for our pancakes/waffles to arrive. I counted the patrons. 6 tables, 17 people including us. 

Some serious training from the management is needed for the Host/Hostess and wait staff. Maybe some leadership training for the management team too. 

A smile goes a long way. But there wasn't one to be found."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I occasionally lunch here through the week.  It's one of the busiest IHOPs in the world, so we are not usually surprised that the prices are a skosh higher than other locations or that there might be minor delays or waits-generally, it's never been a problem.  We decided to go for a late lunch (~1pm) on 8/22, thinking it would go quicker but it was quite disappointing:  while the restaurant was maybe half-full, we experienced unfriendly service (except from the young lady that took our initial drink order but she was leaving), slow (and incorrect) refills, and numerous requests for corrected/additional items and for the check. 
We will probably go back but this gave us pause -- more understandable when they're swamped, pretty inexcusable when slow like this."}
{"text":"The next time that my boyfriend and I want to go to an IHOP, I am going to travel a bit farther and visit the one on Raintree and 101, because not only does it not accept coupons, it seems to have lazy, inattentive servers too. I think it is a bad sign when a customer is trying to catch a server's attention, and there are three just standing near the kitchen entrance talking to each other for about ten minutes without attending them. We unfortunately asked for extra sour cream for our Chicken Fajita omelette and waited about seven minutes for it to arrive, even though the restaurant wasn't even busy. Needless to say, I will be avoiding this location for a while."}
{"text":"Great food great friends and they really make u feel like your at a family breakfast they make my day and look forward to coming back.... Daisy is an asset to the company real customer service at it's best team daisy we are ur fans Steve and Paula and family....!:) celebrated my wife's birthday with our kids and granddaughter!"}
{"text":"RUN FAR, FAR, FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! If I could give no stars, I would. My husband came here and it was his first time in an IHOP because he is from the UK. Firstly, my menu was sticky with eitrher syrup or soda they just didn't bother wiping down enough, which j was just goiing to ignore because they were busy when we got there. But it just went downhill from there. It took forever for our server to be told that the fold wasn't ready and then we found out that part of the reason it was taking so long was because they didn't have the food I ordered. Then when my food came, I had no silverware ( the \"hostess\" hadnt given us any when she basically dumped us in out booth- I'm being generous using the term hostess for a little girl with a sour attitude and an \"I don't give a fuck\" look when we said hello to her). They also only brought my husband his fries and no burger and when the \"burger\" Finally came it was obviously a boiled burger i  could have made more appetizing over a campfire in the middle of the woods. The only rededming part of the whole trip was our server Allen. He did everything in his power to make it as pleasant an experience as he could and it was obvious he was just caught in a shit storm behind t he scene. He was awesome. But I would just tell him to get a better job somewhere else where he would be appreciated."}
{"text":"I have always had good customer service here. The lady who had helped me last time was very sweet, and she was able to cater to my mother and I very well. I couldn't remember what the name of the dish was that I wanted, and so I explained it to her and she knew immediately what I was talking about. She has a great personality 10/10 would recommend eating here"}
{"text":"Absolutely DELICIOUS!!! Love love love this place! The restaraunt is 24 hrs, conveniently located and you don't have to pay for parking! The facility is clean and quaint, the staff is very sweet, professional, and they have quick service. The food is DELICIOUS, fresh and carefully crafted. I will always come back while in Vegas for a quick, hearty bite with family and friends. Thank yall so much!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating here because I don't eat eggs and they substitute them for fruit! Instead of hash browns I could get red skin potatoes and the best part is they have french vanilla creamer! So many little perks that you won't get in a casino."}
{"text":"Good customer service but very inefficient. When we got here we ordered our drinks right away (it took too long for drinks) and then we ordered our food right when he brought our drinks. 
It took way to long for our food to come. We asked how long and he said it was gonna take another 10-15 mins!!! UNACCEPTABLE! He said they had big parties, which is NOT true, all the people that came in was long after we ordered. Very disappointed will NOT come back next time we come to Las Vegas. 
 We're very frustrated."}
{"text":"So I came in at about 1 am. I was asked to take a seat wherever I want. This was difficult as there were about 16-20 tables which had not been bussed. Amanda was my server and she did an amazing job even though she was working alone. I noticed the Manager, Andrea, was walking between the kitchen and front area barking orders to Amanda but wasn't doing a thing to help her even though she had about 8 tables and no help clearly tables, seating guests or checking them out. Andrea should be fired and Amanda promoted to manager as she did all of this with a smile on her face and good attitude. Hats off to Amanda and shame on the manager!"}
{"text":"Food is great but service is not. (Hosts), servers are good though, it's just the people up front. They need to make their servings bigger too."}
{"text":"We can a Thursday evening, at about 9:30pm.

Terrible service.  

There was no one waiting to seat before us, still took us 5 minutes to get a booth. All the other 5+parties at restaurant had the same puzzled \"uhhh service please?\" Look on their faces. . 5 min pass and we're attended to  and  asked for drinks.. 10 min later, we never saw our sever again. 
We walked out. 
Will not be returning. Avoid the headache ."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast this morning and was totally satisfied.  I got the Colorado omelet and raspberry pancakes and service was good.  Good for a family breakfast."}
{"text":"After not getting a meal at another spot this morning, we headed over to IHOP in hopes of FINALLY getting a meal and they did not disappoint. I mean Jared took such good care of the 8 hungry women that came barreling into the place. It took all of 30 mins tops to get our food and that is from the time we walked in, sat down and ordered. Thank goodness as I am not sure we could have taken any more restaurant disappointments. 

Eggs, bacon, coffee, hashbrowns, pancakes. What more can you ask for? Fast, piping hot, cooked just right. SCORE! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Especially to Jared! You rock buddy!"}
{"text":"I want pancakes!! Yup that is what I said while attending a friends bubbly party. For some reason all that champagne had me craving pancakes. So after the party wrapped up my friend Matthew joined me while as I made my way over to IHOP.  We got seated immediately and our waitress was at our table within in minutes taking our order. I just had some plain ole pancakes with eggs, hash browns and bacon. None of those fancy pancakes, just plain ole buttermilk pancakes lol. My only disappointed was the bacon. Don't get me wrong, it was extra crispy like I had requested but they were the two smallest pieces of bacon I have ever seen. I had to eat them slowly so that I could bask in the yummy flavor that is extra crispy bacon. Oh and the pancakes, YUMMY! They were big and fluffy, just the way I like them.


All in all, not to shabby for a late Saturday night. Especially since all I wanted was pancakes. I was a tad bit colder in there than I would have liked, and it seems as I was not the only one who thought so because quite a few people had to put their jackets or coats back on to eat. Eh, as long as my food came out piping hot, which it did, then I am happy and for me that is a win in my book."}
{"text":"So I was pretty happy to have another breakfast place open near us.  I took my kids there this morning (for the first time) and it will probably be our last.  I would chalk it up to it being new and their working out the kinks but its been there too long for that.   We walk in and there is a total of 8 tables being occupied.  There are 4 more tables not occupied but also not cleaned.  I mean nothing picked up from previous guests.  One of these tables just so happen to be right behind me and it was pretty much 4 plates with 75% of the food still on it (like someone left in a hurry).  Our waiter was nice and took our order.  While we were waiting for our food I overheard 3 other tables lodging complaints for one thing or another.  Our food started to arrive and it just kept getting worst.  The manager was on the floor trying to put out fires.  She came to our table and asked if we had everything.  The answer was NO.  One breakfast made it all in one piece, another only half.  My order didn't come out at all but I did get some cold pancakes that I never ordered.  No silverware was another one of my complaints.  I could see the frustration in the managers eyes as she ran back to try gather up what was missing.  Got our silverware and she brought me my breakfast.  2 min later our waiter brought my breakfast.....again.  WOW IHOP!!!  This store needs to get their sh...t together"}
{"text":"Originally came to mccandless crossing to eat somewhere else.. Then we noticed IHOP and decided to head over there instead!

First things first, We waited at the host stand a little while. One girl was responsible for seating people, cashing out every order and getting menus from throughout the restaurant. One girl on a Friday night where a ton of people are headed to see the newest movies across the street. People just kept coming to pay while a line formed at host stand. Bad planning IHOP :/ 

Nathan was our server and he was a great server honestly. Very friendly and had a nice personality. 

Bobby ordered the Colorado omelet with pancakes & a chocolate shake. He wasn't a fan of the pulled pork but overall enjoyed his meal. The shake was pretty small for $4. 

I ordered the country omelet with pancakes (& coffee). The omelet had ham, shredded cheese and hash browns. It was huge. Coffee was good as well.

Average meal and awkward wait at the host stand makes me rate this IHOP 3 stars."}
{"text":"Came here on The holiday weekend. Service was fast and the food was really good I got an omelette that it was delicious pancakes are always good next time in Vegas I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the service or food here at all. When we were finally served (it wasn't even busy) our food was cold. The food seemed a little bland to me as well. Such a shame because other locations we have eaten at the food was good and hot. I personally wouldn't go back here again."}
{"text":"Food was OKAY I guess... But I was able to download the Yelp app, reset my password for Yelp, and write this review before my check came. Unsatisfied."}
{"text":"We had a good experience for being here the 1st time. The food was good. I had only 2  things to complain about and that was:
1- the host dosen't know how to do her job. I can't see how 2 people sit on a 4 Top table and then she wants to sit us 5 people on a 4 Top. I'm not paying to go to a restaurant and pay money to be squished on a table with my family. I earn my money way to hard to accept that. And then instead of offering me sitting on the 6 Top, she just looks and has no idea. So I had to ask her what's up with the 6 Top? Really!?
2- your ice cubes/water is terrible. I had a club soda, because I don't drink soda anymore and it tasted terrible, then I asked my daughter to have a sip on her Dr Pepper and it was just as bad. I'm
Not sure how you can offer this to your customers and thinking they will come back again."}
{"text":"If I could give no star I would do so. I was so excited to get my food and then the waiter what was by the way the manager, serves my and my hubbies food with other plates sitting on top of my food. That is so disgusting! I don't know what the need is to carry 4 meals at the same time stacked on top of each other."}
{"text":"It's 6:11pm on Valentines Day, the restaurant is half empty and the hostess wants to sit 3 adults and 2 10 year old boys on a 4 Top table. You really do think I come to a half empty IHOP, and you want me spending my money by squeezing uncomfortable with 5 people on a 4 top? You might be able to do that with some other stupid people, but not with us and my hard earned money. I want to sit down and enjoy my meal with my family. Needless to say, the hostess did not spend a second to make us happy, while tons of tables were empty on the other side. Apparently the other half of the restaurant was closed for the night. No wonder this place has only 3 stars! We left, still hungry! Thank you IHOP, for all your effort and customer service."}
{"text":"After leaving a really crappy Italian restaurant where we didn't have any service at all, we drove all the way back home to stuff our faces with carbs.
Riley was our server and she was pretty awesome and joked with us a bit since they were slower. But she was very understanding and helpful with our \"customized\" order. Lol

Only con I have is that our waters dropped a bit low and didn't get a refill, and there wasn't a cashier, so we left the money behind the register, but I could totally see younger kids or something running out on their bill or something.

Had a great experience, place was clean and nice and cold inside. Not sure why they have such a crappy rating... Although I have been there in the past and it took forever for my food.."}
{"text":"I haven't been to I Hop in years, due to what I considered their lack of quality food. That was in Washington state. I went with my wife two weekends ago to the location near the Las Vegas Premium Outlet mall. I ordered the Chicken fried steak along with their Glazed strawberries Crepes. The server was very polite and the food came in a timely manner even though they were packed. That is the end of the \"good\" portion of this experience. 
I ordered my eggs over medium, they came very runny closer to sunny side up. I let my server know who offered to have them remake it, which I declined. If a breakfast specialty place can't make an over medium egg, I'm not giving them a second chance. My chicken fried steak was disappointing. I've had better in many other locales. It was tough, way too salty and just sub par. My crepes were drowned in this thick, cloyingly sweet strawberry syrup. The picture in the menu didn't look like this mess at all. I did ask the server to replace with a stack of blueberry pancakes because there was no way I could eat those crepes. I think a 5 year old may have liked them though! My blueberry pancakes came rather quickly, and now I understand why...they were undercooked and just gross. 

I had fond memories of eating at I Hop when I was a child back in Massachusetts. They have gone way down hill and I will not be returning. To top it all off, their prices are now outrageous for their low quality product. No thank you, I will stick to local, regional small restaurants that still  have an incentive to serve high quality, small menu, tasty food. Did I forget to mention that their runny eggs gave me quite the case of the trots within an hour...ugh!!"}
{"text":"Very short staffed which creates bad service. Very long waits after you order, especially waiting for order to be taken. Food is below average despite low prices. Our server did the best she could despite being a very busy day. Management is not very involved except to check out every woman that walked in."}
{"text":"I love coming to this IHOP. We have our regular server, Amanda, who is awesome. We eat here for dinner and I get the fir and  fabulous with harvest nut pancakes. 

They recently changed this but our favorite server was able to help me out and not charge me an arm and a leg.

The food is good and hot and have never had a long wait or bad food. The drinks are always filled. You will not be disappointed with this IHOP. Ask for Amanda"}
{"text":"Honestly, I came in during national pancake day & this worker named Vanessa was the most unprofessional, disrespectful, condescending person I've ever dealt with in a food service industry. Who cusses at their guests?! Who calls people dumbasses? I'm sorry, you are not performing surgery or doing anything of significance besides taking the number of guests and seating them. I understand people could be tired, but leave your nasty attitude at the door before you enter work! Unacceptable! I WILL NOT GO INTO THIS IHOP EVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Pancakes were good, bacon was ehh. Nothing out of this world. I expected better quality for $50... server was there... i saw her three times, when she took our order, when she brought the food and when she brought the check. Meh about coming here again."}
{"text":"Had a GREAT experience yesterday at our local IHOP. Busy as ever but our server, who I don't know her name, was pleasant, attentive and very friendly. Plus when we checked out, the cashier noticed Ron's military ID and we got a 10% discount on our breakfast. WOO HOO!!!"}
{"text":"IHOP is IHOP!  You either love it or you hate it!  The menu is filled old school comfort foods, but every now and then you get that one server who can make your visit awesome!  

Our server was Ms. Dee!  She was Outgoing, Spunky, Attentive and  with a contagious outlook on life!  She made us laugh and feel as though we were the only customers in packed room.  Thank you Ms Dee!!! 

As for the food:  enjoy the Sirloin Tips & eggs.  The onions have made the sauce sweet!  Substitute the bland pancakes with a single Nutella Crepe!"}
{"text":"I love the I Hop on Happy Valley and Prescott Valley, Arizona.  My favorite breakfast is the classic breakfast crepes! They are so good!  I have always had good service at both locations!"}
{"text":"We walked in and were seated. We decided what we wanted to drink and what we wanted to eat. A server never came so we waved down a waitress. Her name was Eva and she was very kind and apologetic to us. She brought us our food quickly, and made sure we had refills, even though we weren't seated in her assigned section. Will return in the future."}
{"text":"The only thing I would like to comment on was the professional service we received at Ihop from our server Valerie. She made sure cups was full and that everything was ok . If something was not right she would correct and make sure it was the best product that came out the kitchen.  Job well done!!!!

Food was great as well"}
{"text":"The \"MANAGER\" made my breakfast wrong. The \"steak\" omelette only had 3 pieces of steak and no hash browns. STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"For being relatively new this place is pretty depressing. The service was slow, our table was covered in maple syrup, the portions were small and the staff was rude. I have no idea why this place is packed constantly."}
{"text":"Let me tell you when I say, we had THE BEST waitress in the world today!  Her name is Mickie and we are blown away, right now.  She was so polite, kind, funny and tentative.  She made sure to check on us, inform us of any specials and reassured us that she was here for us.  I know we've all had good waitresses, but Mickie is special!  Did I mention how polite she is?  We will definitely be back and we're going to hope that we are seated in her section"}
{"text":"This location used to be better with its service. I came here earlier for just pancakes. I had 6 people attempt to help me. They were all clueless and walking around like a bunch of goldfish bumping into each other, including the manager. It was actually kind of funny. Someone needs to come and re-train these people because when I used to work for Ihop my store sure didn't run like this."}
{"text":"Greatly disappointed after trying a second visit within the past 6 months. Was hungry for afternoon breakfast, was seated promptly but after sitting for OVER 10 minutes not one server greeted or even acknowledged us. It's annoying and rude that countless servers walked past our table, clearly seeing we didn't even have drinks, yet not one simple acknowledgement. Upon walking out the hostess kindly told us to have a nice day little did she remember she just sat us 10 minutes ago. I gave  a ONE STAR for just her simple kindness."}
{"text":"Always great service when we go here. We've been to the east side IHOP and in comparison the east side sucks and the service is terrible. 

When I'm in the mood for breakfast foods I come to the university IHOP."}
{"text":"Back in the early 1980's, I had a wonderful and tasty breakfast at this IHOP. The pancakes and scrambled eggs tasted pretty good after spending most of the night traveling thru the Mohave Desert from Bakersfield, California. Place was clean and the staff was friendly. :)

{"text":"Had a wonderful breakfast here with my dad the waitress treated us rather friendly, promptly and professionally. THe pancakes that I had were definately well cooked and the coffee and orange juise were extremely delicious as well. The dining rooms were very clean, orgainzed and well maintained. Two Thumbs Up! :) Staff was not Crude, disrespectful and unfriendly at all."}
{"text":"I have to get it atleast one star. It actually deserves zero stars.  First off I want to say that I have been to two different ihop, and both experiences were horrible. Secondly I went with a small party,  there for four of us, and we were not greated when we walked in, the host was standing there ad never said a word. We waited a couple minutes and finally got seated.  20 minutes later we give our drink orders, 15 minutes later we get our drinks and order our food. An hour and a half later we get our food, and it was barely room temperature, we couldn't even eat our food, and the pancakes weren't even cooked all the way. It was not busy that night and the server kept making excuses. We never one even seen the manager until he came and moved us to make room for a bigger party. All together just a really bad experience, won't ever go back."}
{"text":"What a joke. Tried to eat here with my daughter after a concert in Charlotte. Met by a grumpy hostess, appeared crazy understaffed and although we were a party of 2, never got in. Watched 3 other groups leave then a drama display broke out right in front of us at the front desk with 3 waitresses losing it. We left and ate at B-Dubbs. You just can't do that crap in front of customers."}
{"text":"Went here unbelievably for the first time as its been there for ages.  I ordered the Belgian Waffle combo, While the waffles were awesome I found the bacon thin and eggs really nothing special.  It was quiet but for a place that serves breakfast you would think they would get some decent bacon."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Good luck getting waited on. A lot of servers standing around who are clueless. I finally told the manager as I was walking out the place couldn't get its act together. Done with it."}
{"text":"Server was not friendly, didn't say who she was, or greet us ... rolled her eyes, didn't come back to ask us how our food was ...which btw everything was COLD ... Won't come back!]"}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant many times in recent years. Usually my experience is pretty good. During my most recent visit, the employees were nice, and the food tasted good, but they messed up my order. I ordered a Build Your Breakfast Pancake Combo, which the menu clearly says should include a choice of any 2 same-flavored pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 bacon pieces, and hash browns. The waitress brought me only 1 pancake, 1 egg, 2 bacon pieces, and 0 hash browns. My husband and I had to argue with her a few times and point to the item in the menu. I think that the waitress did not enter the correct items in their cash register. For my troubles, at least I was charged a couple of dollars less than I should have been."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Ihop is my go to Post Workout restaurant. The Buttermilk Pancakes are my fave. They have an Awesome variety on their menu including Lunch, Dinner and Drinks. 

Try the Butter Pecan Syrup next time you're there. You can Thank me later."}
{"text":"I love IHOP but this location is the worst!
We will never ever be back. Except when we have people who want to take us there and even then we will suggest somewhere else.
The tables are filthy and the floor looks like it hasn't been vacuumed in ages.
While were there on 2 different occasions our food was served wrong and there were other customers complaining about the same thing. 
The servers stand there and gossip while your glass is empty. 
When I got up to leave my purse was stuck to the seat that had syrup and straw wrappers on it.
They are usually empty I don't see why the servers stand around gossiping instead of getting the orders right or cleaning something.
I do not recommend this location to anybody!
Red Rock Station isn't that far or Bagel Cafe if you are looking for a great breakfast."}
{"text":"I agree with other reviewers who said that the seating hostess did not acknowledge them. The seating hostess/cashier ignored my husband and me for a little while. I also agree with other reviewers that you cannot find your server when you need something. After I finally had my table, I met the waitress. She seemed nice. She, however, during the meal never brought a drink refill for my husband. The breakfast food of bacon, pancakes, French toast, eggs, etc. tasted good. The restaurant was clean. Because of the service, my husband left a $0 tip."}
{"text":"I went to breakfast with my girlfriend this morning and Brandon was our server. He gave excellent service and was very attentive to our needs as well as checking up on us regularly and just being an overall nice person. The food was great, the restaurant was clean, and as only my second stop at an IHOP I was very pleased."}
{"text":"I stopped in today at around 8:25pm a server walked up to us and stated the restaurant was closed for the evening. he didnt give a reason just insisted they were closed."}
{"text":"excellent service
 great staff. the steaks are always juicy and full of flavor staff is always attentive"}
{"text":"Always a good place to go for a quick and filling breakfast, I tried the harvest grain pancakes and my wife got the French Toast. Our waitress Cara was very attentive and was always asking how everything was."}
{"text":"This review is for the waitress I've had the two times I've been there. Imani is the sweetest and most attentive waitress I've ever had. Love her!"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, I really love this place.  It was recently updated so it is really clean and tidy.  The wait staff is really helpful.  The new menu has the calories listed and our server, Gregory, even looked up the calories in my garlic bread when I asked if it was included in the calorie count for my meal.  It is never busy so they get to us immediately.  They are really patient with kids, who can be rowdy or want to order for themselves.  Plus kids eat free with adult purchases!"}
{"text":"Out of state visitor and by far this is the worst IHOP I have been to. Took 10 minutes til I had to go get the waitress to just get our drinks ordered. Food was decent. The most horrible service ever waitress was rude and got things mixed up a lot. Adding that there was only 4 other parties in the entire restaurant. Just a bad experience."}
{"text":"Was staying at the Howard Johnson across the street, and even got a discount for showing our room key.  

Service was nice and prompt and food was tasty. Typical IHOP food, but instead of going with breakfast, I got a club sandwich and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Horrible service waited for a table for 30 after being told 5 min. Waitress seating people removed us from list without calling our name. Sit down and still no service have to flag down a waiter to be told it isn't their section   Never coming back"}
{"text":"The dingy waitress mixed up my ticket with another guy. I didn't look at my ticket until I went to pay. The woman taking the payment just wouldn't listen. I got stuck paying someone else's bill of 15.99 when I ordered the 11.99 sampler. I will never go back again. Make sure you check everything on your bill. Not sure if this is a new scam on older white men but that's the last time they will see me or anyone from my family."}
{"text":"This was an absolutely wonderful experience! Great service. Great food. I love that they have the low calorie options available. Really great experience. One demerit for needing the bathroom updated."}
{"text":"Always busy on sat good for them. Wait before seating was relatively quick today. Took 30 minutes after being seated for someone to even ask to bring us drinks....I get they are busy but geez. I used to waitress and RR so unacceptable to me. Another 15 before order was even taken and another 30 before food was even delivered. So unless you want to spend 3 hours at IHOP on a Saturday between waiting, waiting, waiting & eating....don't come here on Saturday lol.

Yeah I forgot they placed us in a corner near a \"swinging\" emergency door making an awful sound that screeched every minute...see my video....It's official the emergency door just swung WIDE OPEN (more han this before it closed again). Isn't that illegal?! Emergency exit didn't even sound alarm! It's windy here but they should still have properly secured emergency exit doors!!"}
{"text":"We took my inlaws out for dinner on New Year's day for  Friday's all you can eat fish.  This is the worst IHOP we ever been to the service was slower than molasses and the fish was so greasy and under cook in some spots. My husband mentioned to the night manager but she didn't care acknowledge the matter. We paid our bill and will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite IHOP location! I've been to many IHOP's because of wanting late night breakfast(or regular early morning breakfast) and this is the only location that never fails to give me perfect service! The different servers I've came across here have always been very nice and attentive on another level whether it's 3am or 3pm. The food is also great, I always get my bacon and eggs with side of avocados and banana-Nutella crepe! It's 7 minutes from where I live too so I'm glad it's the closest one because I really really do love this location!"}
{"text":"Egg was good. Pancakes were undercooked in middle but it was a birthday free stack or I wouldn't have paid. Coffee was watery and weak. Waitress was nice til she saw our meal was partially free..guess she thought not much tip..we tipped het well but her attitude wasn't deserving.  She acted like it was a bother to wait on us."}
{"text":"This iHOP had really great customer service. The wait time wasn't too bad for it being in the morning. We waited about 15 minutes just like they said it'd be and our hostess seated us. 

Our waitress mesmerized our order just by memory and didn't have to write it down which was cool. I've never seen a waitress do that before. She asked us if we wanted extra plates for my daughter which was nice since I was going to ask when the food came. 
She gave us refills for our iced coffee without having to ask which was really great.

My daughter was fussing and the other waitress came and tried to make her laugh and even gave her a go gurt which made her content and I really appreciated that. 

Overall great customer service. The food was great and can't wait too return!"}
{"text":"I find that this IHOP location is either okay or awful. The waiters aren't as attentive as you'd hope. I once went the entire meal without being asked if I'd like re-fill, let alone if we were doing alright. Sometimes you'll get lucky and get the one waitress there who is absolutely sweet. Other than her, though, none of the others are too nice. They were really nice about having a GIANT group dinner there for our theatre, though."}
{"text":"This place is a hit and miss experience.  The location is great.  Zoom off the freeway and I'm there.  Zoom back on the freeway.  

The food?  Basic Ihop stuff.

{"text":"So, I took the dogs for a walk this morning. I figured, while the weather is still decent, I should take advantage. I decided to take them to this IHOP, since the pups have been on their patio before.

So, after walking a mile and a half, I walk up to the IHOP, and wonder of wonders, their patio is completely empty. \"Great!\" I think. 

Then I go to the door, and poke my head in and call for the host (dogs, right?).

Only to be informed that dogs are not permitted on the patio! Huh? Who are they going to disturb - there was nobody there! Could there be a connection?

In a city as pet friendly as Scottsdale ( where it's not unusual to see dogs of all sizes in high end boutiques and salons), not allowing dogs on the patio is nearly seen as a crime (or very rude, at least). The fact that there were no customers on the patio on a beautiful 77 F morning shows how true this is. It is a sign of extremely poor management decisions to reduce their customer base so significantly.

With such a lack of intelligence on management's part on this area, I would imagine it is endemic to the entire restaurant experience. 

Even though I didn't eat there, I can't imagine that my rating is out of line to the customers that to choose to go in."}
{"text":"Ya this ihop really is the worst. Starting with the bad attitudes of the staff and followed up with extra oily food.  Including oily hash browns . oily pancakes.  Bacon ham sausage drenched in oil. Coffee was bad too. Jack in the box is better."}
{"text":"If you like. Cold sausage, cold eggs, and hash whites rather than hash browns....this is the place for you.  This is getting to be the signature of I hops they used to be great."}
{"text":"Overall...lacking.

This location is one of the more, let's just say hood. It could use a facelift.

The service, no matter where the establishment is located should still be consistent across a chain like this. Unfortunately my experience here was not pleasant, the waiter, Victor, seemed distracted the entire time. I do not know what he was going through personally or if he was simply gazing out the window wondering what his other options where apart from the service industry. What ever his issue was our order(in my party of three) was incorrect. Two out of the three specials ordered were served with the incorrect food items. I had to wait and wait and wait and oh yeah wait for him to come back for me to inform him of the issue. I asked for the correct food on my order again had to wait. When the second order finally came it was not cooked to my request. The bacon wasn't crispy like I requested and the eggs were too runny. I know the cooks/chefs in the back know how to prepare the food correctly, the order was simply not communicated correctly. I ended up sending it back and leaving hungry. The management didn't even bother addressing the issue either. Needless to say I will not be returning to this location. Get it together Vic!"}
{"text":"This place is worst than the usual IHOP. Slow service and cold food. Food just throw together."}
{"text":"It seemed like everyone wanted pancakes this morning.  Lol, the ihop was packed. Service was subpar at best. Long wait. The strawberry, banana french toast was delicious and the best part of my ihop experience."}
{"text":"IHOP - this chain restaurant brings back memories of meals with grandparents and post SAT brunch with friends... or was it OHOP?  I can't remember, but either way, you can't go wrong at IHOP if you're in the mood for breakfast.

I happened to pop into this location for a breakfast meeting on Wednesday morning.  My companion and I were probably the only patrons under the age of 65, but that didn't stop us from having a good meal.  I ordered an egg white omelette (yes, they do have egg whites if you ask even though they are not on the menu) and 2 Harvest Nut 'N Grain pancakes.  Yum!  Portion sizes were so humongous that I couldn't even finish more than 1/2 of either item.  The pancakes were delicious - and the waiter brought me margarine instead of butter and a sugar free syrup as well.  I can almost talk myself into believing that this was a guilt free breakfast, but not quite!

Service was fine... our waiter was sweet and i was pleased that everything arrived exactly as we ordered it.  3 stars because it's a chain but it's a consistent one at that - I would not hesitate to return!"}
{"text":"The wife and I ate breakfast at this location today. It has-been a while since we have eaten at any IHOP. What a disappointment. The bacon was paper thin, the ham portion was extremely small. However the sourdough toast was fresh and soft on the inside. The worst part of the meal was after 2 hours we both have stomach cramps and diarrhea."}
{"text":"Tried coming in to have dinner and the whole restaurant had only one server running crazy all over doing to-gos.  cashier.  Serving good . and sitting guest .  no manager at all on the floor trying to help him we decided to go as we already had waited 5 min at the door waitting to be seated and never got acknowledge."}
{"text":"Service sucked asked for a booth and was told no there was some open so I left never to go back"}
{"text":"1 star but it should be a - star option this place was the worst I have ever visited ..... We decided to go there because at other locations never had an issue but this one in particular the manager I forgot her name but she has red short hair she yells at you even if you are next to her saying your name with a bad attitude plus the service is not the best the coffe is COLD , no choice of creamers the table dirty when I got my cup of coffee it was dirty it had pink lipstick all over I had to ask for another cup even, the food ok  they never replace the coffee when I had to take my kid to the restroom the restroom was DIRTY  disgusting .... Smelly  when I payed they didn't ask how was our service or anything definitely NOT COMING BACK TO THIS LOCATION ......"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. This location has a really chaotic service, from not being offered cream for my coffee or water, spent like a good 5 minutes waiting for my silverware after my food was already on my table and forget about being able to get catchup or hot sauce. And on my way out I got to see how they misplaced someone's lunch order, didn't even knew they gave the food to the wrong person and when the guy just ask for his money back they couldn't even find the ticket so he had to go and look for it so he could get refunded. Had a huge line of people waiting with a good 5 to 8 tables opened in the restaurant. Just not worth to step foot on this location ever!"}
{"text":"My first time to this location and very dissatisfied in the cleanliness of the women's bathroom. Please be advised these photos are graphic and are not appealing at all. Needless to say we kindly told our waiter we would not be placing an order due to what was witnessed. At that point we ordered an orange juice, paid our tab, and left. Photos were shown to her and she said she would let her manager know. Hopefully, cleanliness improves and employees do their part of maintaining the bathrooms! Photos would not post as part of my review however, are on the photos of the yelp page."}
{"text":"I needed to sit down and eat a nice meal - it was 10 pm in Scottsdale.  Chili's said no.  Red Robin no. Mimi's no. Portillo's no.  I don't like Wendy's and BK anymore.  Saw IHOP.  Saw 24 hr sign.  Went in.
Excellent waitresses.  Friendly and quick.  Excellent pop - I hated the $2.69 price point - but it was really good pop so ok.  U pay for quality, yes?   Had tilapia, spinach, garlic bread,mashed potatoes, and side salad-  8$. !  What?!!!
And it was super good!  Not greasy.  Not buttery.  Just right.  Fresh. Healthy.  And I'm full.  The restaurant was clean, too.
I never saw myself an IHOP kinda guy- but I am now!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent as well as the food. Everything came out perfect and was prompt. Will definitely return if in the area!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we are all totally aware of what IHOP is--mediocre food with mediocre service. Ok, fine. Nothing special to be expected, but sometimes ya just want some French toast. Anyway. This IHOP is ALWAYS disorderly, slow, rude, etc but tonight was just absolutely RIDICULOUS. First of all, I tried to call four times to place a to go order. No answer. Maybe they're busy? My husband decided to just go ahead and go inside and order and wait for the food. Except, couldn't do that either. He walked in and the guy behind the counter was in the middle of some completely insane personal drama ON THE PHONE just screaming and throwing a holy fit and completely ignoring the customers. I know this is Gastonia and it can be a little ghetto sometimes, but COME ON. Totally unacceptable. Tried to call corporate to file a complaint but of course there was no answer."}
{"text":"My husband  an I went there for vets day, 
He got his free pancakes,  an I got stuffed French toast , not sure what is was filled with  i tasted no filling... eggs were good bacon was kind of cold an coffee left a bitter taste in my mouth.. service wss great , she thanked my husband for serving!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. 

We come here at least once a month at around 1pm. For two years, we haven't gotten a very good experience with them but we don't complain and kept going because it's close to our church. Today however is different or worse than usual. I asked if they would honor the birthday freebie emailed to me while showing it from my phone and the guy at the reception said yes. We ordered our food which was almost the same every time except for the pancakes that come with the meal when you choose their specials. My husband's breakfast was served COLD , my eggs were raw when I ordered for over medium and I got the wrong crepes. Still, we were very patient and asked for what we initially ordered. My two kids and husband were already done eating when they finally gave me the crepes. Then came the bill and everything was ala carte as opposed to the special meal combos that we were pointing at on their menus while we were placing orders. Of course it was more expensive which we could afford but just surprised because it's not exactly what we have expected as that was not the price of what we have ordered. Then another lady in red which seemed to be th crew chief asked us if we were okay. And that they won't honor the freebie for myBIRTHDAY. This is a birthday bonus you give your customers. It is not the ONLY item we ordered for and we are willing to pay for. I don't understand the attitude that they were pulling. Then the guy at the check out was telling us that the waitress is new. We don't even blame her. The kitchen screwed up our meal. The manager could have easily straightened it out but won't. Needless to say, we did PAy for what we ate but we will NEVER go there again not because of the price nor the food but the behavior of the staff who could have been sincere in giving a good service if not excellent and should have been sincerely apologetic for their bad service. 

P/.S 9 out of 10 time we went there, the waiting for the food is always long . Today is no different . Just saying it matter of factly."}
{"text":"So I have been to this Ihop on several occasions and always had a great experiences. But on this trip we had the privilege of having Brad H as our waiter! I can honestly say for a 19 year old young man. He gets the customer service concept better than people twice his age! He was top shelf and made sure my son who has a dairy allergy was well taken care of. My family and friend will all return and enjoy this great ihop!"}
{"text":"the service was so good, I tipped her the rest of my $20 change from a $9 check"}
{"text":"Different name, same (sometimes) decent quality food and average service. IHOP recently changed their name to IHOP, as the International House of Burgers. When they first announced their name changed, I had initially assumed that they changed it to the International House of Breakfast.

Anyways, I ordered a skillet and that took about 25 minutes to come through. Service was alright. Waited a while to get the drinks refilled -- at the end, when we were all finished eating."}
{"text":"Went here for Christmas dinner. Out server was very attentive and quick.our drinks never got empty. The food was delicious except a small portion was cold. The side salad looked good but they need to use iceberg lettuce instead of the fancy stuff."}
{"text":"Do I like coming back here?  No.  But the husband loves their pancakes so we come here once every six months or so.  And I hate it more and more each time.

The service here isn't great.  It borders on ok to down right horrible.  I feel like it's a game of hide and seek with the waitresses here.  

On our last visit here, we were sat all the way in the back of the restaurant.  I'm not sure why, when there were plenty of open tables in main section.  But our waitress came to take our drink order, then delivered them and took our food order.  We didn't see her again till she had our food which was about 15 mins later.  We wanted refills and had no one to ask because there was no one in our section, staff or customers.  When she comes back with refills, she brings two drinks for each of us, which was a waste for me as I only needed the one.  The next time she comes back is with to go cups for us and our check.  And the to go cups were a waste as well since neither one of us asked or wanted it.  This was done so she didn't have to be bothered to think of our table.  And because we were out of her way since we were in a remote section of the restaurant.

Also the food is sub par.  Pancakes on average are decent, sometimes they feel a little too laden with flour.  Eggs always taste like they were microwaved.  I don't order hash browns, because they always come out burnt.

Also when I go to pay, there's no one at the register.  If I have to wait more than 10 minutes for someone, the food is on you."}
{"text":"Took a long time to get coffee and water. My suggestion is to hire a beverage waiter and maybe other waiters/waitresses can help out others especially if they are just standing around."}
{"text":"Love this IHOP. My last visit was a couple of days ago. We were sat right away. My server was awesome. He had a Spanish name I can't recall now, but he was amazing. I usually get bad service when I go to restaurants with just my little one, because most servers tend to misjudge me... thinking I'm a single mom, and probably not a great tipper. LoL. Anywho, this server was patient, and very considerate. I didn't even need to ask for a glass of water with my coffee. He just brought it out. My bill was small, but his tip was not. He deserved every penny. Wish more people were like him."}
{"text":"Went here with my husband,  son & daughter-in-law this morning. Iced tea tasted like it had dirt in it. Waitress forgot son's hash browns, biscuits were flat, gravy tasted like flour, eggs ordered over medium came out over easy.  Sent them back & they came back over light, almost raw!
What kind of breakfast restaurant can't make eggs!?!?
Will NOT be back."}
{"text":"They need to lose the balloon guy that always stares at my daughters to the point of being uncomfortable. Our table wasn't wiped at all so I had to have it redone ( or done).  Service was decent and food was good.  Place needs a very deep cleaning."}
{"text":"While the food and service were ok, we felt swindled with the Kids Eat Free deal. For each adult entree, a kid can eat free. We were disappointed to learn at the register that kids drinks are not included. Kids meals are $4.99/5.99, yet kids drinks are $1.79 each. That's almost half of the cost of a meal, so you're saving only $2. We still would've ordered milk, but the server should've mentioned that at time of ordering. Most other restaurant include drinks in kids meals. Super cheesy not to. Then we were also let down to find they do not honor military discounts with any other offer, unlike MOST other places that still offer military discounts on top. Denny's for us next time!!"}
{"text":"Waiting for table was not to bad. Waiting for our food was another story.  Did not get pancakes in time so I got them to go.  The place is tiny and busy. The food was warm not hot."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience in years! So upon arrival, there is a line outside so I ask my wife to get down and see what the wait is. She comes back out and says 15-20 minutes. Okay, park the truck and wait. 45-50 minutes later I'm asking the host & hostess what happened to the 15-20 minute time that we were quoted, \"well there was this party of 16 that is just finishing up so...\" I then let him know that if that was the case, why didn't he communicate that with us. So then he says it'll be just 5 more minutes and it was when we were seated in a dirty area. Our server brought us our drinks, but there was no silverware to stir our coffee. After we get silverware, then we fail to see our server again for a while. Running out of coffee and creamer, now we're without beverages while we wait for the food. The food comes out, but 2 people are missing their meals. 15 minutes go by before they get their food, both children, so that made them feel all warm and fuzzy. Oh yeah, ran out of coffee again. The children's food make it out and our server says that he'll take those off of the bill. When the bill arrives, he took off the least expensive meal (not the 2 that failed to show up on time), and charged us for an extra orange juice. I ask for the manager at this point and let him know that I've just had the worst dining experience in years. He apologizes and asks how he can make it right, to which I reply, do whatever is within your power. He discounted the ticket 25%. We lost over 2 hours of our day and more considering this is one of three feedbacks that I will be providing. The server said he knows the next experience will be better. There probably won't be another experience there, but I would hope that if there was one that it couldn't get much worse than that."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times and its either a hit or miss. This last time though the food was horrible and burnt.  Cook obviously doesn't know what over medium means egg was undercooked, hash browns burnt etc. I was gonna complain but felt bad for the server which was behind with all her tables . Please re train your cooks and hire more servers!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service! Been to this location 3 times now and have not had a positive experience yet. The food has been cold and it just takes forever. This last time I was there my whole table order pancakes, eggs, and bacon and that was it. We should not have to wait 60 minutes to get our meal when there are only 2 other tables in the restaurant. The waitresses aren't bad, but the manager wasn't the friendliest. Maybe she was upset that the three tables before us got up and left before getting their food, but there is no reason she should have glared at us like it was our fault the service was slow and horrible. Let's just say I have given this place 3 try's and I'm done. This has been horrible. I will go to another IHOP location in the future, but never the one on Lake Pleasant. So if you are thinking about going there just don't. Save your time and go across the street to Village Inn."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast Friday morning while my wife and I were running errands. It was a lot more crowded than I thought it would be. No problem, we were in no hurry. We were told about a 15 min wait. It took 30.

Once we were seated, we were greeted by our waitress quickly. She was very nice, and definitely knew what she was doing. The positive for this visit stops there.

We both had quick 2 egg, with bacon, hash browns, and toast. Also a carafe of OJ. The OJ was great! Both our eggs came out way undercooked. The bacon was way, way, overcooked. \"Hashbrowns\" were raw. Our toast had some sort of nasty spray oil/butter on it that just ruined plain white toast. (didn't know you could do that)

Then while waiting to pay with our credit card on the table, we sat for almost 20 minutes before our waitress returned for the check. Again it was busy, she was double sat, no big deal. Except that the \"manager\" walked by our table 3 times and couldn't be bothered to pick up our check and run it. He instead was sitting with what looked like some old buddies BS'ing while everyone else ran around like chickens with their heads cut off.

No thanks, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Every single time I come here 10 out of 10 times I pick up my food and there's always a reason it's cold. This time they forgot to put the cheesecake in my New York cheesecake pancakes, so everything else is done getting cold while they re make everything else."}
{"text":"Food is good, hot.  Service is excellent.  I like the oldies music they play.  My favorite place to go for breakfast."}
{"text":"Wow.  I walked in the restaurant and nobody was up front.  Finally I was greeted by a hostess and was seated.  I was followed into the restaurant by 3 other families who got their food before I even seen a waiter.  Finally, a mgr came over and asked if I needed a drink.  I asked him why I was being ignored.  He didn't apologize and just asked again if u wanted a drink and if I was ready to order.  My drink went empty and I was never even offered a refill.  I had to walk up front just to get my check.  Avoid this place.  Service is horrible."}
{"text":"We visited this location to have a cool dinner out as a family.  The waitress stated when we ordered that it was taking a little longer than normal due to a trainee.  

However, after 45 of waiting on food we decided to leave.  

I would not recommend visiting this location for a period of tome"}
{"text":"Love this place and this location specifically. It has a different vibe than most IHOP's I've been to. It's a place for asu kids to come any time (open 24 hours) to get yummy food that's easy on my college student finances. 

Awesome tv's to watch any game you want.
Really nice and cool servers (ask for Nick, he's super friendly and fast) 
Great managers (Josh was attentive and personable)
Newly opened so it's very clean and modern looking 

It's an all together awesome place to spend your time whether you're studying late at night or taking your parents out for breakfast. You should definitely come to this IHOP right off campus."}
{"text":"It was bad, really bad! we were seated right away, that was the only plus to this visit. My husbands drink came in a dirty glass. All the food was cold-so cold the butter on the pancakes wouldn't budge, hash browns nearly raw, severely understaffed, the wait for the food was unbearable, bringing one dish at a time (nothing was cooked at the same time)-the waitress apologized constantly but didn't offer any discount at all. smh! lesson learned NO MORE IHOP"}
{"text":"The very first time I didn't leave a tip. I'm a very understanding and forgiving person, and always look to see the good in people. Not today, and not here. I understand it is an iHop and I shouldn't expect much, but this service was terrible. I don't even feel guilty about not leaving a tip."}
{"text":"Daytime female brunette management on memorial day has no business being in customer service.  Hire new staff.  I will never return to any ihop thanks to her."}
{"text":"Food was good, server was doing the best she could. I think this place is poorly managed! Took 45 min to get our food which tells me the kitchen is under staffed!"}
{"text":"Either my standards are low, or I'm a lucky secret diner. I love, love, love IHOP. Before this IHOP was built, the last time I had been to an IHOP was in July 2010 when I visited my grandparents in Florida. I ordered the Fresh and Fruity Rooty Tooty Pancakes then, and I promised myself that next very next time I went to IHOP, I'd order the double chocolate chip pancakes, without fail.

Fast forward to 2014. I'm signed up on IHOP's emailer, and I get my coupon for a free short stack on my birthday. I asked if I could upcharge to the double chocolate chip pancakes, and my server said it was on the house.

I've gone back to this IHOP probably 6-7 times, and I've never had an issue here. I always order breakfast foods here, just because that's the kind of food I like. Plus, if I eat pancakes, I can justify exercising that day (although IHOP's pancakes are only about 200 calories each). My food is always hot, and the service is always at least average, considering the patronage that day.

I don't know if I'd order off the lunch or dinner menu here; I really don't. Do they still have country fried steak as an entree? I might go ahead with this once just to say I did it.

Eat 'n' Park makes a good pancake. Shop 'n' Save makes a good pancake. Bob Evans can make a good pancake depending on the day. I don't know about Perkins; don't care. IHOP makes a FANTASTIC breakfast meal, and they're worth the drive from Cranberry if you ask this obese man.

{"text":"Horrible service. Friday night workers are rude. They threw away our food that we payed for & didnt want to answer the phone. Me & my family will Never go back!"}
{"text":"This was our last Las Vegas meal before shopping at the outlets and heading back home.  We got there on a Thursday morning around 11:00am and this place was BUSY!!!  We got seated right away at a small table.  They really pack you in...I was back to back with a stranger at another table but at least we didn't have to wait.

The boyfriend got the Veggie omelette and I created my own.  We upgraded to the blueberry pancakes and the strawberry and banana pancakes.  The food was really good and if we hadn't been so hungry we could have shared one omelette and that would have been enough.

The reason that this place didn't get a fourth star was because for two omelettes, two coffees and two orange juices it cost $45.00 (not including tip).  With tip our breakfast was $54.00!!!  That's outrageous.  I guess I was SO hungry when we came in that I wasn't checking the prices closely enough.

Even though the food was good and so was the service I didn't feel like it was worth the price.  Next time I'll just go to the hotel buffet!"}
{"text":"Food is great, service is slow...7am hardly anyone here and I'd took 15 minutes to get my drink order in, and no one knows the WiFi password...wth"}
{"text":"Place is not bad. Came in n around 1pm place was a mess. Coke tasted funny. The staff was friendly . The tables are all worn out n smells. The food was  average IHOP has gone down hill. I think I'm going to go next door to jack in the box next time.."}
{"text":"Waitstaff was super friendly.  Food was great \"diner\" style, no surprises.  Pancakes were just great, coffee was hot and plentiful.  Food arrived fast - and my waitress even offered to HEAT UP MY SYRUP!!!  Place was extremely clean - I really liked this place. 

I ordered the chocolate chip pancakes and they were fantastic.  Waitress was very tentative to our needs.  I'll be back, for sure."}
{"text":"I come here about once every 2 months. Now I know why....We came in at around 10 am , the place was dead only 2 other ppl. We were finally sat and then sat and sat and sat. It took 20 minutes before the waitress came over to ask our drink order, by that time we were already ready to order. My BF got the big steak breakfast burrito and I got the all american breakfast. Lets start with my food...It was cold, the bacon was RAW! My BF on the other hand was hot but the only steak in his burrito was 4 slices on top, the burrito was stuffed full of mushrooms and onions. We did get the check quick and when I told the girl at the register that they might want to give the cook a heads up the bacon was raw; she took off 5%...not much but the gesture mattered."}
{"text":"Packed house on a Saturday morning. Never going there again for a Saturday breakfast. 45 minute wait then they gave our table to someone else. WTH!!!"}
{"text":"Disgusting conditions, ghetto customers and waitstaff. Met a friend halfway between our houses for breakfast- this was the location. Hot waiting area overcrowded with horribly behaved kids and parents. We were sat after 30 mins at an awkward table practically on top of another couple. Our table and chairs were sticky and stunk like a mildew rag. Floor was visibly dirty. I watched a kid at the table across from us sticking his crayons and bits of paper in the flavored syrups on the table. Food took too long to come out. My eggs were raw when I ordered over medium. My friend received the wrong order entirely. Our waitress was inattentive and rude. I would never return here under any circumstance. I have serious concerns about how unsanitary the conditions were!!"}
{"text":"This is a IHOP that opened in 2016. Unfortunately the last few times I\"ve visited it seems like there isn't enough staff. They could really use more experienced staff and a strong manager to support them. It's a great location, but at present, the wait to be seated, served and fed is extremely long , which is unlike the IHOP franchise."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with my family. The service and food was great. The only reason I gave 4 stars was because the wait is kinda long."}
{"text":"Took my bro and sis out for breakfast service was great. I had the red velvet pancakes they were nice and fluffy.. Didn't even taste like I was eating pancakes lol. It was very relaxing..."}
{"text":"Customer service was bad the food was cold we sent back several items due to being cold. I have never sent more than one plate back at any other establishment in my life it was almost embarrassing to ask for a decent plate of food. Please save yourself the hassle and go to another location. Waitress name was Maria."}
{"text":"After being seated (in the back), of the restaurant and watching waitress D walk back & forth about 5 times, we were rescued by A.  A was called into work 30 minutes early (lucky for us).  She was on the ball, took our drink orders, then checked on the patrons at the other 2 tables that had been ignored by waitress D. Next, she made the rounds and took our orders.  If she hadn't come in early, we would've walked out.  When paying our bill, I spoke with the manager expressed how pleased we were with A and how displeased we were with D."}
{"text":"La comida es buena .el servicio excelente ,   pero le falta limpieza y mantenimiento a este lugar"}
{"text":"Our servicer Marika (sp) was fantastic. Wonderful service, great food.  We were all very hungry after an exciting day. Every plate was clean when we were ready to leave. We'll come back here for Breakfast."}
{"text":"Ok it's been awhile since I've been here. I wasn't to thrilled the first time and must say I wasn't thrilled this time either.  We ordered 4 meals had to send back eggs because they had chunks of meat on them and the strawberry French toast because the strawberries were frozen.  After sending things back they were fixed our waiter was never around for refills asked for a pot of coffee never came had to ask for silverware and napkins took 5 minutes for those and this was mid afternoon with no rush."}
{"text":"I love this place! Servers are nice and very attentive. The food is always good, specially the omeletes! I would recommend this place to anybody and everybody!"}
{"text":"So I treated myself to breakfast, and was brought to tears... by the excellent service Jared gave me... It's so hard to eat alone bc I often get forgotten and ignored. Jared took excellent care of me, even though the restaurant was packed. I am very grateful. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I dont expect much when it comes to chains in terms of fresh veggies but, i ordered a garden omelet anyhow. The veggies tasted so fresh and the dish was really light. 

Service was mediocre for a not super packed restaurant but, it wasnt terrible either. 

All in all, a delicious Sunday breakfast."}
{"text":"Worst IHOP I ever been to in my life. I first went here when I moved to Madison last June, the food was awful, cold, and the omelet was super dry and tasteless. Well my family came to visit me today and insisted we go there although I warned them but we ended up going. The waitress had a major attitude problem and avoided eye contact with me the whole time, I asked her for more water and she rolled her eyes and walked away huffing and puffing. As for my meal, the pancakes were burnt and super cold!  They never bring out warm/hot food!! I will never go back again."}
{"text":"LISTEN LINDA

I called in an order Saturday or Sunday morning around 11am for a veggie omelet with pancakes (w. peaches) and a side of hash browns. Das it. I'm told it'll be ready in 15-20min. Cool. So here we go:

Got there about 30min after my call and paid for my order and was told to wait as it wasn't ready. That's fine. Perfection takes a little time or something like that, I forgot how the saying goes.

The girl (and I say girl as she was a smooth 15/16) at the front desk was being extremely unprofessional. And not in a festive \"it's 3am at wafflehouse and you're drunk and your waitress is super extra but you don't care cause you're drunk and she's entertainment\" kinda way. More so she was talking ill about customers who had called in, gossiping with her other coworker LOUDLY, just doing the most in general.

45min after I called in, still no food.

An hour after I had called in, still no food.

An hour and 15 after I had called in, mind you I've been sitting there for the past 45min waiting for my food, it finally comes. I take the bag and leave as I was tired of waiting. My gut told me to check the bag and realized there were no peaches for my pancakes. I tell the front desk girl, she does the most again and 5 min later someone comes out with my peaches. I head to the car again and find they also had forgotten my hashbrowns. I go back in and wait another 10 min for my hashbrowns as I also have to listen to the front desk girl complain about how they're so busy and orders have been coming out wrong all day. I don't feel like listening cause honestly I have the munchies and I just wanna go home and eat.

Finally leave with my food and get home just to find out I've been given the world's blandest breakfast food. Not an ounce of seasoning. 

So I had to wait a total of an hour and 30 frm the time I called to get my complete order, had to listen to unprofessional employees the whole time AND MY FOOD WAS BLAND. 

On top of all of this they did not go out of their way to compensate my obviously awful experience by giving me a gift card or a kind word or refunding me, nothing.

On top of all of this, there was a long black/brown hair in my hashbrowns. CHEESUS.

Easily the worst food experience I've had. This tops my late night McDonalds experiences dealing with cashiers who would rather be in bed. And McDonalds food. And that's saying a lot."}
{"text":"I haven't been to ihop in awhile. What was quoted as a 10 minute to go order, quickly turned into a pain. I had to keep asking about my order. Nobody answered me. I ended up having to wait an extra 20 minutes. I understand places get busy, but it's ridiculous when you ask a question and never get an answer. I finally had to ask the manager. Then I'm told they ran out of what I wanted. So you couldn't tell me, or call me. What a joke."}
{"text":"I love ihop...normally. The service at this ihop is horrendous. Not only did I wait a good 40 minutes for my food but I proceeded to have to wait at least 15 minutes for someone to cash me out. This is unacceptable. The food made me so gassy and upset my stomach, and the terrible service on top of that just made this entire experience terrible"}
{"text":"This IHOP location boasts friendly and relatively speedy service. I am impressed with the changes made to the menu. Menu items are mixed between traditional IHOP selections and what I would expect to find at a diner which is nice if I cant decide what I want thanks to ''options''. I have been to my fair share of IHOP locations and this one may be the most clean I have seen. If your lucky you may find me here devouring their bacon and eggs combo."}
{"text":"Was waiting their with my boyfriend for almost 10 minutes until we got seated. The place was empty the hostess didn't even bring me a menu. We just walked out worst ihop ever."}
{"text":"Worst place you can eat in Las Vegas!!!!!!!! I'm from long beach and visit I hop at least once a week and am very disappointed about this place 1st  they didn't allow my daughter to sit on a high chair because of \"fire hazard\" 2nd it took them 15 min to take my order 3rd I ask a server to a least get me coffee while I wait and she said its not her job!!!!! Damn if you want something to eat please go some other place....."}
{"text":"Very disappointed from my typical visits around the country!!  Service sucked!! Waited for ever to just get a glass of water.  Attached is my bowel if fruit, yep I had none, this is my bowl!!  Just horrible!!"}
{"text":"Cold French Toast. When mentioned to the waitress she brought back to the kitchen. She came back to tell me that the kitchen was making me a new batch. She came back with the new batch which had the same corner removed that I cut originally to find out that the toast was cold. Ok, it did come back hot (for at least 5 minutes). Toast was dry and tasteless. My daughter who is a IHOP aficionado told me that the French Toast at the IHOP in San Jose, CA is better, but believe me I am not running to find out."}
{"text":"Sunday morning before 11am we were there and it was packed to the gills at this IHOP. OMG, the waiting area inside was full, the wait area in between the inside and outside doors were full and the entrance has about 4 people stand around. WOW! We waited about 20 mins for 5 of us. 

The menus were sticky and mine had a smashed paper liner of a straw in it. The table looked clean and the seats were redone. The place got HOT, there was a lot of people. 

I got the ham and cheese omelet. It was a little dry. The french toast was pretty good. 

All in all, meh...."}
{"text":"After a long day (10 hours of test/scans) at the Mayo in Fountain Hills, I felt like pancakes so Yelped it.  You expect the food from the IHops to taste somewhat the same.  My sampler was good, but the pancake was not.  I was not sure what it was??  Batter is old?  My parents mentioned the same thing that their pancakes were not very good either.  So, I am not crazy yet.  The service was slow."}
{"text":"This is my first time at an IHOP in years!  I did not get breakfast for once.  I got the ham and cheese melt.  Not too shabby!  She let me get it with hash browns (I had to get something breakfasty).  LOL!  The service was fast and she came back many times to make sure everything is ok."}
{"text":"My personal review of the greatest pancake place around would be IHOP, the service was fantastic and they are very kid friendly!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. We came here trying to get a quick bite to eat after a concert and we waited what seemed like several minutes up front despite there were only two tables of customers in the whole restaurant. Finally the hostess shows up with no apology, a look of distaste on her face and I know they knew we were there because the door chimes in the back for them to know they have customers in front. But I gave her my two cents before I left out the door to go to Denny's instead. Did we really expect good service after that? I think not."}
{"text":"I am so a fan of this place, pretty good and consistent. Although I don't think my partner really liked his french toast with caramel topping, it was too sweet. Omelettes are the bomb, big and fluffy filled with whatever the hell you want. There are always running some sort of themed food and that's what I like about this place. I liked it when they had those minion drinks from Despicable Me."}
{"text":"For Mother's Day I ordered takeout and delivery as a houseguest for my fam and the fam-friends we stayed at. Everyone ordered individually and the food came an hour or so later. 

  The food was good; they gave us plenty of toppings and everyone seemed happy.

  It was worth the price, plus the Mom's didn't have to cook! A win all around and I'd order out like this again."}
{"text":"Server was ok. Nothing special. Should have been a little more attentive as it was fairly dead in there. Today I ordered the bacon temptation omelette. I'm still not sure how I feel about the cold tomatoes on top and the cheese sauce. Overall it's ihop. Not bad prices. Kids eat free which is nice. We'll be back at some point but there are definitely better places out there to go."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars, I would. Upon going in, the parking lot was trashy. When we got inside we had to wait about 10 mins for our server to come ask us what we wanted to drink. 2 tables who came in after us got served first. The servers are cussing in front of the customers and being very unprofessional. The waiter ended up getting our drinks wrong. This is the first and will be the last time I come into this IHOP. Save yourself the trouble and skip coming here."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! ! Absolutely loved our waitress Falan!! Great food,  great service! !!!"}
{"text":"This IHOP is the WORST I have ever been to!! And I LOVE IHOP!!! This is my second time at this particular one and both times they have been almost empty yet we had to wait to be seated/assisted AND the first time the floor and tables were disgusting!!! This time when I came in I literally waited 12 min to place a 'to go' order and there was NO ONE waiting!!  The 'manager', I'm assuming that's who he was, stood there and looked at us didn't say anything.. we asked to place an order .. he told us we had to wait. Another person comes to the register... helps 3 other people that have now walked in and the tells us..she will be right with us.. she goes to the back.. comes back and gets on the phone.... we finally place our order and 27 min later we are still sitting waiting! Nobody has asked if we are ok, do we want water.. or gives an update on the time we have left. We ordered coffee... 27 min in we are still waiting after reminding them 3 times of our order. They literally continued to walk by us as if we were not even sitting there waiting. THIS IHOP SUCKS!!!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed coming to this location. But this time it was totally empty when I got there. Stood up front for 10 minutes. It was a ghost town. 

We finally seated ourselves at a booth in the back near the back where the staff was enjoying a pre dinner rush vacation. 

They of course moved us up to the front so they could go back and hide again. When other people arrived and waited to be seated we had to alert the wait staff because apparently people showing up for dinner at ihop is a surprise to this group.. 

To all the waitstaff who has helped me before at this location thank you. But to the young guy Ron with the red and blue Hawaiian shirt who looks like he never woke up from his nap and his friend Laura with the braids on each side of her head and the slowest walk ever.... You suck and I want you to know I came here to have a fun affordable dinner and you ruined the vibe tonight. I hope you both quit. 

Thanks for making us feel uncomfortable eating at our family night out spot."}
{"text":"Disaster. Pure disaster. There was three of us waiting to be seated and it took two minutes to explain there wasn't a fourth person and that everybody was here. Ordered strawberry lemonade, got regular lemonade and was told the strawberries would come later so I wouldn't have to wait. They never came. Then ordered waffles with chicken and was brought the chicken first so I wouldn't have to wait again. The waffles took forever to be brought out. Then the waiter dropped a plate of food right next to my leg, didn't even apologize but rather cracked jokes about it. Two words: never again!"}
{"text":"We waited about 30 minutes to be seated, so I was surprised to see that more than half of the tables were empty.  Well, empty of people.  Full of unbussed plates, dirty napkins, etc. Service was a mess. Food itself was fine, but who wants to eat amidst such mess???"}
{"text":"Hey, it's IHOP.. what do you expect?  I'm not too big of the \"chain\" type places, but when I'm a bit sloshed and in for some late night eats, I'll usually end up at the 'hop for a bite and a drunken convo or two.  This IHOP is pretty much the same ol' thing: Pancakes, omellettes, and an occasional loiterer trying to hit everybody up for some change to \"catch the bus\".  Nonetheless, this IHOP was good in terms of quality of food and large group accommodation.  The service was a bit slow but we came a busy night and there were other drunks in the crowd so maybe they just had to spend some extra time trying to decipher the slurring and drunk bar jargon?  But the gentleman was nice and refilled our drinks often so I really don't have too much to complain about.  If the service was a bit faster, this place would've got the five star treatment from me.  Food was good and prices are decent... what do you expect? It's an IHOP.  I would cruise on by again for sure."}
{"text":"Despite what others have written, I have actually had a great experience at this location. Friendly service, and quick on a very busy Sunday afternoon/brunch time. They checked on our table every two min and always asked if we needed anything. Drinks here out quick and so was our food. Was hot and they got the order right, with no mistakes, pretty impressive. Anyways, hubby and I would def go back."}
{"text":"This is my first five star rating. Our server Miriam was bright smiley and energetic. She did a special order waffle for us and it was delicious! I live the theatrical way she poured our coffee. She even poured our refills!! The facilities were clean and the place was very busy but we were seated immediately. This is our second visit. We will always visit this location when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Food was great once we got it. Cooks missed up/ skipped our ticket so it took more time to get our food. Server was nice."}
{"text":"Over 40 minutes for two orders of eggs. Seriously? And then the toast was forgotten. Eggs over medium does not mean over easy!! Please! It's such a simple thing. The waiter told us it was due to only one cook, but the people seated behind us got their food in 10 minutes. Never again. How can they screw up such simple things?!?! Walked in hungry, left really cranky."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the worst IHOP's I've ever been too. Literally the waitress came to my table threw down the bottle of ketchup and hot sauce and left. I've waited over 20 mins for eggs and hash browns and when they finally arrived it was cold and nasty. 

I would think twice about this location. They don't even ask you if you want water just simply lay down the check and walk away."}
{"text":"Best fresh brewed coffee....  Traditional and always consistent. Simple order, e of everything!  Can't beat their infamous buttermilk pancakes. AND they have special sugar free syrup for diabetics. Clean and fast service. Got to love it!"}
{"text":"By far the worst French toast I ever had not even on brioche bread...second I ask for coffee and you only carry two types of creamer overall but u run out of French vanilla like wth!!! Won't come here again n the hostess very rude called her like three time and ignored me!!!!  NO TIP!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I can remember our servers name but he had nice eyebrows and a good haircut. We went in on our way home from Vegas we wanted to find something off the strip that was quite and this IHOP was right what we wanted. Our server was on point he checked in on us often and gave us refills without us having to wait. Restrooms were clean. Food was amazing I got the banana strawberry pancakes and I'm not a pancake person but they were delicious!"}
{"text":"I have nicknamed this restaurant the \"NHOP\" or \"Nasty House of Pancakes\". I went to this restaurant last weekend for breakfast. It looked like it has not been cleaned in years. 

The waitress brought our juice and coffee with her hands around the rim of the glass (yuck). Another server started sweeping the carpet (very old carpet) around my table. I saw dust particles flying up and thought of how many were landing in my coffee and juice.  

I decided I could not eat at such a nasty establishment. We left without ordering food. This place is disgusting."}
{"text":"I don't know what's going on at this location or on that particular day, but I'm guessing it partially had to do with the way the staff was scheduled. Maybe there wasn't a manager on duty. Maybe even a line cook or two called out sick? You see, I can only speculate because no one ever offered us a reason as to why it took over 50 minutes for our food to arrive. There were somewhere around 15 servers for a half-empty restaurant, and yet no one around us had food either, and many were still holding menus and looking around, even though they were there before us. Our waitress was new, which I am always extra patient about, but she was rude and simply didn't use common sense. On the way out, another woman approached a server and asked why her food hadn't arrived after 45 minutes, and the server just shrugged. The food was okay, but not great. I had ordered a side of bacon which didn't show up with the meal. When I asked about it, the server told me I wasn't allowed to get that side because someone told her the meal doesn't come with bacon. I said \"but I specifically ordered it as a side.\" She said \"You could've done that I guess if you paid extra for it, but it's too late now.\" Then right as she walked away, 2 sad, limp strips of bacon were brought out on a plate for me. Will never be returning here."}
{"text":"I am so frustrated!!!! I brought my 9 & 7 year old so they could eat fast.  It took 25 minutes after we ordered and the food had to be remade.  Grrrrr"}
{"text":"Shitty service, shitty food and even worse management! I was there a few weeks ago with a party of 9 including 4 kids. First of all we waited One hour to get seated. I know that, that in part is out of Ihop's control. After 30 min of My very hungry and impatient niece aproached the hostes stand to ask how much longer, she was told \"I didn't know\" in a very rude way and then was shooed away. Finally after 30 more min of waiting we were finally seated. We placed our ordered and waited AGAIN for another hour before we finally got our food. People who arrived after us,  got seated,  fed and left before we finally got our food.  When we finally got our food, it was horrible! My Ham and Egg melt was disgusting! The ham was black,  it looked like the grill hadn't been cleaned in weeks, and the cheese on a grilled cheese wasn't melted. What kind of grilled cheese is not toasty and melty? After taking to the rest of the group we agreed on talking to a Manger to address the issue. I got up asked to speak to a manager, she was at the cashiers station. I start to talk and all I get to say is \"Our service was\" she then takes my ticket and says I'll take care of it. I again try to get a word in,  I start to say that the food was horrible and something about the wait. She says to me \"I get it,  you waited, and didn't like it. I'll take care of it\" I wasn't looking for my ticket to be taken care of. I wanted to address the issues so that they can be fixed. Needless to say I won't be going to this Ihop again!"}
{"text":"For some reason in Charlotte, when the hostess tells you the wait will only be 10 minutes, it'll actually be 30 minutes. This was the 2nd time this happened in two days at two different establishments. -_- 
I have never been a fan of IHOP, but will go when majority rules. Coffee is watered down, syrup bottles sticky, food mediocre at best. I got the Harvest Grain 'N Nut pancakes.. I don't really know why, but I wasn't feeling anything on the menu. Pancakes were slightly soggy and only bearable with a large helping of syrup. Hashbrowns lacked flavor and had to be doused with ketchup and hot sauce. There was a lot of hope for the New York Cheesecake Pancakes at my table..everyone was disappointed.  I suppose this place is only good if you're just looking to get really full. Service was decent, not stellar, but it's an IHOP, so it was decent."}
{"text":"been here twice now and dont plan to EVER go back.
the staff is very nice, and thats about all for whats good there.
horrid customer service.
it takes forEVER to get your order in, to get someone to your table, get your check, get your food, etc.

the locations pretty good and i would assume they could do good business but i recommend retraining staff or rehiring people with at least SOME common courtesy and good customer service experience..

unimpressive."}
{"text":"Food was cold and clearly they were unorganized it was just a party of 1 and it took almost 2 hours from the time I got seated, ordered, served, checked out! All I ordered was a plain burger and fries so idk"}
{"text":"Today is March 13th it is 944 am, I just left this specific location, about 10 minutes ago.

I sat down at my table and the hostess got me my orange juice around 910 am. I sit around for a while and realize that some time has gone by no one has talked to me yet. I look at my phone its 917, ok, now I see people who have been seated after me are getting their orders taken......927 still no contact, not hi hello, hey were sorry just busy (which it did not seem like when I was first seated) 930 I see another person seated contacted before me

I go to the front and tell the hostess I would like to pay for my orange juice and go, I'll go eat somewhere else, she disappears I assume it's to go figure what happened, another lady comes up and asks me what's going on I just say I would like to pay for my drink and leave, she senses I'm upset and says the drink is ok. I leave. There was a man at the front at the register he didn't seem to care what was going on

This is completely unacceptable as someone who has worked in service for many years to not even be contacted BY ANYONE is a complete failure at your job. I doubt anyone will care cause they are such a large chain what's one person like me gonna do, just go somewhere else other than here

{"text":"i was craving breakfast food so decided to stop by here. the place clean, staff were friendly and it was steady. i ordered the chicken and waffle. it was good but not compared to other places that serves it. our waiter was so quick to give our check to us. she gave it to us right after she brought our food. I felt rush. so after you're done. You gotta take your check up to the front counter to pay."}
{"text":"Drove 18 hours from Florida back home to PA and stopped at this IHOP at 4:30am. Blonde server seemed very disinterested. She sat us at a dirty table, next to a blasting speaker which I asked if she could turn it down. She couldn't, which was fine but she wouldn't even move us- the only table in the restaurant. We order 2 waffles and,I kid you not, there was a mosquito baked in the waffle clear as day. She didn't offer to get us more or take any togo, we just left. I work at a restaurant and this was a completely awful experience. I'll be calling the manager in the morning"}
{"text":"Yea, not sure coming back anytime soon...took forever for a server to take our order, we even let the manager know, which by the way seemed like she didnt give a crap.  Finnaly got a server and she was actually nice and fast, I'm sure the  annoyed look on my face helped a little.  Some of the waitresses seemed a little gangsta with hickeys on their neck, like for real?! Then again this was in a gangsta area so why am I surprised."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Jenelle was our server, she was so polite and kind! She is the reason why we are posting a review because of her kind service."}

Update: Manager said it was my fault because I let it sit. I'm speechless. I didn't know chicken can become rubber like in 15mins"}
{"text":"4 IHOP stars. The place is known for pancakes. And the strawberry pancakes were delicious. Fresh strawberries lots of really sweet strawberry syrup on it with a dollop of cream. Spot on I also ordered a veggie omelette and it was OK. Lots of vegetables and cheese it wasn't greasy. For an additional $.99 I added avocado and it wasn't even ripe at all. I had a manager come by the table on the server check back several times and I didn't mention it either one of them so that's on me. 
Service was fantastic. The coffee was surprisingly tasty and they give you a nice mix of creamers. A nice place for breakfast for a chain restaurant that specializes in pancakes."}
{"text":"Nice friendly quick environment waitress was very nice and even on  Black Friday. Food was good and they split the plate for us"}
{"text":"Food is okay and service  has been good, but the hostess is way over her head everytime i come in. It surprises me that she gets no help. Its hard to give good reviews when you are irritated before you even sit at your table."}
{"text":"When me and on of my co-worker dined in for lunch. And we noticed they separated the gay couples from the straight couples. Then I asked my waiter can I get my drink in a to go cup because the cups were dirty and I didn't feel comfortable drinking from it. He never brought me the cup and told me I couldn't use a Togo cup so then I asked for the manager when the manager told me it was okay for me to get my to go cup."}
{"text":"There are precisely zero vegetarian friendly entrees that are non-breakfast food. I ended up ordering a house (side) salad and mozarrella sticks, both of which were disappointing. We ended up going to this location because we were in a hurry and the Red Robin nearby had a 45 minute wait on a Saturday night. We ended up waiting over 30 minutes for our food after ordering."}

{"text":"Ashley is THE BEST WAITRESS EVER!!! we brought our party of 14 in on a Sunday morning and she had our order memorized, managed to make recommendations, joked with us and did it all with a smile.  We never had to wait for anything and she was prompt and concise.  What a wonderful time we had.  Very impressive service."}
{"text":"I've had two different experiences and the only thing I can attribute that to with the limited knowledge I have is that is because of the crew working at the time.  Kenneth and Julieen who happened to be working on Saturday afternoon really timed it right for me and exhibited great customer service toward me in making sure the food was fresh even though I was late picking it up.  I gave them a call and let them know which as a former employee in the food service industry is unusual.  The crew working during the early week was prompt in bringing me my food but unfortunately not all of it was fresh, I still experienced a friendly customer service enviornment which is something I've come to know Ihop for."}
{"text":"I don't think I will ever come back!  We sat long enough to figure out what we were eating and then had to go ask for a waitress.  In the mean time other people are being seated and served around us.  Pathetic!  Our server brings the food and passes my plate to me, it's hot and doesn't warn me, burns my fingers. And my toast was not buttered.  He never came back to our table to see if everything was ok, just to tell us he'd be right back with our check.  The manager offered us a 10% discount.  I usually tip 20% but not today."}
{"text":"As of the date of this review the phone was not working. Since this was a take out order, that made me drive there to place the order.  Staff was pleasant however and the food was the usual.  I place alot of take out orders and it's 50/50 on order accuracy."}
{"text":"Walked in and the hostess completely ignored me even though I was standing RIGHT in front of her waiting for my name to be taken down. Instead, she started talking to the other hostess about how to pronounce someone's name, which went on for about 3-4 minutes. She could have said \"I'll be right with you\" or something but nope! The waitress was sweet but awful. My son's order was wrong but they fixed that right away. I had to wait on my potatoes for 20 minutes and didn't get them until everyone was done with their food. My daughter asked for ketchup which took forever to bring. Then she gave us the receipt for someone else's order. The only good thing was the food which was actually quite tasty. But the service SUCKED!!!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good.. I think. I was too distracted by how hot it was. We came here to enjoy a night with our family, which we rarely do, and it made for a very uncomfortable dinner. We couldn't wait to get out of there to our car with the AC! It is the middle of summer and we had to go from the heat outside to the heat inside!"}
{"text":"My daughter had little black bugs in her food, the eggs weren't even cooked, there was only one person serving the entire place, and to top it all off the food was delivered cold. It was like eating a meal in a prison... not that I've ever been to prison, but that's just how I imagined it. $50 down the drain... disgusting, do not go here"}
{"text":"You can never really go wrong with ihop pancakes. They are light & the perfect size to be paired up with the hash browns & bacon (I love the turkey bacon) for a complete meal. If I want something heartier, I like to order the steak omelette that is loaded with steak, mushrooms, potatoes, & cheese. 

The employees are friendly at this location. The one thing that is a downfall which I noticed at multiple locations is the fact it can take awhile to get your order. Even if the place is empty, I always have to wait awhile to get my food."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always gteat service. Even though our favorite servers are gone the new ones are quick and polite. We Always go in on graves and never have a complaint. They are just so nice. Food is always hot and just the way we order it. The drinks are never empty and the smiles are great. Love this place."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place only got 2 Stars. Every time that we come here, we have a pleasant experience. I do have to admit though, the wait can be a little long on the weekend, but it's expected. I would much rather come here than Denny's. The food is hot, and tastes as good as it can get for restaurant/fast food. Our server William is great! Very attentive. We will  definitely keep coming here."}
{"text":"The place was just kind of dirty, even the Parking lot had trash everywhere. Food was just ok, and wasn't served hot.  Soda was pretty flat."}
{"text":"We go here for breakfast often because it's right around the corner from our house. They have good solid food and pretty good service. My favorite breakfast item is the Chicken Vegetable Crepe with Hollandaise sauce. I also enjoy the Chicken and Waffles sometimes. It's not a culinary adventure but just an everyday place that is dependable."}
{"text":"2nd time at this location. At just before 3pm on a Wednesday, the place is nearly empty, but it still took 30 minutes to get our food which was horribly overcooked and under seasoned. I didn't even know it was possible to make scrambled eggs crunchy!

Will not be back."}
{"text":"Trying to eat breakfast while being swarmed by flies, the waiter hasn't came back to check on drinks, our order was not quite correct. Average at best."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was fast & friendly. This location has always been good. Never any issues. I will be back. I always have a coupon to use here."}
{"text":"I cannot comment on the food; the closest that I got to it was what I saw on the menu and on the unbussed tables surrounding us.

Seated for 20 minutes without a single acknowledgement by any employee, it was time to leave.  When I told the host what happened, he uttered not a word.

I would give this negative 20 stars; I am ashamed that I have to give it one. I expressed my displeasure on twitter as well.

Avoid this place at any and all costs."}
{"text":"Ok...   So it is IHOP not gourmet faire..  But this one is always clean.  Has exceptionally good service and generally just at the top of the IHOP food chain.   

Once in a while I just want a full breakfast... For dinner!   This is my \" go to\""}
{"text":"Update 3/11/18 : Another visit , same TRASH service . Online order says it will be ready at 10:43am , part of my order was on time , the other part was not ready until 11:15am .. How am I supposed to eat a partially cold order ?! Your service sucks . 


I've visited this location several times over the last 4 years, usually have pretty standard service . Today , our server was amazing (I always forget his name) and the food was great ! We got our receipt and went to pay . Jen (older Asian lady) checked us out and continued to say my card was declined . LOUDLY . My card has never declined and never would . I insisted she try again and she called another server over to help her . The other server stated the machine often gives issues when cards have chips - which this particular card does not . The second server showed Jen how to properly use the machine and she continues to express how it's my card and \"IT'S DECLINED\" . The machine cooperates and she gives me a receipt . No apology , no nothing . I will never return to this location or any IHOP if you cannot simply process a card transaction . Shame on you ."}
{"text":"I was craving pancakes so me and another friend decided to go to IHOP. The one near ASU was closed so this was our last or closest resort. Right when we walked in it was full blast on A/C. I love A/C, but man I was freezing, lol. The customer service was ok. It took about 15 min. to get us our drinks. The food came out in a timely manner, but I didn't like the crispy chicken salad I got. Crepes with strawberries was good. Overall it was alright even though the service was slow, but it looked like there was only one waitress there."}
{"text":"Service overall sucks here, and this was all before we were able to be seated. This place is ran by a bunch of idiots.
We put our name down with having 2 adults and a child requiring a high chair. The hostess took our name down, incorrectly, and only had us for 2. When we were finally brought to our table, with a normal expected wait, the hostess called out two names and the other group cut in front of us on the way to the table and jumped in our booth. The hostess just froze an idiotic look on their face and then shrugged her shoulders. She then found another table with crap still on it and said that it would be cleaned right away. Now during this entire time, I am holding my child, and when I asked about the high chair, she looked shocked as if she wasn't expecting us to need one. She said she would go find one, and never came back. We literally stood outside of our booth for about 5 minutes waiting on a chair for my son. After I snagged one of the workers, they looked around and finally came back to me saying that all of the high chairs were being currently used. 
I sent the wife and kid to the car as I talked to the manager. She seemed truly sincere with her apology but wasn't able to offer any solution. She tried to convince me to come back at another time for a free meal, but didn't take my name down or give any voucher, so I think she was full  of crap.
We went down the road on Durango to Babystacks Cafe, and they were far better than any ihop we have been to. Give them a try before this place!!!"}
{"text":"absouloutly horrible service!!!!! never again the atmosphere in here stresses me out by all the over worked staff if i could put no stars i would"}
{"text":"They just can't seem to get the orders right. First time I ordered a breakfast combo with 4 cream pancakes. They brought me 4 regular pancakes. I ate them, but told them it was the wrong order. The girl that served me (Brisbane), just slammed the plates in front of me without any eye contact and without saying a word! Next time I ordered the same thing, pointing out the order was messed up last time, so please make sure this time it will be the right pancakes!!! NOPE... too much to asked for, obviously!! Again she served me the plain pancakes, although I tripple checked, if she got it, that I wanted the 4 cream pancakes!!! The place barely had any servers and a hostess, that was nowhere to be found. I was waiting for my check, but after 15 Minutes I decided waiting at the cashier in the front for another 10 Minutes. Better go to a place, where the service is up to standard and the servers are actualy listening. They won't get my money anymore for sure!"}
{"text":"Waited about 10 minutes for someone to come get our drink order. Then I asked for cheese on my eggs, nope. I asked for English muffin as my bread, nope. And both my kids didn't get their sausage with their meals. And the hash browns were as hard as rocks.

Terrible service. Food was terrible. I will never come back to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Everybody wants to pretend they have freedom nobody is willing to suffer for it. I announce to the lobby as we walk in.
 It was one of those epic drink-all-night, gouge-your-eyes-out in the morning type of nights. We had been drunk for twelve consecutive hours. The clock inside Ihop read 4am by then, and we had just crash landed. Smoking cigarettes in the sweet morning making haste down the back streets of Maryland Parkway. We had a fierce need for pancakes and coffee in ceramic mugs. 
 I could hear the plastic clock tick away on the wall as they tried to sit us in a booth next to a crazed, screaming child.
 \"No dice,\" I told them, as they told me about their no smoking policy.
 We sat at our booth isolated, alone but for our coffees. Outside, behind shades I acted sober. But internal intoxication was driving me to madness, urging me to act out wildly.
 But we sat and ate our overpriced breakfast with great delight as the the staff loomed over us keeping each coffee mug full. Processed breakfast high fructose corn syrup is a devilish delight, even after this much debauchery.  
 Just as things were starting to get comfortable, in strolls a couple in their late 20's with two children. The youngest was carried by the dad and they strode in first. Behind them was mom, handling the reins of a five year old. Leashed to his captor, the child barged in quickly but was pulled to the floor by his bonds. The child wailed like a stuck pig, a sound which increased by about five decibels as the mother grasped for control of the leash.
 Unable to maintain control, our group burst out laughing with no restraint. The Hostess, also unable to restrain her self cracked the smallest of smiles, that the mother instantly reacted to. The family scowled back at us and the mother swore at us across the once wholesome restaurant, \"I'll spit in your coffee you fucking freaks!\"
 Just like that, the event degenerated into chaos. Immediately the Ihop management leaped into action to regain control. The staff seated them next to the other crying baby from before. We were clearly on our way out as the corporate mangers circled us, telling us we had to leave. I could only retort to the mother:
 \"Monkeys have more freedom than your kid.\"
Outside we offered to pay, but to our surprise, we found our sacrifice rewarded as we were told did not have to pay. We packed into our beat up sedan muttering; \"Nice way to get a free meal\" and then \"Who's ready for another drink?.\""}
{"text":"We had a business meeting and decided to get IHOP before we had to start work in an hour. We made a to go order on the phone and told them specifically that one of our items could not have pork because the person was Muslim. She asked if we wanted bacon or sausage. We repeated we couldn't have any pork in it. Once we finally got our order in, a member of our party went down to pick it up where they had to make it THREE times because they kept adding bacon. The manager came out and assured us that no bacon had been added to the final order. We brought the food back to work and lo and behold, there was bacon. I called the restaurant back only to be put on hold for 5 minutes and then hung up on. So I called back and when I was finally put though to a manager, I was told blatantly that I was lying and that there was no pork. I have never come across such an unprofessional manager before. Would they have been this apathetic if it was a life threatening allergy?! Absolutely ridiculous. Terrible AWFUL service."}
{"text":"First time coming here for supper and the service is what brought the experience to 3 stars. They sat us right outside the kitchen swing door which wasnt bad till we heard an employee fart.  So loud ny wife thought i ripped one. Plus i had a direct line of sight to the front door.  So the food took forever and the waitress had the audacity to say we just got busy...umm, im looking right at the front door and didn't see but maybe two people come in after us.  Then the bring out the blueberry pancakes on a plate that was for bread not two big pancakes.   Then the onion rings in a bowl big enough for a large salad.  We figured they must have run out of typical serving bowls.  Anyway as im typing this i decided to change to two stars."}
{"text":"Ihop for me means I have one pancake cause that's all I order, but damn, I dab that baby with some butter and kiss it with warm syrup...mm mm MMM!!  Mug is delish!!

I always get one multigrain bc I think that makes me feel less guilty.  This location always seems consistently good and this pancake was great (5/5).  The service is prompt and friendly (5/5).  Great experience!!"}
{"text":"Bad service no one was around for 10 min to sit us or welcome us no drinks were  refills  had to go to the bathroom to refill my drink of water no one even check to see if the food and  everything was okay . Which it was not fries taste like they were cooked in old oil. Top it off had to go to the counter to pay because  no check  was brought to the table all around bad experience"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep giving this location a chance. Most of the time I go in we end up having to wait forever to be seated. But today it only took about 5 minutes. It's still a long time but it's better than 20-30. 
I don't even know where to start. They are never busy but the place is always trashed. It took a server to clear off a couple tables in the time we were there. The server we had was very slow. She came up to us not too long after we were seated but then it took at least 10 minutes to get our drinks. Then she finally took our order. That didn't take too long to come out but we had ordered onion rings as an appetizer and they only came out a couple minutes before our dinner. 
The food was ok. But then not even a couple bites into our dinner she already brought us out check. I felt rushed. And we saw the server only a couple of times. 

The service is horrible and the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"The worst service that I have ever experienced at any IHOP.  The server took our order and it came out missing several items she said she would get what we needed and we never came back to our table.  I finally had to flag her down for the rest of our food but by then everything was cold.  Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Went to eat here tonight to find a sign on the door. \"Closed from 10-12 for carpet cleaning\". Seriously. Why not midnight to 2 when there is less of a chance of having to turn away customers. I had my mind set on some stuffed French toast."}
{"text":"Cold waffles runny eggs toilets that don't work.  This place once was a family favorite but they have really let their quality go"}
{"text":"Waited 19 minutes for takeout order of bacon, pancakes, eggs and cup of juice. The juice was not added to my ticket. Was told to pay for juice if I wanted it and was forced to wait an additional 9 minutes for it. Not the best customer service. No sense of urgency or empathy for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"Service was SLOW..
When we arrived there was a bit of a wait, although when I looked around there were a few empty tables..
The girls in the front were 'playing around' laughing and talking to each other rather than helping the incoming customers. 
Our waiter took awhile to get to our table.. He was having a difficult time taking our order. We ordered two things off the menu and repeated the order three times.
Our drinks (Water, Coffee , and Orange Juice) came to the table at the same time as our meal..
On the up side the Double BLT and the Ham Melt were both large enough to share, and tasty."}
{"text":"The food & the waitress were really good so giving 2 stars for that else the older guy with white hair & white beard TOTALLY disappointed me . My mom paid cash for our food , one senior citizen ( my mom ) 2 adults ( me & my sis ) & my 12 year old who is autistic. This was on the 10th of Feb 2016 .... When my mom was paying the older guy was upset that I found a $5 off coupon on I-phone & on top of that he pointed at my younger son saying why should I give him a discount ?!? Though my mom paid but he said he's only gonna give senior citizen discount for what she had . I HATE giving bad reviews but when he pointed at my son who is autistic & actually was well behaved throughout the stay there it really made me mad & I left the restaurant saying to him that I'm definitely NOT coming back . The waitress Aurrora I think that's her name , was wearing a tiny nose ring & very sweet girl ) was really nice & went above and beyond in order to cater us & our needs ."}
{"text":"Ok, where to start... I'll start by saying the food is good. That's the only positive I have. As far as the employees go, they're shit! Who teaches these people customer sevrice? Nobody! That's who.. Nobody makes eye contact, and they avoid you at all costs. The gomer they have running the front should be in a helmet and have a coloring book. All he knows how to say is \"Welcome to IHOP, table or booth?' Then when I say \"To go order\" he goes full retard... Takes my money (which was a chore in itself) and just stands there. I said \"Well wheres the food?\" \"OH\" he says, and goes to get it. Then he comes back empty handed and says it's not ready.... Mind you I placed the order on the phone 20 MINUTES PRIOR! And when I called, he told me it would be done in 10. So I sit. And wait. And wait some more. Then I asked again, \"What's the word on that order?\" He looked at me like he'd never seen me before and said \"what order?.... Oh yeah\" and walked away. Then, I assume it was the manager, finally brought out my food. Which was hot. Meaning they JUST made it. 32 minutes after placing the order on the phone, I finally got it. This is the SECOND bad service experience I've had at this IHOP."}
{"text":"We love IHOP.. just not this one. Terrible TERRIBLE service.. just so egregiously bad. I hope the management reads this at some point. We went to this location twice, 2 Saturday mornings. Ordered the exact same omlettes and coffee each time. Got the coffee but cream, sugar and silverware came after literally 20 mins, AFTER we asked for it twice. First order was entirely incorrect and had to be sent back. The server got my hash browns 10 mins before my correct order, stone cold by the time I could eat it with my omelette. 
We went on another Saturday morning: exact same order, incredibly incorrect again! Server didn't care at all whether our order was corrected. Both service and food was significantly below par. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Two adults and one kid equals a 40 dollar meal.  It's not like we ordered everything on the menu either.  The kid had pancakes and a drink, the adults each had an omelet and one drink.  The pancakes were great, but the omelets were super salty, and the ingredients were the furthest thing from fresh.  The service was horrible.  They kept forgetting things, and it felt like they were trying to rush us out the door, even though there was only one other table there.  

Another reviewer mentioned having to walk through a service area, and it's true.  To get to the bathrooms you have to walk through a narrow service area that seems awkward.  The bathrooms were nasty dirty, next time I'll just hold it.  

To top it off I got food poisoning and spent the rest of the day suffering immensely.  

Thanks International House of Poop!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!! Waited over 15 minutes to order my drink then I didn't even get my drink till AFTER my food came. When I finally got a drink it was wrong. The table next to me had the same issue. I cannot believe I WASTED my money at this place. Do not come here. Avoid at all cost. Spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"It was hot in the restaurant. I had the eggs Benedict and the English muffins were way too big. The ham was a fatty. It took 25 to 28 minutes to get served. Pancakes fell apart and we're not good; Took one bite and shoved them away... there were no napkins on the table nor any of the tables and I finally received my napkins after I finished my meal."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Friday morning. It was pretty busy  but we were greeted right away and sat down in about 5 min. I went with my husband and kids. Service was great throughout. Will definitely return when i come back to vegas."}
{"text":"Wait staff is very nice, but they were out of everything from kids menus to avocados."}
{"text":"The best we've ever been to. Hands down. Armando and Efran servers. We came multiple days and the training of staff here is the best. They are dialed in. I've been to a lot of ihops with my kids and this is the best one. I liked the one in Sacramento and Phoenix but this one is just 100 always."}
{"text":"This is the worst excuse of an ihop I have ever, EVER been to. 
It took then 20 min to even acknowledge we were there. 
 We ordered finally and it seems like it took forever for them to bring our food. The waitress forgot to refill our coffee and my wife's iced coffee even after we asked for refills. 
I'm not a petty guy.  I know sometimes things happen that are out of the waiters control. But three times I've been there 3 separate bad experiences.   I'm good   they need to tighten up. I'll try them again in a year or two until then the University area ihop is now my preferred ihop"}
{"text":"Typical IHOP. It's a clean fresh look IHop. Service and food all average. I am actually writing this because of a new dish they are serving, the breakfast crepe.
This dish was poorly conceptualized.  Besides being a cardiac surgeon's winning lottery ticket. It was 2 crepes composed of a dried out slabs of ham in each crepe and a microwaved slab of scrabbled fake eggs, wrapped in crepes and cheese sauce with bacon bits on top. Ok to look at, not at all delightful to eat.
Won't be getting that disaster again."}
{"text":"Usually I love ihop but this specific one is a nightmare. It takes forever for the food to arrive, and then you can't even be sure if it is what you ordered. This has happened to us twice now, so there is no way we are going back."}
{"text":"10/22/2017  Stopped in for breakfast.  I was greeted and seated immediately.  The server provided me with a menu and took my drink order.  I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak covered in gravy and  came with 2 pancakes, hash brown and two eggs.  The place was clean, well lit and had a comfortable atmosphere.  My order came out quickly and I enjoyed everything but I really liked the Blueberry syrup for the pancakes.  I don't know how something so basic as a pancake can be so good but I enjoyed  the ones  they served.  I was hungry when I entered but I could not eat all of my meal.  My server was always attentive and was quick to ask if I needed or wanted anything.  I read a couple of negative reviews about this location and I was apprehensive about giving this location a try but I did not have one problem and I would return and try some other dishes they offer.  I  would recommend giving this place a try"}
{"text":"12/3/2017 My only horrible experience at an IHOP...over 30 minutes to get our food, only after I got up to check on it while watching our server go in and out the back door many times serving someone else. Another server brought our food. Our server checked in on us and I reported our food was cold. Her retort was \". I didn't cook it...\". Really? When asked how things were when I paid ( which was a mistake as we couldn't eat our meal) I said it was 30 minutes until we got our food and it was cold. The cashier said \"That will be $20.38\". Enough to make me never visit any IHOP again. Save yourself some grief. Try Village Inn down the street..."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Ordered a quick takeout, she say's it will take 15min. Fine. I show up in 10min. The food is already done and the boxes are waiting on the counter. Great, right? NO! Because the hostess is nowhere to be found, the food is unattended, not bagged and left exposed to get cold. Meanwhile this drunk homeless guy is wandering around the front lobby where they left my food. He could have fapped all over my food for all they know..... 

Finally she shows up 5min later, only to forget the utensils. Another 5min later she shows up with utensils and I finally get to leave with my meal. Walk to the hotel only to find out they forgot the pancakes that come with the meal, the eggs were cooked wrong, and one of the stuffed french toast things had ZERO filling.......NEVER going here again! I might be done with IHOP period. Why deal with frozen crappy food that is way overpriced and poorly trained staff?"}
{"text":"Our server Tyler was definitely our guy! Very helpful, informative and super sweet! He even offered us to go cups for our \"never-ending refill\" drinks! Great guy, with a stellar attitude, helpful in all ways! Thanks dude! You are much appreciated!"}
{"text":"There is no line, but service was slow.  There were 6 unclean tables when I walked in.  They eventually cleaned those, but we waited at least 15 mins before we were addressed by any waitress. 
We asked for a to-go cup at the end.  Another 10 mins wait, and we just left cause we needed to go.

Foodwise.  4 syrups to choose. 2 of them tasted like medicine. (strawberry and blueberry). The other two (old fashioned / butter pecan) syrups were ok.  We had a steak omelet. The steak meat was alright.  \"Double blueberry pancake\" was very sweet.  The only good thing is mocha-flavored cold coffee has free refill.  The portion was big, I didn't touch my three pancakes that go with my omelet. 

At the end of the day, IHOP breakfast is typical American breakfast. Big, lots of potatoes, thick pancakes, very sweet drinks and syrup, and it's cheap.  But be honest, I rather have one great benedict than a big table of so-so. 

American breakfast is not for me, so that's a 4.  The food was ok, but not wow, makes it a 3. Slow service makes it a 2.  So a \"2\" it is.

Has \"guest wifi\", but not working."}
{"text":"Always a wait for breakfast and just ok food. At least a step above other breakfast places"}
{"text":"THE LONGEST WAIT EVER FOR A TO GO BOX OF CHICKEN AND WAFFLES ,we had to be waiting for at least 45-60 minutes and when the food came out ,they messed up the order and gave me fries and chicken now we're suppose to wait another 45-60 minutes igg if I could've rated this 0 stars I would ,while I'm making this review I'm still sitting in IHOP.Just go to Denny's"}
{"text":"Ehhh...I go to Ihop typically 2 times a month. Unfortunately, this was just an average experience at best. With all the other iHop franchises in Las Vegas I will likely not return to this one. The service was ok however, no refills were offered, I requested butter with my pancakes and never got it and when I was eating my pancakes there was a bit of raw batter in them so I did not eat that part which equated to one whole pancake that was not edible. When I went to pay my bill the manager refuse to honor the survey that I filled out for free pancakes. I am looking at the buffet at the casinos since the cost is cheaper than iHop and the quality is as good or better."}
{"text":"IHop is my favorite pancake place. I have been to this local IHop numerous times and I am always satisfied with the food and service."}
{"text":"Unbelievably bad service from a waiter named Shannan!!! He clearly wanted nothing to do with me. Once the only other table in my section paid and left, he disappeared! That was the cherry on top of not even looking at me when he took my order, and treating me like I had the plague afterward. 

Called corporate to complain and the franchise owner never called. Explains a lot."}
{"text":"Pros: The food is delicious and the servers are friendly and helpful.
Cons: I often have trouble paying at the register. It frequently takes several minutes for someone to come assist me at the register. What really sucked was on Thanksgiving. I chose IHOP for breakfast because I had a local coupon from the back of my grocery receipt. When I went to pay, after waiting 10 minutes for the cashier at IHOP to put the register drawer together and then wait on other customers, she told me my coupon wasn't valid on holidays. She talked to me as if I knew that and was trying to pull one over on her. She was not personable, and I was confused. After taking the coupon back, I saw \"not valid on holidays\" in very fine print. I felt embarassed and as if I had been taken advantage of. Not a great experience."}
{"text":"It took them a while to get us a table so -1 for that, this place is pretty packed. Our server was pretty Awesome so i gave it a 4, i forgot his name. Place was clean."}
{"text":"Never again!  Took a while to get seated (they were not busy). Took ten minutes for the waitress to take our drink order (I knew I should have just walked out then). 40 minutes to get our food. While we are waiting, the couple next to us sent back their sausage because it was cold. My sandwich was wrong, my wife's salad didn't have dressing, they were out of the dressing on the menu, and we had to ask three times before we could get our water refilled."}
{"text":"Food was good service was ok, water needed refilling and plates were left on table. I can't stand that it drives me crazy. Food did come out hot and fresh and the kids like the different flavors of syrup they have."}
{"text":"Quick service cheap food not outstanding but you can't screw up breakfast food that much."}
{"text":"Went after our concert and decided to give this IHOP a try.  We stood there, waiting for a table, for 15 minutes, without even being acknowledged. The staff were walking around totally obvilious to anything around them. 0 stars. Will NEVER get my business. You had one job IHOP, and you failed. Boo"}
{"text":"Good food for the price. Excellent customer service. Love the simple and fit menus for low calories choices. New spicy scramble is very tasty.

Good food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service. Clean and modern interior. We stopped on our way to the Hoover dam. Nice change from the strip cost and service."}
{"text":"Besides the fact that the whole iHop parking lot was flooded, and the only way to get here was to jump over a puddle, the place was pretty packed. Gives a new definition to the name IHOP. Service was quick and servers were nice. Thank you iHop. 
No wifi :( maybe they can work to get this done. 5 stars nonetheless"}
{"text":"Why does it take 40 minutes to fry an egg. I mean. Seriously. That's how long I had to wait for service. And wasn't even cooked right. I'm disappointed in IHOP"}
{"text":"This place keeps getting cheaper and cheaper evertime we come. They even down sized on the plate size. I never write reviews but this time it's out of hand. Im def not coming to ihop anymore after 8+ years of coming here."}
{"text":"Was seated right away.got coffee within 3 minutes of being seated. The waitress was fantastic! Very helpful friendly, and kept coffee full, and plates cleared. Food was fresh and hot. Honesty best dining experience at an IHOP I have ever had. Keep up the great work! I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. I've been here a few times out of convenience, but this will be my last. If you come here, make sure you smell the water. Seriously smells like they dip the glass in the toilet. Coffee mug smells too so perhaps they clean all their glasses in the urinal. Eggs were good. Hash browns tasted freezer burned and were barely warm. I left hungry and thirsty and on top of that, every time I use the restroom I think of their water."}
{"text":"The food took 40 minutes to come out. The waitress messed up my order because she was talking to another waitress and giggling. When she gave me the wrong order. She put in a new order and I waited for another 40 minutes. She came to me and blamed the cooks and wanted me to know that the food taking so long is not her fault. After 2 hours, my mom asks them to give me a discount for making me wait a long. They come back and only discount $1. I wouldn't come here again. The staff is careless and slow even though they are fully staffed. The manager doesn't care much to do something about her waitresses when she sees these things go one around her"}
{"text":"Our server James was polite and friendly. The food tastes fine and we were seated promptly."}
{"text":"Whoever made the food messed up the order completely. You're supposed to get what you pay for and frankly, this is less then what we paid for. The meal did not look appetizing. I got the breakfast sampler and there were only 3 bits of hash browns (if that). Plus no sausage, burnt bacon, and horrible eggs. I would never in my life recommend anyone to go to this ihop. Bad service, horrible food, and poor plate presentation."}
{"text":"We always go here when we are in the mood for breakfast! The food is great and great priced. I've worked in the service industry for years and trust me. These people work hard, they just deal with a lot of shit! A lot of people running them to death and not wanting to tip. And trust me we know right away when your gonna tip or not. You go out you tip! Period! Anyways our most recent visit we had An amazing server.. I believe her name was Kay. I'll correct it if that's wrong... But she's the older Asian lady and she is beautifully sweet! She did a great job and made us all very comfortable. The manager and the hostess also checked on us and we loved it! She got a 30$ tip for being a good server! People start tipping your servers! We heard that day someone tipped a young girl a dollar?! A dollar?!!!! Stay at home trash! Trust me it's better if we get stiffed! But don't go out and have these people work hard and then complain because you want something for free! Pay for what you eat!!!!!!! You don't deserve anything!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bf has had a love for IHOP's plain, fluffy pancakes for the longest time.  When he finally convinced me that he wasn't joking about this, I conceded to come here for breakfast.

This location was a little over a mile away from our hotel, so we were here in a flash and walked in just before noon for some breakfast.

Parking in the huge lot that they share with Firestone was a snap, and we were immediately seated at a booth in their air conditioned environment.

The menu was bigger than I expected - with tempting pictures.  It's been decades since I've even uttered the word IHOP in a serious way, so my tummy sat up and took notice.

I passed up the T-Bone Steak & Eggs and the Sirloin Tips & Eggs and eyed the omelettes.  The regular omelettes' egg batter has pancake mix in it, to \"make them more fluffy\", so I chose to get the healthy and fit omelette (not served with pancakes like the regular omelettes, but served with fruit instead).  It's made with egg substitute:

Spinach, Mushroom and Onion Omelette, add steak, no salt - served with a mix of cantaloupe, honeydew and grapes, this omelette had fresh leaf spinach, big mushroom slices, and diced onions and tomatoes.  It was fresh, tasty, and the added steak was pretty good. 

Bf had the Sampler - bacon, sausage, eggs,  hash browns and his beloved pancakes, which were indeed fluffy and yummy.

Bf's OJ wasn't fresh squeezed, but the service was very attenttive and the food was so frrsh that I won't fault them too much for the juice.

I guess I can support bf's love for the fluffy going forward!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the expensive prices and amount of food, as in the lack thereof! I used to love IHOP but not anymore. My daughter's BLT sandwich was dry, small, and cost $9.50. I looked through the whole menu and almost every meal was between $9 and $10. Too high priced for an IHOP. The non-stop talking waiter actually stood at my side and when I looked at him he was looking down my shirt."}
{"text":"Great service! The food was delish, my only complaint that it wasnt piping hot even though it wasnt crowded... We ordered the denver omelette burger/add BACON w the bananas foster French toast/YUMMERS! My bae had eggs, bacon,bacon, cheese cake pancakes and cinnamon raisin stuffed french toast.. Standard stuff but tasty! My burger was a nice mix of flavors, bell pepper, ham, white cheddar and the french toast was decadent. Thanks IHOP!"}
{"text":"Food was subpar and waitress not very attentive. She brought us the wrong food and rang up check wrong."}
{"text":"Poor service. Very slow for a to go order. Ordered food via phone and when I arrived the order never went back to the kitchen. Currently waiting in the lobby for past 30 min. Simple order, omelette.  Ashtyn continues to sign loudly when the phone rings or when she is asked to perform any type of task."}
{"text":"Um I don't know why this Ihop doesn't have higher ratings. When we went it was clean, the staff was friendly, and the food was great.

I mean, there's not much difference in terms of the food quality, but I would say this one was up there for an Ihop. The waitress we had was also really nice and super fast with out order. It does seem a bit small but I didn't really check out the other side.

There is also plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Pretty busy on a Sunday 1pm, table for 2 seated in 5 minutes .... no complaints there. It's IHOP people not capital grill. Quick service and she kept coming back to check on things. Got the smokehouse combo was really good."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place gets such poor ratings.  Though, looking through it seems to be in the service, which I guess is a hit-or-miss type of thing.  Our waiter on a Saturday night was super helpful, super fast, and very friendly.  

And seriously, how can you go wrong with cinnabon anything?  Both the cinnabon pancakes and the french toast are amazing.    

My husband got a non-breakfast meal (gasp!) - a bowl of potato soup and a roast beef-type sandwich which  he said he liked a lot.  I've never personally tried anything non-breakfast there, and am still hesitant.  Usually restaurants are good at one thing, and IHOP is good at breakfast."}
{"text":"We went in to get some breakfast was seated right away, our server came super fast took our drinks down asked us if we where ready to order. I mean we just sat down, server left came back I kinda felt rushed the whole time. While we got our food and were in the middle of eating he came by with the check and never came back. I mean really, food is ok but I hope I never get that waiter again. I like to enjoy my food without feeling like I'm being pushed towards the door so fast."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviews regarding service. TERRIBLE.

Waited 10 minutes after being seated to have a waitress come over and ask on her best Kourtney Kardashian growl \"has no one waited on you?\"

Then it took 25 minutes for our food to come out. 

No one seemed to understand their job. It's not rocket surgery you're serving pancakes and eggs. Get it together."}
{"text":"Sampler dish is soooo good... Staff is always friendly..."}
{"text":"Is attention to detail important? Apparently not during my visit :(

Waitress: would you like fruit?
Me: no
Waitress: sausage or bacon? 
Me: bacon
Waitress: what to drink?
Me: coffee

What I got: fruit, sausage & during my entire visit NOTHING to drink. When I asked about my coffee I was told it was brewing. No one remembered anything about it again until it was time to put it on my check... seriously. I asked it be removed since I never got it and she just laughed and said, \"oh, I'm so sorry about that\". Really? Because she didn't seem like she was. Especially when it took her almost 10 more minutes to get me my corrected check. 
I won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"This iHop has the BEST staff. Even when it's busy, which it normally is, you will never have to wait for a server. They've got some great team work going on & they always cover for each other & the result is quick service. 

The food is good, plenty to choose from :)"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast diner food with quick service. 

Anytime I know that time is of the essence OR if I'm with the kiddo's, this is one of our top picks. Breakfast is good for any meal of the day :) 

As an added plus, we've never had to wait more than a few minutes to be seated! 
It's a good idea to let your server know if you're in a hurry. I always mention what time our movie is starting at & they always get us fed and out within enough time to get to the movie theater :D

Little FYI about exiting. If you are turning Left (west) onto Olive you might be waiting for a while. If traffic is bad, you might want to go all the way around, exit on the side street and get to the light :)"}
{"text":"Me and My Co Workers eat here on Many Friday's. The Service in the Morning is the best.  The two Servers and the Bus people  are spot on. The Latina Server is the best I ever seen. I forgot her name. But I was disappointed once when I walk in and she was off. The other Server said in a joking manner. Oh I trained her. So you won't lack in service. And she was correct. This Manager has the best two servers I have ever dealt with. R&L Drivers who come in on Friday's Thanks Ladies for the friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"What kind of restaurant just doesn't answer their phone?? Three different websites have (702) 933-0420 listed as the number to this establishment. When I call, there is no answer and it goes to voicemail."}
{"text":"waited an entire tire hour for food and when it came out it was cold. watched everyone in our section get seated, order get their food & leave. Wait staff were highly unprofessional."}
{"text":"You really want to know what keeps me coming back? The free pancakes on my anniversay (the date I joined the birthday club) and again on my birthday (one week later). The place is always crowded when I go, but that must be a good thing."}
{"text":"By far, the worst Ihop i've ever been too. After being seated, i waited 10 or more minutes to have my order taken. Finally i went to the counter and asked what happen to my server? My guess is the counter lady felt bad and took my order. Well 20 minutes later I'm still waiting. At the rate, i could have gone to the store and purchased and cooked it myself.

I finally noticed a guy serving and taking orders for the tables across from me and wondered if he was also my server. Turned out he was... 

Well i went back to the counter to find out what was taking soo long for my order to arrive, she said she'd check, i also asked if i could speak to the manager, well would u believe the manager was the same guy serving the table across from me...    With that i'd had enough and left. What a waste of time. The worst service"}
{"text":"After flying 5 hrs early morning from the east coast I was feeling pretty darn hungry. Was really looking for McD's but after taking a wrong turn I ended up here. I was first reluctant to go in cause I never had any luck at my local Ihop. Glad I went in cause it was the best Ihop experience ever. My food was hot until the last bite. I must have lucked out cause I walked right in, but when I paid for my meal the lobby was FULL jack!  I would definitely come back here again but I probably wouldn't wait more than 15 mins to be seated."}
{"text":"New York cheesecake pancakes, warm and hit the spot for sweet pancakes with fruit (strawberries). 4 crispy bacon on the side was perfect! The mocha cappuccino was way too sweet.

Eduardo was my server... And I noticed right off he was EVERYONE'S server!! The guy was hustling and bustling the entire diner on his own. WTH management!?!? Saturday morning and just him? Tsk tsk!! Regardless, Eduardo was nice, efficient and handling everything calmly. I would've already lost my shit if it was me.  Dude even rejected serving my bacon because they didn't look cooked. So coming out 3 minutes behind the pancakes was no problem to me!

From seated to empty plate totaled 30mins! So not bad under the circumstances."}
{"text":"When it comes to Pancakes, I'm a simple guy.  Give me some traditional Buttermilk Pancakes and I'll be a happy camper.  That's what I get 99% of the time I come to IHOP.  This location is in the middle of Summerlin, next the the gym I work out at.

It's one of the nicer locations in town as they've kept it clean and comfortable.  The employees here are always friendly and I've never had any issues with the service.  It gets really busy on the weekend, so I normally come here with the family on a weekday morning.

Will I return?  You bet."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was light and cheery as was the service. My boys truly enjoyed the breakfast as did I."}
{"text":"I have not been in an IHOP for at least ten years. I just try to avoid pancakes due to carbs and calorie counts. But today around lunchtime, I was hungry and there was an IHOP in my path. So I went. I ordered an omelet with sour dough toast.  I got to pick out everything that I wanted in my omelet.  The service was very fast. The food was very good. I changed my mind about IHOP and will now remember that eggs are a great option here.   I did cheat, however, by putting the table syrup on my toast.  How could I not sample the blueberry and strawberry and butter pecan syrups?   Honestly, the eggs were very good, but the syrups and toast lit me up like a a big happy camper.  This place brought out my inner kid. I liked the feeling."}
{"text":"One of the few chain restaurants that I particularly enjoy, even in a town synonymous with all-you-can-eat breakfast buffets offered up at low prices.  I know, I know.  It doesn't make a lot of sense to leave the strip for a chain restaurant breakfast.  There is just something about their pancakes and blueberry syrup that I find unavoidable though.  

Upon arriving, we saw the line out the door.  Good grief, why aren't people having breakfast at their hotel, I think with no sense of irony?  Amazingly though, the line moves fast.  In less than 10 minutes, everyone was seated.  This is rather impressive considering just how small this particular IHOP is.  Indeed, the booths are a bit cramped in an effort to maximize the available seating.  The kitchen and wait staff do a remarkable job handling the constant volume though.  Every single special request (my girlfriend's parents are kind of picky) was met with ease and a smile.  We had all of our food in a timely manner, and we were never in want for a refill.  I was pretty happy.  The food of course is consistent with IHOPs everywhere, if not a touch better than some of them.  Definitely a good spot.  The only drawbacks beyond the tight seating was the lack of a good view out of the windows and the tight parking situation outside -- a testament to the premium placed on real estate in these parts.  Other than that, I would be hard pressed to say anything negative.  Recommend.  




3.5 stars"}
{"text":"This ihop is right down the road from my fiance and I. We regularly come here because of the great food and awesome prices. The night staff (about 9pm or later) is usually fantastic! They're smiling, nice, on top of everything and just wonderful. 

Today we decided to go at a normal hour, 6pm. After waiting to be seated for 15 minutes we had still not seen a host or waiter. Another couple was there waiting as well for about the same time frame. We were finally seated yet received no apology. I then proceeded to time how long it would take to get our drink orders... 20 minutes pass and the waiter has come out about 6 times, bringing incorrect condiments to tables, dropping toast etc but has still yet to even acknowledge us or the other couple that had come in At about the same time.  At this point we were over it. There were only 5 tables with only 2-3 people each.

We got up and walked out and saw 2 others waiting to be seated impatiently. 

We will now only go here during the late night shift. I hate to be this person but I have worked food industry before so I know it can get stressful. At least apologize to the customers that are waiting 15 minutes to even see you or be seated."}
{"text":"I'm sure most IHOPs are the same, but this location smelled weird like sewage when I went. Thankfully the smell stayed OUTSIDE the restaurant but it was still pretty bad.

The pancakes were okay. The staff was nice but the food took forever to come out. Maybe I was just unlucky that day with the whole weird smelling thing and really long wait times. I will go to IHOP probably in a different area like Green Valley"}
{"text":"The food is what you would expect from an IHOP, and service was fine, but this location is dirty, run down, and really cramped. Tables are packed in so there is no privacy. But man is it dirty. Not what you want when you're dining out. I don't think anything has been updated since the 70's, and that's not a good thing. If you're looking for a diner breakfast, go to the Denny's down the road. They have recently remodeled and it is SO much nicer, for about the same price."}
{"text":"We have been to this IHOP many times and this is probably the first time that we actually felt like we were valued guests. Our server who I think may also have been the manager, Shauna, stopped for a brief chit chat and took amazing care of us today. Our order was perfect including our special requests. Most of the time I feel as if we are just a tip. I didn't feel that way today and the service warrented a review. Thank you Shauna for taking care of us and because of you we will be back."}
{"text":"First time here. Had the strawberry cream French toast with a side of bacon, eggs, and hash browns. It was amazing. Our waitress was nice. Very please with all of it."}
{"text":"I don't expect the greatest service when I go to ihop, but today I had the worse service of my life. Aside from the food taking 30 minutes to come out, three of the five meals came out wrong and it took another 15 minutes to get the right order. By the time the rest of us got our food, everyone else was done eating. On top of that, our waters were empty before our food even showed up and when we tried to get the attention of another server (Kirsten). She made direct eye contact with us and walked right passed us. We finally went up to speak to a manager and his exact words were \"what do you want?\". All in all, worse service I have ever experienced. The manager did take off one of the meals and discounted our checks, but it didn't make up for our poor service."}
{"text":"The food is cheap and somewhat good, that's why we go. The customer service, well, that's why we review. And if I could give it 0 stars, I would."}
{"text":"We are extremely dissatisfied with our recent visit to this location. We started our experience off having to clean our table because it was very dirty, when we received our food there was a bug on one of our plates, lastly there was another group that walked in with a dog. The dog was a \"service pet\" but wearing no vest and it was on the dinning table. This is very unsanitary and people have dog allergies, service animal or not. I think you guys should have restrictions on pets in your establishment...place the dog in a crate."}
{"text":"My first visit to IHOP. Tiffany, our server 
 was delightful, friendly & helpful. She's a true asset to IHOP! Having such a good server sure makes all the difference in enjoying a restaurant.
     Ok, the food was real good. Steak omelet was very good, steak was of good  quality & tasty. Colorado omelet was lacking in generosity of omelet filling. Poor quality breakfast sausage was part of omelet filling. (Yuck). Chorizo omelet was good. I didn't know IHOP serves dinner..... I'll be back. 
     I have never liked those frozen shredded \"potatoes\". IHOP should take public survey, and discover that most people would prefer home fries made with \"real potatoes\". Just sayin."}
{"text":"Just left this place after waiting 15 minutes for the server to even come by and ask for drinks. There were 2 waitresses, the other waitress sat a group 10 minutes after us and she served them drinks.  But, my red hair waitress ignored us and was busy with other tables.  Rude service. Never going back. I hope management reads this."}
{"text":"I was here a few weekends ago. The service was incredible and we loved our server. 

However, not gonna lie. Our food was not food at all. I ordered pancakes and my husband ordered an omelet. I mean, who doesn't like fluffy pancakes?

We were both really sick the rest of that Saturday. This may have to do with the fact, we don't eat a lot of processed sugars or dairy. It could have been a whole slew of things. The fact is. We were both ill and felt like garbage for the remainder of the weekend. 

Needless to say, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I recently visited this location of IHOP for lunch with a friend since we were craving for omelet. The location was busy but we were able to get a table right away. 

Our server came right away so we ordered our drinks. I guess it was our lucky day, our drinks arrived in no time yay. My sweet tea was missing lots ot love, I guess my server didn't get any from  We were on the clock since it was during the week so we picked out what we wanted and ordered our food quickly. She came back with our food in few minutes. I would say have had better omelet at other restaurants but it was OK rating wise. 

The place wasn't clean enough and I think they can use a little uplift/renovation."}
{"text":"Place was awesome...server tended to our every need...our meals were totally satisfying..no complaints...will be back if we visit Cleveland again..wish Ihop was in Toronto"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want breakfast at any time of the day or night, for me, this is usually between 10PM and 3AM. 

IHOP is my go to for this as the food is consistent. This location needs some help though. 

This location is on the dirty side! It is always under staffed when I come in here. When I say under staffed, I mean there is a cook and one server working. (This is late night, but that doesn't mean it's not busy). Get more help! 

I get really grossed out by dirty dishes on the tables all around me. It's more than just clearing dirty dishes and re-setting the tables though. Is it too much to ask to wipe down the table completely and the seats as well? It sets me off when I go to sit down and there is food on my chair or booth! 

I don't even want to know what the restrooms look like!

If you need an IHOP fix, keep driving a few miles to the next one! I won't return to this location again!"}
{"text":"This IHOP Steelyard was by far the worst restaurant I ever been to in my 34 years. It had a strange smell, the seat was crack, food all on the floor and it was not busy it was around 3pm. It took us about one hour to get our food. Waitress never came to check on us. Another waitress heard me say \"wow no refill\" so she went and got me a refill. 

My fiance asked for banana foster french toast she came out with a waffle. She came back after 20 minutes and asked if he touched it and he said no. She picked up the plate and took it to the table it was supposed to went to. We could not believe she did that. The people looked at her like she was crazy and told her to take it back. She brings my fiance his french toast no bananas and it looked like it been sitting for a long time. We told her to take it back. The cook came out and said sorry and fixed my fiance fresh french toast they did not have any more bananas, so he did strawberries. It was good! 

We gave the waitress only $2.45 for a tip! We get to the car and realized they overcharged us, so we go back in to let them know. This fool (waitress) charged us for the banana foster french toast combo she said well he wanted that, but sent it back and I gave him the strawberries french toast...REALLY? Since you got my order wrong and had to bring out another one, you're going to charge for both...smh...The manager he fixed the total (was overcharged by $10) This time around the tip was zero. Worst IHOP experience ever! Do not waste your time going here. Go to Taco Bell, Steak n Shake or Burger King they are close by!"}
{"text":"my wife and i visited this I hop Monday October 15 , 2012.  Approx. 11am.  I had the Monster burger with fries no seasoning extra crispy and the burger medium rare.  The fries came to our table hot and crispy no seasoning but the burger was well done... Before I ordered this burger I asked the server if medium rare is possbile here she said yes... but like most places here in the valley ordering a medium rare burger is almost impossible to get !  I ate the burger did not complain.

My wife had the strawberry cream cheese french toast she said it was good but did not eat fresh looking strawberries she said they tasted too sweet maybe they are marinated ?  along with two eggs over medium cooked correctly with nice golden brown hash browns and bacon ... 

Disappointed by yet another restaurant unable to provide medium rare burger very simple task ... other wise the service was very good the manager very friendly and the place was approx. 85% capacity."}
{"text":"The service was great. Our server was Mario. The food was good. This is a great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Decent service and good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"There's a reason the IHOP competitor is popping off every night at most hours and here is not. The service was good for me. Considering I was the only person in here. The menu is very boring and doesn't state if its acceptable or not to substitute items (ie Eggs for toast. Sausage for hash browns.) I see why I haven't been here in years. It lakca a memorable experience. A positive one at least. The prices are a bit up there for a pancake stack, combo or entree meal. I do not feel like I've gotten my moneys worth by the end of my meal. The food was bland. Obvious boxed mashed potatoes. Those fake cheese slices on the grilled cheese. Undercooked steamed veggies were too chewy. Seasoned fruit was stale. All this and I'm not even trying to be a diva about it. My suggestion is don't avoid this place but if on a budget or out with loud friends consider another 24 hr diner."}
{"text":"I went to ihop at approximately 1 AM trying to get a good late night meal. I walked in the restaurant, smelled a smell very gruesome smell. My friend and I ignored it and sat down. Tall guy came to take our order, was very rude and didn't even write anything down. I ask for a pancake combo with all the works on the side (hash browns and bacon), guy comes back and says they're out of chocolate chips for my pancakes. I ignore it. He gets rude. I ask for a manager and he gets more rude. I was very mad because I'm a dedicated iHop customer and have been for a very long time. Disappointed with the gentleman and the service, as well as the cleanliness of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Let's go! Second verse same as the first! I'll divide this into three parts: vibes, service, and food.

Vibes: 
It's honestly like any IHOP. It has the feeling of efficiency and corporate diner feels. Not really much to say.

Service:
Now the service was something to talk about. Most times I'll agree that service makes the place! My service was an absolute delight. Her name was Jaime and she was superb. Despite it being 2 in the morning, she was patient, sociable, and very helpful. 

Food:
There's never much to say about food at chain restaurants like this. The pancakes were lovely. Very fluffy! The meal was as nice as I expect it to be."}
{"text":"We expected a wait going on a Sunday morning around 11am and the 25 minute wait was not bad. During that time though we watched the chaotic way the two people taking and calling names were doing their job. Names spelled/pronounced wrong, calling one couple 5 times before finally checking the second seating area and finding them, and treating people with less customer service than should be standard, even for an IHOP. Once we were seated we heard each table around us complain about something one by one. The lady next to us had ordered her food a certain way because of an allergy and was in the process of sending it back as we were seated because it had the topping on it she was allergic to. 10 min later the table behind us asked for a manager complaining about the poor service. 41 minutes after we were seated our food arrived. We had ordered soup, pancakes, and a BLT. None of which should have taken anywhere near that time to prepare. I decided not to complain because it seemed like our waitress was already taking a lot of heat and had said sorry more than enough times. This was our first and last visit to this location."}
{"text":"Poor service.. never had it so slow ever at an IHOP. 
It took more than 25 mins for breakfast to be served. Then the first Dish arrived followed by the second. Looks like they forgot our order. The first Dish when it arrived was just about Luke warm indicating it was sitting there for a while."}
{"text":"It's an ihop. What can you expect? But when you find cardboard inside your omelet you know the staff is untrained. If you are used to the nice ihops I would not recommend you going here. Even after finding the mistake on my plate, I found a hair on the pancakes too. We decided not to complain again because we were embarrassed for the place's poor performance. They only discounted my plate with the cardboard and nothing else! Usually other Ihops will discount the coffee as well, and in some cases I've had the manager discount the whole table without hesitation."}
{"text":"Horrible!! They were terribly under staffed so the poor waitress was running around like crazy. I ordered a chicken fried steak with hash browns and it came with a side of pancakes. My husband ordered the split decision which is bacon sausage eggs toast and a side of pancakes. 
My chicken fried steak was burnt. The gravy on top had been sitting on top of it for so long I could turn it upside down and it stuck on the steak. The hash-browns were hard underneath where they are supposed to be soft. I wanted to share them with my 9 month old but couldn't because they were so hard. So I sent my meal back, didn't ask for it redone and just ate the pancakes. My husbands meal was TINY. The bacon was under cooked and floppy, the hash browns were hard like mine, the eggs (which were scrambled) were watery and instead of toast they gave him French toast. Who wants French toast when they are already getting pancakes?? That made no sense at all. We asked if that's how it's supposed to be and the waitress said it is, but that just didn't seem right and they weren't cooked thoroughly so he didn't eat them. Horrible horrible place. I thought Denny's was bad but I will pick a Denny's over this IHOP anytime!!"}
{"text":"Slow service every time we go, no ones ever at the front to take payment or to seat people. Placed an order for takeout and ended up having to wait 25 minutes in the store. I asked one of the girls how much longer the wait would be and she told me \"i don't know, i'm not cooking.\" Not worth it."}
{"text":"I just ate at this IHOP location and had an amazing customer service experience with our server Reggie. I ordered the pancake
Combo and everything was delicious - except my pancakes were undercooked (totally not a big deal, I know it gets busy on Sunday after church!) Reggie immediately replaced my pancakes and gave me a take home box! I have worked in service industry and this is the kind of customer service that really makes a difference. Thank you Reggie!!"}
{"text":"It has been a very very long time since me or my family has been to an ihop.  We really used to love their food.  Today after church one of my nephews suggested ihop for breakfast....as it has literally been years I was skeptical but we complied to his request.  

The wait wasn't very long and the service was friendly and quick.  The food left a lot to be desired and quickly reminded me why we haven't returned in so long.   My bacon and everyone else's at the table was completely burnt...not just overcooked but burnt.  My hash browns were also burnt...I usually like my hash browns a nice golden brown but this was indeed black.  This was the norm across out table as well.  In addition the pancakes fell apart every time I tried to take a bite.   The food was incredibly underwhelming and for the money I would not be doing it again."}
{"text":"Me and my wife visited this spot at 3am yesterday and it was just not as run well as any other ihop in the valley. It was dead in the morning, barely 4 other tables that were seating no more than 2 people per table, and we had to wait 15 min to be seated. When we sat down, we waited another 30 min for our food. Getting irritable and upset is really easy when its this early in the morning and all you want to do is eat... we decided that we couldnt wait any longer and rather get Jack in the Box for the convenience and quickness. I told the manager that we were leaving and she hurried our food out just as we were getting up so we decided to stay. But as soon as we wanted to dig in, our server never gave us forks, knives, or spoons!!! The manager took care of us from there and gave us a discount for the \"wait\"."}
{"text":"As far as IHops go, 5 stars. Super friendly service, Kay was awesome. Carolyn at check out was great too. Got my free birthday meal and just substituted it for something of equal value. Delicious breakfast and really quick."}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly restaurant. A real change up for us on a Friday night but waiting. Our waitress was very nice and food was good."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé usually get good service here, this particular time we weren't getting as good service, but I'd like to mention one worker specifically who came back for her purse but helped us anyway, her name was Amber."}
{"text":"Food was cold and toast was not made as asked for then took forever to get our food. First and last time going."}
{"text":"Will never return to this location. Waitress was forgetful and completely forgot that we were waiting on our food. Manager was dissociative and even wanted to walk away when we were trying to pay. We will never ever be back. If you want IHOP cruise up 77 a bit."}
{"text":"Sat for 30 Min waiting for our order to be taken. One server for the whole restaurant and she refused to even look at us. Left and walked across the street to Denny's."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. A friend and I decided to stop and try the stuffed french toast. We're chatting away waiting for our food and drinking and here comes a cockroach running across our table. I immediately grabbed my purse and stood up. Our waitress came over and was just as shocked as we were and kept apologizing (she was new so I'm sure she had no idea). We told her that it wasn't her fault and we wanted to cancel our order and leave. We spoke to the manager on the way out and he seemed like he wasn't surprised when we explained what we saw. Thank God we didn't eat. The only thing nice about this place was our waitress. Will never go back though. That ihop has been there for a very long time, it's time to clean and remodel or shut it down."}
{"text":"Loved it! Clean and looks brand new. 
We initially stopped at the one next to the Stratosphere. The neighborhood was weird and the line was on the parking lot. We are very happy we drove the extra mile to reach this one. 15 minutes wait. Good A/C. Ernesto was very nice too. Food was delicious. Will come back for sure on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience ever!  After being seated, 15 minutes passed without anyone coming to our table.  We flagged down a waiter who told us we weren't his table.  Long story short, over 30 minutes before we even got coffee.  We like to try different places but Never again to IHOP Huntersville."}
{"text":"Giving the server a  review  he was very professional and attentive  excellent service  his name was Patrick -if you  ever go to this location please request him you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am not much a fan of IHOP, but I really liked my breakfast the other morning. It's not your fancy restaurant by far, but we did have really good food and service. It was something easy and simple, and I liked it."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast made hot.  Friendly staff.  I made an order once recently.  The woman over the phone mistake my side order as a substitute.  I returned to the restaurant for the correction.  Immediately the manager recognized me once I came back and took care of the situation.  On my way I went with my meal still warm."}
{"text":"I must say that I and a friend stopped into here about a week ago.  I was very impressed. The service that we had was great, the coffee was hot, and the food was excellent.   I am generally not too big of a fan of IHOPs but this has changed my mind.   Definitely worth going and its nice that its in a pretty safe area."}
{"text":"this low carb diet is especially painful when literally everyone around me is devouring stacks of yummy looking pancakes smothered in fruit and whipped cream. my chorizo and eggs didn't look as appetizing as those pancakes, but it did the job, and our server didn't balk at substituting cottage cheese for the hashbrowns and tortillas. the chorizo was definitively better than what jack-in-the-box claims is chorizo but fell quite short of the filiberto's version. the eggs were just dandy and my cottage cheese was overflowing in it's dish. ihop's coffee was fresh, hot and tasty. i can't complain about the service, and that's really saying something. there was a wait when we got there, but we were seated in 5 minutes and were out in just under an hour. i expect to be back - ihop is quick, close to home and perfect for a cheap breakfast. they're open 24 hours too."}
{"text":"Went here tonight. Two orderd were wrong, and I had to show the server the menu as she wanted to argue about it, and then blamed the cook. She called over the manager and he also wanted to argue. 
One order out of the seven was delayed more than 5 minutes after the other six were brought out.
 Drink refills were slow. Someone at another table had to walk to the kitchen to get his refilled. 
Manager had to be reminded to take off the charges for the kid's meals. Kids eat free,which is why this place was chosen. Manager did not offer any kind of discount for the errors or the arguing. 
It was my beautiful granddaughter's birthday and I wish things had been perfect for her. Maybe next year,somewhere else."}
{"text":"Why go here when you can go to Blueberry Hill instead?  Don't waste your time with IHOP when there are other reasonably priced alternatives!  That being said, this place is very average... quite lackluster with all the run-of-the-mill choices you have come to expect from every other IHOP out there.  The service is spotty, as well."}
{"text":"Food not that great today but service was. Think we will stick to our normal IHOP on rainbow."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just had a wonderful breakfast at the IHOP on Pebble and Eastern.  We had the BEST service. The food was wonderful and my girlfriend had a coupon for 1/2 off our breakfast. The total bill was $18.00, she paid, ($9.00) for two combo breakfast's, an I left our server a $5.00 tip.  The manager came to say hello, the host was extremely pleasant, We have decided to visit at least every couple of weeks... it was a delightful experience.  Its nice to know we still have places that cater to the customer with a smile. Thanks IHOP!"}
{"text":"Going down the highway and hungry for breakfast and it's already after lunchtime and we saw the sign for IHOP as a sign from above. Went in and saw a line of people waiting and we thought uh oh as we were hungry and not in the mood to wait too long. But the lady said 5 minutes...probably not even 3 minutes later they called us. The food was great but the service was even better. You could tell right away the whole staff were hard workers and were good at their jobs. They sat you, got your order out quickly and flipped the tables very efficiently. All of our meals were your basic breakfast comfort food, but all done just right. Great breakfast, all around a great pit stop."}
{"text":"I don't think I've witnessed more of a poor display of housekeeping or preparation of food. When my friend and I walked in, we were seated at a booth that hadn't been cleaned properly. It was sticky. Not only that but my friend was served a cup that hadn't been cleaned properly. Our waitress only visited us about 2 times. Another server who wasn't even waiting on us helped us out more, so I'll give kudos to him. They couldn't spare the moment to melt the cheese on any of our food and overall, it's been a bad experience, plus there were flies around us. Do not come here. You can make better food and save yourself time and money by making the same thing in your kitchen."}
{"text":"Waitress was serving 2 tables next to me and he kept ignoring me, so i just left. Won't come back again."}
{"text":"Accommodating to my Keto Diet. Got to order the bacon cheeseburger without a bun, and instead lettuce wrapped. Price for IHOP nowdays seems to be much more pricier now than the past. Waitress was nice and accommodating! Wish they had a more extensive menu like some of the other IHOPS I've been to."}
{"text":"I mean, it's IHOP. It's not gourmet fare. It's IHOP. But the spinach and mushroom omelette smothered in hollandaise is to die for, and bottomless iced coffee is a sweet deal. Restaurant was clean, service was smiley and prompt, we left full (fat) and happy."}
{"text":"Everything was soooo dirty! We ended up asking for plastic forks. Out of 6 sets of utensils 5 were dirty with visible food particles. I am so disgusted!"}
{"text":"I have always gotten good sevice there, Love coming there with my kids or when it's just me and my husband"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Here for the NFR as a vendor and this has been our fav spot!!!  Easy, convenient, great service !! Waiters and waitresses are the best we have seen in Vegas .."}
{"text":"This location is packed. Unlike the one in Chandler AZ, which, because of service,  hardly ever seems to have anyone in there but you still have to wait forever. I digress...back to this location. 
We got seated immediately. The server was excellent,  and she spoke Spanish.  At one point, my son tried to catch the retreating waitress about his eggs but she didn't see him...the manager walking by did, and took care of it herself without complaint and quickly and with a pleasant demeanor. This is such a switch from the IHOP in Chandler. Very impressive; and probably why they are packed. Chandler, learn something from this site and get a grip!

Fyi if you haven't been to an IHOP lately, their house salad is fabulous; many restaurants continue to make their salads with iceberg lettuce (which I don't consider lettuce at all); IHOP corp uses actual real greens that have nutritional value, and plenty of tomatoes. Thank you, keep up the good work on that!

Only bad here was I didn't like my splashberry; I could taste the bitter taste of the tap water used to make the sierra mist in it.  bleah. But 5 stars, anyway."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect or waiter was excellent I like ice tea with lemon .. I hate when they do a refill they never give you more lemon but he did and I like it when they do !!! Better tip when they do because they paid attention to what I order also the food was very good and fresh .. Two thumbs up IHOP"}
{"text":"No. Just, no. 

I'm not really sure what the criteria is for judging a restaurant's service at midnight, but if it's the same criteria as normal hours, this restaurant did poorly.

I found a bread tie in my salad and my boyfriend's burger was dry and missing toppings.  After the server cleared the plates, she didn't come back to ask if we wanted our checks. We waited for 15 minutes and eventually had to grab her ourselves.  

They took my salad off the bill, as they should, but that didn't make up for the overall poor experience."}
{"text":"Using the stop watch on my phone it was over 7 min after i was seated for the waitress to come take my drink order!! Piss poor service. When she came over she had an attitude.... first and last time for me."}
{"text":"Worst meal and service ever. Ordered the philly cheese steak with onion rings. The rings were over cooked and she forgot the pickle and ranch dressing and ketchup. They were not busy at all. Never coming back to this one."}
{"text":"Tonight I have been the recipient of the best service I have ever had at this IHOP in the past 20+ years. Robert P. was my server. He brought refills on soda seconds after the glass was empty. He was courteous and professional and alert to the needs of the customers in his care.  The food was well prepared and tasted great. The restaurant was clean and quiet. It was a really nice dining experience overall. That Robert P. deserves a raise!   Good job, IHOP. :-)"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I usually come every Sunday with my roommate and most of the time it's good but we've had some bad experiences. The last time we came we were seated and nobody even came to take our drink order for 20 minutes or so. Waiters kept passing and looking at us but nobody stopped. When someone finally did help us, she confessed she was actually supposed to be leaving and someone else was supposed to help us but she was nice enough to take our order anyway and stick with us. The food is good for the most part, but the hash browns are almost always stale tasting to me."}
{"text":"all food was cold. ordered an omelet tell. with an English muffin. both were disgusting cold. bacon was undercooked, eggs were at an unsafe temperature. also I was told that there was no flavored coffee creamer and there is in fact a flavored coffee on the menu. terrible service. even worse food"}
{"text":"This is a review of this particular IHOP just south of the strip...everything here is incredibly good...this isn't just any IHOP, this one is worth it..."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here last night for an early dinner and had a great time. The hostess was very courteous, the atmosphere was calm and there were not many customers when we went since it was way past breakfast, but that's what we love since we could order breakfast anytime there, which we did! We both ordered specials that came with avocado slices, and my egg dish also came with a salsa topping which was really good. A family with a baby also came in a little after us, and there was plenty of spacious room for them which was very accommodating. The waitress was very attentive to them and to us throughout our stay. I loved that it wasn't too quiet, not too noisy so my friend and I could take time to catch up on things without lots of hassle. The only complaint I have is that we wanted to let  cashier know we wanted to pay separately, but she was talking (on a personal call) on the wall phone before we paid, during the time she took our ticket, and even after she told us how much we owed, all without getting off the phone. I thought it was very rude doing so while she should've been attending to her duties while working. My friend ended up paying for most of our meal and I gave her change, though I'm not sure it was all the right amount from me. My friend was a good sport about it though. My friend did manage to ask the cashier to exchange my $10 for smaller bills, so that helped. Other than that, I will probably go back. There's such a wide selection on the menu to choose from!"}
{"text":"Went because I had family visiting from out-of-state and this is where they wanted to go for breakfast.  Otherwise, not my kind of place.  The food was slow coming and just fair.  Nothing special, fancy, or that great.  The waitress was slow on filling coffee as well.  I'd rather pay a little extra for better food and service."}
{"text":"Location was clean. Service was fast. Staff was friendly, and at unholy hour of 5:30 A.M, I think that deserves special recognition.  Got big, filling breakfast with coffee for $10+tip.  I have had more spectacular breakfasts but this was good, tasty, filling, and an improvement over last time I ate at this same location quite some years ago.  I'm fairly sure there are no hand-picked-by-the-chef truffles personally-massaged-with-organic-certified-prepubescent extremely virginal olive oil or the like on the premises, but see above: tasty, filling, clean, fast & friendly, $10, and an improvement from last, long-ago visit.  It's may not be \"destination-dining\", but I'd hop in again."}
{"text":"We used to go here often while it was under a different management.  Then it all changed when the manager left.  
Service is horrible there now.  The waitresses all seem to not to care one bit, and forgetful on orders. 
Food:  There is a good variety of it, but like I've said before, since management changed the quality, presentation of the food has gone down hill tremendously.

What so sad is that we had really liked this place, but we haven't been back in about a year.  I keep wanting to go back and see if they have changed, but my family says \"NO!\""}
{"text":"The service was absolutely atrocious... the middle aged women who served us, who's name I WISH I had gotten, was a nightmare. She had an attitude the second I opened my mouth, she was clearly homophobic. The silverware was unclean and she nearly yelled at me when I asked her if she thought it was dirty and tried asking for a new set. We left as the coffee was being brought out and I have never had an experience that unpleasant in the 100s if not 1000s of restaurants I've been to in my life."}
{"text":"When you enter a restaurant feeling good and you leave it feeling nauseous, then there is nothing to be said. Quote the Raven : \"Never more.\""}
{"text":"This place is far beyond disgusting this is my second bad experience here needless to say I will not be returning after drinking a whole class We realize this lipstick marks on the side of a class that did not belong to us and once brought to the managers attention her responses oh my god that's disgusting....way to go IHOP!!!"}
{"text":"The staff are efficient, courteous, and friendly. Warning: Chicken Strips only has two choices of sauce (ranch and barbecue). Very Small Portion :(Comes with a Large Bill)
Staff are hard working and very friendly! 5 Stars for the Staff."}
{"text":"My friends and I come to this IHOP location almost every Friday and Saturday night for the great food and service. I always ask for Ernie because there's no competition and he's simply the best. He's our go to server because he is very efficient and fun to talk to. In addition, Randy is a great evening manager. Whenever you crave a petite desert my friends and I would recommend the tilapia tiramisu. The perfect balance between delicate sweetness and protein. Mmm Mmm Mmmm."}
{"text":"I love their music, their service was friendly courteous even though I was only here waiting for the DMV to open. The bathrooms are clean, they have WI-FI, and their staff is super attentive. I got to practice Spanish with the server who was very accommodating. This was a great way to start a very busy day!"}
{"text":"Here with 2 other friends, waited 1 hour and 20 mins. Still no food. I guess I'll have to wait at least another half hour for pancakes and hash brown. No refill on water, so I'm drinking water from my friend's cup. Trying to hard to track down a server to refill drink."}
{"text":"I've been there twice the service was not great the first time and terrible the second. Drinks came after our food, meals missing items and to top it all off the bill was wrong. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Server was great (freindly and very attentive), seated right away, got drinks fast, food fast and as ordered."}
{"text":"The Brioche french toast they're advertising now is amazing!

Service was quite good; I've been here before and it isn't always good.

Clean enough.  Decent prices."}
{"text":"Verymuch regular foodchain restaurant, but only thing is make me to go this place is their chicken crepe and the coffee. other than that samo samo...."}

{"text":"I came in for breakfast about 10:30 while waiting for my car at Big O   Was seated right away, my waiter Nathan was friendly he had no problem swapping items on my order which was delicious. He came to check on me several times. I came in with a big circle K drink. I did not order a drink here and he offered to refill it.  I work in customer service and he was tops.  Thank you Nathan and I Hop"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant when Bernadette was Manager... So nice!  Treated everyone like her Family!  She knew her Patrons on a first name basis and you knew her name back.  She made sure food was presented perfect!  Then when she left IHOP Management put \"UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT\" signs up... This made the regulars furious because we all felt close to Bernadette.  She was an Outstanding Manager.  We all miss her!  She represented IHOP in the best possible manner.  The new Manager touted that they put the signs up because of \"her new Position!\"  She loved the attention... But, she is no Bernadette.  I miss the old Manager.  As far as any changes... Not so friendly!  Management does not check on her Patrons... No improvement.  Not the same... Food is just OK.  This location is Summerlin and the standards are different.  Be nice, be friendly and serve decent food.  Care about your Patrons... Be genuine!  New management has not made a difference... Moving on."}
{"text":"This place looks very ghetto IMO. Food is pretty good most of the times but it can definitely hit the rock bottom. People are always nice here though so at least that's good. The only time this place will get busy is probably weekend mornings. Opens 24 hours so if you needed a late night snack, this could be a great place. Overall, just your average breakfast spot with some good pancakes."}
{"text":"this place sucks- had a waitress shirlena who was terrible literally had to ask every other waiter for a refill and a box. plus unorganized had a waiter come up to us to ask if we've been helped when we replied no he just walked away... doesn't this place have sections? food was cold too, ugh never again- even for a hangover breakfast ?"}
{"text":"This is by far the friendliest IHOP I have visited.  The managers are on top of the service. I was trapped in town due to weather and had dinner and breakfast here. Great value and service."}
{"text":"2 stars for service. I can't get over the price of  pancakes here. $7.50 for 4 pancakes with blueberries. I could have went to Perkins or Bob Evans and got pancakes on the side of a meal for that price total. The service was the only thing pleasant about my visit. I wouldn't go here again for that price. Very underwhelming."}
{"text":"I stopped here with a  neighbor yesterday around noon and I forgot the two rules of IHOP.  Rule #1:  Never get anything other than breakfast.  Rule #2:  Don't forget Rule #1.

I almost ordered some pancakes but at the last minute I changed my mind and ordered their new turkey and bacon club sandwich.  It's not really a club and had I read the menu I would have seen that it was on a grilled roll.  Misnamed product I'd say.  The disappointing thing about the sandwich was that the turkey was sliced lunch meat, not sliced turkey.  It was an ungainly sandwich and the innards squeezed out as I ate it.  The redeeming part of lunch was the seasoned fries--seasoned mostly with salt, but then I'm a salt freak, so I thought they were great.

Service was OK.  After we got our lunchers, we realized the server forgot to give us napkins or silverware.  Unable to flag anyone down, we walked to another table and took theirs.

I haven't been to an IHOP in a couple of years, but if I return, I'll remember Rule #1 --- or #2."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice, both very late at night and both with the same server. His name was Jeff and did an excellent job both times. We had no problems, service was fast and efficient there was not a moment in which my cup was not full. He even offered a carafe so all of us would be ensured a drink so he could serve other tables. He pretty much made Ihop enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"This is my wife & I fave place... TOO HATE! Rude... Undercooked & overcooked pancakes. Cold. 

Had the AYCE shrimp... Just a pile/plate of grease! Could lube up the car! Thankfully it's AYCE because of small portion"}
{"text":"I frequent iHops with my family especially now that they have the kids eat free option. However... You need to be AWARE of the fine print!

The kids MUST have a drink PURCHASED! And the adult entree(or \"entry\" as they pronounced it, lol) according to one person CANNOT be a 5 stack by itself. It MUST be a \"combo\"(came from a RED SHIRT(mngr?)Then another said \"It can be\"(came from a server).... They're don't even know! 

My wife & I found this out the hard way(at this particular iHop). We have NEVER had this problem at any of the other iHop establishments that we have gone too. Weather it's for the adult 5 stack OR the drinks. 

The server that we had(Catherine) last night was very rude. Walked passed us many times & I had to stop her(sometimes not even paying attn as I asked her for something). Talks under her breath a lot. Made things like it was no big deal(when she TRIED to explain the check, etc). 

Why is it that iHop has to MAKE you purchase a drink($2+) for a kid when McDs, Wendy's, BK, amongst just a few named that the drink is included??! 

Lost business at this location is promised!"}
{"text":"Yet ANOTHER dive. IHOP is REALLY gone downhill over the years. Rude, dirty, food doesn't get fully cooked through, just to name a few. Bad service over all. 

Went here for my wife's birthday(with 3 kids) AYCE pancake breakfast. Took \"15 minute wait\" which actually turned into a 20-25 minute wait. Once seated, it took a bit for the waitress to come(it was busy so it was slightly understandable), but either way. No smile... No intro.... No NOTHING. Just \"What do you want to drink & what do you want to order?\" 

Once ordered, she came back about 15 mins later with our WATER & just dropped the glasses & straws & ran. Then another 10 with the food(wife's stack & my sausage & egg combo). The kids(ranging from 2-5... Let's face it, they DONT eat much!) didn't get anything because we figured they would just share our pancakes(as they ALWAYS do) because nobody at ANY IHOP(including the waitress we had last time we were here) we go too has ANYTHING to say about the kids nibbling out of our plates. 

But THIS particular waitress had a problem with our kids nibbling. (We found out when we received the bill) Charged $1.99 for a sharing charge! 

I/we never even got the chance to ask for refills on the pancakes but she brought me \"2 just in case\" & NOTHING for my wife. So she had to have 1 of the 2 that she just brought(which took another 15 minutes). And again.... Dropping the food& running(the WRONG order I might add).... Took another 5-10 to just get her attn to tell her that I did NOT order the food that she dropped. So she finally dropped & ran my food(the right order this time). My wife & I tasted the potatoes & realized they just didn't \"taste right\"..... But was she around to tell? NOPE. Once she finally came around, I asked for white toast instead. Again... Dropping & running.  

When we received the bill(with the sharing charge).... We were dumbfounded when we saw the $1.99 on it. So we TRIED to question it but again.... Nowhere to be found & too busy dropping & running. When we finally got hold of her... Her response was \"The AYCE is for the consumption of the person that prefers it.... Do you understand?! Wait a minute.... I'll let (whatever name she babbled) explain it!\" And bolted away from the table.

A person(ID'd them-self as \"The Manager\" & stayed the same EXACT thing that the waitress said & then questioned(being VERY SNOTTY) us(the customer) when we told her that the kids did nibble off our plates but WE actually consumed the majority of the pancakes. 

She finally took it off the bill(after giving my wife & I a VERY dirty look. Stated(VERY snotty) \"I'll take it off THIS time but remember, it's not me.... It's the company that charges\".

Manager: Jo
Waitress: Lori J."}
{"text":"Service sucks left me on the  phone almost 10 minutes walked in restaurants told them to hang upon slow service"}
{"text":"I don't get all the negative reviews. I've been going to this location since it opened & food & service is always perfect. It's IHOP. U know what you're getting going in.  It's gonna be noisy since it's a laid back kid friendly place-it's not that noisy. Ever. It's gonna be busy on the weekend around brunch time-try to be patient if you are going to any restaurant at peak time. It's not a fine dining establishment so I don't expect 'ambience' just cleanliness & every time I've been here it's been spotless. 

Just picked up to go order. No mistakes. Extra syrup for our syrup sponges (pancakes). Everything cooked perfectly-scrambled, over easy & sunny side up. 

Staff was friendly courteous. 

The only time I didn't like the food was when I ordered chicken n waffles but that was me-my son scarfed them down & ordered another one-manager comped the 1st one (totally unnecessary as my kid loved it but the waitress noticed I didn't like it) & I ordered something else. 

It beats Mcd's anytime"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant with friendly staff. The gentleman who seated us and the waitress who served us were both very courteous. I decided to try the Colorado omelet. It came loaded with shredded beef, diced ham, chopped sausage, peppers, onion, and melted cheese. It wasn't bad, but I think it would have been better as a side rather than a main entree. With the tip I paid, the whole meal came out to roughly $12. Overall, the dining experience wasn't bad, but I do have two gripes. My wife ordered raspberry pancakes but ended up with plain ones instead. Also, after we were finished and had requested a \"take home box\" for our leftovers, we had to wait a seemingly extraordinary length of time for it. To be fair, the waitress seemed to be preoccupied with another customer who was being difficult. I wouldn't mind mind giving this place another try."}
{"text":"First impression(2/5) : I made the mistake of going here on a father's day... extremely crowded! We had to wait 25 minutes! As we were waiting outside one of the \"chefs\" came out for a smoke break and his clothes were FILTHY. Every fiber in my body wanted to get back in the car and leave but my husband and friend really wanted to eat here. This ihop hasn't even been open for a year but it definitely didn't look new. 

Customer service (0/5): HORRIBLE! Our waitress had an incredibly bad attitude. She was super rude and was acting like we were wasting her time by taking our orders. I'm really curious how she got the job because there was nothing friendly or personable about her demeanor. You know those type of people that NEVER smile and everyday is a bad day for them... that's our waitress. When she came to our table she didn't introduce herself, she just said, \"What do you guys want!\" Oh, and they didn't clean off the table before we sat down. There was syrup everywhere. She didn't check on us until we were done with our meals. We also didn't get a refill until we were done with our meals. I was thirty as a mug! 

Food (2/5): one word - Sloppy! I ordered chicken strips and \"seasoned\" fries. I don't really like breakfast food that much. When my plate came, it looked like they just threw it on the plate. Their version of \"seasoned\" fries is regular fries with a sprinkle of season salt on top. SUPER LAME! On top of the lame fries they only gave me a few. 

Never coming back...ever!"}
{"text":"I'm mainly giving 5 stars because of our server, Shiann  (I think that's how she spelled it). Before she even greeted our table, she gave us a big smile from across the room while she finished up helping her other tables. So I knew that she knew we were there and the smile confirmed she would be there shortly. She brought us everything we needed, never seemed annoyed, and was just so friendly. The food was good, restaurant was clean, and nothing took too long. All this should be expected of a restaurant but our great service from her really made the trip worth it!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate there this morning we got cold coffee and a cool breakfast, this place is horrible!!"}
{"text":"Food was reasonably priced and service was excellent Christine was very attentive and friendly.

For such a busy day (Mother's Day in Mexico, May 10th) we were seated very promptly and did not feel rushed to finish eating.

My one complaint us the lack of Boysenberry syrup, that they used to provide."}
{"text":"I almost always stop here for breakfast on my Costco runs. This location is always clean, bright,  and the breakfast  is always good/great. Just seems less greasy and fresher somehow. Today, we both enjoyed some crepes off the holiday menu. They were outstanding. 

As stated in other reviews, your experience here is highly dependent on how busy they are and your server. Ours was excellent.  Happy holiday Miranda!"}
{"text":"Arrived with the restaurant half empty but still had to wait 20 minutes on a table and another 15 for a server to show up. The food was just so so and one person in our party order a combo and the pancakes never came. I asked for hot syrup and was told I would have to wait until they took care of to go orders."}
{"text":"It's clean that's why they got 2 stars . The waitress obviously hates her job or whatever else the food well lets go over the food chicken fingers and fries over done should have been called sticks and hockey pucks.  The sampler my son said is was meh French toast looked great! Then you tasted it and tasted like bread nothing but bread most flavorless French toast I ever ate if that's not bad enough the hot chocolate tasted like dirty dishwater with a pinch of chocolate who ruins hot chocolate?  Really? This place was immaculately clean but I'm sure it's because they weren't busy with only 8 tables filled while we were there, including ours.  So in closing this was the first time at this location and even though other locations may not be as clean at least they taste better"}
{"text":"We usually split an omelette (the Colorado and chicken fajita are the best!) and an extra order of pancakes.  My husband always ordered the cinnastack pancakes but has recently turned to the cinnamon French toast.   Always a winner and the pancakes are simply the best!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was completely empty and it was my small family of 3 and it took over an hour to make breakfast and we never saw our waitress until she brought us our check.  We never got our drinks refilled until we asked and then she was not really interested in getting us anything else.  The service was terrible and I hope that this gets worked on because I never wish to return."}
{"text":"Late night. 
Okay atmosphere. 
Nice servers. 

Food wasn't fantastic this time, but that doesn't mean I won't be back. 
Sometimes we wait a while for service and our food, but we normally come late @ night or during busy hours so I don't hold it against them. 

Appetizer sampler is always good. 
My husband and I come often. 

Carpets could use a cleaning, but all and all, good experiences are had here."}
{"text":"We are there at peak time for Sunday breakfast.   The service was very fast.   The waitress was super.   I wanted something off the menu.   She made it happen.  

Our food was great.   It was served quickly and very hot.   My off the menu item was perfect.   All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"Nice food, decent service.  Good prices for the most part, except for the kids meals, that are a bit too much for the little that they eat.  I now only go on the days that the kids eat for free.   

Bring back that original Southwest Fajita Salad...it was awesome but was discontinued a few years ago."}
{"text":"Had to get lab work done on base that involved fasting so I was  pretty hungry after. I insisted on stopping here instead of driving a little further, like everyone wanted. Big mistake and I take full responsibility. 

Don't get me wrong, everyone was friendly BUT the first thing you notice is the smell. It's like a combination of sweat and pee. We could have left but I'm stubborn and I thought it would go away, only it did not. I had to ask for new silverware also because mine still had dried eggs stuck to it(ugh!). Our food took forever to come out too! 2 couples that came after us were halfway done with theirs when our food came and there's a resident fruit fly that's just hovering around.

We ate our food and got out of there as quickly as possible, with the off putting smell stuck to our clothes. 

Would we come back? I don't think so."}
{"text":"Completely forgot that today is Nevada day so the place was really crowded when we got there at 10ish. Wait time was 15-20mins. The staff were super nice especially our server, Rick. He was swamped but we didn't feel neglected at all. This guy deserves a raise IHOP management!

Considering how busy they were, my expectations were set pretty low. I actually expected overcooked, barely warm food. Thankfully they proved me wrong. My chicken fried steak with over medium eggs , hash browns and red velvet pancakes were all perfectly and deliciously cooked. The kiddo's 2x2x2 was supposedly yummy too.

I ducked a star because the floors were a little dirty. Other than that, all was good. We'll be back again for breakfast when we're in the area."}
{"text":"First time at this IHOP. Brought the fam here after spending most of the morning sledding at Mt. Charleston. It's location is convenient. There was 15mins wait at 12pm but it went by fast. Service was good and fast. Hubby's Colorado omelette looked good and it was huge too. The kids had the silver 5, they demolished it so it must be good or they could just be hungry. I had the chicken and waffles. It was ok, the waffles were kinda soggy but the chicken strips were good. The serving seems smaller than the last time we had it at another location. 

We'll probably be back if we're in the area but I won't get out of my way just to come and eat here."}
{"text":"It's an IHOP. You're not getting five star dining here.

But what you will get is friendly, hospitable service with decent (albeit a little overpriced) food.

When the server found out I was graduating today, he brought over a free slice of chocolate cake he paid for. I thought it was a really, really sweet gesture and guaranteed my vote to tell people to go there, if nothing else for the good service."}
{"text":"This place definitely needs some work.   The service was great, the one thing I really had an issue with was the quality of the food.  I ordered a sandwich from this Ihop location and what I got was a soggy mess.  I couldn't even finish it since there it was literally unappetizing.  Worst $10 I've ever spent."}
{"text":"Nothing special, expected more with a fairly new store.  Food was pretty good, many of the clientele looked kinda rough."}
{"text":"IHOP is very busy this morning but well worth the wait for them blueberry crepes and relaxing with my Sunday paper 
It turned out to. It be so relaxing when the same waiter kept screaming out orders as he went by my table 
Been here at least a half hour no food yet hummmmmm and all the wait staff is running around stressed out 
Starving"}
{"text":"OK, so it isn't gourmet food, but the pancakes are the best I've ever had and the prices are a helluva lot less than most of the casinos. I also tried one of their specialty drinks with strawberry puree, lemon lime soda and orange juice. It was a great departure from O.J. or apple juice. Add to it a buy one, get one free coupon and two of us had a really good breakfast at a really good price. For the two of us it was less than $20, with tip."}
{"text":"IHop my way over here, getting what I expected but never disappointed. Wait staff always finds a smile. I was glad to see that the fruit bowl was fresh, not canned."}
{"text":"One thing I've found about IHOPs---service and cleanliness vary from location to location.  This IHOP is one of the cleanest we've ever been to plus service has always been consistent, as has the food.

I recommend going for breakfast which, IMO, is what IHOP does best.  We've never been disappointed when we've dined at this IHOP."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend for breakfast. I wasn't expecting great service considering the location but I was pleasantly surprised. Our waiter, Scott was extremely prompt and friendly. That man deserves a raise!!! The restaurant is aging but still very clean with the bus staff constantly cleaning empty tables. Great job guys :)"}
{"text":"Long wait time for food 47 minutes to be exact. Order was wrong. I thought with the remodel this place would be better.   I had such high hope for IHOP it's the only one thatnear the house and I am sad to be disappointed and greeted with dirty tables, cold food and long lines. I left and won't go back"}
{"text":"So, I come in here with some friends, I order the chicken Florentine Crepes, I have allergies, I specifically told JOHN our waiter to not include the mushrooms as he naturally begin to inquire about my allergies, he left me to believe that he understood that I didn't want any mushrooms within 100 miles of my food. So, my food did end up coming out within a timely manner and BEHOLD I found a plethora of mushrooms in my food, and I know this is a minor fix but I was damn near assassinated by IHOP because they carelessly decided to put mushrooms in my food. Food was great though honestly."}
{"text":"We were driving around wasting time and came up on the restaurant.  We were in need of breakfast, so IHOP it is.  The parking lot is really weird- the way the spaces are lined up, it can be difficult to park.  There is also not alot of space.  The nearby area seemed a little sketch, but not frightening.

I ordered the pick-a-pancake combo.  Didn't really need the hash browns, but my brother offered to eat them.  Problem solved.  I got the double blueberry pancakes- blueberry pancakes with blueberry topping.  You definitely get alot of them. The eggs were cooked well.  The bacon could have been cooked a little longer.  To drink, I got the splashberry splasher.  How awesome that you get free refills of them.

Our server was a bit slow to begin with.  We got seated, she took our drink order, and then she disappear for a long while.  The others in our section were looking around for her, too.  My brother even joked with another table that they may have to go find her.  Not so good."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars. I'm sure IHOP doesn't care about Yelp reviews because they are a national chain but my experience tonight was unbelievable. We walk into IHOP and are taken to a booth by the manager in which we were told to \"watch out for the strawberries on the floor\" as we walked to the booth. There was strawberry compote spread and good length on the floor. There was one other party in the restaurant so it was not during peak hours. Our waitress came right over and took our drink order then vanished for 30 mins. She brought our drinks & placed our order. While we waited another 30 minutes for our order to come out we had to wave her down twice to ask for drink refills. When the order arrived it was incorrect and cold. We sent the food back. She assured us it was being made right away. Another 20 minutes pass and we overhear her tell the cooks she needs an order of French toast, scrambled eggs, etc. We realized it is our exact order she was just now placing. We should have just gotten up and walked out. The replacement food comes out and it is yet again wrong. We tell our waitress how frustrating this is and she apologizes and says she will discount the bill for us. After we wait another 20 minutes for her to discount our bill a whole whopping $3.86, we approach the counter to pay, stepping over the same strawberry compote that was there 2 hours ago. The manager is walking back and forth from the kitchen to his office and refuses to make eye contact. I waved him down so he could cash us out and he stands in the kitchen and yells for our waitress to cash us out. He never addressed the issues we experienced or tried to recover the service. Next time I want French toast at 8:30pm, I'm just going to make the damn things at home. I will never visit this location again."}
{"text":"Everything that I ordered from IHOP was pretty bland in taste. Not only that, but the food took forever to come through after ordering. I ordered an omelette and waited around 30 minutes for it to come to be table.

The server was friendly and apologized for the wait. I didn't understand why it took so long though, it wasn't even busy inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"We came in deep! We came in hungry! We came; and they were ready! 46 person group at 6:15 am. I thought to myself about the mentally disabled dude that says \"Got eem\"! As our group filled one side of the restaurant. Within minutes, the staff like a well oiled machine, was taking drink orders and right afterwards, if we were ready, they were able to start putting in our breakfast orders. I was filled with amazement to see our orders begin to start flying out of the kitchen after 15 mins. Jen was our server, and she was rocking it. She's a mature woman, but her energy was of a senior teen. She was sexy at her job! The guys that were helping the other sectors of my group, was making 3 pointer shouts with their service also. This team makes me love a place that I never liked. Then my poached eggs were cooked to perfection. Boy; y'all are freaking beautiful!"}
{"text":"I wish there is an option to select zero stars!  The scene at the hostess station when  we arrived should have been a red flag.   A few employees were staring at the seating chart and ignored us for a few minutes despite seeing us enter the restaurant.  One of them finally asked \"how many of you\" in a voice that seem to suggest that we were inconveniencing her by being there.   After receiving the answer,  she peered into the dining area and said nothing else.  The hostess (a different employee) then asked again for the number of people in our party,  despite standing in front of the first employee all this time and hearing our response.   

It took 10 minutes after being seated for a waitress to acknowledge us and ask 'did she get to you yet?'.  I presume the waitress assigned to our table was MIA.  It then took another 10 minutes to get the water we asked for.   There was plenty of opportunity to look around the restaurant while waiting - many tables were not served (no drinks) despite them having arrived before us,  a few seem to have been waiting a while for someone to take their food order, write a few were waiting for their food,  and a table across from us had food that was incorrectly prepared.  A woman,  whom I presume to be the manager from her attire, made a few appearances in the dining area,  seemingly unperturbed by the frustrated looks on the guests' faces. 

When our pancakes finally arrived, we discovered that 2 our of our 3 orders had undercooked pancakes with raw batter in the middle.  Mind you,  this is IHOP, a restaurant that is supposed to specialize in pancakes!  Instead of sending it back,  we decided to eat the portions that were edible as there was no telling how long it would take to flag down a waitress, or to have the food remade.   

As we were leaving,  we heard two ladies inform the staff at the hostess station that they were leaving because they waited for 20 minutes without being served.  The response? 'Oh,  that's too bad'.  The staff did not seem overly concerned.  We commiserated with those two patrons as we walked out together and they shared that they were heading to Panera.  In hindsight,  we should have too, the moment we saw the scene at the hostess station when we arrived.  There are enough dining options in the area now so I can safely say we will never be back to IHOP again."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Place had 12 people total inside and my mom only wanted a milk shake... after I had to go grab a server after waiting for 12 minutes, he asked \"did you guys just walk in?\" 15 minutes after ordering, no milk shake still. No employee even in the front or restaurant, they were all in back. 27 minutes, we eventually just got up and left to go find a restaurant who could serve food and maybe even just bring a water. Surprised this place is still in business, on a Saturday night, complete empty and no employees to service to be found anywhere."}
{"text":"Our expectations have not been met this cannot be an IHOP , the coffee was cold , the potatoes were cold , no refills for anything I've given this restaurant two chances I'm not going for the third"}
{"text":"Everytime we go to this IHOP we end up getting sick.  The kids they have working there are not experienced and have no idea how to make things right when you have a complaint.  The cooks are not very good.  We ask for our bacon not crisp and it comes out burnt.  Told the waiter but he said they blanch it the night before, cook it, freeze it and then microwave it the day it is served.  This seems like a lot of work and the bacon ends up like a piece of wood.  What is so difficult about putting a piece of bacon on the grill and cooking it fresh.
Another thing that was upsetting is that a lot of kids from Hamilton High School go to this IHOP and they take over the place.  They are loud, obnoxious and throw their stuff all over the floor and act like they are having their own private party. Nobody would dare say anything to them because they are entitled.  They are all on their cell phones and some were throwing food around.  One table had 4 girls who shared one hamburger and never left a tip.  They did leave a big mess.  The waiter was around their age so I guess he was scared to say anything to them.  We have noticed in other restaurants where Hamilton kids go, they are always disruptive and rude. We stopped going to the Wendys by Hamilton High because of this type of behavior.

Anyhow, we both got diarrhea and intestinal problems again from eating at this IHOP.  This is the 4th time.  Something is definitely wrong in the kitchen healthwise.  We are done -"}
{"text":"Too expensive! We showed the waitress a 'buy one, get one free' coupon from an entertainment book we purchased, but she said that the manager insisted we must each purchase a $3 drink even though this was not indicated on the coupon. When we paid the bill, the cashier said that the coupon had only an $8 value... this was not shown on the coupon either. All-in-all the total 'discounted' price of our two-meal breakfast came to $25 not including tip! The service and breakfast were fine but not spectacular and definitely not worth the price. Unfortunately, we won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm going with 3 stars. What I did like about my experience is the waitress Nicka was timely and polite."}
{"text":"Was worried to come here because of the low rating on yelp,  but decided it give a try and glad we did. Shere was our server and the service was fast and friendly. The place was clean and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"I've eaten @ IHOP's all over and I can honestly say, 9 out of 10 times I complain... but hey, it's a convenience and they have something that appeals to everyone! 
Well... here is that 10th time! On vacation in Vegas and heading to the Grand Canyon, no time to research the local Vegas fare (that's tomorrow), so we picked old faithful. This was not the norm!!! This place is great! Service was 5 star all the way. Our waiter (Al) was phenomenal, the food was great and even the hash browns I ordered well done came out well... well done! A feat which usually proves to be tricky in most IHOP'S I've been to. 
Another plus was that the place was not a madhouse to get into. Anyone who eats @ and IHOP knows, there is usually a wait for the table! Not here, fairly empty and sat immediately! 
A very good job... the bathrooms could have been a bit more detailed but it was NOT filthy, just not sparking!!!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I've had at a restaurant in a long time! We were seated very quickly, but the service was slow.  I've been here multiple times in the past years and the service has been average.  They had at least 10 waiters and the food came out cold and we never received any refills for our water.  When we went to pay for the bill and we were going to split the bill and pay with our debit cards.  The cashier asked if we were paying with cash.  I said, we were paying with debit.  She said, not cash!  I said, no by debit. She had to go get her Manager...wow!  We will not be going back to that IHOP ever again!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday morning at 8am. Instantly sat in a booth. Our server was quick with our food and drinks. She was also on top of drink refills and checked in on us to make sure we had everything we needed. Will be back"}
{"text":"Great food great service . Breakfast is always busy , hard to find parking lot . Pancake is great at IHOP. In side is very clean too."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Slow service and overpriced for the quality of food. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Service is slow and the Tuscan scramble was cold. Not very good. SMDH Mot the IHOP I grew up with"}
{"text":"Great prompt & friendly service for my To Go order. They weren't busy but I have no doubt that the staff would have performed any other way. Best location."}
{"text":"Went here about 7:30 in the morning which wasn't to bad. Not to many people in there. Service wasn't to bad..........the smell inside the building tho that was horrible. Along with the food, bad just bad. The only thing that was good was the raspberry iced tea. Needless to say I will not be going back to this location probably not any I hop."}
{"text":"This a 4-star review for many reasons. It was the perfect storm in a way. First the group sitting in the booth in front of me was very comical. That young kid was better then listening to the comedy channel while sitting on the couch trying to take a nap...some of the stuff he said was very funny but you knew he wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer. Remember \"pro choice\" for a reason!! Then the argument in the kitchen between I think the cook and the waitress of waffles?!? REALLY?!? You guys were arguing and saying derogatory insults over...waffles, HA!!! Very Entertaining especially with the comments coming from the booth in front!
Next thing is I decided to order something that wouldn't jack my blood sugar to near comatose levels, so I ordered the Simple & Fit omelette. Add Tabasco and BAM!! A flavorful breakfast that high in protein and only 310 calories to boot! 
So with the entertainment from both the booth in front of me and the kitchen excitement along with as healthy as possible meal, I give it 4 stars! PEACE!!"}
{"text":"My review is only on pick up. Called my order in around 10:50am today and the guy said hold up. I was on hold for ten minutes. So I cancel and re-call them. Then a lady answered and took my order in less than a minute. So I get there around 11:12am(usually only takes 10 minutes). I walk up and tell, Carlos, the guy at the desk I'm here for pick up. He totally ignores me and seats some people. I wasn't mad, I was pissed. So 5 minutes later a lady comes to the front and asks me why I'm just standing there. lol I tell her pick up and she says my food isn't ready. So what do I do cry, yell, complain....nah I pay for my food and I just sit down. Guess who's in the kitchen chit chatting.....CARLOS!!!!!! I wanted to take a picture but that would be kind of creepy. I got my food until 11:30am. That was 40 minutes after I called them the first time. Luckily I inhaled my food trying to get back to work so I did eat my lunch. Food was okay, but I'm just disappointed on how Carlos probably was the one who put me on hold and just bounced once I got there to pick up my food. I felt discriminated, shamed, angry, maybe because I was wearing a painted shirt either way I didn't feel like a valued customer who's been here more than 50 times maybe even more than 100 times...."}
{"text":"This IHOP is a great place for friends and family to gather which is why we visited. Their menu is very colorful and an individual can get breakfast at noon and mozzarella sticks with ranch all in the same visit. I ordered breakfast and my guest dinner at noontime. The issue that I did have here was that we were offered drink refills but cups never filled. Even when we asked our server for refills she finally brought them with our check."}
{"text":"We were greeted and seated as soon as we walked in. We must have beat the Saturday morning rush. My son had a ham and cheese omelet with 3 pancakes he said it was good. I had a T-bone steak, scrambled eggs and cheese, 3 pancakes, milk, and grapefruit juice. My steak was really good and cooked just how I asked for it. Everything was good. Our waitress was very attentive, courteous, professional, and great."}
{"text":"IHOP has been my favorite restaurant for the past 14 years. I recently removed to surprise Arizona, and oh what a surprise I got when I visited the local IHOP. I sum it up to poor service and management at this location. My daughter's orange juice  had white floaties which was not pulp, the coffee cafe was filthy having butter stain, water spots, syrup,and fingerprints on it. The server brought it out and ignored that it was filthy.  Our order was not cooked specific to the request and when we brought it to the server attention her body language spoke louder than her words. Will not return to this IHOP"}
{"text":"Service was great, genna did a great job. Fries were kinda stale but turkey sandwhich was good"}
{"text":"This location is the dirtiest IHOP I have ever been too. Food is not great. I always seem to be over charged. Really not worth even coming here. Service is terrible. Had a male waiter who had so much attitude, he was lucky I even bothered to tip."}
{"text":"The food was OK and it didn't take too long to receive our food order, there wasn't a lot of people in the restaurant area and that was the highlights of our experience. Everything else from rude, not so friendly hostess, to a ok waitress that took our order, brought our food to us, and Never checked back with us to see how we were doing. All of our drinks needed refills and like I said earlier in this review there wasn't a lot of people in the restaurant area. The waitress seemed to like hanging out in the back talking with her coworkers more then serving her customers. Despite this horrible experience at the particular iHOP location, we still ended up giving her a tip for some reason and her attitude when giving tip was with a lot less gratitude then expected. I do not see going back to this IHOP location nor would I recommend anyone going there unless you lower your expectations down next to nothing."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely miserable I now go out of my way to the IHOP on Fort Apache or even the Denny's honestly anything is better than this place. It's dirty and it's menu is limited. They cannot get pancakes right and do not ask for something that isn't on the menu because they will serve you God knows what because they don't know what it is you're asking for. We asked if they had biscuits and gravy and they told us yes and then they brought us an English muffin cut in half with some weird gravy on it. We used to get coupons that made it to for one and even with our coupons now we wouldn't waste the meal."}
{"text":"This is my preferred IHOP in my area. I live closer to the one on Rainbow but that one is such a joke the very limited menu its dirty and they cannot make a pancake! This location has it fall IHOP menu and everything I've had there so far has been great!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. The waitresses deal w alot of bad customers coming through here and deal w it great. Tip your waitress well here they deserve it"}
{"text":"Okay I came in at 2 am. Our server waited 20 minutes to even approach us, took another 15 minutes for her to bring the drinks, then took one of the drinks away and didn't bring another one. She yelled at another table in front of us and it took over 25 minutes to receive our food. I would not recommend this Ihop! I really think she is intoxicated or high on something! She can't remember anything you tell her ! I've never seen anything like this and I'm a server ! So I'm not a critic at all! This is just so horrible ! I hope management really look at this yelp because she needs to be off the floor"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to an IHOP so I was very surprised to how modern this location is in terms of atmosphere and menus! Kudos to them in that aspect. 

With everything else...... shouldn't expect that much but if it takes us three tries and two different servers to be able to ask for anything like a bottle ketchup or hot sauce, we'll probably be done with our meal by the time we get any of our other requests. In addition, our server seemed to really hate us by the way she talked to us or she wasn't having the best of days. But either way, we apologize if we caused her any inconvenience!

In terms of food, everything was pretty subpar. Eggs were a little salty and hash browns could be crispier but the pancakes were not bad! But it'll take a lot of convincing for me to come back."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much since I'm not a fan of diner chains like IHOP or Denny's. But I've been here twice now recently and idk, maybe I had too low of expectations or maybe they truly were enjoyable experiences.

First time there I had strawberry pancakes with creme filled French toast. My friend ordered the Belgian waffles. The portions were humongous! She didn't finish half of hers, but I'm a hungry man so I finished mine and hers. They service was fast too, but then again it wasn't busy. 

This second time the service was just as pleasant but a bit slower. It was pretty busy though so I gotta take that into consideration. I ordered the chicken florentine crepes (substituted mushrooms and onions for red peppers). They were fantastic!!!! And not just for IHOP. I mean after all I did see a review that said \"eh it's IHOP, not great but not the worst\". I'm sure we can all relate and know exactly wtf he's saying. Lol. But I gotta say, they're 2-0. And those crepes were good enough that they'd be the reason I would come back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just left and we were very satisfied . We started off by ordering chicken quesadilla which was a bomb appetizer, I ordered the New York cheesecake pancakes which is my all time favorite and my baby got his chicken and waffles. Our waitress AMBER was simply amazing. Great customer service, constantly checking up on us and the cooks food was delicious!!!! Thank you we were so hungry, definitely coming back !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"No CHOLULA!!    To be honest,  when it comes to their food, I usully know what to expect-- Decent food, decent service, OK Price.  Well, as anticipated, all was ok, until the waitress said that they were not allowed to give their customers Cholula Hot Sauce any longer.  I said \"what\"?  She proceeeds to tell me that they can only hand it out when people order chicken wings.  Really?  That makes no sense!  Needless to say, she insisted that she could not bring me any.  that really sucks.  11.00 Downt he drain. will not go back to this IHOP again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We received a coupon in the mail for a free meal with the purchase of another meal, so we decided to have breakfast this past Sunday morning at IHOP. Despite living near this IHOP for 2 years, I have never eaten here, mainly because there are other places nearby that I prefer for breakfast. 

IHOP is currently doing an all-you-can-eat pancake promo, my husband got that with eggs and hashbrowns. I decided to get the International Crepe Passport with strawberry banana crepes, this came with eggs, bacon and sausage. 

Our waiter was efficient and helpful. He made sure to bring out a pot of coffee so we wouldn't have to pester him for refills, as well as Tabasco and ketchup in case we needed it. 

Our food was good,  not great but good. The crepes were particularly tasty, I wish they did an all-you-can-eat crepe promo. I still prefer Omelet House down the street though. Unless we have a coupon, we probably won't be back for a while..."}
{"text":"In the last 2 years, I have probably been to this specific IHOP about 10 times.  If you're ever in this exact area, you know how tough of a neighborhood this place can be.  But I find myself out here often and when it comes to finding a place to feed my belly, sometimes IHOP will just have to do. 

First of all, this place gets pretty busy on Fridays.  I think most of my visits here have all been on a Friday. Known for their pancakes, but they are just okay.  What I actually come here for is their Steak Omelet with hash browns extra crispy.  Not the healthiest breakfast/brunch, not the tastiest, but still enough to satisfy me until my next meal.  

Service is spotty at best in my opinion.  They have someone that serves strictly drinks and another person for food. Nothing can be more frustrating than being hungry, wondering what their specials are, and the person that first serves you drinks telling you that they don't know.  My other issue is that their diet Pepsi machine is always down.  At least it has been down my last 3 visits.  

Overall, I have to give it 3 stars.  Tough to give them any lower since I eat here so often."}
{"text":"This will probably be the last time I ever go to this location. My boyfriend and I were seated very quickly, but he host was unsure of where to seat us.   We waited about 5 mins to get served, then realized we both were ready and no one had even come near the table. We saw what we think is a manger cleaning tables around us. Made eye contact with us twice and went about cleaning. The server who we assumed was ours, looked at the table and walked away. We made the decision to leave and head to Dennys. We gave you a shot and you let us down. As being a server for over 12 years, with a not so busy restaurant, your staff shouldn't be taking almost 10 mins to even greet their table. Maybe try A better server training program.."}
{"text":"The burgers here at IHOB are actually surprisingly great!!!!   The fries are amazing too!!!   Great value!
Check it out;)"}
{"text":"Worst service I've had in years. Nazim uddin the restaurant manager should be fired or taken to a customer relations class. That man is an idiot when it comes to defusing a situation. I sat down for 5 mins without service finally someone comes we order for 2 a coffee and water and free pancakes on International pancake day. We got our pancakes and drinks fast it was awesome but then we sat there for 35 minutes without a single server ask how our meals are refill my water. I literally ate all my ice cubes and poured some coffee in my cup. Now at any point in time I could've asked what was going on but I wanted to see how long it would take. So finally I asked to talk to a manager. He came around the corner and I said hey man what's going on we've been waiting for 40 minutes. His  first response was \"I assure you, you have not been waiting that long.\" Now I'm upset. Because the general manager just told me I was wrong. Not like I haven't been timing you or anything. Keep in mind I serve and make 400 a night at the restaurant I serve at and you never tell the customer they're wrong. So I said afterwards that this is fucking ridiculous and he told me not to say curse words. I reassured him that I can talk anyway I'd like because I'm angry. And then I said dude, Don't tell me how to speak. He replied saying don't say \"dude\". I said excuse me now you're telling me how to speak? I said I'm a paying customer who us upset about the service and he said he can kick me out. It doesn't matter that I'm a paying customer. If I'd like I could have him take the order. I said ok. Come over here. So we ordered and then he had another server who wasn't our initial server come and help us. I asked him if I wasn't waiting for some 40 mins where is the server you originally introduced and I see her helping the other people at the table next to us. They've been served and already paid. And I haven't even gotten my food. He just said it will be out as soon as possible. So the server was awesome after that. Being I work in the industry I knew it wasn't her falt. I got my food and I actually tipped her 35%. when I went to pay he didn't even comp a meal he said sorry and compped. A coffee so my 22 dollar meal went to 18. Lmfao. I don't care about the food I payed for it. But after that service that should be the least you can do. I understand the IHOP isn't in the nicest part of Phoenix area but I was hungry and I saw it. So that's where I went. It shouldn't matter the location. The people that work there should make the environment and the dining experience. Well ill never be eating at a IHOP again if they hire people like that. I just can't believe he was the general manager. Store 1505"}
{"text":"The worst iHop I've ever entered. The one star is for my waitress acknowledging there was a problem. 
The staff was loud, cursed and carried on conversations in front of guest. Guest next to my booth saw what seemed like an insect, and asked for help from the host. He refused to help them and asked another staff meme bet to handle the situation. After ordering my food, I quickly ask for my waitress and canceled my order and left. 
The entire restaurant needs to be restaffed."}
{"text":"Holy pancakes! The best of the best! Everything was FRESH, service friendly and fast, unbelieveable! They can turn breakfast into breakFEAST! Carmen guided us through our order and kept us in the know! Who knew that an eggwhite omelette with fresh spinach and mushrooms could be soooo tasty. Hubby had the sampler and didnt speak til his buttermilk pancakes were finished. 
My fork barely left my hand as I enjoyed it all!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for breakfast on Christmas morning and surprisingly, it wasn't too busy at the time I was there. The parking lot is large and can accommodate large amounts of cars. 

As you enter the restaurant, you're greeted by the smiling faces of the ladies that work at the front. Even though they had to work on Christmas, they were cheerful and smiling. The host sat us immediately in the first seating room, which seemed small compared to many other IHops that I've been to. There was another room where they were seating large groups of people. 

Our waitress came by quickly and took our drink order while we looked over the menu. I haven't been to an IHOP in awhile, so many of their items on their menu were new. I decided on the New Spicy Poblano Omelette and made it a combo and added a side of hash browns. My guest got the Denver Omelette with a side of pancakes. Our food came out fairly quickly, probably within 10 minutes. Everything was fresh and cooked the way we liked it. 

Our waitress was very sweet and came around several times during our visit to check up on us and to make sure that our meal was how we wanted it to be. She refilled our drinks often as well. Always smiling and spreading the holiday cheer. 

The restaurant itself was clean and organized. Tables were cleaned off immediately as people left. Floors were clean with no trash or food on it. The inside was decorated nicely for the holidays and it just had that nice inviting feel to it. I would definately come back to this location."}
{"text":"I don't understand what the negative reviews are talking about. My mom and I had a fine experience here. Service was good (though food took a little longer than it should have) and food was great. Mom's fruit cup was a bit frozen, but she asked for another, and that one was fine. Bathrooms were fine. No reason not to visit this location, really."}
{"text":"Slowwwww service so far, but the food is great"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!! The tables are all about two inches from each other, which is really awkward. We waited about 30 minutes for our food, to get under done scrambled eggs, and have nobody come over to us to see how everything turned out. Naturally I tried walking up to the servers and the manager looked at me and kept walking???? And about 5 workers were just standing around talking and we still didn't get help. We actually left."}
{"text":"Slowest service I've ever had
This was my second visit and worse than the first
This visit entailed a screaming match in the kitchen by wait staff
I won't be going back to this location"}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Place was a bit dirty but prolly because of it being busy. Chef n waitress tonight did a superb job!! Food and service was spectacular!!"}
{"text":"Kevin, our waiter, was very good. He kept me hydrated with iced tea which is rather important to me. The goofy thing is a fresh straw with every glass?

I had the California skillet. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I seriously don't have it in my heart to give this place one star especially since I ALWAYS come here at least once a month ! & always have great service .... not tonight .... all new faces ..... maybe I came too early tonight & need the over night crew that makes me laugh & are fast with great customer service ! Any who .... it's not packed in here , how ever ..... it took 15 mins to get water ! & then after getting my food I asked if they could melt the cheese for me on my sandwich .... like it's suppose to be ..... & that took another 45 mins to the point where I didn't even want it anymore. I am so sad to even write this review with just 1 star especially since I always come here & never have issues but then again k have never seen these faces .... this breaks my heart but I'm super upset about this. There is only one other table being occupied in here at the moment. It's beyond ridiculous."}
{"text":"Was there around April 10th around 1130. Myself, wife and father-in-law. He had blood work that morning and had to fast. He used to love that place until that morning, not only did it take over 30 minutes to get over food and was cold like sitting under warmer. The pancakes were like chewing on a rubber band along with having hard crust on them. The restaurant wasn't busy at all ( as I can see why ). To top it off another table that came in 10 minutes after us seemed to get there food before us. We will NEVER step foot in that place again!!!!! BTW he's in a walker. I'd be very embarrassed if I was the manager there, both me and the in customer service industry. Little customer service goes a long way in my book."}
{"text":"worst service ever one star to good for this place!!  placed a to go order for pancakes took 30 min!!  would never go back I would starve first!!!"}
{"text":"Made a phone order, turkey bacon strips, and crispy hash-browns, I walked in and I got 4 regular bacon strips and barely cooked hash-browns, I just feel the person who took my order could barely speak English or understand, I specified turkey bacon and crispy hash browns, next time I come
Back in definitely confirming my order twice"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast at 10 am on a Thursday morning. It took about five minutes for someone to come and seat us. There were only a few tables occupied and the service was horrible. We got coffee and ordered our meals. No one ever came back to let us know when to expect our meals. At 10:45 we left. Never got our food or an explanation about what was taking so long.  I would give this IHOP zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant, new and clean. I ordered the whole wheat blueberry pancakes and eggs and it was the best meal I've ever had from an IHOP. The service was a bit slow considering we were one of 5 couples in the restaurant."}
{"text":"If you want to be uncomfortable while eating and think its okay to seat 6 grown adults (3x at 6'3\") at a 4x person table, this is your place! One of my most uncomfortable dining experiences. Recommend going to Black Bear Diner next door.  Disappointed in the decision making of the hostess Christina and management. When asked if we could sit elsewhere, we were told we'd have to wait another 20 minutes. Yet, this same team sat two people at an 8x person table, 3x ppl at the same booth next to us and 5x at a 6x person table. Staff was friendly enough. Both Samuel and Tiff apologized. Tiff was our saving grace, she was prompt, pleasant, and professional.  We were all very uncomfortable. To make matters worse the booth also had a large uncovered hole in the seat my sister kept falling into."}
{"text":"Worst ihop ever!
Server Michele kept telling us to be quiet at 4am even though there was NO ONE else in the restaurant!! There were 8 of us and we were all being loud since we all just came from work, but to tell us to be quiet with no one in there?? What the ...??Never coming back to this location.

On to the food
I ordered the avocado bacon omelet, it was ok nothing special. This comes with a choice of hash browns and pancakes or toast. Now after waiting a solid 45 minutes for the food when she brought my toast out she dropped half of it on the floor and left it there and just gave me the other half!! Ok at least the one I ate wasn't on the floor but can you get the other 2 pieces you owe me. She also never brought hash browns. Horrible experience here, maybe that's why that server is scheduled at night so she isn't helping to many people??"}
{"text":"IHOP is IHOP.... so the 2 star rating is not for the nation wide chain, it's for this specific location. This IHOP has really really bad service, food takes a long time to show up, drink refiles never come, and it's not as clean as I would like."}
{"text":"The place had a moldy smell and the window sills had a lot of dirt and dust. We asked to sit at another  booth, but the smell was still there. I wondered if the kitchen was clean? Yikes, no return trip here."}
{"text":"Called in a to-go order, was ready in 10 minutes! My food was fresh, cooked just right and the staff was friendly. Best experience at an IHOP :)"}
{"text":"I don't think this place cares if they stay open or not. This is the worst managed Ihop I have ever seen. They don't offer online ordering.I have been trying to call off and on this morning and no one will answer the phone, and there is no voicemail. What kind of business doesn't answer the telephone? I won't go there and eat in person since there is always at minimum a 30-45 minute wait for your food, longer than anywhere else in the area. I don't get a two hour lunch break at work, and that's what you need for a few measly pancakes at Ihop. Save yourself some disappointment and order your breakfast from Eat n' Park like I am doing today, or any one of the many other restaurants in the Robinson area. I can't believe this place has not been shut down yet."}
{"text":"Came for lunch for a try , won't be doing that again ,there food either breakfast or lunch is so plain I could make it better at home , had the club and swear the meat is out of date from the nearest grocery store , do yourself a favor and go across the street to black bear which has excellent food for a reasonable price ."}
{"text":"This place is just GROSS!  Dirty floors, tables, bathrooms, and dirty food.  I should know better, the B health rating is clearly posted so all the gamblers can see their odds if they decide to eat there.  The last time I went there I actually got a little black curly in my food.  GROSS!!! Do not go here, even if your a gambler, it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Terrible worst IHOP I've been to. Food was cold, our waiter was nonexistent...I even had to get up and get my own plate!...and finally their prices are more expensive than the other ones. Go to a different IHOP or just stay home and enjoy a box of cereal. You're better off."}
{"text":"Best Ihop I have been to in years! Pancakes were light and melted in your mouth, the eggs&bacon were cooked perfectly. My two year old went nuts over the food eating his food&mine. Our waitress Karla was polite, obsercant, professional&kind. Definitely coming back with my family for more great tasting food!!!!"}
{"text":"No nothing has changed I hate this place. Most of the food was cold it's over priced and don't have that home cooked love"}
{"text":"This is the best IHOP that I've ever been to! I was there on a Sunday morning and they were swamped with baseball teams and half of the north valley, but they were still super quick, friendly, and the food was great. The staff was all very young and excited, and there were no problems."}
{"text":"We had pretty good customer service and wasn't expensive."}
{"text":"Been eating at IHOP for many,many years and this location is the best yet.  The service was good and timely. Came at 12:30 pm and only waited for a couple of minutes. The food was served fast and correctly even though all the people in our party had substitutions and adds/changes. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Out with a friend for the day we were looking for a place to have lunch, and she spotted the IHOP up ahead. Actually, I am not a fan of IHOP for meals other than breakfast, but I also don't want a 20 minute discussion on where to eat, so I took a left into the parking lot.

OK, I will admit I was wrong. We were there between the lunch and dinner hours so seating was immediate. Our waiter brought the drinks right away and took our order promptly. We both ordered Patty Melts, and the cooking time was fast.

The real shock was that the food was good. Not just good, but really good. Not only was it really good, it actually looked like the picture on the menu. I have to say I was impressed with this IHOP and would not hesitate to return.

4 stars, losing one because the entire time we were there all the tables from the lunch rush remained dirty. Yeah, it didn't really effect the meal, but it was no pleasure to look at."}
{"text":"Overall pretty bad experience. Menu was so sticky I could barely touch it, food took 20 minutes at dinner time even though only two other patrons in store, homeless man was begging for money outside the front door."}
{"text":"I ordered from the Hawaiian Roll menu and my food was fine. The service was fine. I asked for the senior discount at checkout and was told they don't offer any discounts for \"special menu\" items. It would have only been about a $1 discount, so whatever. Still, for about a dollar, they made a customer sad. Why?"}
{"text":"I enjoy the Colorado omelette every time I come I am never disappointed. Service the crew does well food comes when it is done. Thanks IHOP!!!"}
{"text":"This IHOP is super rushed. Omelettes come out runny and cheese are not melted. Quality is not a priority at this IHOP."}
{"text":"I gave this place a 2 star not because of the service or food but my experience at the end. The food was good and the service was great. We ordered ham & egg melt and an omelet with pancakes. When we arrived, to our surprise they offered unlimited refills on orange juice, wow. The Ihop in Clovis, NM where we were living didn't offer that at all, so I was impressed. Our food was good and delicious except for the hash browns, they can out over cooked. When it was time to pay is when this turned bad. We paid half the bills with gift card and the rest was going to be on a credit card. She took the remaining balance from the gift card but it still charged my card for the entire amount. The manager came out and said that the charge should drop and that all banks do that. Umm no you fucked up and over charged my card and you are blaming the band for it. So now I have to wait and see if I get refunded the difference. Such a hassle!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"NO STARS!!!!!!
Worst service ever!!!!! Waited for coffee and orange juice for over 15 minutes and it wasn't even busy today. Then when it was delivered it was ice cold. Asked for fresh coffee and the guy never returned with the coffee and I waited for 20 minutes and still no service at all. So I got up and walked out and will NEVER return to this shit hole location. I'm really beginning to believe that customer service is a thing of the past."}
{"text":"Slow service! Didnt really feel like I was a valued guest. I think I would feel better spending my money somewhere else, like the Dennys across the street. Then the waitress double charged our cards."}
{"text":"This place completely blows. I waited for my food for 40 minutes and they still managed to mess up my order. Waitress had a terrible attitude and didn't bother to come give refills until we flagged her down. Never coming back and you should never come. Save your time you'll lose your mind waiting that long for average food."}
{"text":"Today is he first time that we have actually not had to wait nor is it crazy inside.  As far as food goes this place is neither good or bad.  It is clean and he servers are attentive.   Clearly pancakes are the main item on the menu but they aren't like to die for pancakes.  The kids are always excited about the chocolate face pancake and spend time coloring and playing tic tax toe on the children's menu.  The ice tea is also mediocre."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great food and service! Mai was a great server! Love being able to watch the game at the same time as eating my pancakes"}
{"text":"It's 2:00 am table of four. Didn't get food till 2:52am. With seven people total in the place."}
{"text":"IHOP is what IHOP is, nothing gourmet but this one is consistent and reliable. The service here is always very good, the facility is clean and the omelets are huge. Kids eat free on Tuesday nights and every night in Aug."}
{"text":"Just left after waiting 15 minutes, no 'we will be with you soon' or any kind of aknowledgement.  There are a bunch of young kids working here I see. Let me tell you,  a little courtesy goes a long way. Take pride in what you do,  if you can't give good customer service then that job is not for you. Giving 2 stars for the guy who sat us down.  He forgot the kids menu and crayons and brought it as soon as he remembered. We walked out after waiting 20 minutes. And this was at 2 or 3 PM,  when all the traffic has died down."}
{"text":"I came to this ihop at 2am on 1/24/16. I had a long night at work and just wanted a hot meal and a smile. I didn't get either. I was not greeted at the front counter for a long time, then a server briskly walked past and said \"I'll be right with you\" without even looking at me. I heard him arguing with a customer about the amount of customers he had. After several minutes he walked past me again without looking at me or saying anything to me. It was obvious the server was in a bad mood and it was putting me in a bad mood. After several more minutes without being acknowledged I walked out. 

Horrible customer service tonight."}
{"text":"Not sure what the negative comments are about. Why I always believe in \" you don't know if it's good till you try it yourself\" quote. Anyway, I have nothing bad to say about this place. Customer service was really good, we were greeted on Christmas Eve right away and seated as we walked in. They had a nice flow of customers not too busy. Our server was awesome, took our order right away and kept checking on us. Food was very delicious:) came out fast and was very warm (no cold food) we will come back to this location, way closer to our house. So I'm excited!"}
{"text":"We came in at 10am and we waited to be seated but it didn't took long. So, we got sat down and we right away got our beverages and we were ready to order. We waited for our food for an hour. I was noticing that people who got sat after us go their food first and we were only 4 of us and they were like 6. Plus when we got our food i still had to wait for mine. When i went to complain to the waitress about the wait, she was complaining about the cooker that they weren't hurrying up. The food wasn't good. I got a red velvet pancakes and they look overcooked pancakes. Even my husband's pancakes were like dry. The ham was burned and hard. I all ways go to this location but today i wasn't satisfied at all"}
{"text":"Meh.  The 5 of us waited 50 minutes for our food while other guests who ordered after we did - received their order before we did.  The \"manager\" was defensive and irritated while listening to our concerns and fed us a line of excuses like \"I'm new\" ... Totally unprofessional and untrained.  The place was chaotic, unwelcoming, and the entrance laced a host/hostess.  Just not a good experience!"}
{"text":"Good quiet atmosphere, good food and service. Brought the kids with and they enjoyed it as well"}
{"text":"iHop, where you pay money for below average food, and almost 0 customer service. 
Came here late one day to grab a bite after the gym. I never know why I continue to disappoint myself with ihop, but after this time, I think I've officially given up. 

One time we were here, I ordered their steak and egg hot plate.. and the cook somehow forgot to put my egg on it????

Another time, the waitress came around to grab our order, place our food, and give us our check. I'm not expecting a conversation, but at least a check up on food. Didn't get that.

And this past time, my boyfriend and I decided to call an order for pick up since we didn't want to deal with their customer service. Of course, no pick up. So we drive there to place the order to go, and you see an employee on her phone wandering around, and no one to greet us.

I understand that sometimes when you're out at midnight and your choices are limited on where to eat, esp on this side of town, but ihop will never be one of my choices again."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! Took us 10mins.to even get notice,plus 45 mins to get our food!!!! Food was okay, not great , the place wasn't busy so this shouldn't have been a problem.. My husband is a great tipper, he didn't leave a dime to the waiter ... What does that tell you??? Never going back if we come this way again!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the slowest restaurant I've eaten in. The food is literally inedible. The waffles were still half batter. BTW it's Monday evening and the restaurant is empty.  I will never be back here again. Terrible!  If I could give it less than one star I would!"}
{"text":"My daughter just HAD to have the create a face pancake (strawberry eyes, whipped cream nose and banana mouth), so off we go.  It's a holiday so there was a 15 minute wait and half of Ballantyne must have been waiting.  IHOP managed the wait well though and it wasn't long before we were sat down.

Our waitress came right over and took our drink orders and was nice to my daughter and asked her to smile like the face on the pancake which she did.  Coffee was OK, and they leave the carafe at the table so you can fill up your own cup.  

My omlette was good as were the hashbrowns.  My daughter loved the pancake and was excited that she could try all of the different syrups on the table (Maple, butter pecan, blueberry, strawberry).  Her meal came with a yogurt squeezer which was a nice touch.

The staff was friendly everyone from the Manager to all of the waitresses.  They did a couple of \"birthday songs\" which was fun for my daughter.  

I'm on the fence on what I think about IHOP as a whole, I mean the food is \"good\" and I'm not sure on where I stand on whether the price and the hype is worth the quality of the food.  We spent $21.00 for 2 breakfasts before tip so make you're own call."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot, pancakes were delicious, service was great."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I went for lunch one day, because she had a buy 1 get 1 coupon. I ordered a patty melt with fries, the patty melt was good, the fries weren't. My co-worker ordered a grilled chicken salad. It was OK. After taking our discount we still ended up paying about $10 each including tip. It might sound cheap, but for a mediocre lunch, its not. Not only did it take about 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us for the first time, but our waitress was a bit wacky and didn't seem to care to ask us what we wanted, she just wanted to suggest and rush off. I wont be going back anytime soon for lunch."}
{"text":"We were staying nearby and had an IHOP gift card, so we decided to stop in for a late breakfast on our last day in Vegas.

It was a weekday morning, so the restaurant was not crowded.  Our waiter was a friendly Hispanic gentleman.  He was very efficient and charismatic.

Food was the usual IHOP breakfast, it was tasty enough.

This was overall a positive dining experience."}
{"text":"Two stars only because it was free and they donate to charity.  Dirty restaurant and bland food."}
{"text":"Shawn was incredibly polite and a great waiter.  Seems that he know a lot of customers.  He knew a lot of customers by name.  Great guy, food was good, and a great price."}
{"text":"I wanted to go to an IHOP that was off the typical tourist area.  I drove about 6 or 7 miles away from the STRIP and ate here.  The service there was great.  The server Jeremy was very attentive and helpful.  Overall, the food is as good as any other IHOP but, it was the service that will make my family come back here again."}
{"text":"Service was horrible 2 times in a row. I gave them the benefit of the doubt after the first time and went back. NOPE! The first time was during their rush (Sunday morning) me and my 2 young daughters walked in to a full waiting area, fine. I check in tell the lady we are a party of 3...ok sat down. A group of 3 men walk in she confirms the # in their party and IMMEDIATELY seats them. On her way back to the podium I reminded her that we were also a party of 3 which the she says \"oh yea, sorry\". 

We get seated at the only available table at the time which was the half booth/handicap table with 2 chairs. The booth was dirty and I requested it to be cleaned well no one came and I seen another booth being cleaned so I requested to move.

We got seated, no silverware and after ordering it took 30 minutes to bring our food. Our waiter was great btw.

2nd FAIL- I walk in alone this time and a family comes in shortly after. Mind you this was noon on a weekday (quiet and DEAD). No one is in sight besides the cooks in the kitchen. The door has opened and closed twice and no one can hear that?  Finally a nice waitress with bright pink hair comes out of no where and informs the other ladies hiding in the corner having their own conversation and laughing that people are at the door and need to be seated. The heavier set lady seats me with a smile, no apology which did it for me.

**Management please take care of your better employees. The lady with the pink hair is extremely nice, efficient and knowledgeable but please have her change her hair it is so offsetting. Also the gentlemen on Sunday mornings is amazing as well."}
{"text":"The WORST ihop I have ever been to. This is the second time where there are only two tables and three servers. We waited a good ten minutes before someone even acknowledged us as we grabbed our own menus to seat ourselves. So we got sat, again there are only two tables and three servers running around. We sat for fifteen minutes while the servers would pass us and not even bother to ask if we wanted something to drink. We ended up getting up and leaving and as I walked out I told one of the servers no one bothered to come over to us. No apology nothing. We just left. Personally, I'd spit on their establishment and the person that trained these guys. I'm not expecting a five star dining experiencing, but come on, at least better service than that. I will be calling the manager."}
{"text":"This is just an average IHOP.  Nothing is super special but you get everything you are used to at other IHOPs around.  The service is ok, the food is ok, and the atmosphere is ok.  This particular location has been crazy busy every time I have been here, so keep that in mind if you are in a rush.  Again, nothing special and nothing negative, just average."}
{"text":"The service was good and the food came out really fast, which I'd be coming back, but I'd like to see their cleanliness improve, you can see some dirty tables and the floor wasn't so clean, overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"We always love eating her...great food great service. Everything is always great. Take a jacket with you it's always cold in there."}
{"text":"The service was very friendly, but the food wasn't all that good. Most everything tasted like it had been sitting around for quite a while before being plated. Especially the potatoes. Not sure I would return."}
{"text":"Best service the last two times went in! Food always great and fast! Favorite IHOP! Shane was Amazing!! I work in retail and he is an rock star!"}
{"text":"I've been to some really shitty chain places, but this is the worst! Called in my order- which took about 10 minutes because the girl kept putting us on hold to talk to someone in the background. I asked to substitute the pepper jack cheese FOUR times. When picking up, three people walked by to seat us and we told them each that we were there to pick up but none of them grabbed our food or seemed to know where it was. Finally after I started to steam and get loud someone found our food. I had ordered avocado with mine and getting in the car found I had gotten no avocado. I sent my friend back in there and he came out SEVEN minutes later for like two slices of avocado. He said people walked past him and he couldn't get anyone's attention. NEVER AGAIN will I even ATTEMPT to order from this establishment! Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"It was hot inside a different IHOP when I went in the summer and the AC was out. It was hot in this IHOP on Warmsprings today, February 4th. FEBRUARY 4th! How is it so hot in here in February? They must be running the heater over time. And I know I'm not the only one who found it uncomfortably warm. The cashier was fanning herself. And the couple one table to my right commented on the heat too. Get a clue, management!

Ok, with the rant out of the way it is on to the food. I knew ahead of time what I wanted to order. In sticking with my own tradition, I wanted to try a mushroom swiss burger. I was offered extra sauces on the side but asked for the burger to come to the table as is. It came out to me after maybe 10 minutes. Not too bad I guess. I was a bit disappointed by the initial appearance of the sandwich. It is considerably smaller than those which you can get from rival Denny's across the street. But I have to admit, it was a good burger in terms of taste. Fresh grilled mushrooms and onions are always welcome to the party. The mayo, or whatever that white sauce was, was a great addition to the flavor bomb. It was not standard mayo but perhaps had the benefit of some horse radish. It wasn't exactly spicy but had a tang and zip that set it apart from the standard sauce on a mushroom burger from other places. The beef patty, again, was on the small side. But these new burgers from IHOP are steak burgers and so have a definite fresh and beefy flavor. Over all and despite the size this was a good burger for $8.99.

Service was OK today. I had to wait a few minutes to be seated as the restaurant was very busy. My order was taken a few minutes later and the food came out a little while after that. I was brought refills before I was even half way through one glass of iced tea so there was no waiting for more. Unfortunately I asked for lemon in my tea and was brough my original and two refills each without lemon. Clearly it isn't the end of the world but I would have liked the citrus freshness a lemon would have provided."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a bite yesterday morning around 10AM.  The first thing I noticed was a sign on the door stating they would be closed from noon to 8Pm for emergency repairs.  Whatever that means.  Well, it turns out that means their AC was down and it was hot as blazes in the restaurant.  They explained that to us before we went further and asked if we still wanted to eat. As all of us were hungry and there, we chose to stay.  They sat us under a fan which helped a little bit but it was still very stuff out there.  That iced tea tasted all the better being cold and refreshing.  

Service was fast and friendly.  They were apologetic for the heat.  Not that is was their fault but it was nice to hear the words.  As for the food, we all got burgers.  They were fine.  Nothing special but certainly not a bad burger.  And the fries were tasty.  I've had better of both burger and fries but for a quick meal, A-OK about covers it."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of IHOP and I've had some shotty experiences at multiple locations across the country.  This one on Craig Road next to the Howard Johnson is alright in my book though.  Service was friendly and the food was not too shabby.  I ordered the chicken and waffles.  It was supposed to come with honey mustard but they brought me ranch dressing.  Whatever.  I don't care much for ranch but I was not going to argue over it.  I don't use much dressing for my chicken anyhow.  My mom ordered the pumpkin pancake combo with hash browns, eggs and bacon.  I was shocked that she finished her plate.  She tends to be a light eater.  Either the food was simply that good or she was absolutely starving.  My step dad got some other combo.  I think I saw pancakes, stuffed french toast, eggs, hash browns and toast.  A total carb fest with a splash of protien.  Whatever he got he enjoyed.  And both my mom and step-dad were happy to see butter pecan syrup on the table.  I used traditional.  I guess I'm boring that way.  When it came to settle the bill the 20% discount for being a Howard Johnson customer was not applied right away.  The staff were quick to admit the error and ready to fix it.  They were even good enough to bring the new receipt to our table having seen my step-dad hobble up to the counter with his bad knee the first time.  For this level of service, IHOP gets all the credit that is due."}
{"text":"Denny's used to be my diner of choice until they started giving less food and raised their prices.  So recently I decided to give IHOP a try.  Typically I am not a big fan of breakfast foods and I also don't really care for the lunch/dinner menu at IHOP.  But on this particular day I was wanting French Toast and did not have the stuff to make it at home.  So IHOP it was and great too.  I went with Split Decision Breafast with French Toast, pancakes, bacon, sausage and eggs.  Add a cup of hot tea with lemon and honey and I was set.  The French Toast was thick and not too dense with a slight crisp from the skillet.  The pancakes were fluffy and cooked to perfection.  The sausage was just average but the bacon was quite good.  And the eggs were scrabbled just the way I like.  The service was good too and so I was impressed this time.   I only wish the small two person both they put me at was bigger.  The table was a little too close for comfort and attached to the wall making it impossible to move for some more room.  Then again maybe that just means I need to lose some weight."}
{"text":"Breakfast was ok. No need for us to ever return ..The kids both ordered chicken and waffles off the kiddo menu, and seemed to enjoy it . I had the blueberry lemonade pancakes with bacon , eggs & hash browns. Pretty Standard .. My bf ordered hash browns well done and a side of bacon cooked extra crispy . Bf didn't get his 2 items until after the kids & I had eaten .. The bacon was under cooked and hash browns looked the same as mine ( not well done ) soooo he waited an extra 10 minutes for his order why??? The waitress was kind enough to remove the hashbrowns from our bill without us asking  guess we can scratch ihop off our list of breakfast places"}
{"text":"Restaurant is clean, fully staffed & food was good. Better than village inn or Denny's . When you need a quick bite at a family friendly spot, this is a great place to stop. 
Best part ??? Kids eat free with paid adult! Now that's a deal"}
{"text":"Yummy! My favorite plate is the Pork Chop Dinner! =)"}
{"text":"It's IHOP, not the Four Seasons. And, at 2 am and you've had a few cocktails and are in need of something to soak up those cocktails, IHOP sounded like a fabulous option. 
Having been a couple decades since I've been to an IHOP, nostalgic memories flooded back to me once we were seated at the table and the high fructose corn syrup bottles sat waiting to be sampled, such nectarous flavors such as strawberry, boysenberry and butter pecan. 
I ordered an omelet with avocado, dry wheat toast ( it came heavily buttered, and I tipsily enjoyed every bite), others ordered the fried chicken and waffles, scrambled eggs and turkey sausage, a green salad full of field greens and a small handful of diced tomatoes, and of course, pancakes. Everything was okay, nothing stood out or wowed us, mostly bland or quaggy in taste and texture, but it did make my slightly alcohol-soaked stomach happier. 
Service, our waitress at 2 am was more than accommodating and friendly. Putting up with our raucous bunch was probably somewhat challenging at times. 
Prices are average/fair for an establishment like IHOP. 
Decor, it's IHOP, it's old, outdated, and not cool retro as just plain and unappealing. But, it's IHOP, who cares? It could be a tad cleaner, the bathrooms seem outdated, but also in need of attendance. 
Next time I am exiting a night of bountiful libations and debatchery with friends, I would definitely consider IHOP."}
{"text":"The service is great. Food is ok. Hours are confusing.

They remodeled and the place looks more modern. The service is great but at night it is just one person hustling. Extra respect for our server.

I typically order breakfast foods here, which is why most people go, but this time I visited, I wanted anything BUT breakfast. So I perused the menu and decided to get the fried chicken. I know -- random, but what the heck. 

The chicken was done and the batter was extra crispy. Pretty salty too. It could have used less time in the fryer. The mashed potatoes and corn was good. I wasn't impressed and I will probably stick with breakfast foods here.

I typically love their hash browns and they omelettes are massive. They are obviously known for their pancakes. I love how they have seasonal flavors and stuffed french toast.

Good to hangout with friends, unlimited coffee. However-- two things: 1) it was SO cold while we were eating. Most people kept their jacket one. 2) I have never been to an IHOP that isn't 24 hours. This one closes at 10PM I think. Odd, right?"}
{"text":"Good service and nice people!  Nice place to stop by for a quick bite!  Alone or with a group.  I was alone today."}
{"text":"This must be a interactive exhibit like the Carnegie where the customers learn about busing their own tables? They also wanted us to learn about HOT and COLD and measurements because they left a near empty, cold coffee kraft on the table...for display, I'm assuming. 
Don't read the menu because this IHOP is serving up loud Yinzer conversations with a side of bad carpet odor. Food....late...45 minutes. My food didn't look prepared as much as \"squirted\" on my plate. Though I tried to lose the memory of this food...IHOP doesn't forget and followed my stomach for 3 hours. Did they put kidney stones in that omelette?
Our host looked like they pulled her from a bunker after 40 years and with math skills to match. We told her to split the bill and she came undone like Russell Crowe from A Beautiful Mind. The next day, I realize they charged me and the party the same full amount. 

If you want comedy in complete incompetence, a staff of lost hopes and dreams, and a painful restroom visit...look no further. The waffles are stuffed with broken promises."}
{"text":"Not a favorite, but my little guy likes to go for pancakes. Last nights waiter was so hard to understand talking 200 miles an hour. Steak tips were tough & tasteless. I drowned them in A-1 sauce to flavor them. The onions & mushrooms had so much grease, I was sick from it. The corn was bad, not fresh and tasted frozen. Going to stick to local places. This isn't a place for dinner."}
{"text":"Been here off and on.   Service is usually good, food is consistent. Always clean and courteous."}
{"text":"I'm currently at IHOB right now. And let me just say...Blake! is hands down the best server you will ever have. He is amazing. I have never been so satisfied with my server before. Also dissatisfied that everything in the restaurant is labeled IHOP. Very bad marketing."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Called to order over the phone and the girl i spoke with Paola was not professional at all. At the end of my order i asked for my total and she put me on hold for 5 minute. The phone somehow got disconnected and I called back. When I asked for my total again she once again placed me on a hold hold (3 minutes this time) Phone cut off i again I tried to call back several times but the line was now busy. Drove to the actual location turns out Paola never actually put the order in. There was no apology or anything. This is simply unacceptable. The poor standard of service should not be accepted by any management. This lack of service will drive customers away. IHOP management this should definitely be addressed."}
{"text":"Surprised by how light and fluffy the pancakes are. I love their convos and tried their salted caramel pancake - which is one of their fall pancakes selection. Servings are just right for me for brunch."}
{"text":"A plethora of empty tables - no greeting - waited 15 mins no table - no apology for wait - didn't even tell us there was a wait- chaos everywhere - I advised hostess that we were leaving and she could remove our name her response \"ok\" that's it!!!! I called to speak with manager he was too busy to take my call because he was cooking!!!!   Unbelievable is all I can say!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving just one star is because our server did try hard to make our experience a good one. Unfortunately, our food took forever, it was cold, my eggs were overdone... AND we were sitting where I could see right into the kitchen. This allowed me to see another server drop toast on the floor, then pick it up, put it on a plate and serve it to the people behind us. I'm not sure if my upset stomach is my mindset or bad food. We should've gone to TJ's. Won't make that mistake again."}
{"text":"Dear Manager,
It is a bad idea to argue in the foyer with a customer who is complaining about how long it took for their to go order. In addition, I suggest you find the source of the vomit-like smell that was the ultimate reason we didn't even wait to be seated."}
{"text":"Great service. Delicious food. We were seated, got our food, ate and paid in less time than it took for us to have our order taken at Black Bear across the street."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous! We order our food right away and we literally wait 20 minutes for 2 orders for 2 people (nothing fancy) and the restaurant isn't even busy.

We get our breakfast and literally it's like eating a snack because the portions are sooo darn flipping small. Do birds eat here or what? 

I should've known better than to come to a lame *** place like IHOP. 

After this experience I'm burned. Not coming back here again. Super slow service, overpriced, low quality of food and tiny portions. 

They need to just shut this place down."}
{"text":"I'll start my review by saying that I'm glad I didn't get sick after eating fruit that had mold on it.

I came in last week with my husband for breakfast and ordered a simple 2 egg breakfast with bacon and a side of fruit.

You might be thinking what could possibly go wrong with a simple 2 egg breakfast. Well.... everything was fine until about my fourth bite of \"fresh fruit\".

I looked at the grape I was about to eat and saw mold on it. A significant amount to actually notice the white/greenish growth on it.

As soon as I saw it I was done eating the fruit and lost my appetite. I should've mentioned it to the waiter, but didn't.

Then when I got up to the counter and decided to mention this issue, because I was asked if everything was okay and of course the answer was No.

The cashier went straight to the manager on duty and he came out and apologized and took $4 off the breakfast, which I did not expect.

Overall I'll think twice about coming here again, because this is not my idea of a fresh and sick-free breakfast.

If they have the gall to serve moldy fruit then I'm concerned that they probably serve other spoiled food also and I don't even want to stick around for that.

I am pretty disappointed about this and I hope they get their crap together. If you decide to give this place a whirl, don't say I didn't warn you.

Good Luck!"}
{"text":"Its IHOP at 1am after moving the last 2 days. It is what it is. But we are tired and hungry and it's taking forever."}
{"text":"For a 24 hour restaurant, service is reliably OK.  Ive been here all hours.  Problem is the coffee -- I get sick off of it for some reason. I can handle strong coffee or coffee of all types but something is off at this restaurant (clean the machines?...).  Food is always done as it should be.  I continue to go here, just wish the coffee could improve :)"}
{"text":"Not much for the food quality, you typically know what to expect at a breakfast franchise like IHOP. 
This review is more for the service we got. We went on a Thursday afternoon it seemed really busy but we only waited for about 5 mins. Once we got seated our waiter Monze was really nice and attentive, I would recommend sitting at her tables for quality service."}
{"text":"I have not been here since 2009...and so decided to give it a try as our regular spot had a 40 min wait!  Omg. This place is great again!  It's completely remodeled, great service with very nice staff.  Food came out very quick and it was better than our regular spot.  We will be back!  Thank you for getting the place back in shape:)"}
{"text":"We had never been to this IHOP before and let me say that it was very very busy, however, the service was fantastic! Beyond impressed with food and our waiter. He was nice and humble. The entire staff was very polite. Even the manager was asking how our food was. I mean we were very pleased."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of IHOP but since it's a lot closer than Denny's I've come here a few times. I actually have yet to dine-in. I always call my order in and pick it up to eat at home. So far I have no complaints. My orders have always been right and ready when I pick it up."}
{"text":"Been sitting here for almost an hour, no food yet...and no coffee pot. Everyone around us has one....people who got here AFTER us...and after we ordered are almost done eating.

Ok, literally 1 minute after posting this the manager came over and apologized for it being so long. The kitchen lost our ticket, so our food wasn't made yet. We also got our coffee pot. Once the food came out it was piping hot and delicious. She also took 50% off the check."}
{"text":"Where do I start... while we were waiting for over 30mins for our food 3 tables got up and walked out because a server never helped them. When we received our food and it was room temperature at best and wrong. Instead of fixing it they just threw cheddar cheese over the american cheese and didn't even bother to try to remove the american cheese in the actual omelet. Granted cheese is minor but in an omelet it makes a BIG deference. A manager was supposed to come over and talk to us and give us our check, we waited for about 8mins and the manager never showed up. I could understand if they were busy, but the restaurant was half empty."}
{"text":"To save time I Placed an online order 45 minutes prior to pick up
Came to the restaurant they said they don't see it on their system ! Showed  them the email print out with the address on there ! I ended up waiting another 35 mins for my order! Incompetent staffs and manager!"}
{"text":"just wanna give a huge shout out to Omar!! he has great service. was very attentive with our orders and very precise despite the fact that we were a big group. he was on it with the refills as well as with anything else we needed. he is definitely a great addition to your team.keep it up omar"}
{"text":"Save yourself the headache and go somewhere else. The wait is not worth it. They had over 10 tables open, completely open and clean and there were at least 5 parties waiting. The staff doesn't care, they have an entitlement attitude that is quite horrible. If they cut the chit chat and took their jobs seriously this place would be better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite IHOPs to go to late at night. Everything is super fresh and always tastes amazing and the staff are really friendly!"}
{"text":"Ihop is one of those comfortably familiar places that is pretty much the same neighborhood to neighborhood and state to state. However, when I first entered this Ihop in Las Vegas there was an immediate difference and her name is Shannon.  I (and everyone else) was greeted with the friendliest most sincere welcome I have ever received in a restaurant.  Shannon greeted, seated, stopped by all the tables and generally made sure everything was perfect. This alone would have been fantastic, as it turns out, our waiter, George has the very same  attitude. I live in Los Angeles, but whenever I am back in Las Vegas, this Ihop will be one of my first stops.  ...and yes the food was perfectly prepared and served, during the morning rush with a completely full restaurant."}
{"text":"Visited this location at lunchtime and the restaurant was about 30% full. Got seated quickly and then waited and waited and never got any service. The two servers kept talking to each other, but no one came to serve me. I left after 15 minutes and went to Denny's. The service in Denny's was fast which surprised me considering how full they were. My advice, if you get bad service at ihop give Denny's at try."}
{"text":"The hostess tatiana was extremely rude. She laughed at my coworkers name. Never had i seen or heard of such blatant disrespect from someone in the food industry. Obviously the managers need to be more careful if they want to start hiring residents of the nearby ghetto. I got sick afterwards but since my coworker didn't I won't blame ihop. One star for not getting me sick . Minus four stars for service."}
{"text":"Last night my family of 8 came in to ihop. Our server Robin was awsome she was very attentive to our needs refills without asking, we were not rush we playex our heads up game and enjoyed our evening. Our server was doing  everything to make or visit fun.  cashing us out at our table was a plus we like this place and will be back...  food took a little long Robin informed us in yhe begining that there were cooks training, so understood .. great service, good food good friends...."}
{"text":"Well a very bad experience have not been here in a long time and now I know why.
Three other groups sat down 5, 10 and 15mins after us and they all got their food before we did and to top it off the other two people sitting w/me got their food before I got mine and the wait staff came over to tell me one of the other wait staff took my food.
Great place
I will NOT be coming back here.
Saturday morning just before 10am and this place was not to busy at all. Still not coming back.
Finally got my food and my eggs had more cheese then eggs, it was the egg Scrabble. So if u want cheese for breakfast this is the meal for you.
Its to bad that they have a cook or cooks in the back that give the restaurant and servers a bad rap.
Maybe this place needs a new cook.
Or maybe a manager since all heis doing is hiding around corners.
One last thing there was a young girl asking for donations $5.00 a children's hospital and we were happy to do that and they give u a $5.00 coupon toward ur breakfast. The lady gives us our bill and they charged us again for the donation instead of taking off the $5.00.
Another reason to NOT come back to this location.
I've gone into places where the manager is just so involved in the customers this place is not that way at all. This manager either needs to greet customers and stop hiding or this place needs to to find a new person to manage this location."}
{"text":"What is there to say about IHOP?

Food is always consistent and hot.  It's cheap eats.  Service is always quick and polite. 

This location, however, stays busy.  Give them a plus for being located next to Krispy Kreme Doughnuts."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this IHOP since it opened several months ago. I am giving it three stars because of past service. Had I only been here the past few months the stars would be fewer.
   First, let me warn you. If you order the ham and eggs, it will arrive looking nothing like the menu. I specifically asked the waiter if the Ham and eggs was as it appeared on the menu and was told yes. Now, the menu shows a couple of eggs and nice attractive ham steak. What they delivered was a half of a piece of ham so thin it only had one side.  I shamed the waiter into delivering another thin half piece of ham.
   Now, the past three tests I've been in , the service has drastically declined.  The wait time to be seated, even though no one else was there, is unbelievable. Once seated if you get a chance to order, again seems excessive.  The last time I went to Ihop, over 35 minutes passed after placing order before I finally just left.
    If they were busy at the time, I would come tell understand, but the times I was there, few diners were seated at tables.
  I may give them one more shot, we'll see."}
{"text":"I ordered food other than breakfast. I will not do that again. I do not think it is just IHOP, but all \"breakfast\" chains. Just get breakfast. I like IHOP though. I will be back. Service was poor. The young girl was nervous or new. She disappeared."}
{"text":"Tonight I was looking for some decent food at a good price served in a clean restaurant.  That is exactly what I got.  The food wasn't a magnificent culinary creation by a world renowned chef.  It was the $5.99 special.  I had water.  I got out for less than $7 after tax.  I left a tip to my adequate server.  I left having received exactly what I had expected to receive."}
{"text":"Got up and walked out after waiting to be seated, then waited and waited for service( taking the order). Place was pretty empty and there were 3 servers on the floor. Eventually a server comes over, leans against booth seat and says\" what do you want?\" This being said with an attitude of \" I could give a crap one way or the other\".
I looked at her and said, leaving now and walked out. No efforts were made to stop us or to make it better.
I see other posts just like mine and wonder what is the manager and district manager doing about this? I won't be going back to this location again."}
{"text":"Good food, but messed my wife's order up. But somewhat redeemed by quickly making it correctly. But still forgot the sausage.  2 stars, certified south park yelper."}
{"text":"We live in Surprise and have an Ihop much closer to us but we always prefer to make the trip out to this location. Its not as crazy busy on Sat & Sun mornings. If there is a wait its not but a few mins. The restaurant itself is clean and tidy. Doesn't have that weird smell that other Ihops tend to have too. The staff is always friendly and the service is great. I never run out of tea.  They sometimes have a balloon maker that works for tips and makes the kids cool balloon animals and such."}
{"text":"No complaints whatsoever!

Friendly staff! Always with a smile. 

I got their special which was two banana pancakes and the ultimate meat combo. The environment was nice. 

I use to come here a lot as kid, and I'd be back again :)"}
{"text":"Well I should have trusted the reviews. I had a 20% coupon from the Firestone shop so thought I'd enjoy a little lunch. Though they were hardly packed, service was slow and my pancakes were only warm, as was the sausage. Eggs were passable, but all in all this was a mediocre experience at best."}
{"text":"After our last two experiences(see my Perkins reviews) with breakfast we came to a place we can always count on for at least good service. We waited a little long to be seated and then we were seated in a crowded, stuffy little room full of small children. I asked to be moved so they accommodated. Our server, Heather, was excellent and she was handling the slow kitchen with patience and empathy. We heard. \"Sorry your food is taking so long\" a few times but everything came out perfect and we were happy for another predictable and reliable experience at IHOP."}
{"text":"My partner and I were hesitant to go to another IHOP after receiving such horrible customer service at the location on Northern Ave near I-17, but decided to give this location a try with hopes that the experience would be a positive one. Well, we were wrong. We showed up at noon today(4/13/14) and there's was one small family ahead of us. The hostess was not at her station and the cashier didn't even acknowledge us with a hello or \"the hostess will be right with you.\" The hostess came back and didn't acknowledge us or ask if we had been taken care of. Two families walked in and she immediately said hello and took down their names despite my partner and I standing right there waiting to she if she was ready to start taking down names. My partner and I were so appalled, that we just looked at each other and walked out. I will never eat at an IHOP again."}
{"text":"I have been here before, however I would rather go to the other IHOP down on university from now on.. each time I go there I feel like I am rushed and there's always something out of stock. The difference this time when I went there is I think this place needs to change its hours.. it's says it's open 24/7 and yet why is it I go there at 4am in the morning and the cashier closes/locks the door and ends up just staring at me through the window and simply telling my friend \"we are not taking orders\". We were simply wearing work clothes to begin with seeing how we just got off work and wanted to grab a bite to eat... if you can't manage to stay open when you say so on your sign outside of the store and on all websites than change it..  so I felt the cashier was rude and I ended up taking my business to Perkins down the road who greeted us as we walked right in and sat us down to eat.. which is where I'll most likely be grabbing my breakfast from now on."}
{"text":"I've been to this IHOP several times, most recently last night for a weeknight breakfast dinner with my boyfriend. I'll start by saying that I don't hate IHOP, but it would be a stretch for me to say that I even like IHOP. Last night, however, was a disaster and left me not wanting to return for a long time.

First things first, they were clearly understaffed and although there were numerous empty tables there was a wait. Not the fault of the server team, but at the end of the day they are the ones that have to deal with customers. 

Also, have you ever been to a restaurant where the server instructed you on what to do with you plates when finished eating? Specifically, she asked that we move them to the end of the table and stack them. Odd, eh? 

The food, not terrible, not great. Speaking of food, the boyfriend ordered one thing and got another. He's too kind of a guy to not say anything to the server, but boy did I want to mention the fact that he didn't order what was presented to him. 

Check arrived and we were happy to see that we weren't charged for OJ (maybe the server realized she screwed up the order?) 

It's remarkable that we didn't see anyone walk out the door without paying. However, we did see numerous customers waiting by the cash register to pay and leave, but there wasn't anyone to take their money. Lucky for us, when it came time to leave I was able to get the attention of a server that quickly helped us close out our bill.

{"text":"Too bad I can't give zero stars. Service was terrible. Had to ask for water, silverware, salt, and re-ask for two things that were supposed to come with my meal. The waitress never once came by to ask if we needed anything or to refill our water. We sat for a very long time after we finished before she brought the bill and then we had to wait again to pay it. On top of all that, the food was cold and really low quality. I've eaten at a lot of IHOPs but never one this bad. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Very nice front end and serving staff. My first time at this IHOP and it was busy, but we was taken care of in a timely manner. The food was served hot and was delicious.  Next time I will remember to take photos. My waitress was very attentive and pleasant. The restaurant even has clean restrooms with hot water!!! I will return and next time I will post photos."}
{"text":"I have gone back twice since last visit and the food is 100% better. They have better wait time on to-go orders.  Front end staff are friendly. Wait staff are attentive and patient. The only thing I still have a problem with are the prices, however, IHOP has seasonal promotions which help with cost."}
{"text":"I love coming to IHOP. It's a great place to go to at night when they are open for 24hrs. Keeps all the drunks in line and is a good place to sober up. I remember meeting a friend for the first time that helped me get through some stuff at IHOP  so apparently they got rid of thousand island which is really pathetic because that's my favorite sauce. They got all these different sauces for pancakes, got chicken tenders, omelettes, I usually get the bacon temptation omelette. Ask for Tyler at nights he's a great server that busts his butt. Easily one of my favorite restaurants"}
{"text":"Service was slow but friendly. My husband loved his patty melt. I ordered the biscuits and sausage gravy meal. It was gross. Like white salty soup. Sausage gravy is supposed to be thick with sausage pieces and full of savory flavor not runny."}
{"text":"Some extremely great servers, and some awful servers.  Management doesn't seem so great either. Other than my food being slightly cold and my particular server looking super swamped (while other servers were standing around doing nothing), also the manager was just walking around while food wasn't being pushed off the line, and customer wasn't being seated in empty seats. Food was still overall delicious.  But could have been sooo much better. 2nd time this has happened last couple Sunday's 9am-2pm.  Need to replace the lazy staff and retain management.   THEN this place would be the 5Star iHop I love."}
{"text":"Never disappointed with IHOP. I always asked for extra strawberry sauce for my pancake."}
{"text":"Their sirloin tips are to die for - the best value tasty 'fast food dine in' meal to be had across this great country.

For the most part, the staff are excellent and the restrooms clean.   

We've been travelling the USA for 2 months, repeating our holiday of last year. Been coming to the US since '78 and had never been to IHOP until the last trip. I regret not trying the place decades ago, now I know what I have been 'passing up' - they leave the other fast food joints for dead."}
{"text":"Came here on my way out of town. Was kind of bizzie waited for waiter for 5mins before she even come over to see if anyone was helping us i said no. She walked away stating she'll be right back never came back. Watched her take two other people's order. So the next best thing to do get up and walk out. Went to dunkin' donuts.."}
{"text":"Very expensive fast food joint. They do not get order right everytime I've been. I like chit chatting and coffee, can't afford the wrong food."}
{"text":"The IHOP Store #1522 provided good customer service. My server was a member of the latino community. She demonstrated enthusiasm and a passion for her job. Thank you for a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Had a 20% off coupon from Smiths grocery store to get 20% off meal at ihop and in the end to pay the cashier says we can't use this coupon beware of having any coupons this is the 2nd time they would not honor coupon. 70% of the menu is not valid. Hello Denny's ....."}
{"text":"I love ihop specially for breakfast and lunch and always the consistency is the same . It was very busy when we went . The only thing they need to work on is the staff they just need to be more attentive."}
{"text":"Greeted immediately but it went downhill after that.  Only one server on shift and after she took our order we never saw her again for over 30 minutes.  Our drinks were empty and once she came to bring our orders (over 30 minutes) she completely ignored me and my cup upside down to indicate it was empty (for a long period).  She was very quick to bring the check..lol.   The Manager on duty was pretty worthless as he didn't really seem to chip in and help the server.  The cook...hell who knows where he was.  Poor Poor Service."}
{"text":"I don't eat at IHOP often, I usually prefer to make breakfast at home. But once in a while it is fun to eat out. We had a horrible breakfast at this location. My husband ordered coffee and the cup was dirty with women's lipstick. They got him a new one, but very gross!  The service was not very good. They got my husband's order right. At first they brought me the wrong pancakes. Then once I got the correct meal, I never got the butter I asked for. I ordered the peach pancakes with sausage, hash browns and scrambled egg whites. There were hardly any egg whites, not worth 50 cent upgrade.  The hash browns were under cooked. All in all it was a very disappointing experience and certainly not worth the money! There are better breakfast options out there!"}
{"text":"Woke up suuuuuuper early at our hotel so we stopped at this 24hr location for a quick bite. Mimicking what everyone says, it's dirty, cramped and old. However....

Service was awesome. My older gentleman was so kind to my toddler when she had an epic meltdown. He even gave her a free yogurt. He was soft spoken and friendly, like a grandpa. I appreciated him. 

Food tasted like typical IHOP food but my crepe came out ice cold :( in a pinch, it filled our bellies but nothing to call hole about."}
{"text":"After work we wanted to go for Pancakes where else than International house of pancakes right....wrong we stood waited to be seated for a while enough to look at a menu standing up. People who were sitting even looked around for someone. The guy walked past the back servers door twice and looked our way but nothing to let us know someone or even him would be right with us.... The lady mopping the entry way even looked around... Needless to say the menus went back into the pile and we left.... Went to Denny's instead excellent service and a great meal!!!!"}
{"text":"The hosts are always friendly, the wait is never too long. Clean restaurant & bathrooms (ladies room, at least). My boyfriend & I have never been disappointed with the food & they leave the coffee pot at your table, which is nice. Prices are reasonable. I always get the breakfast combo, which is 2 pancakes (your choice of \"flavor\"/I like strawberry banana) + 2 eggs + hashbrowns + 2 bacon/sausage. About $8.60! Overall, a wonderful breakfast experience. My boyfriend & I go in every Wednesday morning. The only thing that keeps me from leaving 5 stars is the fact that service is either a hit or miss. Whether we have an unfriendly/unwelcoming server, or a smiley/helpful server, everything is made up for with the great food, clean restaurant, & warm atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This is your typical IHOP as far as the menu and offerings. I did have to send my food back because of a hair in the food (I have an issue with that I'll admit). They offered to remake it for me, but I chose to just eat my pancakes. One thing I have to say is our waiter Stuart was FANTASTIC and so attentive and friendly! The manager came at once to apologize for the mishap. A++++ for service and hospitality. Far exceeds anything you'd expect from IHOP or any chain restaurant. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst IHOP I have ever been to in my life. The dining area is small so it isn't like they have a 100s of diners at a time, but they always have 20 or so workers working and their service is still terrible and unorganized. I went there a couple of weeks ago and when we walked in not one person said hi to us, and the lady behind the counter was on the store phone (understandable) but after she got off the phone she just walked away...another worker came up near the Counter to ring someone out & still said nothing to us. By the time the first worker had came back, 2 other families had came in after us and then started to seat them first, telling us we had a wait time of 10 minutes! I had to raise my voice to let her know we had been there first and had been waiting several minutes. I went there again 2 days ago. My friend got her food about 10 minutes before I got mine & the waiter had just walked past setting the food on the table without even asking if she needed anything else right away. She had no silverware and our waiter then disappeared for 10 minutes until he brought my food, at which point her food had gotten cold. She was able to tell him we needed silverware when he dropped off my food, but took several minutes to bring it back to the table and then did the same thing he did before-set it on the table and walked away. All my food was cold besides my eggs, and my toast was cold, hard, and only one piece had been buttered. When we told one of the waitresses we wanted to talk to a manager (because our waiter was MIA once again) the manager came over and listened to our complaints and then said \"Oh well someone ordered toast with no butter so yours had to be remade\" and then walked away. No apology, just an excuse for piss-poor service! She did end up giving us 15% off our meal but acted like they hadn't done anything wrong. I'd rather cook my own breakfast than eat here."}
{"text":"The customer service was great and our waiter was very fast and nice. As an added bonus they give you drinks to go."}
{"text":"I come to this IHOP pretty regularly, and only because this place makes awesome red velvet pancakes, and only because it is one of few outfits that open 24 hrs in the area. However, the service here is mostly abysmal. Servers are not attentive and it takes forever to get your food, even on days where it is empty. My average wait time for food usually about 40mins. Shortest wait time has typically been for Sunday brunch (when it's really packed)."}
{"text":"I had not been to a ihop in a while and was pleasantly surprised at tonight's experience. Our waiter, Luan, was great!  He was extremely friendly and made the whole experience pleasant. The food was very good as well.  I had a great hamburger with avocado and my husband had breakfast.  I assume his was great too as he cleaned his plate."}
{"text":"Service wasn't the greatest. They can be a bit slow. But the seasonal pumpkin pancakes are delicious."}
{"text":"My sons and I haven't had breakfast for dinner in a long time so we thought we would go to IHOP.  Next time we will go to Denny's. My toast was cold, I couldn't get butter to spread on it, my sons hated their sandwich and omelette.   My sons sandwich had some sort of spread that he said made him gag, and my other son had a creamy sauce in the middle of his omelette that he had to wipe out of his food to eat it.   As we were waiting on our waitress that didn't ever come by, I noticed dead flies on the window sill right at our booth.  We all left still hungry because we hated our food.  :(


It's the next day and I just wanted to add that my entire family that ate here ended up totally sick.   Soooo we definitely will never go here again."}
{"text":"Went here the day after Thanksgiving. It was very crowded and busy. All the employees seemed to be rushed. We had to wait about 20 minutes and once we were seated had to wait another 15 minutes. It did quiet down a bit and we were able to order. The food was good and our server comped our drinks which was nice. Over all I would say this place was ok."}
{"text":"Food was junk. Cold over done eggs, warm underdone hashbrows. Overdone cheeseburger and underdone French fries. Service wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Don't eat in the Casino for breakfast ever. The same meal would be $29 at treasure island When it's 7 dollars here."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why so many negative reviews for this location. The restaurant is clean and spacious. Exceptionally friendly service. The waitress Jenna is super super super nice. The only time we had to wait a while was Mother's day weekend. The food is just like any other IHOP location. Will surely come here again."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying this ihop is amazing!!! Been here twice and not a bad experience yet. Food is hot and delicious and came out fast as well. Great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I love ihop it is a great place to eat but this was the worst ihop experience I have ever had the sever didn't know what was going on and my pancakes were over done not impressed"}
{"text":"Very bad service , angel she thought me and the rest of our family members and they took more than 45 min to ask us what we wanted to drink"}
{"text":"My wife and I usually go to breakfast every Sunday morning, but for some reason, we have passed on the IHOP near 83 Ave & Bell Rd. This morning, we went, and WOW, what a terrific experience. We were seated by a young man who was very personable, and waited on by Britney, who was absolutely terrific. We ordered the standard fair, eggs, a meat side and pancakes, and it was good, and served extremely fast. Even though it was very busy here, the service was fantastic. Not a gourmet breakfast, by any means, but very satisfying. We will make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"2/23/18 - Back again today for lunch again with Mom.  Not changing the star rating, but needed to share my disappointment:
They up-charged me to add (a small dollop of ) Salsa to the Poblano Omlette. 
Really?  You know this is Arizona, right? Salsa with eggs in Arizona is like ketchup with eggs in New York.  And it's a \"Poblano\" omlette!
The up-charge is tacky and cheap. I feel \"nickle and dimed\". 
True story."}
{"text":"Middle of the night - only one other customer - the eggs and toast were cold upon arrival at the table - bacon was so hard I actually broke a tooth - emergency dental work today - restaurant employee response to broken tooth \"sorry about that\" - evidentally there was no manager on site - avoid at all costs!  many better options available in the area"}
{"text":"This place looks dirty as hell. Just nasty. I walked in with my man and was just not feeling the place what so ever. At the entrance I guess someone went to the bathroom and dragged a seat cover out with them on their shoes. EEEWWW! So its floating around on the floor in the waiting area. I know the workers saw this. After seeing this I came here - to  yelp to see what the reviews were - and a lot of you were on point. Gross and nasty. I was getting sicker just thinking how the bathrooms may look. After reading and having our own personal experience with the floating seat cover - we went to the one off of Marylane. Waaayyyy better!!!"}
{"text":"The staff is amazing here. They're always so sweet and helpful.

I have my usual (as I do every where else we dine regularly) and my go-to would be the stuffed french toast combo-- comes with eggs (mine are over easy), potato and meat, I go for sausage bc I don't like bacon. The SFT is stuffed with this cream cheese goodness that for someone who doesn't eat very much sugary foods as much, is such a treat! It's SO BAD, but it's SO GOOD. It's not overly sweet to where I need to chug a gallon of water, it's just so GOOD.

Close by, great service, consistent food flavors... You bet ya we'll be here on a regular :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food but what is the basic screw ups that shouldn't happen. I ordered a cold brew coffee with mocha flavoring, when I took a sip I could taste straight sugar. I told the server about my displeasure and the young man took it off my bill which was nice. As for the food I had an omelette which was very good."}
{"text":"I have come to this Ihop due to the fact that its right by the crib.  They always have good coupons so its a deal.  The service can be super good to downright atrocious...depending on who ya get.  The food is OK for processed, heated up food.  They do have pumpkin pancakes that are so good I would naked wrestle Bronson Pinchot for a stack of them babdboys..  Bacon, eggs and the hashbrowns all seem super processed and loaded with sodium.  But hey, its Ihop we know what we get when we walk through the door.  With better servers and maybe a wipe down of the walls this could be upped a few stars.  Pretty much all the businesses in Steelyard Commons are like this for people who havnt taken in all its glory.."}
{"text":"I pulled a nice hair out of my mouth while eating my breakfast...awesome. No it wasn't mine. Pretty gross. They did comp the majority of the meal, but I paid for what I ate. Fair? I don't know, but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great. However, the food was not brought up to par. The food took a while to get to the table (25 minutes) ...this was also like 9pm at night and there was only me and another customer in the restaurant. Additionally, the waitress was no where to be found 90% of the time. I believe she was always in the back. I wanted ketchup for my eggs, and had to wait for her to get out from the back. After about 15 minutes, I asked some other waitress to get mine. I would not recommend this store. They were slow (especially when there is only 2 customers in the entire restaurant and that it was 9pm and should not have to wait 25 minutes) and the food was not up to par."}
{"text":"Armando no no no...  He gotta go go go!!  
 owner will be pissed when I tattle on him in the. AM"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. I came here the other night around 11pm with a group of 11 people. Our waitress was ok. She was nice, but there was a delay in the food. We ended up not getting our food for 2 hours and when the food finally came. One of the waitress gave us attitude because we couldn't hear her when she asked who ordered the food she was carrying. She spoke so quietly, but got annoyed when she had to repeat herself even once. Then she threw my friend's plate down on the table quite harshly, any harder and it would've spilled all over my friend. She had no right to be pissed because we waited long for our food and simply couldn't hear her because she was so quiet. While we were waiting for our food, we asked for refills and our waitress forgot. She finally came back with refills 30 mins later. During the 2 hour wait, other customers had left, or looked frustrated for not getting their orders. It would be nice if a manager came by to apologize for the wait, but nope. Nothing. I usually prefer IHop over Denny's, but was greatly disappointed in the service and quality of food that night. Not even an apology. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"It was Mother's Day and my daughter did not want to find the crowds. So I ordered our breakfast from IHOP. Showed up and proceeded to wait for almost a half an hour. Several other orders came, received food and left. I asked to speak with a manager and was told day manager hadn't arrived yet and night manager went home. 
When I got up and asked when my food would be ready, they handed me an ice cold bag. Contacted corporate and received no satisfaction.
I really like IHOP but the sting has to wear off before I go back."}
{"text":"This Was The Worst Sevice I Never Had!!!!!
I literally said that I was in a hurry when I was seated, after waiting 5 minutes to be seated. I sat at my table for 10 whole minutes, watched the waitress converse with an elderly couple the entire time; go to the guy across from me, offer him dessert and a drink to go, walked off as he declined and proceeded to have a conversation with the girl at the register. The only other server was a male who took an order from another couple who was seated prior to me. Am I invisible? I can't wait to be ignored anymore. This is not a good representation of my last day here in Arizona. Now I'm \"Hangry!\" Hungry + Angry= Hangry, now I have to go to work on an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"Well  our waitress disappeared after giving us our drinks so we had to wave our hostess down to take our order because we were starving. Ultimately the hostess made up for the waitress disappearing. When the waitress reappeared the hostess kept taking care of our table. Guess  the waitress was too embarrassed to come back. Lol ... Good food though"}
{"text":"This IHOP , is always good with their wait time. Can't complain on that. I usually order the Chorizo Omelette, it will not disappoint you.  Hopefully this helps and enjoy."}
{"text":"the worst service that i've ever had . server was very unfriendly and didn't let us finish our sentences before walking away . asked for my burger a certain way, returned it twice and didn't end up eating . neither server or manager apologized for any of the incidents after waiting an hour for our food , would not recommend ever . if i could i would leave zero stars ."}
{"text":"Service sucked. ...server was rude and very short. Food came out all at different times and the last plate had hair in it. Never got refills on our drinks and waited 20mins to pay for the food. NOT A FAN OF THEIR LATE NIGHT."}
{"text":"I very rarely give 1 star reviews but this place has really gone down in the last year.  Our family used to drive all the way from Buckeye just to go here.. usually in the evening time.
Last Saturday  (May 5, 2018), we arrived at IHOP, stood waiting to JUST be seated for almost 10 min & we were the only ones waiting to be shown to our table.  I looked around & saw a medium crowd, the same kind of crowd I saw the week before with once again 2 waitress and 2 cooks.   i didnt just write this review over one incident, this has happened multiple times where we go in the evening time on a weekend and there is a nice size crowd with only 2 waitresses & 2 cooks.  The first couple of times it happened, I figured someone called in sick which caused the shortage of workers, BUT since this has now happened multiple times, I can see that management purposely scheduled it like this which is ridiculous.  As I mentioned before, last Sat we stood almost 10 min to be seated and walked out.  However the last 3 times we have been to IHOP, we have been seated, but have waited almost 20 minutes for our order to even be taken. It did not used be like this!  IHOP used to be one of my favorite restaurants to go to, that is no longer the case. I have kept returning hoping for a change and its still has the shortage of workers.  BTW, the last 4 xs we have visited IHOP we have seen people walk out.  Always on the weekend, in the evening. Our family will not be returning until this improves!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible they take forever!!! Don't ever come to this place especially at night. The cookers are just chilling sounding like they're having a great time back there. We've been waiting over 40 minutes just for our appetizer!!!! This is ridiculous"}
{"text":"We had excellent service each time we dined at IHOP while in town. We were greeted and sat quickly. Our orders were taken promptly and our food came reasonably quick. Their new Blackberry Vanilla double dipped brioche french toast tastes amazing, might I add! 

Good value, service and food!"}
{"text":"I have gone several times with my boyfriend to this IHOP and the food is getting worse every time. Starting to wonder if Danny's and this place have same manager. Don't even bother going there, horrible food. They can't get Eggs right; my boyfriend cooks eggs better than this place. The Pumpkin pancakes are literally dry inside the top peels of, yuck.
So we decided we are done no more IHOP!"}
{"text":"I only eat at places like this on rare occasions, and I expect mediocre service & decent eating. I'm not going to say this location bucked any of those trends, but I got some blueberry whole grain pancakes with bananas that were surprisingly delicious. I've had whole grain pancakes elsewhere and they tend to taste like they were made from cardboard batter. These were much better. They've also got turkey bacon which, while nowhere near as good as true bacon, was a good alternative. It sure beat most of the greasy crap they serve at Denny's. 

Besides, when you're in Vegas who's really paying attention to what they're eating?"}
{"text":"Went there tonight and had to wait twenty minutes to get a both, then it was given to two others that came in later, host would not look where I was siting after this I left 
May never go back to this location ever again"}
{"text":"Got our food wrong twice, when I told them they filled my cream cheese crepes with vanilla frosting, she told us the kitchen confirmed it was cream cheese. Then the manager said no it was frosting. He said he'd fix it but we had already sent the food back and we're out of time. I didn't touch my crepes (since they were filled with cinnamon roll frosting?) and the manager didn't even offer to discount or take them off. Place was empty and service was terrible. We heard it was our servers first day so I told her I don't blame her for the kitchens mistake, but to tell the kitchen that they almost cost her her tip. She basically scoffed at me. I'm a bartender and live off tips and always treat my servers above and beyond. Apparently that only went one way today.. never going back."}
{"text":"From start to finish, our experience at the Elyria IHOP was an all-around enjoyable time. As soon as we walked in the door, we were greeted by a man who told us to step on up, almost as if we were being called down as the next contestants of The Price is Right. He was a genuinely jovial man, who took pride in what he was doing. Putting two and two together, we soon figured out that he was the manager of the restaurant. In our short table wait, we watched him kindly interact with multiple patrons as they both entered and exited the restaurant. He even made an attempt to cheer up a considerably grumpy little girl by offering her a Trick or Treat bag and telling her parents about some fun Halloween promotions that the store would be having in the upcoming weeks. We were quickly sat by a hostess, and, within only a few moments, our server, Bobby, came over and took our drink orders. Throughout our time in the restaurant, which lasted approximately 40 minutes, our table never went unattended. Even though the restaurant was considerably full, it was adequately staffed with a group of people that actually worked as a team (something that I think is rare to see in a restaurant). Not only did the manager and the assistant manager check on us, but so did other servers. That is by no means a remark to say that Bobby wasn't doing his job-- he checked on us sufficiently, but he had other guests to take care of. When he couldn't make it to us, someone stepped in, and they were all pleasant to interact with-- it was refreshing to see that kind of camaraderie amongst a staff. The food was good, too, I don't mean to leave that part out, but the service at the Elyria IHOP is honestly enough of a reason to come back for seconds."}
{"text":"Here right now at this location. And Victor the server is working. First we waited almost 10 minutes for someone to come out. Then when he did, he came out irritated. Took our order and being rude. Have him the menu back and he snatches it from my hand. ... made us feel as if we were unwanted.... what a jerk.. definitely not coming back to this location and possibly company..."}
{"text":"National Pancake Day And She Is So Excited For Her burger....WTF?  lol.....ok, I came for the cakes....yum! Service was good and didn't wait long for a table..."}
{"text":"I don't even know why they are open or how. Bad service, food poorly cooked and tables were filthy. Doesn't even deserve one star."}
{"text":"Here to meet Gayle and Wilma. Their choice for breakfast near Wilma home place. Busy here. I have not been this chain but a time once many years ago. Always a good choice however. I had a plain waffle and was good. Others had a variety of pancakes, omelets...nice portion size and was all real good."}
{"text":"Read online that they take Denny's coupons, but refused.

Service was rude and aloof and slow. I would not recommend this place to anyone who doesn't hate themselves."}
{"text":"Me atendieron bien hice una orden para llevar y la persona que me atendió fue muy amable y paciente con migo a pesar que es fin de semana y están muy ocupados gracias"}
{"text":"Wanted to see what all the burger hype was all about. Decided to try the brunch one with pancakes. As always the pancakes were great but burger was just okay, its pretty much a breakfast burger. My friend got the mushroom swiss and said it was good but the fries were under cooked. The buns are great soft almost buttery but they are a little small. Our server (larry)? Was very nice and attentive.  The bathrooms are gross I think they probably have been there since they opened."}
{"text":"Huh, guess we just hit this restaurant at the right time. Had a gift card to use and wasn't looking forward to using it based on the reviews. We came for dinner on New Year's Day. It was pretty empty. Clean, new modern restaurant. Noah was our server. We ordered eggs,bacon,waffles,omlette,hash browns, sliders. We were all happy with our food. Service was attentive. Food was served timely. Happy to have this option in the area."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately and took our drink order but it took the waitress 15 minutes to take our food order. The resturant was not very busy. Then we had to wait more than 30 minutes for our food. When we finally got our food my hash browns were burnt, I ordered eggs over easy and i got scrambled eggs that were undercooked along with the sausage links that was also undercooked. My husband had to go get ketchup which we had asked for 2 different times. My husband also did not like his pancakes which had something black and burnt in it. His hasbrowns were also over cooked and 1 of his sausages was burnt the other was undercooked. I can gaurantee i will never go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here in two weeks. The last time, I had to go to the kitchen and get the Cook to tell the waitress that I needed her. 

Today, we've been here for about 30 minutes, and I'm tempted to call the restaurant to get our waiter but my husband won't let me."}
{"text":"The facility was clean and the food was good. We went the day after Christmas and they were busy but not overly so. The service was slow and the waitress was rarely seen. I will say that I believe that has more to do with the waitress than the actual restaurant  but the service at a restaurant  reflects on the facility it's self so that is why I place it in this review. 

We were seated right when we walked in but then it took 10 minutes to place our drink orders and then 35 minutes  for our food to come to the table. Like I said the food was great but the service was poor. There are plenty of other IHOPs  to select from in Cleveland so I was suggest going to another."}
{"text":"It's IHOP, do you really want to read my review on the largest chain ever? come here for breakfast, it's satisfying. And if you're coming here for lunch or breakfast......you must be lost or scared of the local restaurants."}
{"text":"Well the server was nice... Thats it for the good. We had french toast that was stale and burned. French fries werent cooked. Chicken fingers werent cooked."}
{"text":"The servers are very hard workers at this establishment. There is nothing that makes this ihop any different from any other one. Good food all around!"}
{"text":"First and foremost the customer service was great, they even gave me my meal for free. But the reason they have me my meal for free was because i ordered the sliders, and they come with lettuce, tomato, onions, when they brought me my food i didn't even let it touch the table. It was just bun cheese and bread. They corrected it but by then the burgers were cold, they should have re cooked them. I went with my family and they also were not impressed with their food."}
{"text":"We stopped in to fine after renewing our vows. We were joined by our 5kids who Love IHOP.

The place was quiet, We were only one's in at the time. PRESTON who was our server was absolutely Amazing. He took care of us from the start. 
Even the Manager on Duty was amazing gifting us our Meals as Newly Wedz.
Thank you guys so much glad we chose IHOP on this evening. Tho we're from out of state we'll always come to this location to dine while in VEGAS.  To refer those looking for great  service Preston is the Guy.."}
{"text":"Great location! All the staff were very friendly. I had a pancake combo with New York cheese cake pancakes and they were delicious!!! We didn't have to wait because they are new to the area. But the new look is fantastic.... Modern and more inviting the the old look that they had before. You definitely need to visit this place"}
{"text":"We live pretty close to this location and for some reason i always leave somewhat disappointed . Always come back in hopes that it will get better but it don't. The management here is just disorganized, it makes the servers very disorganized and all over the place as well.
You have servers walking with stacks of cups and coffee cups in there hands spilling whatever is left in the cup on the floor. When we got seated we didn't even have silverware & , of course our server asked prior to our food coming out what we needed and failed to bring it to us before our food come out so she might of well just not asked ."}
{"text":"Waited and hour for our food.... when they brought it out cold I almost hit the roof....  should  have just ordered room service from the hotel. Smh they weren't even overly busy. Not to mention didn't get my cranberry juice until I complained  to the manager"}
{"text":"Came in with my family to have dinner. I'll start with that the restaurant was very clean and obviously remodeled. The food was also very good. However, the service was something to be desired! First off we were told kids eat free with the purchase of an adult entrée. Then we get told that he didn't think that the computer was going to take them off because we ordered of the 'special menu'. Excuse me? Um yes it always has, and as we attempted to explain this to him he kept saying that he wasn't sure, he was new. So we asked if he could find out for us so in case we had to change our order and he tells us he can't unless he is cashing us out. Ok, so we ask if he could ask a manager and he told us there's no manager on duty. Are you serious? What business has no manager on duty? I call BS on that. Anyways we tell him that fine we will just take what we ordered and see what the computer does at check out. Two minutes later he comes and tells us that yes it will take the kids meals off. Good. Well here comes check out time and he gives us a bill at full price and a milk that we didn't order. Try to explain this to him at the register and he argues with us that he did take the 3 kids meals off and that yes we did order a milk. So my wife has to argue with him that no he did not remove the kids meals and that no we did not order a milk. He finally adjusts the ticket and it's amazing how the total went from $61 with supposedly the free kids meals to $34 once he fixed it. During this whole process we ask again for a manager and get told there is no manager on duty. I think that's unprofessional and sounds like either he didn't want the manager involved or the manager told them that they did not want to be disturbed because I doubt there would be no manager on duty. Another thing worth noting is I wouldn't waste time calling as our server told someone on the phone that they would have to call back as he is busy and had people waiting on him. Talk about unprofessional! I will be calling this ihop tomorrow and speaking to the manager, provided there's one on duty,  about the unprofessional and lousy service we received and that for now on we will go to another location. I also will be calling the corporate office as well."}
{"text":"Went there last Saturday took forever to get our order when I did receive it it had a big long black hair in it! Called over one of the other servers and they got the manager he apologize I really didn't want another order but he had said he already started it, 20 minutes later after my family was almost done eating they brought me my food, I really wasn't feeling eating it, I took a few bites get ready to leave brought me my bill charged me for it, I kind of felt that I should've not been charged since it took so long to receive it and the first-order had a big black hair! And it took forever to get it!"}
{"text":"As far as Steelyard quality goes, this place fits right in....I'm adding this to my list of \"never list\" along with Walmart. 
My friend has a toddler who is in a pancake phase, so we've been here several times already in 2017...After our last visit, I say we will find somewhere else local who has pancakes for dinner. 
There were 2-4 tables seated while we were there. But, still it took 15 minutes to get drinks. Uh oh, as soon as I dip my straw, I see something black floating in the glass. Over 15 minutes for refills. The wait staff has always been friendly, just super slow. The food has always been fine. Though, they do run out of a lot of things. At the end of our visit, a bug came crawling across the booth, pushing me right out the door!  For me this place isn't worth the price. I'll go to the local spots, MAYBE pay a little more, but have superior food and service."}
{"text":"Just got done eating here. I had the bacon omelette. Wow it was fantastic. Our service was great. Food came out fast. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"I went in around noon for a brunch with my boyfriend. we were greeted promptly by Stephanie. she took our drink and food order at the same time therefore our food came out right away. cooked to perfection! 4/5 stars because we waited nearly 15 minutes for our bill and it never came. finally we got up and asked the cashier to pull the tab so we could pay and be on our way. overall, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Unclean bathrooms, slow service. I wouldn't recommend coming to this location."}
{"text":"Will never come back here again. Sat for 40 minutes waiting on my food to watch 2 tables, totaling 6 people get their food before us. My order was wrong when the food finally came and I asked for more apple juice and water which also never came. Horrible service."}
{"text":"Love having this option nearby!  We ordered the Apple Toffee Cheesecake French Toast...  yummy!  Service and pricing were both right on par."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast at dinner.  Love their pancakes! Friendle staff, fair pricing."}
{"text":"10 minutes passed before we received drinks then only one out of 3 meals came out, and that one meal was WRONG. then my waitress told me the manager said not to worry about my food but i feel she just messed the order up the management was very nonchalant and the place was not even packed"}
{"text":"I always say an egg is an egg and how bad could a restaurant be to screw up an over easy egg? Well, today my husband and I had same meal. 2x2x2. 2 eggs,bacon and pancakes. The waitress brought eggs and bacon first, saying I'll be right back with pancakes. Well I like to put my eggs on top of pancakes. So as we waited, the waitress was bullshitting with a table who was fascinated with her accent. 15 min later two pancakes and cold eggs. Cold coffee and expensive too. $3 for a cup of coffee? Trust me they're not Starbucks. Spend your money on local breakfast cafes. I'd rather support mom and pop restaurants and pay them $25 !"}
{"text":"Restaurant in crisis.  What a horrible experience I had trying to enjoy a Labor Day breakfast with my daughter. A good 20 minutes between drinks and ordering food was the start. As I started looking around, i noticed how stressed out the servers looked. Another 30 minutes later, our order showed up. My daughter's order was wrong, my pancakes were cold and the quarter cup of eggs were horrific. Bacon was border line raw. When I brought it up to the server, I got a whole lot of excuses - \"the cook was freaking out\" was what I was officially told.  She disappeared and wasnt seen again for a while. Drinks were empty and my daughter asked to drink my remaining orange juice so she could swallow her remaining pancakes. I was about to get up and get the refills myself when our server finally showed up again. In an attempt to salvage the event with my daughter, I choked down the subpar food and we left. On the way out, we ran into the manager who was just coming in. It was apparently her day off. She proceeded to tell me how understaffed the establishment is and that she needs to hire more help. No kidding.   I know we all have bad days, but not on my dime. Never again. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"Chocolate chip pancakes, biscuits and gravy, eggs, bacon,.. and the Splashberry drink. Thats what I come
here for! A great go-to when you are craving pancakes or breakfast and the best bart is that they are open TWENTY-FOUR HOURS!"}
{"text":"I went to here a slow Sunday at about 12:30 and arrived to an empty restaurant and to the service truly lacking. Between having to wait a good 30 minutes for someone to come take our drink orders, and then waiting another hour to receive our food I was truly upset with this dinning experience. To top it off what makes it worse was that one meal was wrong and the other two arrived with burnt sausage. Truly disappointed and hope not to return here again."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. I went my whole meal with an empty glass that was never refilled. My sons order was incorrect after repeating it three times."}
{"text":"November 16, 2017. 1 waiter 1 cook at 8 a.m.  Terrible service, food was uneatable, utensils dirty. Patrons (obviously related to the 1 cook and/or 1 waiter) used vulgar language at me as she heard my comments on service! This dump needs to close. Doesn't deserve any stars."}
{"text":"We had to wait for a table but that was expected since it was a busy Sunday morning, in th middle of brunch hours. I was very impressed at how fast our food arrived to our table. Everything was cooked to perfection and we were very pleased. Our waitress was very sweet and the restaurant manager came around to make sure everything was to our liking. Great service."}
{"text":"This place is always packed on Sundays, and for good reason:  Its good breakfast fare at a reasonable price.  The service is always good here, and today was no exception.  Our waitress was nice and checked back often.  Our food was delivered timely and was hot. 

Wanting to try something new, I had the Bananas Foster French Toast.  Its 2 big slices of brioche dipped in a delicious egg batter and topped with a caramel sauce, whipped cream and of course,bananas...Wow.  Perfect for that Sunday morning sweet tooth.  It came with 2 eggs and hash brows, and I ordered mine sunny-side up. They were cooked perfectly, and the hash browns were nice and crispy.  IHOP is great for what it is, a great chain restaurant with good food and a fun family atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast spots. Pretty busy on the weekends. Sing up for their birthday club and get a free meal on your birthday."}
{"text":"If I could give this no stars I would! When we were seated, it took the server about 10 minutes to get our drink order. By then we were already ready to order in which she says she can't because there was another group before us that she needed to get orders for. 10 minutes later we are still waiting for her to take our order. Her name tag says Christian. Terrible service."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this IHOP and it was a very good experience.  Despite their being very busy on a Sunday morning, we only had a five minute wait for a table.  Our server Brandon was friendly and attentive. My wife had a short stack of pancakes and they had Boysenberry syrup, which is her all time favorite!  I had the two egg breakfast, which was prepared exactly the way I ordered.  At the end of the day IHOP is IHOP, but this one was better than most."}
{"text":"Just  want thank Haley for being very helpful.  For being attentive, she asked first if I wanted the food together I said yes,  if the good was good if I needed something else. I loved that she had all the time a smile on her face. The restaurant was clean and the GM and manger were friendly and attentive as well.  I want to thank the cooks also for the delicious food. And for their hard work.  Great people."}
{"text":"A great place for a quiet business meeting (that's why I was there). They always have new and wild items on the menu that are worth a try. And I shouldn't forget the classic buttermilk pancakes. Don't forget great prices. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"I have never been to this IHOP before, so I thought i'd try it out. Biggest mistake ever. As I parked I saw threw the window that not much people were in there, due to it being a Saturday night. So I thought,\" Hey at least we'll get our food quick.\" Cause me and my friend were hungry. Little did we know the horrible service we were about to receive. We were sat down quickly, But it took at least 10 mins before the waitress even acnowledged us for what drinks we wanted. There were 2 other people that came in after us that had their orders taken before ours. After our orders were taken and our food got to us, the waitress NEVER even came back to us once. So i paid 2.29 for a soft drink and NEVER got a refill. The busser came and took all the silverware, even my glass without even asking if i wanted a refill. Than we asked for our check, TWICE!! We waited for at least 20 mins killing time just to see if we would ever get that check. We never did. My friend wanted to Dine and Dash cause it was so bad, but i told him I don't do that. This is without a doubt the worst service I have seen in any restaurant. I left no tip, and that's something I never do, until now. I It wasn't like it was just one person giving the bad service, it was the whole staff. The waitress was horrible, the busser never let anyone know that we watned our checks, and the Supervisor from what I saw was not helping out. I wish I could give 0 stars cause I would."}
{"text":"We all have those nights. You know the ones, when you're out late, maybe the nightclub lets out at 4am, or the bar lets out at 2am and you have some trouble corralling all your friends again to the car in one piece. You just missed closing time of your favorite late night taqueria, or maybe you're just not in the mood for Mexican food, or that certain someone needs to eat, chill out and sober up so they can eventually get home safely, that's usually when I end up at this 24 hour IHOP. That, and 24 hour food joints in Las Vegas close to home are hard to come by.

There's a select few waiters and waitresses that are very hard working (often the only ones on duty) and friendly (smiles and salutations) who always ask if we need water or juice to begin with (they see some of our party is still clearly inebriated and/or dehydrated) and promptly ask us to order. Usually we aren't prepared as soon as they think and we ask them to come back in a few. On more than one occasion that \"few\" has turned into 10, 15, even 20 minute separations. Yes, I understand that there's not going to be 8 waiters on duty at that hour, but sometimes there's only 2-3 tables dining in the restaurant at that time, so how could we be forgotten that easily?

Once ordered, the food usually comes out quicker than the wait between our waiter's first than our eventual second visit where they took our order. Orders are accurate, food is warm enough, and eating the food is usually the quickest stage of the restaurant experience. Waiting for the bill is more often than not another lengthy process, but if you're assertive, just go walk up to the front counter; you're more likely to be noticed there.

Thanks IHOP for making those nights just a little more manageable."}
{"text":"Food was good but our waiter took to long to take our order. Other than that everything was amazing"}
{"text":"I've gone to this IHOP about 5-6 times over the span of about 8 years and while the service is pretty average, the food is always that great IHOP quality. I will say though that more so lately (and I don't know if this is just because it was National Pancake Day) I've noticed a downturn in service. I've seen waitresses yelling at each other, a host taking me to my table that didn't exist (and thus had to go on a scavenger hunt with me for another table), and a front counter person who didn't know how to ring up a donation bill on NPD! Needless to say, these things won't deter me from coming again next year as the location is close to my work. For a regular weekend breakfast out, however, I'll stick to my local IHOP down in Chandler."}
{"text":"I loved the food. But the service was annoying.. She started out by being sarcastic.. it was funny but it gets old. Then we asked another server for hot syrup when she wasnt around. she took this the wrong way and kept asking us about every 30 seconds to a minute if we were doing okay.. then she kinda rushed us outta there.. Idk decent service good food."}
{"text":"Service is so BAD! Today, Saturday morning, apr 30th, a young girl sat my friend and me in the middle. No server for 25 mins. We asked to move to a booth and asked for a server. A server finally popped up and went to a table that was just sat. When she finally walked past, we asked for a server and she took our order. Another 15-20 go by for drinks and food took forever! This was 11/2 hr process of nonsense. 

We watched the table we originally started at and 4 couples were sat and walked out. One table got fed up and walked out without paying. 

Servers act like it's still the opening week. All those nicks should be out by now. All young, slow, immature and no clue how to work in a restaurant! No one cleaned tables! All the tables were dirty and the hostest started taking reservations because there were no clean tables lol! 

The so-called manager ( i think she was), wasn't bothered by people walking out, 10 tables dirty and servers never on the floor!

Scary scary place!"}
{"text":"I love IHOP, but this location was horrible.

1st, it was not easy to get to (that's the DOT messing the signs up), but Im not docking them for that.

2nd, the restaurant was pretty empty (compared to other locations on a Sunday afternoon) but it took our waitress 10 minutes to even stop by to ask us if we had questions about the menu (not even taking the drink orders). I can understand that kind of wait if the place is packed, but this was ridiculous. After flagging her down (and after waiting another 5 minutes), we submit our orders. I order the strawberry paradise (or whatever it was called) with NO whipped cream. The only other thing I specified in my order was to use real eggs instead of the batter crap (my husband did the same thing). The food came out pretty quick, but the only thing that was half way decent were the pancakes (yes I know it's the International House of PANCAKES, but i've had really good eggs and other breakfast items there too). On both mine and my husband's plate, the eggs were burnt, the hash browns were burnt on the outside and raw on the inside of the lump on our plates, the ham pieces were cold, and the sausage (I had links, he had a patty) tasted sour like they were old or something. I also ended up getting whipped cream on my pancakes which I specifically asked to take off.

Our waitress didn't have a clue (or maybe it was the lack of brain cells) and we didn't see her much. When my husband went to pay the bill, the cashier pretty much didn't care about our complaints and cashed us out. Needless to say, nobody got any kind of tip. We will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Service is so horrible today.  Only one waiter and he is running around.  

Waited 16 minutes before he took our order, the frustrating part is he kept passing us and said he'll be right back.  

If he was more efficient he would have wrote the order down gave it to the kitchen staff and came back out with the food for the other tables.  Sometimes multitasking might be too hard for some."}
{"text":"Breakfast totaled $25.36, I decided to leave a $3.00 tip. Guy @ register said my total bill was $27.43, because HE included the tax. So....I left a $1, making total $28.43. When will restaurants learn that u tip off the cost of the meal BEFORE tax is included.  Stop trying to be greedy & slick! Google it, if you don't know the \"rule of thumb\"!"}
{"text":"My other half and I were extremely hungry at 4AM, and visiting Las Vegas. We decided to explore \"sin city\" and venture south of the Las Vegas strip. 

We did not want to eat anywhere on the strip and we ended up at this particular IHOP. We were greeted in a great manner and seated immediately. It was early in the morning, but a busy IHOP with only one female greeting and taking orders. I wish I would have gotten the young females name. She was great! The only way I can describe her is; she was young, had dark hair and beautiful hazel eyes. 

I will most definitely return to this IHOP on our next Las Vegas adventure."}
{"text":"I Hop is typically an ok place. This one is clean and ok environment. It is taking a while for the food to come to the table. Young kids working here."}
{"text":"I mean it's IHOP so standard diner fare so why bother reviewing, but I was sick an hour after eating here. Getting the trots on my only day off this week means a 1 star review. But judging by the other nasty reviews, they don't care anyway."}
{"text":"Usually my experiences at IHOPs are pretty decent, but this time it just wasn't pleasant. 

The positives are of course a nice variety of items. You aren't stuck with pancakes at lunchtime and you aren't limited to soups, salads, and entrees at dinnertime. Our waiter was friendly, however it seemed obvious that he was too busy to handle his section and that he needed help, but I saw no-one was willing to assist him, even though there was a bored looking hostess up front playing with her hair and not washing her hands after digging in her scalp, gross. 

So I ordered an egg white omelet with sausage, tomatoes, mushrooms, and spinach, with a side of banana pancakes and hash browns, didn't seem too complicated. When our food came out, I was disappointed to see that there was no cheese melted inside my omelet, it was a single slice of cheese melted on top. In my opinion that's just lazy, plus a square of cheese on top a long omelet looks silly. Also, there was no tomatoes in my omelet, as well as regular eggs, not egg whites. Additionally, they forgot to bring my hash browns, and my pancakes came without the bananas and cold with a block of ice cold butter on top.

I used to be a server so I tried to be very patient with everything so I politely asked another server (since ours was too busy) to take the omelet back. She did with a smile and our waiter stopped by shortly after and apologized for his mistake, which was actually a nice thing to do. About 6 minutes later, my omelet comes out, and it's technically correct, but still unappetizing. they just gave me an egg white shell with some spinach and mushrooms mixed in, with again, a block of now unmelted cheese on top, and uncooked poorly sliced tomatoes on top as well. 

At this point I'm pretty upset but still calm and patient because I felt that causing a big scene would do more harm than good. The server came by, told a few jokes, and dropped our check. No-one checked on us between bites, and the manager came by once after I pushed away my half eaten plate, asking if we were okay as she kept walking away. Time to pay..

I go up to the host/cashier and ask if our checks could be split down the middle, since my girlfriend and I like to share the bill. With an attitude she tells me that she can just split it by what we ordered. Even with old Micros systems, you are able to do the math and authorize a card by the dollar amount but she was too lazy to do so. We payed our bill which was not discounted and left. I'm a manager in the food industry. I know how things work. The only apology or acknowledgement we received was from our busy server, and no manager stopped by to apologize and let us know that we were being taken care of.

I can honestly say that this was the worst experience we've had eating in awhile. To come into a restaurant with barely ten tables seated, a host scraping her scalp and not washing her hands and touching peoples menus, to a server that's too busy to handle his station, to food that comes out wrong and is lazily made, to an incompetent cashier with an attitude, I can say that I will stay away from IHOP for awhile and NEVER return to this location again."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped by to have some late breakfast at this place, the smells in one of the areas were not pleasant at All! , so I asked to be seated some were else,We got our food and It was TERRIBLE the pancakes were under cooked , got new ones and they were Also bad,the food had no flavor , the only good thing was the coffee and the Server was very nice! But wont ever come back to this location!!"}
{"text":"This is the first time that we have been to this IHOP where we were waiting for over 15 minutes and a server hadn't even come to our table to see what we wanted. We left because of this, hopefully others will not experience this type of service :("}
{"text":"Went for the tropical pancakes
 I had been seeing the ads on TV, went there today, they were excellent, had the banana with macadamia, Nicki was my server, she was great, kept checking on me and the service was very prompt..."}
{"text":"We went to the Ihop in Avon for dinner tonight. To say it was a complete disaster would be nice. We placed our order and waited...and waited....and waited. There were 4 adults and 2 kids in our party. The 2 kids meals came our first. They finished their food and none of our meals were out. Finally after what seemed like forever, our meals came out in pieces. 2 of us had to send food back because it was cold. We ordered an appetizer but it never came out. We had to ask for everything (ketchup, mustard, steak sauce, jelly, refills). Finally the appetizer came out after we had finished our meals. The reason the waitress gave....\"i forgot to put it in\". In the end, they took off one of the meals and did not charge for the appetizer. We weren't the only people who complained and from what I heard, they were comping a lot of people's bills tonight."}
{"text":"We came here the day after thanksgiving for breakfast with my boyfriends family. I know what you're thinking, a chain, IHOP of all places but it was dipstick fly a very pleasant experience. 

The employees were so friendly, especially it waiter. He was so attentive and made sure we were happy! 

The food was pretty good for IHOP and really big portions for an affordable price. The omelets we had tasted fresh and had a lot of flavor. The pancakes were light and fluffy, not too dry. And they had an awesome assortment of pancakes to choose from. I wanted red velvet so bad but i stuck with an omelet. 

Overall a good experience. Very clean restaurant, friendly environment, and great for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Such slow service. I would give this place no stars whatsoever. We waited to be seated for 10 minutes, waited to put our drink orders in for 15 minutes, waited another 15 minutes to put in our food order and waited 30 minutes to get our food. It's a Wednesday, midday, so this place was EMPTY. After eating I went to the front and asked who the manager was and the guy helping us was the manager. I asked him why it took so long (the service) his excuse was there was one waiter, I saw more than one waiter. I just laughed and walked away... 
I don't expect 5 star service at a diner but waiting for diner food for over an hour is insane...lol. Don't waste your time here if you're looking for something pretty quick."}
{"text":"We came in after being out fishing all morning. It also happened to be right after church for folks. So they were super busy. 

We were sat at a half booth which was perfect for us. It took about 45 minutes to get our food, I had an omelet and hubby had the sampler. We are confused at why this took so long, but it could have been that they made tables that were there first their food. Makes sense that would it that way, which is why I won't take a star for that. 

The table we sat at I got super hot, I don't believe the AC was on, but it was also my the kitchen and windows."}
{"text":"One of the most clean IHOPs I've ever been to. Food was great, and our waitress was really polite. The second our drinks would get halfway we were already getting refills. Much better than the Denny's near campus."}
{"text":"Our waitress Amanda was friendly and attentive.  The food was wonderful.  I recommend this Ihop."}
{"text":"This place was disgusting.  My chair and table still had crumbs on them when I was seated.  The display on the table had dried up syrup all over it and what looked like a piece of hair stuck in it.  My food was just as bad.  My soda had a hair on the side of glass and my omelet was cold.  The cheese was not even melted. There were food crumbs all over the floors.  Then they seated a lady with a full size dog right by me.  The dog was not wearing any service dog credentials and looked like it hadn't had a bath in a long time. This place should be visited by the health department cause it is nasty.  I only gave 2 stars cause there lady that seated us was nice and our server was well mannered."}
{"text":"Went there late last night. Michael is an inspiration to all. Great service by him, he was fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Not bad , not very many people here for lunch . Had the petty melt I've had better and I've some that were crap ."}
{"text":"Not bad the food could have been hotter ! Staff was very nice and made sure that you had what you wanted ."}
{"text":"We love this IHOP!  Friendly staff, great menu with a lot of variety and excellent specials, and the restaurant is clean. Each time we come here, the manager checks on us more than once, which is a nice touch (and rare, nowadays). Great experience every time."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant.  The service is pretty good. The cheeseburger omelet look better in pictures. The first couple of bites, ok, the more you get it to it, not so good. This is as per my husband.  The ham and egg melt per \"Gina\"was ok, the ham tasted a little funny, pulled it out the remaining was good.  The pancakes were fanominal.   The hamburger wasn't too bad, the tomatoes were a bit mushy, overly ripe.   Over all we give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"This IHOP on 44th Street is in tune with crowds, turnover, and still has customer service. When its slow the servers are actually chatty and friendly. On sunday mornings when the waiting crowd is out into the parking lot, dont fret (unless youre that party of 8), youre gonna be seated before you swipe left three times on TINDER!"}
{"text":"Very very poor service. Waited an hour for our food and when it arrived everything was cold. The waiter was the only one here and was stressed. He reacted very bad to the order being cold did not apologize for the error. I do not recommend going here at all."}
{"text":"I am not much of a reviewer but had a pretty bad experience here. They need a new dishwasher. (This was a couple weeks ago) So half way through my coffee I suddenly feel something slimy hit my lips. I am not even sure what it was, romaine? A pepper? Mystery green piece of who knows about an inch long. I almost threw up, what the hell how can you pour someone a cup of coffee and not notice that? Ew. Then my friend noticed mystery bits of food on his silverware. It seems weird to write a review of a chain restaurant but wow, so gross. Gave two stars because we got the meal for free after they realized how awful this was. Won't be going back, probably to other locations too."}
{"text":"an epic adventure in americana ghetto wraithdom.

ok, so why would i be eating here and then admitting to it? well, downtown vegas has its own special ghetto charm. i wouldn't miss this for the world!
we walk right in, no wait. i'm told this is unusual with a line frequently going outside and a 15-20 minute wait throughout the day. luck is with us!

--server's face sparkles with glitter make-up! FTW!
--another server is lording over her busser, \"...I make *more* than you! I make $9.50 an hour!\" wow.
--no blueberries, no chocolate chips. pancakes are popular today! chocolate batter pancakes are the pinch hitter.
--eggs ordered over easy arrive over-rock-hard. nice! just like i ordered!
--english muffin served with side of whipped butter on a piping hot plate... so the butter was a melted pool when i went to look for it. whaHAW!
--tap water/ice has floaties! great surprises!
--busser drops tray full of glass tumblers, sending shards of glass flying, and onto my table and booth. nice!
--10 servers, 2 hosts, 2 cashiers, countless bussers and managers all chat lazily over their patrons. great vibe.

--pan handlers fight over us (fresh bait) as we walk the sidewalk. Mine! Mine! MINE!

Don't miss the $100-move-in/$300-per-week rooms for rent next door. the view of the sky through the caving roof is framed well through the gaping holes which used to be glass window panes. maybe there was a bomb test conducted there?

thanks for the memories!"}
{"text":"Just had one of the worst meals ever here. Today is Mother's Day and all I wanted was the new breakfast sliders from IHOP. Husband took me and our kids here this evening. Restaurant was nearly empty, yet it took FOREVER to get our food. Not even kidding we sat there for 45 minutes until we finally got food. When we got food, half of it was cold and just plain gross. Server never asked if we needed refills, we had to ask for them. Then, we had to wait forever to get cashed out. Will not be back for a long time unless you can get these issues fixed."}
{"text":"Very clean, great service. I really like that the menu has lots of nutritional information including calories."}
{"text":"Disappointed to lose a good breakfast place. We have been coming here a while without issue
Today it took 45 minutes to get a quick lunch with only 4 other booths of customers.
Breakfast food so covered in grease and cold was inedible no offer to remake or credit

You guys need to stop this burger focus and return to what you did right"}
{"text":"Monday evening kids wanted pancakes thought I would make them but since it was my son's birthday thought I I would take a chance. Made our way to ihop and from the moment we walked in to the moment we left the service was amazing!!! I have never seen a server handle a whole restaurant. Meredith was amazing come to find out she only works Monday and Tuesday evenings but that's okay we will definitely return. I suggest heading in on those evenings because she's the best!"}
{"text":"a typical family diner. lots of booth seating. great for breakfast but always special order or for some reason it doesn't come out hot!! the food is good, especially the stuffed french toast(a little small). service is always good-fast & friendly. the bacon is never crisp. however if you stick to the pancakes & french toast it's a real good meal for cheap. usually $10-$15 per person.
the ihop on the strip is good after midnite"}
{"text":"This location is just trash on all accords. I was ordering breakfast to go for my family since everyone was busy at work. I first tried ordering online which was a major fail. It kept telling my my cart was rejected due to an item but did not say what item. So I changed out each order to something very basic to try to figure out what the item was but it was rejected each time. This was frustrating and a waste of my time. They have 5 off your first order of 25 or more and I definitely wanted to use that since I was ordering for 5 but time after time my cart was rejected. I called this location 5 times and did not get an answer at all. I was beyond ready to give up but my dad really wanted ihop so I went there and ordered and waited. 

The place was packed so I can sort of understand not answering the phone. I go to place my order with a lady at the register and THREE TIMES she answers the phone in the middle of me trying to order. No excuse me, hold on... NOTHING. Miraculously I keep my cool and just continued to place my order. She keeps getting confused and asking the same questions over and over again. Idk what is so hard about shelled eggs but she was just not getting it. 

Finally, at 11:45 after much struggle my order is placed and my receipt is printed. At 12:37 my food is ready. They forgot pancakes, the eggs that I ordered with it and the whip cream that came on three of the pancake orders. I inform the employee of the missing items and she says I don't get eggs (I ordered them) but she will get the pancakes. 
 They came out pretty quickly after that. I asked for whipped cream and she brought me one container, three orders needed whipped cream.

Maybe the experience can be saved by deliciousness? Wrong. The strawberry syrup crap they give you... gross. The potatoes... bland. The bacon... chewy. The eggs.. mediocre and definitely not worth the extra dollar they charged for cheese. 

I wasted two hours of my time, 47 dollars and countless calories. I would have been better off at McDonald's across the street. #ihopnogo"}
{"text":"I had to meet some friends from LA earlier today....and I suggested we all go eat. My friend's boyfriend apparently was demanding IHOP.. And I couldn't have been more annoyed and confused. But... I didn't want to be difficult so I just went with it.. Sure enough, the old people's home, dusty, dirty and dingy vibe hit you at the door. Shockingly, it was very crowded but we were seated right away in probably one of their biggest booths. So that was a plus. I'm not even going to get started on the number of unappetizing things I saw before I even ordered... I can't complain about that when I'm at an IHOP, or can I? 

Anyways...I start looking at the menu, after seeing grilled tilapia, some salads and chicken fried steak dishes ... I started thinking of the complete jerks that actually go to IHOP and order tilapia. It reminded me of one of those times I was always told, \"you don't go to a hotdog stand and order sushi\". I knew then and there to stop looking at their 30 page menu and stick to PANCAKES!! I ordered a stack of pancakes with raspberries and white chocolate chips w/ cream cheese frosting, and two pieces of crispy bacon... Definitely one of their 'specialty stacks'. 
My girlfriend ordered a 2X2X2... And her boyfriend, (the IHOP sympathizer) ordered eggs/ bacon and two pancakes.. 

I was very glad I ordered what I did when all the meals came... Their eggs literally looked like hard and shiny plastic, mustard yellow, scrambled kids' kitchen-toy-food. Holy schmokes those 'eggs' could literally be on Fear Factor... These IHOP eggs are really eggs', the way McDonald's chicken Nuggets, are really 'chicken'. 

My food was good... I'm going to demote that to OK as I reflect on them while writing this. They weren't terrible by any means.. But they weren't evenly cooked.. They were very cold and now that I think about it... I am pissed I didn't say something or ask for them to be heated. I literally thought nothing of eating cold pancakes.. And to be honest.. I probably wouldn't have considered handing back an open plate with my food on it, at IHOP only because how many germs must be floating around at any given time. They squeeze so many people, at one time into that dining area... That it literally feels like a cafeteria packed full of every portly senior citizen, west of the strip. Back to my cold pancakes, even for white chocolate chip raspberry pancakes...and considering I was at the international house of pancakes they were subpar. 

I feel with all the wonderful mom and pop shops.. Going to one of these places should be a cardinal sin, and I am now prepared to lose friends the next time one suggests we go to IHOP, for a delicious Saturday breakfast. Come to think of it, if any of my friends frequent IHOP.. We're not that close. I don't say this to be stuck up... At all.....I LOVE a good hole in the wall, if their food is superb and the place is authentic/ is ran with passion. 

But, IHOP is where food goes to die and where geriatrics go to find dates and/ or friends.  The atmosphere and energy of this restaurant, honestly remind me of eating in a smoky dining hall, inside a hospice care center, in the middle of Nebraska. Did I mention the atmosphere was terrible?!?!  But again, what did I expect?? I keep bringing this review back to the fact that my expectations seem to have been set unrealistically high for a trip to IHOP. But shouldn't my expectations always be high when I eat out?? I mean, who do I keep giving IHOP any slack.. Hell they're been around so long, NONE of these mistakes should ever be happening!!

If I was rating on service alone, this place would get 4/5 or 5/5. Only reason a possible 4/5 was the hostess, who was very nice- didn't look clean or bathed. Her hair was pulled back messily and very greasy, w/ noticeable dandruff everywhere.. and her clothes were filthy.. Stains everywhere. And they were black... Not sure if this should help or hurt these facts...Regardless, these aren't good things to see when you're trying to build an appetite. And... I'm never one to go around trying to judge if someone has showered, but in a restaurant- a hostess MUST look clean and presentsentable. 

In summation: Bacon, which I ordered crispy was a 2/10. White chocolate pancakes with raspberries and cream cheese frosting... 4/10. Atmosphere 0/10. Service 9/10. 

The only thing I've learned after eating here against my will, was to ALWAYS speak up and veto a trip to IHOP.  

In case anyone at this location cares what I think... I will give this tip. #dowhateverdennysisdoing."}
{"text":"Service was horrible, the guy gave us our stuff and never came back once but to drop off the check, my girlfriend got a dirty coffee cup for her tea, the chicken fajita omelette was cold as was my food.  We sat in the waiting are for 20 minutes while others who came in after us got seated first, how does that work?   My girl loves IHOP but we will never go back to that location."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Tried to place a carryout order at this IHOP and was put on hold for 15 mins and gave up waiting for a response. If this is any indication on how they treat their customers than I want nothing to do with them. It just sucks because I love IHOP and this was the closest one to my girlfriend's place."}
{"text":"Not bad just like any other IHOP, busy on the weekends of course. Not a long no wait and not a long wait on our food to arrive. Good experience overall"}
{"text":"I'm a true fan IHOP fan. Always have been. Always will be. While I will say his isn't the most top notch location, what keeps me coming back is the server that usually works the over might shift Jamal. He hustles and gets it done. Always has a smile on his face, positive and friendly attitude. The food is the same as usual. Tasty inexpensive. Simply love it"}
{"text":"Great service, as always! great menu items. I'm a pancake fan, and my wife loves chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"Party of ten! Got drink order in 5min. Put order in. Left us with nothing after 30 minutes we has to ask where our waiter when. 10 minutes later got foods but no condiments then waited for another 10min
 Food was cold sent back. Then finally MGR got involved.  Try to resolve.  But by then  was already over the entire situation. Not happy camper."}
{"text":"Food came out in pieces and took very long to get. Every time we asked for or needed anything it took 5 minutes to get and they weren't even busy. Never got any refills on drinks either. Waitress was not friendly at all and left for the night without telling us. We sat there waiting for someone to check on us or even get us a check and I finally had to speak up. I get when shifts end, but check on us and let us know who our new server is going to be. We frequent Ihop a lot, but this was the first and last time we will go to this one."}
{"text":"Been to this Ihop twice and haven't been a huge fan. 1st visit service was terrible. Waitress never checked on us and pancakes/sausage was not brought until we all were done the rest of our food. At that point we just sent it back. Had to track someone down to get drink refills. Food was good though. I always believe in 2nd chances so decided to visit again. We all have our bad days. Our visit yesterday was the opposite. Service was great. Very friendly and tentative waitress. However, food was way over cooked and some things were burnt. They were not busy so I'd expect everything to be excellent. I have visited many IHOP's, all over the country and never had unhappy experiences until now."}
{"text":"Haven't had this bad of a service at this location. 

First, it took a while for the host to seat us. There was no greeting and the host was not personable. He did not state his name or made any eye contact with us. 

Second, I had to ask the host who was our server was since we had been waiting for 15 minutes just to take our drink order. He stated he would get our server and I noticed after another 5 minutes of waiting, our server skipped over us twice and helped out customers that came in after my family and I. 

And lastly, Jimmy, our server, FINALLY came by and SOFTLY stated he was \"sorry for the wait.\" He then asked what \"food\" we wanted to order. Um really? We all stated we haven't even ordered our drinks. He seemed dumbfounded. After taking our order, Jimmy was quick to leave. We had to stop him because we have been waiting for so long that we had already chose our food selection. Jimmy then seemed irritated and said \"nicely\" oh okay, what can I get for you? 

Let's see how long we will have to wait for our food since he took other customer orders. 

Customer service is KEY at any restaurant. Why is it so hard to train your employees?"}
{"text":"I would give this place no stars if I could. I ordered a veggie omelet and this is what they brought me, my service was horrible, the waitress started yelling and cursing because I didn't want the food. I asked for the manager twice and he never came. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and I love ihop!"}
{"text":"This is by far, THE worst IHOP ever!!! Let me reiterate this, EVER!!! 
The servers have this absent-mindedness way about them. You ask for something they look at you oddly and puzzled... \"All we were asking for was avocado slices!\" It's as if we were speaking a different language.  
From lip stick marks on more than one of our drink-ware, to completely disregarding what was ordered, the quality of the food, to disgustingly filthy restrooms, they seriously have a looooong way to go! 
On top of all this, the place was like a sauna!!! Are they cutting back on energy costs by not running the AC? It was uncomfortably hot in here. 
I can honestly say that I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Wow I am really disappointed. Food was very bland and tasteless. I have three kids and they all ordered from the kids menu. The two \"funny face\" pancakes were awful. The design on them was pitiful and it was caked with so much whip cream I wasn't sure there was a pancake under it. My daughters Mac and cheese was chewy and gummy. Apparently the drink isn't included with a kids meal so each drink my small children drank was $1.30 a piece! Talk about nickel and diming. I had good memories as a kid but as an adult ihop was a huge let down."}
{"text":"Most of the back tables were sloppily cleaned and the carpets looked as if their vacuum was broken! The creamer that was brought to use was covered in a \"slimy\" something.  I've been coming here for years, once a month or so and this is by far the WORST it's ever been.  The food was tasty and cooked correctly, but the price of all this is just getting not worth it.  $28 without tip for 2 spinach omelets a side of 3 pancakes and 2 coffees...  Eeehhh"}
{"text":"No IHOB here! Haven't been in since the renovations and place feels a lot more fresh and clean! If you can, get Anne as your waitress...she is terrific!"}
{"text":"Always happy leaving IHOP. Classic pancakes and coffee every time. Nothing better than that."}
{"text":"I had often heard that breakfast is quite good at Ihop. 

Therefore, we took the opportunity in Las Vegas and visited this restaurant. Unfortunately, our expectations were not fulfilled. I found the restaurant was quite dingy and dirty. The food was OK, but just that. Compared to what was offered, the price was too high in the end. 
My opinion is, that you can eat breakfast better and cheaper elsewhere."}
{"text":"not sure if it's all IHOP's but for some reason when I go to this location it's always TERRIBLE service. I myself am a server and know when a server is having a bad day, but there's one specific waitress we get each time we come late at night who is rude and just looks like she hates her job. She takes at least 15 min to get our drinks, another 15 to get our order and then almost an hour to get our food. ( I understand this part isn't her fault) but still she can at least get us refills or check up on us during that hour of waiting. Oh yeah! And also she was hanging  out by expo the whole time and not once checked up on us after we got our meal and had a manager check us out. This was Friday night. Get new servers who actually wanna work!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have had in 20 years. If you get the server Espy, ask for a new server or table. She didn't smile once. We saw her laughing and joking but only with tables that spoke Spanish. If you work dealing with the public being so publicly and obviously racist seems like a bad idea. She forgot things, lied, and was rude. We have been going to this ihop for years and even for the free pancakes you get with a survey, we will not be back. When we told the cashier, she told us to take the survey and let them know. She informed us we can get free pancakes and that if we come back when she is serving that won't happen. Seriously?  That's how you handle complaints? I wish I could give them less stars. And if the cashiers don't care how the meal was why ask? Unfortunately for us, the food has always been good for a  chain. :("}
{"text":"You don't expect a culinary experience when you come to IHOP. But you do expect fast and friendly service with quickly served food that is decent and warm. 

My opinion, this location delivers on all of that. 

Tara was my server and she did a great job!"}
{"text":"Lots of business going on at this IHOP.
Wide variety to choose from on their menu. 
Split Decision breakfast comes 2 of everything you should need, including sausage, bacon, eggs, french toast, and pancakes. (which i turned into their N.Y. Cheesecake  style) bomb.com! 
15 minute wait on food arrival."}
{"text":"The Harvest Grain pancakes are my daughter's favorite.  The hot chocolate is a great treat.  It's impressive how the staff tends to you regardless of how busy the restaurant is.  They get you in and out quickly while still allowing you time to enjoy your food."}
{"text":"I actually like this IHOP better than the one on Central. The food has always been good with lots of coffee refills. The last time I went, my hash browns were so perfect. Super crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. The waffle and eggs were great too."}
{"text":"Stopped to eat a 3am. Fried eggs were overcooked. 

Paid for my coffee and left. 

I've been here before and it wasn't bad. But you are probably not going to be happy if you come here in the middle of the night with the B crew working."}
{"text":"30+ minute wait for food. Hashbrowns were not brown, they were white (barely cooked). 

After I finished eating, I went to the restroom to wash my hands. I came back and the plates were cleared from my table but the dirty silverware is sitting inside my glass of water ! WTF
Terrible service. Food was not worth the long wait."}
{"text":"I see a lot of bad reviews, which is weird because this Ihop is great every time I eat here and compared to other locations! Staff is always friendly, place looks awesome & wait time on table and food is not as bad as mentioned by others! Unless I'm just really patient, but no. Regardless, I recommend stopping by if you want some good brekfesssst!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner this evening.  Our waitress pretty much forgot we were there.  My son had to stand up by our table for about ten minutes before she noticed him.  I wouldn't have been so patient. I think I would have gone looking for the manager.  Oh, and the food was mediocre.  I paid extra for avocado in my Cobb, and had to really dig to find the four small bites.  My son's hash browns tasted like they \"were made this morning.\"  Stale and dry.  The kids liked their Mac and cheese, and grilled cheese.  But it's hard to mess up Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Sluggish service. This is my second time here with family and both the times the service was horribly slow. We were a group of 4 - 2 adults and 2 kids and our order was a simple and straight one with 4 items. Still it took almost 45-50mins for us to get our food. Needless to say, the waitress was a polite person but she was asking if everything was alright in that 45min window where our food wasn't still served. Fortunately after that looong wait food was ok, else it would have been a worst start to the weekend with breakfast here. People come to these kind of restaurants mostly to kick start their weekends with good breakfast, so please don't ruin it."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  Although I loved our waitress.  She was wonderful.  However the food is basic and not great."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times prior to dropping off my rental car, and really have no complaints. My guess is that everything is few bucks more on the menu because of the convenient location. They do take pretty good care of their guests because of a complaint I had on my 1st visit Management promptly responded with an apology and a gift card. Very cool! I had a plain Turkey Benedict which I thought was darn good. My waiter was awesome and the food was hot with quality ingredients. If you're looking for quick, easy and clean then this spot or the Denny's at Tahiti Village can't be beat."}
{"text":"IHOP is IHOP... it's great for it's consistency wherever you go.  Usually when I hit up IHOP it's on the weekends and you end up fighting the crowds, but if you time it just right... your IHOP experience can be a good one.

This experience recently on a Saturday happened to be after a 4 mile run so we were super super hungry.  I was pleasantly surprised since they offer some new healthy options.  I had the wheat french toast combo with turkey bacon and scrambled egg beater eggs.  Not too bad for 490 calories.  Good way to start the day."}
{"text":"Food is good but service was slow tonight. The slowness isn't our waiters fault. Ricky was a cool and awesome waiter!!! It was some naughty ass lil African American kid waiter throwing a fit that I think slowed things down because he ended up storming out. Overall good food!"}
{"text":"Went here with my dad and brother on the way to running other errands and can honestly say I should've waited to eat lunch. Don't be fooled by the long lines of people trying to get in, this IHOP isn't worth it. 

The service was terrible, for starters. I understand it was busy, but people around us were getting food and coming and going while we waited on coffee. The food itself is...as expected: greasy and bad for you. Nothing special whatsoever. 

The real kicker is...the place was gross. Sticky, dirty tables and floors, disheveled staff, and my silverware had to be sent back because food was on it. I won't be back, and probably shouldn't have gone in the first place."}
{"text":"Nice staff but I feel like I'm being squeezed  into a little box very small restaurant for the amount of traffic"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the place is clean food is hot fresh and fast. I have never had a issue here or slightest to a problem. The waiters \" usually female\" love my kids and do anything to make them happy and smile. Regardless if that's their job you can alway tell when something is genuine."}
{"text":"I love how this place is 24hrs, after I get off work it's always hard to find some we're to eat at a reasonable price. Typically I try something new every time I come here, for the most. Can't complaint about the service, as when I come at night there always fast and efficient. Food is fresh and everything is clean and quite. Definitely recommend if you haven't been here, try it out for yourself and tell me what you think."}
{"text":"Came here at 1:00 on a Monday. Called ahead to ask the wait. The woman said \"a very long time\". I asked her, how long is \"very long\" and she said 20mins... so I live literally 1 mile from the place so I figured that's not a bad wait, will head over. Once I get there. They ask \"how many\" and I tell them 7, she gives me the most hateful and rude look and said \"that's gonna be 45mins\". We nicely complied. Waited. Then got sat. After being sat we all order waters. Nothing complicated. We get our water, the 10 mins later (not even exaggerating) she takes our order. Then, it takes 45 mins to GET THE FOOD. IN ADDITION, everyone's order was screwed. I got the sweet cream crepes, there was ZERO, cream in it. Then my buddy got a pancake combo. They brought the pancake. But NOTHING ELSE, so we figured. It might come out later. Eventually nothing comes and the waiter is NO WHERE TO BE FOUND. so we holler at a close by waiter to tell her he hasn't got his food. And she comes back to tell us she never put it in. So at this point everyone is pissed and ready to leave.... we get up to the register and tell the lady we would like to split it... she gets so Bitchy and rolls her eyes and talked down to everyone in my group. We just wanted to pay and leave. 

Long story short , never coming back"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service not so much. Waiting an extra long time for the food to come and when it came one plate wasn't correct. I ordered all 3 plates with eggs scrambled well... one came back as over easy. I just old the server that it wasn't what I ordered and he attempted to argue with me. Telling me I ordered over easy... which I have never ever in my life ordered my eggs any way besides scrambled. I asked could he just fix it and not argue with me.. so he took my plate back to the kitchen where I could hear him yelling the kitchen staff \"she ordered over easy now she wants scrambled\" who tf does that?!? I was also missing items and could not get a refill unless we asked. Will not be back at this IHOP."}
{"text":"Excelente servicio, se tardaron en servir pero estaba llenó.  La comida estaba sabrosa. Y los meseros atentos, siempre pendiente a si necesitábamos algo."}
{"text":"Literally it is probably the worst place I've ever tried to eat in.  Long line, long wait, the AC was broken so we were sweating before we got to our table. Finally seated and there was food everywhere, really dirty.  Got up and left and never looked back.  Gross!"}
{"text":"I was super hungry so of course the pancakes were great. Unfortunately ihop never has good coffee. It's horrible. But their food is good."}
{"text":"Okay food but nothing special. The hash browns were tough. 
Both of us got large portions.
The ladies bathroom was very cold and smelled funny.
The men's room urinal was broken and the toilets were dirty.
The service was good.

Wow! The bill surprised me! $31 before tip for 2 people. A bad price for a mediocre breakfast. $6 for  a coffee carafe? Is that normal? 
I won't go back!"}
{"text":"It was alright I had asked for a burger and they ran out of buns so that was annoying and the manager was just yelling in the back and then when we were checking out I heard the manager yelling \"son of a b****\" very unprofessional for a manager"}
{"text":"Madison the manager is very rude and condescending to the customer, especially when you say thank you...very disappointed"}
{"text":"Oh IHOP, as far as breakfast places go, you are a staple, aren't you?

I've been to this IHOP on numerous occasions with my fiance. He likes IHOP, I go with him to IHOP. I used to frequent this place when I was in high school with my friends.

Overall it's just your normal, run of the mill pancake house. Often they have random promotions going on for whatever new kid-flick may be out at the time. The servers get issued garments to wear, blasting the movie in your face, as does their \"new menu items\"!

I usually go with pancakes or an omelet. Every once and awhile I may order off the dinner menu, but not too often. Their breakfast items are staples and they tend to do them right. Just keep in mind the huge-ass portions you're getting. I tend not to eat my entire meal.

This particular IHOP is in the GHETT-O! Because it is the closest to my house is the only reason we come here. The service is usually spot-on and the servers are nice. I've experience better IHOP's though. And I've experienced MUCH better places to eat breakfast."}
{"text":"Near Nellis AFB I have often found myself here with my husband on lunch breaks or quick breakfasts.

Pleasantly clean and free of grunge. This IHOP is decorated in a military fashion with helicopters hanging from the ceiling and accents of patriotism strewn about.

Service is quick, to the point, prompt, and amiable. Service men frequent here - they expect food, they expect to pay, and they expect to leave. But - you will find families here too, most of them military.

Food is decent IHOP fair. Pancakes, omelettes, skillets, etc.

The cleanliness and service is why I will return. Plus I adore the multiple types of syrups IHOP has for you on the table (so maybe it is all high-fructose corn syrup flavors, oh well). Plus ask for maple warmed up and they will be happy to bring it to you."}
{"text":"I stopped in at this IHOP with a bunch of co-workers at a very, very busy morning hour. There were about 10 of us. They accommodated us very quickly though, even with the high capacity of customers they had at the time.

Our waitress split our checks without hesitation, we didn't even have to ask. Although we did mention it, and she replied it would be no problem, and she was already doing it anyway. She kept our drinks full, the food came out in a perfect amount of time as well. 

I was really surprised with how well everything went to be honest. Since we were such a large group and because it was busy. They are probably used to this though, because they are on Las Vegas Boulevard. I do believe their prices are jacked up a bit because of their location. Others in my group agreed to this as well. I guess we're all IHOP connoisseurs...

If I happened to be in the area and wanted breakfast I'd definitely go back. Word of caution though - I think the reason we all received such quick service is because it was terribly obvious we were there for lunch during our lunch break and we all had federal government ID's. So will this happen to every large group that comes through here on a busy morning? I wouldn't guarantee it."}
{"text":"Considering the location this IHOP stands out as one of the better ones in Las Vegas. I think its proximity to the Strip lends a hand to how busy it is most of the time. You can come in this IHOP any day of the week and at any time and you will find quite a few patrons. 

I've been here late at night after clubbing on a few occasions (many years ago). Most recently I went with my husband for a mid-morning breakfast on Saturday. It was busy, they had all the sections open and plenty of wait-staff to attend to the amount of patrons.

I ordered an omelet of some kind, my husband ordered something similar. IHOP's menu doesn't change much, besides their addition of specials, which usually run congruently to whatever kid's movie is out at the time. 

Our food was decent, came out quick enough and the waitress was nice. Overall, it was a generic IHOP visit that I am sure is within its corporate restaurant standards."}
{"text":"The worst customer service I've ever had in almost 19 years. We got a table our sever came took our order, about 10 minutes later she brought us our drinks. At least 3 other tables came after us and they got a table placed their order and even got their food while we were still waiting for our food. The manager asked at least 3 other tables around ours how everything was but didn't even bother to ask my table. Our sever brought food but it was for the wrong table it was for one of the tables that got there 15 after we did. After close to an hour and no food yet in our tables We left... the manager asked how everything was we explained the situation and she asked the server in front of us and the server then said that our ticket never came trough, the manager then yelled at her in front of us.  I can see why our server wasn't doing her best, especially when the manager is isn't doing a good job herself."}
{"text":"Worst service ever
Ordered for pickup they said 15 it was 30 and had me sitting there not even acknowledged me for 10 minutes and then didn't even get what I ordered. I will NEVER BE BACK"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location a couple times.  Not impressed.  We've ordered take-out from this location 3 times, and definitely not impressed.  Just because it's a regular place and not some 5-star rated restaurant doesn't mean that you can't get good service and food.

For food, it's fine.  It tastes like the other I-HOPs that I've been to, and I would give it a 4 star.  As for service, I give this a 1-2 star.  It's not that they are rude, but they don't pay attention to detail, nor is it really customer service oriented.  I get the feeling that it's just a job and being mediocre is okay, that you don't have to do better than that.

How you do things at a lower level is how you will do things when things are better.  If you're a jerk at a low level, you'll just be a bigger jerk at a higher level.

The first time ordering online, we arrived to pickup our order a few minutes after it said it would be available.  We proceeded to wait another 30-45 minutes and it was NOT busy in the restaurant.  I don't think they really cared and we did ask why our order was taking so long.  No apology or anything.  It's like it was the norm.

The 2nd time, it didn't take quite as long, but they didn't get the order completely right.

The 3rd time, last night, they didn't get the order right.  They forgot to add gravy to the chicken fried steak but I did ask about the gravy before I left and the guy said it was in the bag without checking.  It wasn't and my husband and son went back to get the gravy.  The gravy was bone cold.  Then we realized the pancakes my son ordered, NY Cheesecake Pancakes, well, the cook decided to change the order to Strawberry Pancakes instead.  Thanks.

Denny's has consistently been better for us.  The I-HOP location at Elliot & Alma School is much better.  Though this I-HOP location is the closest for us, it's far better for us to go to a further Denny's or other restaurant for take-out.

The service here, they just don't seem to care from the manager on down.  And, I can see that many other reviews similarly agree.  Sorry, I tried to give you a number of chances to prove that it was just a one time incident, but it seems this is how you guys operate business normally."}
{"text":"Food was prepared very well, but the service today was spectacular. Brennan was the best server we have seen in quite a while."}
{"text":"I came here to have lunch with my friend. I ordered a sampler meal with 2 sausages, 2 slices of bacon, 2 slices of ham, a waffle and hash browns. When biting into my waffle I pulled out of my mouth some paper. I don't know where the paper came from but it was horrible. My strawberry blitzer also had chocolate chips in it. I will never return here again. The waiter was extremely nice but the food left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"This is one of the cleaner IHOPs that I have seen.  The food is the standard fare so it's decent.  The wait staff was courteous and friendly.  The service was a bit slow but we weren't in a hurry anyway. All in all it was better than the typical IHOP."}
{"text":"This ihop is the best I've been since I left Hawaii, I usually don't like eating at IHOP or Denny's but the food was actually really good Their French toast was super delicious and I love how thick their hash browns were I will definitely be back since we live close and our waiter she was so amazing I wish all waiters were like her!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst I hop I have even in ,its on the  south side  of the strip I was leaving Vegas around 11:00am parking was really bad because its located is a area where there is a outlet in the rear plus other restaurants I spent about 3 to 4 mins .looking for a parking space, there was a line to put your name on the list to be seated that took about 20 mins. order food came out in about 20 mins. food was just OK but you know even bad food taste good if you are really hungry. I had to wait about 10 to pay my bill, the staff was very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Good place to eat !
Little bit of a wait but well worth it.
Coffee good - serve yourself coffee with your own crafe. 
Food was good - hot and enjoyable!
Easy paying"}
{"text":"AWFUL! I ordered eggs, over-medium and they brought my eggs over-easy. Politely & kindly I asked the waitress if she could make the eggs over-medium... she cheerfully said yes. Brought me a new order of eggs cooked exactly the same way.... over-easy. I ate the new egg order (should've known better) and within 1 hour I had the runs, and it wasn't from the toast, hash browns or bacon.
I think the cook got pissed that I said something and decided to show me by sending a new order prepared the same way plus his bonus of making sure I had a problem later.
I won't ever go back!! Stay away!"}
{"text":"I'm confused as to why all the 1 stars!!! Our service was great. Our food came fast. Everyone was attentive and made sure we had what we needed. I think it surpassed typical chain restaurant service. I had the red velvet pancake combo. 2 red velvet pancakes which were pretty good, hash browns, sausage, and eggs. The eggs were the only bad part of the meal! They gave us a carafe of coffee which is always needed. The hostess was so nice and attentive since the server was busy. The manager came by to see how things were and if we needed anything else. We were in and out and overall satisfied, as I would expect from a chain like ihop. No complaints here!!"}
{"text":"It is what it is-- sorta like a Dennys but centered on pancakes!  Went with my kid and his friend after Crazylegs on a late Saturday morning and of course it fit the bill for them.  Not very busy, friendly service (both our waitress and the manager).  Mediocre coffee but they stick a whole pot on the table so you're good to go.  Had some whole grain w/ nuts pancakes that were pretty good.  Not sure when my scrambled eggs were cooked though or if they were just waaay overcooked.  But since it was after an 8k I ate them, so I guess they weren't that bad.

If you're looking for a quick, easy, and relatively cheap place to take the kids for breakfast you can't go wrong.  Not sure why you would go here for anything else."}
{"text":"I come here almost every Sunday with my BFF.  It's almost like a ritual.  We like that it's never crowded when we're there, but damn, the service and food is soooo hit or miss.  Don't get me wrong...I know it's IHOP.  I'm not basing my rating on a comparison to a 5 star restaurant.  All I want are decently cooked eggs bacon, people! Depending on the weekend, sometimes we get awesome food, and sometimes we don't.  
I like that they have endless coffee and that we never feel rushed to get in and then out.  The service is average but always friendly which is probably what keeps us coming back here.  
If you're looking for a decent, relatively cheap place to have breakfast where you can bring your kids and come in your pajamas, this is your place."}
{"text":"Ordered online. Received wonderful and quick service. The hostess's at the front were very inviting. I will definitely return to this location and continue to enjoy their friendliness."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday morning, around 11. They were busy but no waiting to get seated. We had coffee right away and Jennifer, our server was friendly and attentive. Our food was hot and fresh. I had the cheeseburger omelette and it was pretty good, it was HUGE! Pancakes are always a winner. We were pleased with our visit and the service was very good."}
{"text":"This review is for our server Autumn. She was awesome! She remembered my really picky order without having to write it down and took care of us super FAST. That was nice because they made a mistake up front and we had to wait even longer.  Anyway me and my man both agreed that she gave excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"This IHOP was packed but me and my niece only waited about 2 or 3 minutes for a booth. The waitress came right over and took our orders. Food was out quickly and it was hot and fresh. The place was clean and it wasn't super noisy. Good experience at this IHOP!"}
{"text":"I have been to this IHOP around 4 times so far. I can't complain as of yet. The customer service is good, they come around and check if you need anything from time to time. The food was good, cooked very well. The restaurant can get busy at times, but we were seated fast and served quickly. 

Couple bad things about this place. The booth seems small. We had four people and felt cramped. The restaurant get very loud as well. With so many people a lot of conversations going on. Also, they barely give you some coffee. 

Overall solid place. I will continue to come here until things change."}
{"text":"Horrible experience at a known family restaurant. The wait was long. But that's not my complaint at all!!! It took over 40 minutes to get our food (6 of us total). Only an apology when the waiter brings the food to our table. Then I find a hair in my husband's food. And that's not ALL!!!!! When my husband starts to spread the butter on his pancake .... It falls apart. I don't expect much at ihop but this was the worst experience EVER. Thank goodness my crepe was delicious or I would have probably screamed!!!!
Upside: we got a free breakfast (the one that had a hair was comped) & 1/2 off of our bill."}
{"text":"I do not come here on a regular basis when I have come here with family we chose IHOP over Dennys.  After coming here my next choice will be anywhere else but IHOP. I do not like the choices or the menu change. Everything seemed very generic and bland not only to me but everyone else. It is not worth the prices. I know times change but even simple menus at other places have more effort to make food taste good. Besides that the service was great. These ladies work hard and did deserve the tip for their service."}
{"text":"For a breakfast place open 24 hours this place is an epic fail.  Took forever to get drinks. The breakfast nachos (a good idea) came out Luke warm at best. It needs better execution."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite on a Saturday night. First off the table had been scratched worn and needed to be replaced.  When I leaned forward to hand something to my dinner partner my shirt became covered in syrup. I ordered the roast turkey sandwich with fresh fruit and my partner ordered the ham and eggs melt. Her meal was fine. Mine was a nightmare. The bacon was mostly raw and ice cold and the fruit was on the verge of going bad. The manager did apologized and take off the meal, but that is not issue.  That sandwich should not should not have been served. I've had this sandwich at other locations and the bacon has at least been warm. When asked the manager did say that the dish is served cold, but ice cold bacon doesn't taste good."}
{"text":"I use to work at iHop so I know how the customers feel when they don't get quick service. Well one the store is brand new, very very few customers were seated and they still took forever to serve us. Other than that food was good, pancakes were soggy."}
{"text":"The service was SLOW they were super busy we went on friday around 1130am. Waiter was nice tho and kept checking back w us. The food was good but came out wrong. Was not a bad experiance but not great either"}
{"text":"Insider secret if you ordered scrambled eggs know that they come out of a bag it's a premix also the same with their soups nothing's fresh it's cold and then you warm it up in the microwave and it served that way.  Is that not disgusting? really! And no concept of what customer service is"}
{"text":"This is such a great IHOP! We stopped by on the way out of Vegas and I was amazed at how fast and friendly the service was. We were aiming to leave Vegas by 10am because we had to be back home by a certain time, but I was really hungry and craving a real breakfast. My boyfriend was reluctant to stay and eat, considering there was a bunch of people in line ahead of us. To my surprise, we were barely sitting in the waiting area for two minutes and they called us already. The place was packed on a Tuesday morning but our server got our orders within a few minutes. The food was ready in about 5 minutes --and it tasted sooo good. The bacon was crispy, the sausage was juicy and flavorful. We did run out of water before our server realized, but a diferent server who was passing by noticed and offered to get us more water. While the other server got us water, our server helped him out by clearing the plates for his other table -- great teamwork. Before we finished our food, a supervisor/manager came to ask how our food was and if we needed anything else. I noticed that he was going up to each table to assure that everyone was satisfied. The service was so fast that we were able to be in and out in 30 minutes and get back on the road on time."}
{"text":"Very hospitable! This is my usual, neighborhood IHOP. Each time i am here, the wait staff go. Above and beyond to accommodate my party of 6+. Nice staff, clean restaurant, and quick service."}
{"text":"I don't expect much from IHOP but this place has the most mediocre food I've ever ordered from it's franchise. I don't know why but I usually try to sway my family from coming here. But it's so close, convenience gets override by reason. I usually prefer IHOP to Denny's but this place. Blah. Their customer service is excellent. No issue with their staff at all, except maybe the cook. There's just not a lot of flavor I suppose."}
{"text":"Service here is great, very attentive. 

Had an egg and mushroom omelette with hollandaise sauce.
Ordered plain strawberry crepes.

Friend ordered Swedish cream cheese crepes which I learned have lingonberry. 

We traded one of each of our crepes. Had a good time. 

Will return for any deals, to try new things, or when I get those emails saying I got a free smiley face pancake."}
{"text":"Came here for National pancake day where you may donate dollars for the free short stack of plain buttermilk pancakes.  Added hash browns and an egg, but my server forgot to add the egg order.  I reminded him of the omission after a few minutes and told him I didn't want it anymore, but a manager brought one over, anyway.  Hash browns were OK, crisped the way I requested it, but the pancakes tasted very sweet, and I hadn't even added any of the syrup I'd brought, not like any other kind of pancake I've had at local breakfast places, such as Good Egg, Snooze, Soul Cafe, and even U.S. Egg.  I ate one at the restaurant, and took the leftovers home, but they turned rubbery the next day and was inedible.  I could taste the sugar left on my teeth when I tried to take a bite...

I won't be back for the free pancakes, but perhaps, in a pinch*, I could have more of the crispy hash browns, bacon, and eggs.

*Thanks to Jeffery A., who made me realize I didn't have to throw the 
baby out with the bath water!"}
{"text":"While visiting on April 1st, 2016, my family and I encountered a very busy yet well organized staff. Very friendly, pleasant, courteous, energetic and fun.  While we were waiting to be seated, The staff talked to us and interacted with us treating us like an old friend. Warm and genuine. Thanks Tasha!

My family and I were placed in the first available seat, which was a booth.  However, I'm a bigger guy and booths aren't my first choice when dining.  As I was \"squeezing in\" I noticed the hostess Erika was watching, walked over and told me that a table just came available and asked if I'd rather sit there instead.  
How awesome, that Erika observed and went out of her way when her responsibility with me had already been completed.  Thanks Erika!

Our server Aurora, was outstanding and immediately we had our order almost as fast as the click of your fingers.  She was Jenny-on-the-spot, with our drinks and our special requests.  Thanks Aurora!

The overall experience I feel is because of a caring and well organized staff.  Thanks to Scott, the cooking staff and all the above for making my family's experience so wonderful!  

I would highly recommend this IHOP, and say that the dining experience is worth the wait.

Thank you!!!     - J. M., Clinton, Utah"}
{"text":"I have to say that I have had better!!   Pancakes Ice Cold.   Eggs under cooked!  Party of 5- only 2 other tables in the place and it took 30 minutes for the food.   Server was VERY VERY NICE BUT THE COOK SHOULD BE FIRED!!"}
{"text":"Been years since coming to this location. Slow service, and kept asking me what my drink was because he forgot to bring it out to the table. Food was decent, had to ask for salt, silverware, etc because it wasn't at my table. Table was also dirty when I was sat. They just need to up the customer service and things would be great!"}
{"text":"Love coming here!  Always served quickly.  Saturday AMs can be super crowded but it is like that for most breakfast places.  Nice atmosphere, awesome waiters, and great food!  I marked it down because once in awhile the food takes longer than I would like."}
{"text":"This Ihop had amazing service! The staff is very friendly and happy to help their customers. I told our waiter I was in a little bit of a hurry and my breakfast was out within 5 minutes. The waiter and server made sure we were taken care of and made us feel very welcome. I will definitely go back when visiting the area!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Rude inconsiderate staff. Place needs to close. Staff ignores you. Had to wait for their credit card machine then had to wait for 5 minutes for a pen after waving my hands in the air. Pathetic"}
{"text":"So nice to see the new I-Hop location at Cotswald and I had the opportunity to visit last weekend with two other adults a newborn and 6 year old.  The waitress was super sweet.  Our order and meal went well and the food was tastey.  However I waited forever for my check.  I asked another server to let my waitress know I needed my check  but saw she had been seated a second table.  So I waited.  Then I got up and went to the kitchen door.  The other waiter came thru and said do you want to start tomorrow jokingly :) and then said she didn't come over yet??? and I said no.  So I go back to my table.  I then see the waitress at the computer assuming maybe she is preparing my check.  Wait. wait. wait.  Others at the table are getting annoyed too.  So I take my two pancakes on a plate up to the waitress.  I said I would like a box and my check please.  She is lost in a fog.  I said please get me a box and my check.  Again lost in fog.  I hand the plate to her and said I will meet you up front at the register.  I tipped her too and I really don't know why.  Should it take 2 hours to eat in an empty restuarant?   What I really meant to say was are you supposed to wait for an hour after you eat to get the check??"}
{"text":"This is is worst horrible restaurant in vegas, the employees there are just so unprofessional specially the black cashier such a horrible person make yourself a favor and please don't waste time here. I had to leave because i deserve better than this."}
{"text":"My parents absolutely had their credit card compromised here and they have since called the police.  They drove to Charlotte and stayed overnight in order to catch a flight the next AM.  This is the ONLY place they used their card in Charlotte.  Their waitress at first told my dad his card was declined so she needed to run it again which took more time.  My dad said he thought something was a bit off.  Sure enough, my parents fly out the next day from California.  Their card is declined.  My parents figure this is because they were in a few different states within a few days and was a security feature.  Nope.  The card was copied and used a number of times in Charlotte that morning and then even in Canada.  Maybe the manager is in on it?  Who knows but do NOT use your credit card here.

My parents also have the name of the waitress on their copy of the receipt."}
{"text":"It's not a great location -- there were homeless men pestering pedestrians on the sidewalk outside when we went. But in spite of some negative reviews on Yelp, we had a great meal here. Our server, Laurie, was attentive and patient with our kids, and the food was fresh and well-prepared. We were there for an early dinner. Maybe the service goes downhill in the middle of the night or during a rush, but our experience was as good as iHOP gets."}
{"text":"I wish this was a long detailed review about this locations quality of food and service but it's not, sat there for a good 10 minutes as a couple employees walked past the table without saying a word to us . Way to create a warm and welcoming environment for your customers . 

My boyfriend and I decided to go somewhere else that might actually take the time to help their customers."}
{"text":"I have had a taste for pancakes for about a month. Finally made it there. It was a Sunday so the service was a bit slow. However our waitress was amazing. You could tell she was stressed and tired. We got there and got our drinks right away. Our food took about 40 minutes. But that's ok. You go at peak time on Sunday in a busy shopping center it's what is going to happen. That simple. Julie was our waitress and she was fabulous! Always checked on her tables. Yes, all her tables. She was all over the place. She made a suggestion to my friend about a cheeseburger omelet. Omg this things was amazing. Cooked perfectly and my friend even added bacon! I had a normal breakfast with eggs, French toast, pancakes and sausage. And their sausage is real sausage. Not that crappy fake kind. My friend also got a stack of pancakes but ended up taking them home because she was full from the omelet. I got chocolate chip ones to go. And they were great at home. It was a great experience there."}
{"text":"Attached is a picture of there advertised banana and strawberry French toast and then our picture of what we had in our to go bag when we got home - no strawberries or whip cream at all on the side or anything, and bananas super brown and disgusting.  Gross.  What a waste of money and time. No one would eat that"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would but it doesn't give me that option. First of all, the hostess was very rude (Silvia) to me when I said we had a party of 7 and she questioned me as if seven people would be a problem to seat. When she was walking us towards the table, I had seen that they weren't put together and she had the audacity to say \"you can put the tables together\" as if that was my job. After she left, the waitresses who attended us ( Berenice and Destiny) were very nice unlike Silvia. She looks so miserable working here, clearly if you can't handle an environment with a handful of people; then the job isn't for you. One doesn't like to see employees with a bad attitude, because it also gets us upset."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I will officially stop being a loyal customer to IHOP. Especially to the one on nellis and Stewart. I went in at 11:03am for a birthday breakfast for a party of 9.  I have experienced the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  Myself and the rest of the party will make sure to not go back to ANY IHOP wherever we travel. You need to retrain your staff and show them some manners, especially your manager Maggie."}
{"text":"Great service from our server Bryanna. She was super sweet and attentive. I'm from San Diego and seriously haven't had someone so great serve us at an Ihop."}
{"text":"Need to start off by saying that liking IHOP is a deep dark secret that I keep. I know I know it's an \"evil corporate chain\", but damn aren't those some delicious short stacks.  
My biggest beef with this place is the hostess stand. No matter what time of day I go, they can NOT get it together.  Why is there a 20 min wait, when there are 8 table open and a huge line of people?  Now, before you get all up in my grill about double seating, I have been a hostess and a server, so I gets it. HOWEVER, on a Sunday at noon, I expect to get sat like crazy, and as a former server I love it! More tables = more cash money in my pocket.  However, these hostesses don't get it, and on top of it they are rude as hell.  Management really needs to step in b/c it's not appropriate for a teenager to be rude to a Senior Citizen.  Show respect.
Once you are seated the service isn't bad, it can be slow, especially during that dreaded Sunday after church rush, but it's not terrible.  
Food is pretty standard.  Lunch and breakfast.  Like I mentioned above, it's a chain so it's nothing extraordinary, but it's good.  I always get breakfast, but this past weekend I ventured out and got a turkey club sandwich. Not too shabby.  The French fries were seasoned and super yummy.  
If you're in Robinson and have a hankering for some breakfast, definitely go, just be prepared for a teenager with an attitude to make you wait an unnecessary mount of time."}
{"text":"ehhh. That is all I have to say about this location. The food was o.k. I had a HUGE stomach ache after eating here. Was not very pleased by the quality of my food. My eggs were cold and wayyy to much butter for my liking on my pancakes. The waitress was friendly though. Not going back to this location, I've been to way better ihops."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad, but it's not great either. Service is kind of slow, and the staff aren't very friendly. It has a small parking lot too. You can always tell if it's busy because cars are parked all along the nearby street."}
{"text":"We ordered a T-bone steak medium and I got it well done and dry. Asked for A1 steak sauce and she didn't even come w it so I went to get it. She never checked w us after. I hate that this place is always understaffed"}
{"text":"Enter the restaurant as it was getting ready to rain, only one other table occupied in the whole place.
I went to the bathroom to wash my hands before being seated, and upon getting back to our table I was appalled at how filthy the floor was!  

The floor outside the kitchen door was literally black with grit.  At that point I wanted to leave, but my husband had already ordered a soda. I asked the server what their sanitation score was and she said 98!  I told her the floor was so filthy it was just gusting, and her response was I'm sorry. She ended up being very sweet, service was slow, super slow! For being the only customers that had ordered food. We knew there was going to be a problem when the cook Came out of the kitchen and said to one of the servers I don't know how to make this! 

I has been ordered the six dollar breakfast deal, and I ordered the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes, of which they did not have, so I ended up with french fries.
My meal was supposed to come with garlic bread and was completely forgotten, it took them 10 minutes to make one piece of garlic bread. 

Mahogany, our server apologize for the wait.
One of her closest friends loves IHOP. But said he won't step foot in this one, now we understand why. It was our first and last visit."}
{"text":"decided to come here for breakfast because the fam was tired of Denny's at the timeshare.  It was fairly crowded for a Thursday which was kind of surprising. 
We all ordered.  Everything came out luke warm at best but we were all so hungry that we ate what we could.  $60 for breakfast down the drain!  When the waiter saw half our plates were still full, never once did he ask if everything was ok.  Will not return to this location!"}
{"text":"Great service and really wonderful server! Wish I remembered his name, he was Hispanic and had a thick accent. Great at his job and very sweet! Love this place in the morning when no one is there!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on my moms birthday. The hostess was very nice. We got seated at a huge booth. Our waitress was jacky. Mom and I both ordered hot tea. She asked if I wanted cream and I said yes so she said she would grab it for me. She came back to the table with no cream to take our order. My mom ordered the 2 egg breakfast and I ordered the sweet cream cheese crepes and a side of grits. I asked her for honey and she finally brought back honey AND my cream for my tea. My grits came out soon after and about 10 mins later, our food. My moms order was right, but mine was completely wrong. I didn't get the sweet cream cheese crepes, the waitress ordered me the strawberry crepes, which I ended up eating anyway even though she offered to get me the right order but I declined. She never checked on us after that except to bring us our check. She didn't ask if we wanted refills on hot water. I asked for a small glass of water which she brought me. She took our payment in hopes of \"getting you out of here quicker.\" I guess we complained too much for her so she was trying to scoot us out of there. My mom had been there previously with no issues whatsoever so hopefully this was an isolated incident. Haven't decided if I will return."}
{"text":"Came for a takeout.. with my food i said no tomatoes and a side of hash browns because apparently they cant have the one i want as a side- okay, understood. came home, and my food came WITH TOMATOES AND NO HASHBROWNS. No sauce came with my brothers food and no whipped cream for my mother's."}
{"text":"Experience:  This is my Grandfather's favorite IHOP.  He eats at this spot at least 3-4 times a week. So, once in a while, when I can get up early enough, I like to join him. 

Service:  Now, let's talk about why this is his favorite spot...that would be one particular waitress named Bianca. She knows my Grandfather by name and treats him like gold. She is half his age, but he would marry her, if she could. 
She is very friendly and helpful by nature, so make sure you ask for her!

Food:  what can I say....it's IHOP.  I like the food here, and every time I have eaten here, the food has been hot and fresh. 
I ordered the smoked sausage breakfast with over easy eggs and sourdough toast. I always ordered some roasted Serrano peppers on the side too. They are not for the faint at heart, but I love them!

Facility:  It's an IHOP.  LOL! 
But this one is nice and clean. 

Overall review:  I would probably give an IHOP a 3 star rating, but I'm giving an extra star because of Bianca."}
{"text":"Service was amazing. Dijon was the man. Serving breakfast isn't easy, so when they get your eggs right, all your sides and keep your glass full, make sure you show them \"the money\" and tip well. 10% is not acceptable, especially on a $10 meal."}
{"text":"Perfect place for breakfast! My family and I have been coming to this ihop on Easter Sunday for years. My parents are even on a first name basis with the manager Tracy. So now that my baby brother is a server there what better way to celebrate Easter even though he has to work. 

This ihop is usually packed on Sundays so Easter Sunday is no exception. Surprisingly the wait was only 20 mins. The service was great and the food came out quickly despite how busy  it was. 

You can't really go wrong with breakfast food. It is ihop so I don't really have high expectations for the food but everything came out as it should. No complaints. 

Very satisfied everytime we eat here.  We even got to watch my brother do work! The five stars is for the consistency of their great service and decent prices. As well as the the short wait time on a holiday."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with pancakes right ? WRONG !! Our night started out marvelous , perfect 102 degree weather. Nice night. Then we walk in ihop. We were then greeted by a very rude/awkward waitress who seemed the only one on the floor this evening. She then walks us to a table and wipes it off keep in mind there's crumbs and large pieces of food on the table and the booth. She then walks us to another table and tells us she'll be back. We look at the menu and immediately realize she forgot to give us another menu,therefore we had an incomplete menu. She comes back takes our order and then leaves. My fiancé and I are talking and the busser loudly yells if he can help us ,I was looking at him and he got offended. Overall this has been the most awkward and worst experience I have ever had.."}
{"text":"This entry needs to be deleted because this is a redundant business listing.

This is the same mildew stank IHOP.  Nothing is wrong with the waitstaff, they aren't stank.  This place needs to have the carpets replaced because they aren't doing well.  You keep thinking a homeless person is sleeping around the corner or that you are in a ruined cheap motel.  Mildew / urea are the smells I get.  I know the mildew is from the rugs.  The urea smell is probably from a cleaning agent."}
{"text":"Things they got wrong: decaf coffee instead of regular. Pancakes never came with the pancake combo. All this after waiting about 45 minutes. At least I got $2 off the check...?

Things they got right: We asked for an extra set of silverware and got 6 sets. Generous and thoughtful!

Never coming here again."}
{"text":"I really like IHOP. Maybe it's because it conjures up fun high school days and it's become a post-hangover destination, regardless, I enjoy coming here every so often. I love this particular location because the service and food have consistently been good. The place is clean and they provide outdoor patio seating for nice sunny days. I usually order the garden omelette and Harvest Grain 'N Nut Pancakes. My omelette was not greasy and the vegetables were surprisingly uber fresh. The pancakes were amazing. However, they forgot to ask me what type of compote I wanted and they didn't add whip cream but I think it actually made the dish better. I could taste the flavor of the nuts and whole grain. All I needed was some simple butter and syrup. It was heavenly and I cleaned up that plate. And to end our meal, it was my co-worker's birthday and our waitress made a sweet gesture of bringing out a plate of cake and ice cream for her. I love IHOP and sorry I'm not sorry, foodies."}
{"text":"Was visiting from out of town and there was hair in my food. The server was great. I got my whole meal comped. I ordered a coffee just so that I could leave a tip for the server since I didn't have cash. Coffee was disgusting. The guy who served me was a sweet young man so I left him $20. Not his fault the food sucked and a cook got hair in my meal. I go to Vegas often and won't go back here for breakfast again."}
{"text":"Horrible experience @ this ihop. Server spilled soda all over the table and the food took over 45 minutes to get to us. Never going back"}
{"text":"This place lacks customer service skills. From the hostess to the waitress these people are very short and rude. The waitress handed us wet straws and told us they're wet so you can wait for them to dry. I told her we ready to order she said she had to put another order in and be back. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I went in here with a couple girlfriends yesterday morning, which was Super Bowl day. It was around nine in the morning so we expected it to be wild with all the snow birds and people who came to Arizona for the game. No surprise there was a lot of people, but I was surprised at how fast and quick the staff was. I'm sure they were expecting a big crowd and it seemed everyone was well prepared. They had a large sitting area and for a party of four we only waiting about two minutes. Once we got seated our waitress jumped on our table and asks for our drinks. She was really friendly and always came by to check on us. Which was a surprise to all of us because they had a full house of costumers. But the staff seemed to handle it very well, quick to everything around them and with a smile on their faces. And when it comes to any simple sit down restaurants that's 85 percent of the whole experience. I ordered a stuffed filled strawberry French toast which I could only imagine how many calories, but ate it all up. Very good, if they can handle super bowl then they can handle any day in my opinion."}
{"text":"I love this IHOP it's never packed and the waitress Samantha is always nice. The food is good. The area isn't that great but it's quite."}
{"text":"Short of servers in Sunday Morning. Waiting for lemons for my drinks for 15 mins. The server passed by few times and kept telling us he left it at the counter. Sides of fruits were not fresh and when we tell the server, he was arguing with us and tell us what can he do.......after he came back with a better plate of fruits, he said\" just don't yell at me next time\" ....... ask for a check and he didn't even respond us."}
{"text":"I should disclose that most of my trips to IHOP occur between midnight and 7am. This is relevant because the service is different at these times than it is when normal humans are there. 

Whenever I go late at night, I have sudden cravings to eat certain meals... cravings usually caused by how soused I am. So sometimes I go in there and I need something greasy and unhealthy, and I pick the appetizer sampler. You get mozaralla sticks, onion rings, and chicken fingers. Plus, you should be cool and order all the sauces they have to dress up your fine, fine meal. I like ranch, marinara, and honey mustard. 

The service here is always good. I never have to wait too long to get a table, my coffee/water is consistently topped off, and the food comes out pretty quick. 

I want to rate this place 4.5 stars, but that's not an option. I want to give them that number instead of a five for one simple reason: everything there is good, but nothing is GREAT."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this restaurant because it has some of the worst customer service I have witnessed and experienced in a long time. The table behind was confronted by the server and I'm assuming manager to argue about can't sub meats on an order. Then my meal comes out and I have to get up and look for my server to bring condiments. And the nail in the coffin. As I pay my bill my wife hands me a coupon from Smith's which I read for \"1 meal\" I didn't read the fine print \"up to $9.\" When I politely asked the cashier Andrea why my math was different than what I payed  for our meals she got combative with me and sarcastically asked if I wanted to speak to the manager I said I would. Then I remembered that the family behind me had been bullied by the server and manager so I'm taking my disatisfation on yelp. I wanna have a pleasant meal, not be harassed by the employees of my destination."}
{"text":"We came to this IHOP for breakfast with our four kids while stating at the Hilton nearby. We normally have good service at IHOP and the food is consistently great. But this time our service was incredible. Our waiter, Eduardo, was absolutely on top of everything. We always have a special order because one of our kids is allergic to dairy. He made sure that everything on the order was absolutely perfect. Thanks Edwardo!"}
{"text":"it was hopping on a Monday mid morning xmas vacations i guess but not a long wait the service was pretty good the food was good too had the swedish crepes they hit the spot I know its a chain but this one is is great ive been here a few times and never disappointed it does get loud esp with kids but its good for a comfort breakfast"}
{"text":"I've been to this IHOP many many times with pretty good service. The most recent visit (tonight) literally left a bad taste in my mouth.

It started with a less than attentive waitress, progressed to a dirty teaspoon, and ended with batter-filled undercooked pancakes (that arrived about 10 minutes after the other part of my meal).

I asked for a manager. The woman who came over asked the problem, I told her and asked her to comp the pancakes. (They were part of the double blueberry pancake combo.)

She apologized several times then left the table.

When our waitress brought the bill, she said the manager had taken $5 off the bill. 

We were comped our drinks (one cup of hot tea and the all-you-can-drink soda). I wasn't aware those two drinks were $5, but okay...

Kudos to the seasoned waitress, Iris, who tried her best to rectify our situation.

Actually I happen to be a French toast fan but c'mon IHOP! If you can't do pancakes, well, what CAN ya do?"}
{"text":"We have had so many ups and downs at this IHop. This morning was the worst one yet. I ordered the chicken that came with a biscuit with gravy.  The chicken was hot and the biscuit was ice cold, topped with ice cold gravy.  Our server was at another table, so after the manager dropped off food at a table next to ours, we flagged her over, asking for a hot biscuit with hot gravy.  She put her hands on her hips and said, \"well, that's the last biscuit and gravy we had\".  I think I had the most shocked look on my face, as she offered to reheat the chicken (which was was hot) and the eggs, leaving the biscuit off completely. She didn't offer toast or a pancake, no alternative, nothing... My response was \"I just want hot food\" as she says \"well, I can't do anything about that\".  So I handed her my plate of food, that had taken only 1 bite of the chicken, and asked her to take it off of my check.  Alice never offered to bring anything else, no apologies, nothing.  Our server, Nichole, was great, she quickly came over, apologized, and then apologized for how Alice acted, then brought me the name and phone number of their district manager (whom I am about to call in a few minutes.)  Funny how it seems that Alice is aware of her mismanagement, as she has now disappeared and is no longer carrying food to the tables, as she was before."}
{"text":"IHOP is IHOP. Their pancakes after all these years are still pretty tasty. I do appreciate their variety. The employees at this location are very sweet and personable. It can be busy but that's what you get when you don't want to cook . 

I appreciate the employees here. There has not been a bad experience here for me. I believe during the normal breakfast rush hours this place is properly staffed."}
{"text":"I cant believe this place only has 2.5 stars.  My girlfriend come here at least once a week.   We usually come here about 9PM or after and have always had the best service.  Ali is usually our waitress and knows what we love.  The food is wonderful and nothing beats a stack of fresh pancakes.  Ihop is the best at that.  Last night we actually ate light and for once I didnt get pancakes.. I know crazy!  But I did feel good after and not full like usual. haha.  

Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"I generally am a fan of all IHOPs.  I give this one 4 stars because while it is a dive location, at 3AM they busted out some great fresh food that we all enjoyed.  Yes we were out at a party so you probably think that any food would be good.  Not always the case. 

Im a big breakfast lover and their pancakes are always amazing.  Service was quick and great.

Id go here again!"}
{"text":"No complaints here. I bring my sons to eat breakfast or brunch and always experience good service and great food. I like the fact that if u order a coffee, u get a big thermal to refill ur cup as u please, unlike Denny's diner."}
{"text":"The many reasons we like IHOP especially this location:
Close to home so it's convenient for us to go there.
Open 24 hrs saving grace on weekends for a late night hunger fix.
Nice Staff and the place is very clean.

What to Expect:
Don't expect the kind of service you get at other breakfast places.
It will take forever for the food to arrive.
A good 15 minute wait until the server comes to take your order.
Pancakes are average you might be better off getting waffles or an omelette.

I recommend the one with spinach served with hollandaise.
They have new spring fling pancakes strawberry & cream, sweet peach praline and blackberry.
Hash browns are just Okay.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went in Sunday 5/1 at 8 pm.

I know, an off time, I should expect for trouble. Restaurant probably 1/4 of the way filled. 

But, Ihop is 24 hours. They should be ready at anytime. 

Walked in, no one at the front. A mother and son was waiting before me and my girlfriends. She was looking through the window trying to find a staff member, and no one had come. I told her I would go to find someone. Now, its 8:05.

Walked through the restaurant-no staff. Looked into the kitchen doors, saw no one. Finally, as I'm trying to find someone, two staff come out of the kitchen. 

Now its 8:08. 

The staff takes the mom and the song first to sit down. He doesn't acknowledge us. He then disappears again, as does the other staff member. 

8:12. We are still waiting to be seated...even acknowledged!

8:14. We leave. Go somewhere else and have a fine time. 

My advice: Don't go here."}
{"text":"Worst ihop in the line of ihops. Bathroom was disgusting. Hoodlums hang out front... Pretty sure a drug deal went down with a chef. Bugs on the table, big ones, with 6 legs. Never going back"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ended up eating here two mornings in a row while staying in the not-so-super Super 8 around the corner.

Okay, not only is it a chain, but it's an IHOP, and yet I'm giving them 5 stars.  Here's why:

+ There are a few not-completely-terrible-for-you options with their Simple & Fit Menu.  The Blueberry Harvest Grain 'n Nut Combo clocked in at 440 calories, was delicious, and left me full but not uncomfortable.
+ They offered sugar-free syrup.  I even got a brand-new, still-sealed bottle the first day.  Score!
+ The iced tea was fresh and pretty strong.  I like a good iced tea kick in the pants in the morning to get me going.
+ Even on the Saturday and Sunday mornings we were there, they weren't busy.
+ Service was excellent.  Fast, friendly, considerate, etc.  What more could you want?

Options were limited in the area and our sucky hotel stiffed us on breakfast (coffee and a juice machine do not constitute a continental breakfast, yo), but we actually enjoyed our mornings at the IHOP!  Whudathunk?! :-)"}
{"text":"So I was excited to receive an email from IHOP yesterday that they were bringing the stuffed French toast back. So today I decided to order that meal to-go. I got the stuffed French toast with strawberries, hash browns, turkey sausage and cheese grits in stead of eggs. I get there and they gave me the donut French toast. I asked the lady that placed my order \"what is this\" and she proceeds with \"well we don't have that stuffed French toast anymore so I assumed u wanted the donut one\". Like WTF you don't assume what I want to eat. And the only reason I even started eating at IHOP again was bc they brought the stuffed French toast back. So her manager comes out and I guess he forgot to tell the staff that they are now serving the stuffed French toast again. He apologizes and takes the donut French toast back and 10mins later brings me a stuffed French toast. At this point I should have checked my order before leaving bc I get home and realize that they never gave me my cheese grits! Completely horrible!!! I'm so pissed!"}
{"text":"Got coffee. Took 10 minutes to get cream. Got cream but had nothing to stir my coffee with. The people in the kitchen are dropping the F bomb every 30 seconds so don't bring your kids here. Waited an hour for cold food."}
{"text":"our waiter Martin was really nice and provided excellent service. I ordered the sweedish crepes combo with eggs and bacon. the eggs and bacon were great, the crepes however, tasted like they had been cooked in a pan where they cooked other foods.and they they tasted a little burnt but they didn't look burnt...so I imagine the taste transfered from another food that had previously cooked there.
I would return it was a good experiance overall"}
{"text":"This place is so slow. Service is ridiculous. I know why there is never anyone in here. It's definitely not worth the 40 minute wait for an egg!!!!!"}
{"text":"wait was loooong...but we were in an area where there are more retired folks than anything else. the food was good. like all IHOPS lately there were as many customers as employees running through the place....the manager and another staff member had a loud conversation next to our table about the dishwasher lady walking out after 17 years. and needing to find her or call her. wow"}
{"text":"Good for an IHOP.  Fast friendly service.  When I need breakfast for dinner, this is where I go.  Darreon was our waiter and he was great."}
{"text":"When you go to an all night IHOP at 3am and see security guards stationed at the entrance, you know you're in the right place.  The service was terrible (but friendly) but the food came out as requested."}
{"text":"The waiter was very nice. The manager Yumilet was very rude. Sorry for making you do more work by pressing more buttons on your register. Just because I asked to adjust my check cause I didn't want to pay 1.99 for something I didn't get shouldn't be a problem."}
{"text":"This place is awful! I had called my order in, which took over 10 minutes because the person had no idea where the crepes were and then did NOT ask me about my side options. I pick up the item and all the staff was rude. They even forgot hash browns. The patrons here let their kids run all around and even hit strangers in the legs. DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"OMG IHOP WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU!!! ??  You used to be so good  and put your feasting patron into a tootie fruity fresh and fruity heaven... dreaming of those filled crepes and fruity pancakes.. every delectable bite, sending you deeper back into your childhood on those special weekend moments... With IHOP, you could always depend on the taste being there.... Well this morning, reality hit me in the face, as we visited this Las Vegas location...   First, prices went way up... Its really expensive and second,...they cut way back on the amount of food they give you along with the quality... I ordered the breakfast sampler.. (bad choice).  its supposed to come with 2 eggs, 2 pieces of ham, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, hashbrowns and 2pancakes... sounded like alot... well when it arrived, the eggs were so small that it looked like 1 egg... both pieces of bacon, looked like they had taken 1 slice of bacon and cut it in half (each piece was about the size of my pinky finger, the ham (and I kid you not) each piece was the size of a quarter  and very salty.. the sausage tasted disgusting (only thing that appeared normal size) .. the 2 pancakes seemed smaller and drier then what I remember... but were ok when drenched  with syrup.   This is not the IHOP I remember!!!  Also, the service at this location was bad and when asked to talk to the manager, we were told that he was too busy to talk to us.... ok customer service is lacking... Sorry IHOP and Yelpers, but have to give the honest opinion here. Take care, good luck with the gambling and I personally advise my fellow Helpers to eat.elsewhere."}
{"text":"We had a group of 13 including 5 children, on a Friday morning with no reservation and Justin and the other servers did an awesome job serving our breakfast. The twins had chocolate with whipped cream and cherry pancakes as a treat and they loved them!  They willingly split an order of chicken fried steak which my wife and I shared. This is a great place for a more reasonable cost in the Summerlin area!"}
{"text":"I placed an Uber eats order twice, both were denied. When I called the store this morning to see what the issue was, the female working told me it was busy and she had turned off the Uber eats app. I asked what time she may reopen the app and she responded \"idk, whenever I'm not busy.\" This IHOP has lost my business. Not only due to the fact that I could not get my food but because the employee working seemed she couldn't be bothered to help me. I mean how difficult is it to bag up a small order?? If it's really that busy on a Sunday where I may not place a food order through Uber or the store then maybe this establishment should consider having another employee on the clock or perhaps an employee who is more competent. I strongly encourage Uber to discontinue their business with this establishment. I am not happy!!!"}
{"text":"The bf and I came here around lunch time and the place was packed!
Not even a minute we came in to give the guy my name he didnt get my name right, we were called to our seats while there were several people waiting to be seated before us. 

Our server introduced herself to us and she just didn't seem like she wanted to be here but she did deliver.

I went to the restroom to wash my hands and this is the first time I've ever seen a worker in uniform using her phone with her planner out in the restroom.

The managers stuck out like a sore thumb in the crowd.

Anyways I ordered the $10.29 breakfast sampler came with 2 eggs, 2 sausage links,  and the bf ordered the special ultimate combo breakfast for $7.99 which was a tiny bit different but practically the same.

Server was nice and checked up on us to see how were doing which was nice after she saw that I was disappointed.  I explained to her that my order is practically the same as his but more expensive which I didn't understand.  She said the orders are not the same and that it is better to order from the specials which was the best advise she can give me.  

My best advise for the servers here are to suggest a special for a customer as an alternative for a better deal to get a better tip.

The food was good, but I could have gotten a better deal"}
{"text":"After a 1st Communion we decided to get a quick bite... so we opted for IHop - the place wasnt full - we were sitted promptly and got our menus. The waiter came back took our drink orders and brought them out fast. However the food did take some time to come out. I ordered the Spicy Chicken Ranch Sandwich which was edible but Not delicious. The bread was hard as if it had been toasted and served cold. The chicken was rough seemed old. I ate it because I was hungry but I would Never want to order that again. 

I think the food is regular and overpriced.
The Vanilla Iced Coffee tasted weird
The total for (7) adults with drinks was $92

I doubt I will visit this Ihop again"}
{"text":"When we arrived we where not greeted until 5min because they where mingling in the main office. So we are seated then we wait even longer for our waiter to show up, mind you it was not busy at that time (940pm) I had to call over someone walking so I can get service. Also hopefully management sees this so they have have the staff lower down rap music in the kitchen. It made the place feel like a jack in the box."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst breakfast spots I've ever been to. My girlfriend and I ordered French Toast, The country fried streak and eggs, a hash brown and pancakes. First of all I asked how much coffee was only find out it was $4!? I went for the French toast hot chocolate and it wasn't hot at all, more like room temperature chocolate. The steak was dry and the gravy was terrible and cold. The hash brown taste like soap and I couldn't bother to finish it. The only reason I'm giving this a star is because of Gabriel our server was very nice. We will not be returning to IHOP ever again."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. Within 15 mins of being here I have yet to have my order taken. I had to seat myself, and the waiter only came by to give me water and a straw. There is a group of older women to my right who are also sitting and waiting for their food. The waiter is in the back talking to the cook and the lady at the front door is drinking coffee and looking at her cell phone. I am walking out as I type this review to head to Denny's."}
{"text":"My Bacon Temptation Omelette was great, the buttermilk pancakes fell apart and were crumbling, couldn't even stay on fork. Oh and the dang \"door bell\" was obnoxiously annoying."}
{"text":"I went to the Denny's across the street months ago, and they were terrible. I decided to go to the IHOP because you know the whole \"rivalries\" situation, but it wasn't a rivalry. I learned they both sucked. I will never come back to this location. Sat at my table for an hour and 15 minutes to be exact, and the only thing I had to eat was the ice cause my cup was empty as well. The food finally came out and I wasn't sure what I ordered (maybe I forgot after the long wait... jk) . Now I'm sitting at in-n-out where they will not only get my food right, but I will have something to drink with no wait!!"}
{"text":"The thing about IHOP is that you usually know what you're getting when you go there. It's not the best breakfast food, but it's consistant. The service at this location has always been quick and we leave all ready for a nap."}
{"text":"IHOP is still totally overrated. Had a choice of going here or Marie Callanders. Guess what we picked? WRONG PLACE TO GO. Bacon & eggs, 2 coffees & a waffle...$25.00. $8.75!!!!!!!! for a friggin' waffle. My wife ordered that & didn't notice the price. (her mistake) Never again, I'll go to the Rampart & we get an order of bacon, eggs, hash browns, toast & coffee for $10.80 less tip & tax. This place is a total rip & the food wasn't that good."}
{"text":"I'm a self-confessed brunch addict, and IHOP is one of my guilty pleasures.

Apparently this IHOP (located right outside of The Strip in VEGAS) is the \"busiest IHOP in the nation,\" according to our server. And I believe her wholly. Came here for breakfast with the family on CHRISTMAS DAY and it was open, bustling, and had lines out the door from the moment we arrived around 10AM to when we left. The managers and hosts all had earpieces and it really made me feel like this IHOP really was a 24-hours-nonstop type of joint. 

Service from our waitress was lacking, but I don't blame her...the tables in her section were constantly being sat, since there was always hungry customers waiting in the foyer. Our family shared the 5-stack buttermilk pancakes, breakfast sampler, side of hash browns, and meat omelette. Although I am not a coffee drinker, I gotta tell ya a CRUCIAL POINT brought up by the rest of my family...\"THE COFFEE IS KILLER AND TOTALLY DOMINATES DENNY'S COFFEE.\" They wanted me to write this in my review, because CLEARLY the Denny's on The Strip sells watered down coffee, and they wanted to give a round of applause for IHOP's deliciously strong coffee. 

Food was just perfect and staff was efficient, given the CRAZINESS that comes with being open for service on Christmas day. Next time I'm in Vegas, I know where I'll be getting my off-of-the-Strip breakfast fix!

Cheers to the entire staff from the bussers to the line cooks--y'all deserve ALL the love and happiness that this 2014 and upcoming 2015 will bring because it's CHRISTMAS DAY and you all worked your butts off."}
{"text":"Walked in. No host. Not busy at all. Waited a few mins but no one came so I seated myself, waived at the waitress. She just looked at me with a dirty look. I guess I was supposed to wait forever for a host? After I sat down they made me sit there for 5-10 mins before even acknowledging me. Won't return."}
{"text":"Stood at the front waiting to be seated for over 5 minutes. Finally someone can and sat the person in front of me. Then left me standing there. Crowd was building behind me. 
Bring lots of sanitizer with you or try not to go to the restroom. Avoid it at all costs. Looks like it was last cleaned weeks ago!"}
{"text":"iHop is starting to grow on me with their seasonal clever creations.  This time it's the banana pudding pancakes.  Even comes with miniature Nilla wafers.  Weekday specials are priced reasonable.  The only complaint I have is their juice prices."}
{"text":"20 minute wait for a table not bad...waiting 1.5 hours to get your food is ridiculous! Yes they were busy the day after Christmas but it was obvious the entire staff was overwhelmed and understaffed. One server even left because he said he couldn't take it anymore. Our server,  Gabrielle was as good as she could be considering it was her first week at being a server... she was very apologetic and almost cried once.  This is obviously a management problem because we experienced somewhat the same issue on a previous visit so unfortunately today will be our last."}
{"text":"We rarely go to breakfast.  However, I had a birthday coupon for a free rootie tootie pancake stack.  I tried to call in my order to try to pick up on my way into work.  No answer to the phones. So i drove over, ordered and waited.  I got my free pancakes with strawberry topping, and ordered an over easy egg and some sausage.  The strawberry topping was ice cold. Like so cold the strawberries were icy. I threw the container out. Thankfully the gal put syrup in the bag. The sausage was ok.  Not sure now many links i was supposed to get, but I received 2 and 1/4 links. The egg.  good grief.  I asked for over easy and what i received was a overcooked mess. I ate the white and threw out the yolk.  I shoulda went to Dennys."}
{"text":"We went in at approx. 12:48am on New Year's Eve.  We were hungry and not much was open, so we went to our neighborhood IHOP.  We were thrilled to see that there were only 4 other tables of customers in the entire restaurant when we arrived.  I went in planning to tip $10 minimum cause I feel sorry for people that have to work on new year's eve, but the horrible service we got from Tekeyah drastically reduced that amount by the end of our meal  :-(  
Despite there being few customers, she kept disappearing into the kitchen and not coming out.  We ordered cheese sticks and wanted some ranch dressing, but she never came back, so we eventually ate them without dipping sauce just so they wouldn't get cold and be ruined.  Then she brought our food, which was fine, but she wouldn't refill our drinks.  When we point blank asked her towards the end of our meal, she handed us our check and actually said \"when you're finished you can take this to the register...\"  her tone and demeanor said clearly that she had no intention of bringing us a refill, and though we waited as she brought drinks for another table beside us, she acted as if we were invisible... solidifying her actions and attitude that we'd eaten and she was finished with us and we were invited to leave.  We did leave, and she got a whopping 10% tip on our $34.24 bill  ($3.40)  Someone needs to inform Miss. Tekeyah that service = tips, even on a holiday.  Perhaps she should rethink her chosen profession as she's clearly not good at it and her failures and shortcomings reflect quite poorly on IHOP as a result.

***UPDATE:***    I emailed IHOP.com the same review that I posted here at yelp.com and I got a response that said I'd hear from a representative within \"3-5 business days\".  When that time passed, I replied to the email asking for someone to contact me.  I got an email from a Robbie Turner (Area Supervisor) that thanked me for my time.  Again- no dialog about my complaint, no apology.  I replied to Robbie's email asking who to contact to actually have a discussion...  it's been 3 business days...  again, no response.  
I'm going to take that as my answer that IHOP doesn't give a dam# about their customers or what they have to say.  I won't be back and I'll be telling everyone that will listen!!

***UPDATE:***   I spoke to Robbie Turner today and the first topic out of his mouth was that he'd checked the video of our visit.  Again- no apology.  He started the conversation off in a defensive manner.  When I explained to him that the fuel that has kept me so irritated was that his canned responses were inadequate for the situation, he finally offered an apology...  an empty apology, but at least it was one.  I asked him if he'd spoken with the server and he said that he did, but didn't elaborate on the outcome of that conversation which I'd have liked to hear.  The conversation reached an impass resulting in him asking me what he could do to make me happy...  at that moment I realized that there was nothing he could do to salvage my business as this whole experience has completely eradicated my desire to eat at IHOP again.  
Well done Tekeyah and well done Mr. Turner; you've successfully run off people that are overweight, eat out every meal and have disposable income...  all the marketing in the world can't turn that around."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars, but it isn't an option. Sat for 20 minutes and were never acknowledged. As we walked out, we told the greeter we were leaving and that we sat for 20 minutes. No response whatsoever, not even an, \"I'm sorry.\"  We will NOT  be back...EVER!!!"}
{"text":"**2nd Edit 5/2/18**

Gift card never came. After a follow up call with a new manager of this location, she promised another gift card to come last Friday. So far, no gift card. I do hope that management reads these reviews-After a month it does not seem that the service has gotten any quicker. Unfortunately we will not be back to this IHOP. It's a shame that they can't keep on their promises. 

**Edited 4/2/18***

After filling out a survey, the district manager contacted me today, and let me know that there is new management in this location with 10+ years tenure and is committed to turning this location around and improving the service. This is such a great gesture, I am going to visit this location again in a couple of weeks, and give them a 4th chance, 


We have been here three times since it opened. Very slow service, like most of the other reviews. All three visits happened after 8pm(only 2 in my party) and each visit the restaurant was dead. The food is fine-typical IHOP food, but the service is poor and the wait time is atrocious."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting! Management was horrible! They wouldn't lift a finger to help out the servers who needed help. We also seen a roach left our food on table and left. With out eating. This establishment needs a health inspector and needs to be shut down!"}
{"text":"This place was just OKay and the food could have been better.  I really like the location in Mesa better.  This place does have the potential at being a good place.  The servers and cooks just need to kick it up a notch.  Our server was new, very friendly but didn't come by as much as we would have liked.  Our drinks didn't get filled as much.  Even though it was really slow.  The place was clean and comfortable.  

On to the food....  I had the southern fried steak with mash potatoes, broccoli, and the potato soup.  Southern fried steak could have been crispier, mash potatoes tasted boxed, broccoli was good, and the potato soup was not fresh (it was darker color compared to the color of the soup in Mesa).  Their pancakes were over cooked and dark brown.  My husband had the Colorado Omelet and it looked packed full of goodies and freshly cooked.  It tasted good too. 

I would come here again, but I would most likely take a trip down to Mesa first."}
{"text":"Had to have dinner at our fav place last night.  Got a new waitress, Kay.  She was cheerful, very helpful (especially when my husband spilt tea all over me), and kept us happy.  My husband was downing so many splashberry drinks, she gave him a pitcher of it.  That made him super happy.

The food was really good and was served fast with big portions.  

We had fun!  Thank you again!"}
{"text":"I only received 1 fruit cup and no utensils.  My order shows fruit with both entrees.  Make the driver wait while you check the order.  I am a regular customer and am upset.  But this shouldn't happen at all.  Bye IHOP."}
{"text":"What'd you expect in an IHOP, 
Quick service late at night,
Hot coffee at 3am,
And surveys to do when you get home for free pancakes,
Which in turn brings me back in whenever I'd like being they're 24/7. 
Convenient location, with a weird way of getting to it so its never too packed.
Brioche Banana Foster French Toast sonn!
Bout that life!"}
{"text":"This place sucks I found 7 hairs on my dish . Between the batter of the pancake the egg and even my coffee what kind of shit it this if give out a -5 slow service and the waitress have their hair all over the place that explains the hairy plate"}
{"text":"Waiter obed was nice and attentive. I got my crepes dry on the sides not how I usually get hem fresh and soft. Not crunchy !? Everything else was okay there was no silva ware when we sat by the way we had to reach out for one.  Food came out fast it was okay and it was at night btw"}
{"text":"IHOP IS AWESOME! Especially this one! The food is always to die for and the staff is very friendly! Go to this one!!!"}
{"text":"IHOP has never really been a place that I get excited about going to but late at night when nothing else is open, their chicken fingers are divine.  I had a great experience at this particular location, the service was excellent, the facilities were clean, and the food was great."}
{"text":"Horrible! Not one good thing about this place. We were one of 3 tables on a Monday night and it took almost 45 minutes to get our food AND it was completely wrong, items were missing or cooked wrong. Completely trash. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good.  I'm trying understand how they seat people. Looking at the restaurant they put the black  minority men to the back of the bus.  When the Black men asked to be seated in a seat closer to the front the hostess said NO!!  Is it not where the customer wants to sit!!!!  Does the customer not help keep you in business.  The one star is for the food, only.
I know this review will go on deaf ears but it has to be said.  Racism is still going on but it's very undercover. People are hoping you don't notices!!!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday before checking out The Boulevard Mall .. Our waiter George was awesome.. He was friendly, helpful and had great customer service.  I felt bad for him because he had so many customers and he was working solo.   I watched many of them being rude and it annoyed me because he was my himself and still composing himself professionally.  We waited about 45 minutes for our food, which kinda sucked because my pancakes were cold.  But I think they were short staffed. Still the food was good!!"}
{"text":"I went there for dinner.. the food it's very good and tasty.. but the services isn't good.. first we wait to be seated like 15 min.. and the restaurant was all empty not even the employees wasn't there.. second , we ask for drinks and the drinks taste weird.. so we ask for another drink .. after  we finally get the food .. nobody check on us again until we are done.. no refills of water or soda.. I think they have to take more care about his customers.."}
{"text":"I love IHOP, but this place blows buttcheeks!  Service was poor, took forever to get our food.  I ordered the \"Harvest Grain Blueberry pancakes\" with egg substitute and turkey bacon.  What I received was cardboard pancakes with no blueberries and two strips of extremely greasy turkey bacons.  After questioning what I ordered, I received an apology and was offered blueberries in cup to place over.  Isn't the blueberries supposed to be in the pancakes not on top of them? Anyhow, won't be coming back here again after a long night on the strip."}
{"text":"Omg they need help so bad please go fill out an application there every one was so unprofessional so ghetto and so dirty there was more food on the floor then in the kitchen"}
{"text":"RUDE! My fiancé and I came to this iHop for a late dinner and saw a sign that said they were closed, but reopening at 6am on Tuesday 5-1. It was 10pm and we were about to walk away but noticed there were people eating inside, so we pulled on the door and walked in. We waited awhile before we had to walk around to find a server to ask. My fiancé didn't even get a chance to say anything before a rude, female employee screamed, \"CLOSED! The sign says closed! Like the sign says!\" And my fiancé threw his hands up in the air and said, \"Ok, I'm sorry. We saw people eating so we came in...\" and the lady says, \"We're closed, the sign says we open at 6.\" No, I'm sorry to inconvenience you or anything like that. The customers eating in there were staring at us, very confused too. If we had come from the hospital across the street and she'd treated us like that, I would have flown off the handle."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in here at 10:45pm on a Friday night. While the place was busy, we still had really good food and exceptional service. Server, Alex, has a great personality. When my boyfriend asked for a box, he went to the back and grabbed a big empty cardboard box and brought it back to us as a joke. Hilarious. He was polite and talkative, great server. The apple ring pancakes were insanely good. Wish they were here all the time!"}
{"text":"Today's visit was pretty good! My boyfriend and I visited here on a Tuesday morning for the first time, at this location, (we are no strangers to IHOP!). With this new location, we were surprised when we walked inside. It's very sleek and clean looking on the inside. We were seated quickly, And our service was outstanding! Lindsay was a wonderful waitress, 5 stars just for her!! She checked back often to see if we needed anything, which I appreciate. She was very personable and was relaxed. After waiting a little while for our food, she kindly let us know that our food would be out soon and that the kitchen was running a bit slow today. I ordered the Strawberries and Cream crepes with an order of hash browns, scrambled eggs, and bacon on the side. The crepes were delicious while everything else was pretty standard. Overall the food was about a 3.5 star rating while our service was a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"I only go here for pancakes, and I am never disappointed. The bacon could be improved, but I love pancakes!!! Always great service."}
{"text":"I love to go to this place for pancakes but the scrambled egged to me are very dry even when you add cheese!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal here. My food came out quick and fresh. No complaints! I got the double dipped French toast and it was amazing."}
{"text":"I have been yelping for five years and written 661 reviews, and have not been to I-Hop. What is wrong with me!? So, I'll talk about my experience at I-Hop after a 5 year hiatus that goes back to 2009 when we dined in the Fisherman's Wharf restaurant on the week that Michael Jackson passed away. 

  This is an interesting I-Hop. It is located in the parking lot adjacent to the Las Vegas South Premium Outlet Mall off of Las Vegas Boulevard a short distance south of where it transitions from the Las Vegas Strip to a local Highway parallel to Interstate 15. This I-Hop is a melting pot of clientele. Under it's roof; tourists, locals, and I-15 motorists enjoy the legendary I-Hop pancakes and breakfasts. 

   This past Saturday, I was facing a 300-minute Praxis exam. I  needed a delicious breakfast that would fill me up. I needed I-Hop. 

   Owing to the fact that you have all the tourists, locals, and I-15 motorists flocking to this I-Hop; it gets busy to the degree that the parking lot and restaurant fills up. I'd park a couple of pads away at Dunkin Donuts. Regardless that I-Hop was hopping with people, they were able to get me in right away. 

   In the five years since I last dined in I-Hop, the menu has changed. I did not see the Rudy Tutie fresh &  fruity breakfast combo that I remember loving so much. Likewise, I saw less of the omelettes I also loved. What I saw more of was higher prices. The majority of the breakfast combos with just a coffee (forget coffee and orange juice) add up to around $15. That is around triple the price of a coffee with a cream cheese bagel or coffee with two donoughts combo a couple pads away at Dunkin Donuts. Regardless, I did see a combination with a stack of  flavored pancakes that included bacon, scrambled eggs, and hash browns. 

  Just looking at the picture of the stack of strawberry pancakes topped with that mouth watering strawberry sauce, strawberries, and whip cream makes me salivate. Their fruity pancakes are the bomb. The scrambled eggs were also out of this World delicious. The bacon was cooked at just the right temperature. The coffee, served in a kettle was premium tasting. The one weakness was that the top center of the hash browns was hard. 

  The service was okay. I appreciate that regardless of how busy they were that they did not rush me. Still there were some flaws in the service. At the time the waitress served the coffee there was no silverware. Likewise, I'd have to reach across a recently vacated dirty table to grab Sweet & Lows. 

 In conclusion I am more of a dinner than breakfast person. I prefer to look forward to eating out. However, every once in awhile either I deserve to treat myself to a good breakfast or feel the necessity for one before a long test or event."}
{"text":"Were there yesterday for breakfast with a party of six. Busy restaurant and were seated promptly and greeted and provided great service by our waitress Yvonne. She was pleasant and witty and made our breakfast experience good. She gets 5 stars!  So why does the restaurant get only 1 star. 5 people of the 6 in our party became ill after eating here. Dont know why, maybe cleanliness or bad food.... Next day my wife is still feeling sick and my daughter too.   The Health Dept needs to pay this place a visit. Last time we eat here."}
{"text":"We eat at this location on a regular basis.  Usually, it's early on a Saturday or Sunday morning. Food is great, service is great.  I prefer my eggs done over hard and the chef gets it right most of the time, no raw yolk inside.

My son loves it, too.  We last ate there today and they have a coloring contest going.  My son took part and hopefully, he will win!  This location is child-friendly.

The only place this location falls down on the job is with carry out orders.  They are busy enough that the cashier doesn't pick up sometimes on the first attempt.  You frequently REALLY have to want to take it home to persist.  If they fix that issue, my review will change to five stars.

In short, I recommend."}
{"text":"So I have been training folks on computers and WordPress and my recent client and I started meeting at this location about 2 or 3 times a week for a couple weeks now, going on week 3. No matter when I meet the client here we always get great service and the staff will go above and beyond for you and your requests. I couldn't be happier to find this location. I now will be looking to meet more clients at at this location where I know we will we will receive great service during our stay.  

The restaurant is always clean in both the dinning area and the bathroom, well not sure about the ladies room, but the guys bathroom is always clean. I see the staff is well organized, they work as a team, and are very efficient from order taking, delivery of food, to busing the tables. I am very impressed with the performance here. This is rare as I always do the good, the bad, and the ugly of all my reviews. This is the first time after \"x\" amount of visits I have yet to find the bad or ugly. 

Thank you all for making my clients and myself feel welcome and important there. I'd recommend your location to anyone looking for fresh coffee and food served with a smile and great attitude cause you guys do exactly that. I have yet to see any unsatisfied clients there. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Was at this location both Saturday and Monday morning. Wait staff was very friendly. Food was typical for chain..fast and friendly service. Got by back to Vegas in February and will defiantly be stopping at this location."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday and even though it was crowded I was seated promptly and my food was out on about 5 minutes, surprisingly fast. The coffee was good and my breakfast was even better. You can't really go wrong with having breakfast at Ihop. The server was busy but she was still very polite and attentive. Thank you IHOP for an enjoyable Sunday breakfast."}
{"text":"I Hop rocks.
Fast friendly service food is great coffee is super. You get a pot of coffee on your table that you drink as you eat. Unlike Dennys where you have to hold your cup up in the air like a beggar,begging for money..
Thanks to two I HOP waitresses Autumn and Cara for excellent service with a smile."}
{"text":"Usually I like IHOP and I've honestly never had such a bad experience at one. As many other reviewers have stated, the service wasn't stellar here. That said though, it wasn't the worst part of my experience. Actually my server tried her hardest to be friendly and polite even if she was a bit off and not the best at her \"bedside manner\".

What really killed it for me here was ambiance and the cleanliness. It felt dirty and disorganized from the moment I got in. The host had a messy pile of menus all tossed together on the stand. In fact they were so confusing that he gave me a doubles of one part. It seemed weird to me for it to be in such disarray at lunch time in the middle of the day; and they weren't busy at all either. When I got to my table it was quite gross. There was some sticky matter smeared on it here and there. I managed to find a decently clean spot to open my laptop as I had come here to work some because I know they can be relied on for having WiFi. The music is really random and entirely too loud making it a considerable distraction and not good for a relaxing lunch time.

They have a new quick lunch menu where you can pick a sandwich, wrap or salad and pair it with a soup or other side such as fries. I opted for the avocado bacon turkey wrap and loaded potato soup. The wrap itself had a strange flavor to it that I didn't like. The few avocado chunks in it were small enough that you never tasted them and the bacon crumbles were the saddest excuse of a supplement for bacon I've ever had. They screwed up the entire wrap with an almost painful crunch. For the soups they had run out of bowls in the proper size (again, in the middle of the day...) so I got a large bowl half full of soup and with no bacon or cheese sprinkled on top as I'm used to with this soup. Lastly, crackers were an afterthought from my server. Basically, I don't think I'll be coming back to this IHOP."}
{"text":"IHOP is the place for my unusual loaded baked potato soup fix of the day. It is my favorite item on their menu. But that aside it's not a particularly unique experience to go here. Yeah it's the International House of Pancakes but I have to say it's a name we spent lots more time pondering over hot Lipton's tea while waiting for our food to come out. Like, why is it international? Because the food isn't exactly international fare and I'm not aware of them being popular in foreign countries. In fact the most international thing about this IHOP is the multicultural staff and the university area patrons.

Yeah, they have some standard menu items I like but I can get a steak omelet at at least 100 other unique joints just in this city. Breakfast food is breakfast pretty much anywhere you go. It's impossible to screw up eggs. And they don't. Just like delicious pancakes with different toppings. The one thing you can rely on is boring consistency with a chain like IHOP so boring that you almost want them to burn your bacon to a crisp so that you have to complain to get some excitement with your meal. When I'm depressed and want to indulge in the comforts of a warm bowl of pureed potato soup I know I can always find IHOP there for me."}
{"text":"We were here first and three groups got seated before us. Waited about 56 minutes for our food and staff was unprofessional. Don't come to this IHOP if you're in a hour or ever."}
{"text":"awful just awful . After waiting forever food sucks . i am so mad . I found a hair in my food . My friend  food was cold .He sent it back . Never again at this Ihop"}
{"text":"Working 3rd shift and this is the closest place that is open. Overnight staff is quick and nice. They don't mind that I order to go, and usually offer me a soda or other beverage while I wait. Definite staple in my 3rd shift diet."}
{"text":"First we, along with other apparently white looking patrons, waited several minutes to have a server approach us then when I got my drink, it was mimdewy tasting.   The young servers were quick to replace the drink, but did not show any concern for how serious mildew is on their ice or drink dispensing machines.   In fact the young man seemed impatient and was sucking through his teeth when I was discussing the taste it left in my mouth.  Not a happy experience."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location on and off. The last time I came here was sometime last year. The service and the food from what I can remember was very good on my last visit here. However, this time around there has been a big shift and even though the same employees are still working here since the last time I've come in you can tell the quality all around has gone down hill. We got seated fairly quickly, however, wait time for the food was very very long. The food that was brought out after all that wait was just \"ok.\" Our waitress, who we've had before, and I know has done a good job in the past seemed to be lacking a lot today. Not so sure it's worth coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Usually I don't like ihop and the food was better than I had remembered but overall still disappointing. Basic service nothing worth commenting over. I liked the new menu where everything was pictured and some of the items look really good. 
We got the California scrambler and the brioche bananas foster French toast combo. The omelette portion of the California was pretty good the salsa had a good taste but the cheese was smothered on one side which ended up making it not as good as it should've been. The potatoes that came with it had what tasted like Potatoe chip seasoning and was super salty but still tasted good. 
The bananas fosters French toast was good it was thinly battered and covered with the perfect amount of caramel sauce. 
The thing that was the biggest turn off was when we got the receipt seeing that we were charged 1.79 for a kiss orange juice and $3 for a diet Pepsi. In total we ended up spending about $10 in just drinking making a cheap breakfast up to $40."}
{"text":"Uncle Yu's san Ramon - What happen to this very good Restaurant? New owner, new chief? Horrible! Please figure it out...We miss the great food, and service???

Hoping for the old quality to return. 

regards, Bob R."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here on Sunday morning with our friends who were visiting from California. Jeffrey was our server and he was efficient and gracious. One of our friends was not used to sweet tea, so Jeffrey quickly replaced his tea with unsweetened tea. The guys had omelettes and the girls had eggs and pancakes. All were delicious and served hot with the proper sides. There is a very large church across the street from this IHOP, so expect to wait for a table if you show up before the early service or between services. Tables were bussed quickly, though, and food came out of the kitchen in an appropriate amount of time."}
{"text":"5 stars for Truce, Sammy and Shasta!! They made my husband and I's wedding anniversary sooo special! I will never forget! Such wonderful service and yummy food too!!! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite late at night as everything else was closed.  Had a club sandwich and some fries.  It is a normal Ihop, nothing fancy.  Service was a little slow, but our food was out at a decent time.  Not many people in that late."}
{"text":"It's IHOP. I'm still alive. 

Food is good. Large selection of food from breakfast (Crazy huge omelets!) to dinner. Sometimes hard to make a quick decision."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Ordered an over-priced spinach/mushroom omelet with NO swiss cheese today.  I ended up scraping the cheese off of my omelet that wasn't supposed to be there in the first place.  It wouldn't have been so bad if it was the first time it had happened, but the exact same thing happened last time I went there.

So, I made it known that there had been a mistake made...again.  The cashier giggled and gave me a whopping $2 off a $32 check. I won't be going there again anytime soon.

Save your money, the place is overpriced and can't seem to get it right."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to this location late last night to grab some iced coffee and a bit of dessert. We were the only patrons there, and there was only one girl working (this was at 1 am). She promptly seated us and took our orders. While seated, we noticed a young girl (teens-early 20s) who came in, dressed in a grey sweatshirt and jeans. She walked to the end of an aisle, stared directly at myself and my husband, and burst into laughter, smirking. She headed to the women's bathroom together with the waitress, and we saw them go back at least twice. When she got out, she headed with the waitress to the front of the restaurant. Then, things quickly went downhill. The female customer (whom I suspect of being on MDMA or an equivalent drug), became extremely loud and obnoxious, dancing like a monkey and screaming strange lyrics and such at the top of her lungs. There was a family who had arrived to eat, and they too looked askance at the scene. Then, the girl turned around and shouted \"MY NAME IS HEIDI, AND MY GRANDFATHER AND I ARE CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN TOGETHERR, WHOO!,\" whilst pointing at my husband and myself. The waitress became shifty eyed and defensive, quickly saying that the girl was \"Okay,\" and simply drunk. When my husband mentioned telephoning the police, she became scared. IHOP, I don't know what kind of a business you're running here, but the scene last night was very suspicious. My husband and I suspected that the customer was selling drugs in the bathroom to our waitress, though that may not be the case. We will not be returning to this location, or possibly any IHOP, for a VERY long time."}
{"text":"Yuck! Yuck! Triple yuck. I hate leaving 1 star reviews, but I had to get this out there so people are aware and so hopefully management can help clean this place up. When we first walked in, the restaurant was a disaster, there was food and trash all over the floor. From the front door, through out the entire dining area. There were a ton of empty tables that had not been bused, with split drinks, food and trash all over. The place was basically empty so it looked like the staff was just lazy and was not ready to clean up yet. When we sat down I could see right into the kitchen. They had about a dozen or more pancakes sitting out on plates on their counter, just sitting there. I then watched the manager drop a towel on the floor by accident in the kitchen, then continued to wipe down the counter with the same towel. This made me cringe for I could see how dirty the floor was and then I watched a server prep food to go out to a table on the same counter he just contaminated. The staff ran around yelling at each other as if we were at a party, not a restaurant, they were yelling jokes back and forth, yelling for people to find other people and saying things like \"Ya I just ripped my finger nail off finally!\" I don't want to hear that from people handling my food! Yikes! I ran to the bathroom to wash my hands and almost tripped over the \"wet floor\" sign. The bathrooms were just as dirty if not even dirtier than the restaurant. We went ahead and stayed since we already ordered our food before we saw everything above. When our food came out I saw a different server grab our food, grab the sitting out pancakes and head our way. He said \"Here you go, we went ahead and gave you a 3 stack since we have all these pancakes sitting out and need to get rid of them!\" Why do I want to eat food that has been sitting out for god knows how long. I'snt all of our food supposed to be made fresh! If its not why are you telling the customer that?Ugh...... I cut into the pancakes and they were definitely stale and hard. I was too nervous to eat any of my food. My fiance on the other hand said \"I'm a Marine I have eaten worse\" so he went ahead and ate. I let the server know of my concerns and she assured me that it was safe to eat and they are always siting out, but I just couldn't. You can tell this specific location is lacking management and I am surprised they pass their inspections. Eat with caution here people!!!"}
{"text":"The IHOP is another one of those places that I just don't get, and I don't really understand why, because I make pancakes frequently enough at home.  They have a decent menu and all - in fact it's pretty hefty.  But I can sit there and page through it time and time again without being able to really find something that I crave.  So I end up ordering something that I don't care for, then I get something I don't care for, and eat something I don't really want, and end up unhappy.

The good news about this particular location is that the staff is nice, but the bad news is that the service can be really, really bad.  Most IHOP locations will have a line at the popular times - usually on Sundays after breakfast.  But this one has a line all the time, even when the restaurant isn't full.  Even if you should get a table, you'll end up waiting.

Servers will often keep your glasses full, but that's about it - and don't plan on talking to a manager about it, because they will do everything they can to avoid you.  We watched the table across the divider from us ask - over and over again - if they could speak to the manager.  This went on for probably half an hour, and as soon as they gave up and left, the manager came out.  It was pretty bad.

The quality of the food is good enough (if you can find something you like), it's just that the service here is pretty bad."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service! I ordered a breakfast sampler. YUMM! BURP! Then I was craving for something sweet. Ordered banana nutella crepe. Too full to get it in my belly so i asked for it for to go....

Got home and I was so excited to eat it... but.. It barely has nutella on it. :'( Bleh. I guess next time I would ask for \"extra nutella\" please. :)) 


3.5 stars all in all!"}
{"text":"The food was really good as always our waiter was very genuine and friendly; his name was Donald. But however, there were some flaws, our waiter made too many orange juices and charged us for it! You just don't do that. Next one of the cheese melts wasn't melted all the way and lastly the iced tea was kind of bad, overall this restaurant is very slow it took them approximately an hour to sit us down because the hostess does not know how to accommodate the tables."}
{"text":"I guess this won't really be a fair review since I came in for the free pancakes on National Pancake Day or whatever it's called. 

Of course I had the stack of pancakes which were pretty good. I ordered a bunch of sides (ie. Sausages, bacon, and hashbrowns). The sausages and bacon were mediocre and pretty greasy. I told them I wanted the hashbrowns crispy and they were borderline burnt. 

Our server was nice though so I felt bad and didn't want to complain. Plus, he was probably already drained from the other table that he was serving -- they kept asking for more pancakes but didn't have the money to buy anymore. 

The service was good but the food was mediocre. I'm hoping that it's just because of how busy they were."}
{"text":"Quick, efficient service 
Waitresses constantly walking around ensuring good customer service"}
{"text":"Unimpressed.  It's a new location so I'm being generous with my rating, but it wasn't a good experience from the beginning.  A dying bug greeted us at the front door. Ugh!  No human in sight to greet us, which gave me time to notice the stains on the carpet and the straw wrappers that no one bothered to pick up.   You'd think they would take a bit more pride in a new store.  Once finally seated we received menus that had dried on food on the back.  Really?  No one took three minutes to wipe down the menus?  And it's not real busy - not that being busy would be an excuse for uncleanliness in a restaurant.  Our server Ryan is very attentive and sweet.  It's unfortunate that the place hasn't been better cared for considering how new it is."}
{"text":"The last time and this time sat at a table for over 10 minutes with no server. Last time they gave the excuse that the coffee pot was gone. This time I sit here waiting with a coffee pot and still no one. I know this place is new but the service has gotten worse since they opened."}
{"text":"This has got to be the BEST experience we've ever had at an IHOP.  As most IHOP places tend to be, they were packed with people waiting to be seated. My husband and I, were thinking that we were easily going to be waiting a half-hour, if not more. So wasn't I surprised when I put my name in, and the nice lady said, \"Okay it'll be about 5-10 minutes\" I was thinking how is that possible with so many people waiting to be seated? Well here it was about 10 minutes later, and they called our name!! WOW!!! We were seated, and our nice server (forgot his name ) was at our table taking our drink order. Drinks were promptly served and within minutes, he took our order.  And minutes after that, our food was served hot and delicious and all correct!! Another WOW moment! As we sat eating our food, we observed everyone from the managers, to the bus boys, communicating with each other as to which tables were open, so as to get their guests seated. It was amazing how well oiled this IHOP is, in making sure they get everything and everyone taken care of. At the end of our meal, we had the pleasure of speaking to the Assistant GM, Denise. My husband just had to let her know how impressed we were with everything. She even offered up a nice discount card to come back to this IHOP whenever we make it back to Vegas! She actually took 20% off of our first visit too!!! Talk about phenomenal customer service!! Thank you Denise, and to everyone there who makes this IHOP by far the BEST one ever!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I stopped by this IHOP was because my mom was craving pancakes after her doctor's appointment. Usually, I'm not a big IHOP person.

I ordered the Bacon 'N Beef Bacon Cheeseburger because the thought of bacon IN the hamburger patty made squeal with glee. But when it arrived, I couldn't taste the bacon in the patty at all. Perhaps it was the fact the bacon on top overpowered the bacon in the patty... but it wasn't all I hoped. The fries were decent.

Mom seemed happy with her pancakes and eggs. So I suppose it wasn't a total bust.

I feel the need to add that we had the most amazing waitress here, though. Really. She was a lot of fun and ended up hovering over our table to play a quick game of key chain Boggle. :)

But yeah... IHOP isn't my favourite place to eat."}
{"text":"The whole service was awful! We got seated and it took about 15 min to get our drinks ordered, then they had the dishwasher, chef, waiters and the manager all taking orders. When the food was delivered about 30 min later one of our orders was wrong and the other was burnt also the table next to us had the same issue. And in the end when we went to pay they didn't have change so they asked myself if I had change for a dollar and when I said no the poor waitress had to use her own tips to give out change to the customers! Never again will I go there"}
{"text":"I've tried very hard at liking this location. But I cannot. I went with my mom the first time after being very disappointed with the customer service she immediately didn't like the restaurant. I decided to give it a second chance. I went in with my family ready for breakfast. We were immediately seated which was great and guaranteed considering it wasn't busy at all. After we seated it took about 15 minutes before our waitress Kat came to get our drink orders. And then another 20 to come back and give us our drinks. She took our order. And we didn't see her again for another 30-40 minutes. And that was with our food. When we got our food my sisters grilled cheese looked as if it was thrown in the microwave to warm up the cheese. The cheese was visibly not cooked. My brothers Mac n cheese was absolutely disgusting. Which was disappointing because I like IHOP's Mac n cheese. And then my fiancé's food was cold. My food was hot but my hash browns looked as if it was the crumbs of all the orders before mine. When we finally collected the bill I noticed that Kat had charged us 2 large drinks when we had ordered 2 meals from the kids meal. When I pointed it out to her she said well yeah it's because they're large cups. Well I know that but what I was wondering why she gave us the large cups to begin with when we didn't ask for them. Throughout our entire breakfast which lasted about an hour and 15 or so we saw Kat about 3 or 4 times. Considering they work for tips this was by far the worst customer service I have ever received. I know what it's like working in food. It can definitely be hard especially if you're under staffed but when the employees have a bad attitude over something customers have no control over if not okay. I understand this location is new but they need to fix their customer service. Never been so disappointed to go to an IHOP."}
{"text":"Best experience I've ever had at an IHOP. Visited on a Tuesday morning. The place was clean and quiet. Pleasant staff. Our server Melissa was great; she has a peaceful spirit that seemed to put her whole section at ease. Plenty of smiles with my pancakes this morning. :)"}
{"text":"I would never take my family here for breakfast again we always sit in a booth we were waiting for are food and when my two year old had showed me what was in his hand it was macaroni which we never ordered i look in the corner of the booth seat and there was a bunch of macaroni which my son had got all over his shorts the service is slow and they never even came to check on us after we got are food and it took over 20 minutes to place a to go order for a small side salad"}
{"text":"Late Night on the way to Vegas.  I was surprised that all of the food establishments in Jean are now premium with pricing like at the Airport.

2 stars for price, since I still equate Jean, NV with Vegas for food pricing.
5 stars for the service level, quality of the food and friendly staff during my dinner."}
{"text":"Used to go to one closer, but this IHOP is alot better. Good sevice, they know how to correctly cook eggs over-medium (no runny whites), manager Shane is amazing and very upbeat. Restaurant itself is very open and airy with nice window light. Think I've had maybe 1 server I didn't care for, but other servers are friendly and nice."}
{"text":"This review is NOT directed towards the morning crew. I  go here often and their always very friendly fast and food is just right. The store manager is always walking around making sure everything is running smoothly!! 

the night crew around 8pm is the worst. Very short staffed and literally only leave the kitchen when they are going to place an order or delivering food. They had a trainee in the front desk who was sitting people literally asking if people needed drinks filled because she was the only one on the floor everyone was in the back kitchen. (At least she was doing a good job) but it is not her job to fill drinks. After waiting 12 minutes to finally have a waitress ask if we were ready to order. We waited another 30 minutes to have our food deliver and everything was extra crispy golden brown NOT burnt but defiantly darker than usual. After waiting for 45 minutes all together we decided to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"OMG can I please get a refill  on my  soda !!!!!!!! 40 fucking minutes I still don't have a refill on my soda it is so busy in here I got it waitresses walking by me at all times nobody can stop the waiters staff is very an intensive they're too busy talking with each other and said serving the customers"}
{"text":"We were seated fairly quickly, and received drinks shortly after. But then it took almost an hour to receive the food. It was not that busy in there when we first got there, but within 30 minutes the place was packed with people waiting to be seated. Overall the service could have been better but was not the worst experience."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here on June 3, 2018.  Food quality was great and service even better.  Keep up the good work Annie K. :)"}
{"text":"Had one of the worst take out experiences a couple months ago at this location but didn't put a review on here bc the food was excellent however this time was inexcusable. As soon as we got seated there were 11 tables seated with no food so I knew the wait for food was going to be long. Ordered an omelette with no cheese and it came slathered in cheese. They remade it and failed to bring back the salsa they took with it. The omelette was not good very odd texture. My side of pancakes were not good as well the top of her pancakes were actually hard. How can you screw up such easy breakfast food ? The pancake syrup was empty too not sure how these items are not checked prior to sitting people. We won't be back. The people sitting behind us are having issues as well unbelievable."}
{"text":"Parking: a few in front, more on the side
AC: good
Lighting: bright
Inside: clean
Service: 1 server, seated fast, order taken fast, food out fast, hot. Only 5 other tables occupied. Refilled drinks timely. Good service. @930pm Monday.
Prices: like Hawaii

Banana Nutella Crapes: freash banana, hot, not enough nutella, crape batter (i am not impressed) will not get that from here next time.

Sirloin steak tips, mash, garlic bread:
hot, smells good, box mash not bad, can corn with butter not bad,  steak is too sweet,  not as chewy as i thought it would be. Will not order this again."}
{"text":"The owner asked us to come back and give them another shot, ON HIM.  We did just that.  No one knew who we were or that our meals would be free, and the service was impeccable.  We have eaten here several times since."}
{"text":"My son and I went there today for breakfast at a time that was not particularly busy. We got seated within a minute of arriving and promptly placed our order. Our service after that just got worse. Half of my sons breakfast came out and my entire breakfast came out. When I asked our server to bring us some ketchup, it took him nine minutes. At that time we still had not received my son's waffles, or the refill on his Coke. I also then had to request hot sauce. That took another couple of minutes. While I waited for the ketchup and the hot sauce my breakfast, as you can imagine was barely room temperature.  We have eaten at several IHOP's all around the world, and we live here in Las Vegas. I have to say that I will not be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"The food here is good - that's always the most important thing. But my boyfriend and I avoid this place as much as we can only because of the customer service and crowded atmosphere. It's incredibly loud in there. I've always experienced a wait to be seated, usually without any visible reason. Finally, the service is very slow - it takes forever for the food to come out, it takes forever for drink refills, and it takes forever to get your check. Good for late-night munchies, but I don't recommend it for a nice breakfast out."}
{"text":"One star is for the server who was okay. Food was awful. 

There was no wait when we came in yet we still waited for our server for 10 minutes to visit our table for drinks. When our food FINALLY came out after another 20 minutes all of my food was cold: the over easy eggs, hash browns, bacons, especially the toast, and blueberry pancakes. The only thing making this breakfast tolerable was the warm syrup which heated my pancakes. 

I don't send food back in restaurants. Thoroughly disappointed and mad. Review on their receipt to follow as well."}
{"text":"I ordered the rooty tooty breakfast, which was good. Service was fast. Drinks are overpriced. Coffee was $2.19 and OJ was $2.79. Half the coat of our meal was drinks."}
{"text":"This place a great. This was my second time coming to IHOP and I had really good experiences here. The service was pretty good. The food tasted great. They have different types of syrup flavors for pancakes that include blueberry which is probably the best lol, butter pecan, strawberry and old fashion. The price is very cheap here, I ordered the chicken and waffles and chocolate chip pancakes and it's came out to around 14$. Overall this is a great place to just stop buy and relax."}
{"text":"Silverware wasn't up to snuff, SOMETHING  floating in the juice.  Service was good, but without quality you won't get anywhere.  Just dropped the drinks in one corner of the table. It was busy, but you gotta get the details right!!!!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about 24hr breakfast!!!! This place is new so already it's nice,clean, and vibrant.  I came during negotiations off goes so didn't have to deal with the ridiculous crowds during peak mornings.  

Ordered a simple breakfast with eggs and buttermilk pancakes. Just your standard stuff and it hit the spot. Nothing outrageous just breakfast for when your craving it at 10pm or early morning.  

Staff was very friendly from the greeter to the waitress."}
{"text":"The smell as you walk up was so gross! I thought it was sewer outside, but ended up throughout the restaurant. Smelled like old nasty mop that molded. 
I tried to get my family to leave & go somewhere else, but they were convinced the smell was not going to be in the eating area. Well, it was. I hoped the closer we were to the kitchen, the stronger the food smell would be and it would cancel it out. Only after coffee came was I able to be comfortable about eating there. 
The food was great! Service marginal. Waitress never brought us waters that we requested, nor the cup for my husband to have coffee. I could see she was busy and we understand that part. Plus she took extra coffee off, so no big!
As we walked 2 steps away from table...the smell again. Ugh!
Lastly, the restroom was deplorable. Paper all over floor, gummy soap dropping back towards the mirror showed it hadn't been touched for hours. Paper towels weren't put into dispenser correctly, so big chunks of clean paper towels were everywhere. 
All in all, I highly recommend either take out or skipping this location until they choose to clean properly or replace the nasty smelling floors."}
{"text":"Service is awful most of the time. Food is also subpar at best. I'm done coming to Ihop forever. There are some many great mom and pop breakfast restaurants idk why I keep giving Ihop chances"}
{"text":"Being Lent - I ordered a grill cheese - worse grill cheese ever - the cheese should be melting throughout - my was not. The fruit was unfortunately also sad....."}
{"text":"As always this brand consistently delivers.  My server Mauricio was there to please. The best brand to sample when u want solid food and consistent service. Hats off to this brand which knows how to satisfy customer needs."}
{"text":"Great food and service! The staff is friendly and quick. The service is great and consistent, besides a few hiccups which is expected when it's busy. This location is always busy when I dine in but the servers are attentive. Overall very satisfied."}
{"text":"Just have to rave about great service at this IHOP recently. We dropped in for a late dinner (9:00 ish) and were the only ones in the place.  Some road construction nearby made it difficult to get to this parking lot but we managed.  I believe our waiter's name was Jacob.  He was professional, pleasant, efficient and he took our order in WRITING - and delivered exactly what we requested.  What more can you ask?

IHOP is IHOP - on this night, it fit the bill and this young man renewed my faith in good service.  Keep up the good work!  People will notice."}
{"text":"This location is 24hours the best days to eat is Monday-Thursday. Friday-Sunday is a hit and miss when it comes to the quality/freshness of the food. Management changes frequently if it wasn't for the servers and their good customer service,I would give this location 1 star. Would, I recommend this place to my friends and family? It depends on the day ;)"}
{"text":"My family and I went in for a quick dinner 
and found Laurie waiting tables, bussing tables & the cashier. Did I mention she was by herself . That is right she was all alone in there doing everything. The whole time she had a smile on her face and if she was discouraged  being the only one worker there she didn't show it . She was professional and personal."}
{"text":"\"Well, it's not called International House of Crepes.\"  This is how I talked my Dad out of making a huge mistake at the i-Hop.  And I took a cool photo of the pancakes with Boysenberry syrup.  Not a bad i-Hop, but let's face it, i-Hop is no Waffle House."}
{"text":"Finally doing a review on IHOP. My husband and I come here every once in a while at night when we want something fattening lol 

[Food]
Syrups: I love that they have four different syrups, strawberry, butter pecan, blueberry, & old fashioned.

Stuffed French Toast: this is my favorite menu item :)

Cinnamon Pancakes: tasted like a cinnabun, but sweeter. Too sweet. WAY too sweet. Straight sugar might taste like this. Can hardly eat it, after about a third of the small cake I was done. :(

[Service]
The servers at night are very nice but occasionally they are no where to be found."}
{"text":"Regular retail price $20. Paid $12. Signed up for the IHOP email club and they sent me a free full stack of Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity pancakes- there was some confusion with our order but that's what the coupon was for and that's what was taken off our bill despite what's shown here.

The reason I gave this place three stars instead of four was because it had a weird/bad smell like the bathroom had overflowed recently. Had the host not greeted us so quickly we would have just left, but it would have bern awkward to explain."}
{"text":"Bad experience, hoping it was isolated: Came here later in the evening on a weeknight so no long waits.. hold on, it was the opposite of too many people waiting to be seated. We walked in and nobody was up front seating customers. There was a couple waiting to be checked out and pay as well. Finally, I noticed, the employee that was outside who saw us walk in, came inside after about 5 minutes of standing there. If you see customers walk in, the first reaction is to help or have someone else attend to them. Unfortunately, she also became our server after seating us. Maybe their operations is: whomever comes up front and seats the next guests becomes yours to serve. Then we made the mistake of asking her to give us \"just one more minute\" to order, and it felt like she forgot about us as I had to wave her down nearly 10 minutes later.

The food was fine, but there's no excuse for the level of service we got with hardly many customers inside. Even with so many servers that night, the ratio was like 2 tables to each. Only reason I'll return is that it seems cleaner than other IHOPs I've been to in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The only reason I give 2 stars to this place is because without today \"incident\", I would have rated the place 4 stars.
Today, I only ordered a coffee and a glass of water, informing the waitress \"Jasmine\" that I would be ordering food if my friend makes it.
I was brought the coffee pot, a cup and creamer, in a winkle, and she left before I was able to remind her about the glass of water.
I asked again 5 minutes later: she smiled and said ok

\"Live\": 10 minutes later, still no water, but she has been spoiling the table besides me (they are all eating, and it's going to be, hopefully for her, a nice tip...).

I am speaking with my father on the phone in French...Did the accent \"bother\" her, as I have been surprised about how many ignorant and racist people, who dislike arabic people, confuse the french and the arabic accent? But this is just a personal and subjective guess, which might be totally inaccurate.
Maybe she just doesn't care because, for a cup of coffee, she is not expecting a tip.

I would have prefered a rude waitress and getting what I (politely) ordered.
I was thinking to eat something by myself, useless to say I will go somewhere else.
5 min later, the Manager checked every table and I smiled, but didn't ask for water, to see if Employee \"Jasmine\" was going to bring me water.

Update! Jasmine just dropped the bill, and I said thank you and didn't even bother to look at her, giving back the same kind of respect.

My table neighboors just asked for water, let's see if she brings it...
Yeah, they got it! And 2 glasses. Consequently, I will not eat here, but I still will give a tip for the guy who prepared the coffee and will wash the cup.

On my way out, I shall try to get some water!!!

Au Revoir!"}
{"text":"Food was great but service was terrible. My family and I arrived a sat down in the waiting area and waited for about 10 minutes with different waitresses passing by us many times and not saying anything and It was not packed whatsoever. Once we were seated and were served our food we noticed we didn't have any cutlery so we asked a waitress if she could please get us some and she came back with two forks and gave them to us, in my opinion completely unsanitary since most of the time you receive the fork, knife and spoon wrapped in a napkin. Our waitress never came back to see if we needed anything else or see how we were doing. We were sat by the kitchen and saw a waitress on her phone multiple times. The staff doesn't seem to like their job no smiles nor greetings during our stay."}
{"text":"VERY GOOD SERVICE!! VERY CLEAN!! 
The manager came to ask how our food was, I think his name was Johnny was very nice and polite. Super friendly staff!!!"}
{"text":"\"its not pee\" -mom shrieks! 
a family reunion. 
RVs in the lot... 

     Sunday at the Steelyard IHOP is quite the experience. Upon entering, before the hostess could even say hello, a sign was given to me that I (unfortunately) chose to ignore.     

     \"Its not pee!\" announces mom #1 to the entire waiting area. Her child -with pee all ovwer her politely disagreed. Then Mom #2 got involved.  \"PEE !! It IS PEE\"!!! she shrieks, followed by  -\"No its not PEE\"!!! from mom #1. This was quite the spectacular entrance.

 I also saw:
2 full blown plumber's cracks. On women. 
1 ten year old morbidly obese boy drink a liter of Coke and inhale stacks upon stacks of pancakes while mom's cell phone never left her ear. I think his dad and him had a pig-out contest. 
Piles of bleach blond hair piled on dark roots and assorted weaves. It was worthy of a photo series called \"The people of IHOP - when Walmart just won't do\". 

The syrup containers were worthy of a hazmat suit just to handle them. I hoped that wasn't the PEE that was the topic of conversation. Our waitress was fine, but the one that brought the food to the table had her big, fat thumb on the plates. It appeared that she just rebuilt her tranny before coming to work, judging from the black sludge under her nails. 

On the upside, the food spectacularly leaves your digestive tract within an hour, so make sure it is not a long drive home. 
The floor manager was a clone of Uncle Rico from Napolean Dynamite.
IHOP: You nasty, nasty place. Nope, nope, nope...

Carry on."}
{"text":"There super speedy with their service, food is decent... For iHop, although my hash browns were burnt. I always order the stuffed French toast combo. Staff is fair... Ehhhhh."}
{"text":"We came in to eat last night on 6-25-18. If I could rate this a 0 I would... had a terrible experience there late last night about 1am. It took us about 30 mins to get three drinks for our table. The manager came out to help with a messed up to go order and then she ran back in the back with a young man, leaving the waitress out there by herself to deal with everything. The waitress had no idea how to handle her 4 tables there. When we finally got our food after about an hour of being there my friends omelet was missing mushrooms and her hash browns and toast never came... our omelets looked burnt and my waffle was super hard. I had specifically asked for \"no onions\" and mentioned it's because I'm allergic to them and when I bit into my omelet I found onions. I was so upset because I work at a restaurant and I know when someone has a food allergy our staff and cooks take care of it best we can and cook it no where near where onions are. I don't know who's mistake it was but we were very frustrated after being there for an hour and 45 mins. When we asked to speak to the manager and the waitress went in the back and came out and apologized and said the food was on them... like we were going to eat it. Let alone pay for that! I was very upset that the manager never came out and addressed the mistake with the onions that caused me to get hives shortly after eating them. Very unprofessional on her part. Just terrible experience overall."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends this morning; you can always count on a long wait on a Sunday morning. Our server was wonderful and attentive, even with how busy it was. He was prompt and brought out everything we requested right away. Our food was a bit slow to come to our table....35-40 minutes after ordering, I think. It was your standard IHOP fare, but I really appreciate that it has \"Simple and Fit\" menu items that are healthy but still very tasty, and it shows you the nutritional info. If I want a really dynamite breakfast I will not come here, but it is a good place that you can always count on to be good."}
{"text":"Worst ihop ever they ruined 3 of 5 orders. Made my 7 month pregnant gf wait for 45 minutes to get food that was edible and then the manager Sara was to scared to come tell us we were only getting a 20 percent discount.  They then threatened to call the police on us when we refused to pay for the portion of the meal we werent happy with. We are now in the parking lot waiting for the police to arrive.  Food was sub par even when it was correct."}
{"text":"This restaurant chain is great for a breakfast fix, however, this location had bad customer service. Other locations in Vegas had great customer service and didn't mind switching out items (diced potatoes vs hash browns), but this location charges extra for any adjustments to the menu. Overall, food was good and served relatively fast. Location was clean, also a plus. Will not return, though, due to no order flexibility."}
{"text":"I have been at this place several times, like any other IHOP they are always busy! But the great thing about this location is that they always seem to accommodate everyone within 10 min , which is a great thing when your hungry and really to eat some really good food! 
The waitresses are always friendly an nice ! The food is always as i ordered it! 
I have been there several times and every time i feel welcomed and amazed with how friendly the staff is! What i really liked was that the manager took time out of her schedule and went around and asked the costumers if everything was fine! Of course i said yes! And she said \"well thank you for coming in have a great day\"  ! 
I have been to other IHop's down in Phoenix and some of the hostesses and waitresses make me ask myself its a miracle that they have a job!  But anyways i truly recommend this place to anyone that wants good and delicious breakfast! 
2 thumbs up, or better said 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I will NOT return to this IHOP, ever. It was my first time going this morning and I was ordering a to go order. I got there at about 845, BEFORE the breakfast rush. I didn't have a complicated order, a pancake combo and a ham and egg melt. There were a couple other to go orders that came AFTER me, but of course their order came out before mine. I asked one of the receptionists after being quit annoyed when my order was going to be ready, but she began talking to another customer and told me \"I'll check\" after she talked to the customer. After about 45 minutes, my order finally came out. I didn't get a \"sorry for the wait\" or anything like that. Just told me the price. Mind you I ordered a pancake combo and had to ask for syrup, I didn't even get butter either. I got home, less than a 10 minute drive, and my food was not even remotely warm. All of it was cold. And to top of my horrible experience, I didn't even get any silverware. LOL not returning here and recommending nobody EVER eats here."}
{"text":"This place does not even deserve one star. The place was dirty and the service stunk."}
{"text":"Food was so-so.
Service was ok
Waitress charged one of our breakfast orders as all side orders which cost an extra $13 over the menu price but I was in too much of a hurry to make a fuss."}
{"text":"Paul our waiter was FANTASTIC, great southern hospitality. He went above and beyond what most waiter/waitress at IHOP do. Strawberry and banana pancakes were pretty awesome too!"}
{"text":"absolutely filthy. the sullen, zombielike boy cleaning the outdoor tables came out no more than four times, staring at the dirty table next to ours, moved some things around, went back inside carrying nothing with him, came back out repeated the whole process, this went on for about thirty minutes before it occurred to him that he might want to actually prepare the table for the next guests. the chairs were covered with bird excrement, when i asked the young man to wipe off the chairs and not worry about our table, he looked at me with total confusion. the bathrooms were disgusting, i don't want to think about what the food prep area looked like. everything tasted ok and none of us are in the hospital with food poisoning, so i think we all dodged that bullet. it's an ihop, don't go in expecting a lot in the way of food and you won't come out disappointed. the two hostesses and our waitress, erma, were all excellent. very nice, prompt, attentive, had it totally together. unfortunately the place is so filthy we won't be going back again and the health dept. should probably pay a little visit in the not - so - distant future."}
{"text":"Pretty polular chain. The service is usualy pretty good here, I've had more positive experiences than not.

 I usuay get grilled cheese with hash browns nearly everytime I go there, even in the evenings. I love the way the bread is crispy and the cheese is melted. One time I came here the sanwich looked as though the put the cheese in between, then put it on the grill for a few seconds and took it off. The cheese wasn't melted at all. I asked the lady if the cheese can be melted more and she replied \"that's how we always make them, but I'll have them melt it more.\" I've been there enough times to know that is not the case. When my plate came back the whole thing was hot. She put the whole plate in the microwave. Not only did she put it in the microwave, she put it in there too long. The cheese was like rubber. And the bread didnt taste good. 
Something else I like to get are the cheese sticks. They're really good when the cheese is perfectly melted on the inside. You have to eat them while they're hot. I use ranch and marinara dipping sauces. 

Other than that incident, the service is good. The food is good. Overall its a good place to just come, eat and converse with others. Or come have some alone time and eat, read the paper whatever."}
{"text":"Another 1-star review for this IHOP.
After we were seated, 5 minutes went by until a waitress came by to tell us she'll be with us shortly. Then a couple minutes later she takes our order. 10 minutes after that our drinks come. 20 minutes after that, some of our food comes with one dish missing. Then waitress comes and says the cooks screwed up and just started making the entree (veggie omelette, hold the tomatoes and mushrooms). As the rest of our family finishes half their breakfast, the veggie omelette comes to our table WRONG: with tomatoes... And no side fruit. Just the measly omelette with half the plate bare. $11.99 for that? 10 minutes later, the order comes correct to our table... And waitress realizes that the fruit side was given to another order and they forgot to include pancakes on another order on the table.
To sum it up, the meal was not worth the price even with the manager comp'ing the wrong entree. 
Denny's a block away would've been a better deal."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch, ordered the waffle with strawberries and cream and 2 scrambled eggs with bacon. I hate the vanilla whipped cream that they have added. It's too sweet. The food took For-ever to come out so annoying. The server said there was only one cook in the kitchen. My sister ordered the french toast combo that came with hash brows-worst hash browns ever. They tasted like an old dirty freezer. It was my sister's birthday and she wanted to come here, other wise I will avoid this location."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice in one week.  They have a senior menu for Pops and when you can get 2 eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes and hash browns for less than $6.00 it is a great deal for seniors.  I wish they had more of a lunch selection but hey  they are known for their pancakes.  There new salad with chicken, oranges and pecans is pretty good and is a pretty big size.  Nice friendly staff and pretty good salad."}
{"text":"It opened recently and most of the staff has no experience. They have a long way to go but they were very receptive to input on improving their skills. It's not hopeless here so be patient and give them a second chance. I know I will."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend came for breakfast on her birthday and when we got the water to drink and it was something flowing inside of it"}
{"text":"The place was very slow when I went on a Wednesday night. Although, Veronika was absolutely wonderful. She did a great job and is an exceptional employee!"}
{"text":"Great fast service not busy on Tuesday morning. Great tasting seasonal menu. Eggnog pancakes were light and fluffy with eggnog cream. Really good. Crispy bacon. And toasted marshmallow hot chocolate yummy. Hubby steak cooked just right"}
{"text":"Very typical IHOP. Nothing special. There seems to be a turnover of employees because I never see anyone twice.
Standard menu  standard food
Very heavy on carbs. Big pancakes and you can get them with everything  and covered with sugary fruit 
I get the bacon and eggs and that's pretty hard to mess up. They are always over medium and warm. 
I like that you can have a carafe of coffee and serve yourself so you don't have to wait for a server
Paying at the register makes it faster ,too
I find the servers and register employee workmanlike but not friendly. Just doing a job
I wish there was a better breakfast place in town"}
{"text":"IHOP is one of my favorites, but they weren't open when advertised. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here Friday night, food wasn't cooked, and it took 15 minutes just to get drinks. There we three parties at three tables and one server. He apologized that it was late because he was 'slammed'. It was really really frustrating. I asked for my food to be heated up, they took it away and the waiter forgot about my food and didn't bring it back for 15 minutes. I told him I didn't want my food anymore and didn't want to pay for it, yet he brought it out to me and gave me extra to make up for his mistake. I still had to pay for my food despite making it clear that I didn't want my food after all the hassle. It was honestly the worst experience ever. The waiter even asked me to add him on Snapchat... whilst he was screwing up my meal. DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"So yesterday we went to this IHOP and I have to tell you I was so waiting on long wait and even longer serving times. Much to my surprise it was my best visit ever. Wait time was long but expected it was 9am on Saturday morning I knew what I was in for. Now the surprise I have been here many times and wait time to get food had made me irritated on several occasions. I was served by a nice young man and received my meal faster than I have ever had in all my previous visits. The food was extremely tasty. I just wanted to say what ever has changed to make this franchise better I give a big thumbs up. Thank you wait staff, cooks and management. Yummy."}
{"text":"On my trip here on Sept 4, the service was subpar. The \"check out attendant\" was extremely rude. The only good thing about the trip was the food. IHOP, please tell your people what industry that they're in. If they do not believe it is part of their jobs to provide quality service, they should probably go work else where."}
{"text":"It is the worst customer service ever! The women in the night shift take forever to come take your order. It seems like they don't want to be their acting all snobby and apathetic. The coffee was cold and when I told them it was cold she got an attitude and didn't come back for 10min. Overall wouldn't recommend or would go back"}
{"text":"This IHOP is excellent because of May!!! She makes the trip 100% worth it because she treats you like family and makes you feel at home! She always goes above and beyond! 
Do yourself a favor and go see May!!!"}
{"text":"I have once, in 6 years, received good service here. Usually it's adequate to poor. The last time I complained to the manager on duty about the 'terrible' service, she brushed me off & handed me a coupon that another customer had just redeemed. I noticed later that it expired the very next day. The apathy evident in the employees can't be their fault... they're only copying their manager.

The food is the standard IHOP fare, pancakes, french toast, eggs, etc... nothing to write home about. I'd happily never grace their premises with my presence again, except my son loves the chocolate funny face pancakes.

Grit your teeth as you pass through the door, and be prepared to wait. Hopefully they'll get your order correct the first time, and your drinks won't sit empty for 15 minutes or more."}
{"text":"There was many chairs and booths open, but the wait time for everyone who entered was 30 min"}
{"text":"Even though my parents are considered regulars there I feel that the customer service is great. The manager always greets everyone and interacts with all customers and food is always great. I can see why my parents love coming here"}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast my family and me we came here and the service was excellente the guy who service us was excellente person his name Ernesto he is la neta tanks for the service"}
{"text":"My visit was yesterday I decided to go with my husband and our two daughters. Well to start off the waitress looked like she had a cold and was very rude probably because she didn't want to work that day. Anyway it took 15 minutes for her to bring our drinks none of them had ice and they were at room temperature and we ordered different types of drinks and she didn't leave straws for the rest of the drinks. When my husband got up to get the straws for himself the manager caught his attention and when my husband complained about the waitresses bad service and poor attitude the \"manager\" just lifted her eyebrows and said \"well nobody else has a problem.\" That's when I told her well we do and we are paying for our meals and we expect good quality service. The only reason I stayed was because my two daughters were eating very comfortable. When I was eating my table I asked for Texas Pete and A1 sauce and they both had other people sticky finger prints on them that is disgusting that they are not cleaned before giving them to the next customer. The table they set us at was right next to a dirty table full of dishes that for the whole hour and a half we were there was left like that and when she picked up our dirty plates that's the table she placed an ad and continued about her business. When my T-bone steak was served the waitress was breathing through her mouth the whole time and all her breath went on my food which is why I threw it away because I felt if I said something the manager was going to say the same thing that nobody else has a problem so I put it in a plastic bag and disposed of it in their bathroom paid my bill and left no tip whatsoever I will not be coming back here they have really bad customer service it was a manager can't be nice to customers who are nice to her then she shouldn't be in business if she can't be polite. I will rather eat at dinos on Sugar Creek before coming to this piece of crap again!"}
{"text":"I wanted stuffed French toast. So we went to our closest IHOP. It's 10 pm, but the restaurant looks to be fairly popular at this time. Not super busy but definitely steady. We are greeted by a guy in a T-shirt, basketball shorts, and sandals with socks?... Is it like, casual Wednesday at IHOP? He seats us. And then we waited. And waited. We are in a corner but we see two waiters pass by without even looking at us. Nobody even took drink orders. We waited HALF AN HOUR for someone to talk to us. Eventually we left and went to blueberry hill instead. Sucks cause I wanted stuffed French toast."}
{"text":"We have always had bad experiences at IHOP. It doesn't matter at what town or at what time we've gone. In fact, I wrote a scathing review for the IHOP next to our house. But this IHOP gives me hope for all IHOPs. We had just gotten back from a long drive from LA. I wanted bacon. Bad. We stopped by at around 11 at night. We were helped by someone named Brenda. I'm not sure how long she's worked there, but she is a PRO. Shes sweet, timely, and great at knowing what you need and when. She seemed confident and very friendly. Especially considering how it was the night shift, I was impressed. Our food was good. It got the job done. But what really makes this place stand out is people like Brenda."}
{"text":"Good food reasonably priced , service is always quick. If your looking for a place to take the family that won't break the bank come here for a casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I took my 10 year old daughter here for breakfast recently on a busy Sunday morning.  The wait was unbearably long (probably around half and hour or so while we were there), but what really got me was their unprofessionalism.  We were sitting on some chairs, waiting to be seated, and an IHOP employee says to me and my daughter, as she grabs our chairs, \"we need these chairs\"!  She practically pulled them out from under us!  There is a more professional way to ask honey!  Moreover, don't you think you should have enough chairs in the first place, given how busy you get on weekends?!  Sheesh!

UPDATE 12/28/15:  Given my last bad experience here, I did NOT want to come back, believe me!  But my daughter LOVES IHOP, and she convinced me to take her there.  I figured that since it's Monday, it would not be as crowded, and it wasn't.  It was moderately busy, with a few tables available.  So imagine my surprise when we walked in, and there were
about 6 people (including us) standing there for what seemed to be a long time, waiting for the hostess to come out of hibernation to seat us!  Finally, she did, and she then proceeds to tell us that the wait for food, AFTER she seats us, will be 40 minutes!  You read that correctly folks.  I said FORTY minutes!  Even my 10 year old daughter agreed that we should just go across the street to Panera's, since a 40 minute wait for breakfast in unheard of!  This place should be ashamed of themselves for being unprofessional and inefficient, as they are driving customers away and harming the IHOP brand!  NEVER again!  Downgraded to a one star."}
{"text":"The service is terrible.  The Black server women seem Racist towards the White people.   I was in a party of 2 total and we were up THEN 3 black people came in behind us THEN the Black server lady flagged them and told them \"Oh i can help you come this way\"  and seated them!  Then there were 3 open large tables.  Our black server told us there were no servers available for that area so we couldn't sit there So we got sat at a small table THEN we watched the black server seat a Single black person at a Large Table by them selves Twice! !! THEN it took 45 minutes to get our breakfast.   Then the black waitress took my empty drinking glass AND never even brought me another drink after taking my whole glass!!!  This place is Racist & has Terrible Service! !!!"}
{"text":"Hosts do not know how to seat guest in a timely manner nor in the order that people arrive in. 3-4 parties that came in after us were seated before us. When we asked what the deal was they caught attitude instead of cutting the excuses and just getting us seated. We were a party of 6 with 1 baby (high chair) and the party of 5 that came if right after us was being seated. They are absolutely no help and have no manners towards their customers. Ended up walking out and going to another IHOP where we were acknowledged and seated almost immediately upon arrival. 

They need a better seating system!!!!"}
{"text":"Many tasty choice. The manager's special was a lot of food for only $7.99! They always keep fresh, hot coffee in a carafe at your table.

Berto was very friendly and courteous. He anticipated our every need and kept our table clean and cleared!"}
{"text":"Dismal is the word that comes to mind. Remodeled the building but obviously forgot to invest any time in training staff."}
{"text":"There was a big sign in the window help wanted. Then I walked in it was all guys.
Then I understood the sign in the window. The guy's were running every were. Dishes on 
Every other table. And b4 I was seated the guy had 2 wipe the table down. I had pumpkin pancakes 
They didn't have much pumpkin in them. My water glass ran empty and I didn't get a refill. So I'm not going back 
Unless I get a gift card."}
{"text":"I am shocked at all the negative reviews I've read! All I can say is that they must have cleaned up their act here or something because we had a great experience. 

When we walked in there was a line out the door, which I partially expected on a Sunday but this was a HUGE line even for the time of day. Then it hit me... duh.. it's FATHER'S DAY!!! No wonder it's busy. I guess dads like pancakes too. :) 

As we walked in, the hostess told us it'd be about a 10 minute wait. She gave us a card with the name of a sports team on it, and other people had the names of famous people. When your table was ready they called the name on the card. I was sitting there laughing each time a name was called. It was very effective and got your attention if your table was ready! \"Gordon Ramsey party of 4 your table is ready! Buzz Lightyear, table for 2 your s is also ready.\".. I think Paula Abdul's name even made an appearance. 

While we waited I hopped on Yelp to scope out the reviews. Then I saw the rating and what people had said about a server named Tekeyah. I was expecting a horrible long wait, slow service  and no refills.  I didn't know what was coming. And, I even thought about leaving to go to another breakfast place nearby. 

We were tight on time, and figured there was probably a wait anywhere so we stayed. Right on the dot about 10 minutes later we were taken to our table, and the server walked up with a smile and greeted us very promptly. Her name? Tekeyah. My boyfriend and I looked at each other across the table and thought uhoh, we're in trouble now.. based on the reviews we had read about her. 

I tell you what, Tekeyah was nothing but nice to us and very attentive. She was slammed with tables and she still managed to come over and keep us updated on the status of our food. The only downfall was that we ordered breakfast potatoes instead of hashbrowns, and we didn't get them until the end of the meal because hashbrowns were brought out instead. In her defense, the eggs benedict is not on the menu so it isn't somthing that normally is requested, and substitutions probably need to be added in the system manually. I've been a server and I can say that things like that sometimes slip your mind when you're dealing with a crowded dining room. When we told her about the potatos she was EXTREMELY apologetic, and very nice. 

I asked her for a refill and got it right away. Tekeyah was very friendly and I would absolutely go back based on how polite she was. After reading the other reviews, I'm thinking perhaps she had a bad day and had other tables who had been horrible to her on a holiday or something similar, before she had served the other reviewers who were unhappy with her service. Who knows, I can only vouch for my experience and I have no complaints. 

I only gave 4 stars because of IHop in general, it's ok... just not my fave."}
{"text":"the staff isnt very friendly and takes forever to even get their attention to get drinks. i had to wait over 20mins just to be greeted and get a drink. never ever go here again."}
{"text":"The service was okay but the bathrooms and the dinning areas where nasty & disgusting"}
{"text":"Bad service, dirty tables and cold food. Won't be returning to this location. Only thing that I lik d was the balloon girl who makes balloons for the kids. I'm a server and this was just not good at all. None of the dirty dishes were prebussed and no courtesy check after 2 min to see if everything was good. May want to retrain staff."}
{"text":"We here yesterday, around 12:00 PM, with my husband and my 4yr old son. Service was okay but the food we horrible. First, I got the French Toast breakfast combo and the hash browns were uneatable. They were so hard, you could probably break a tooth on them and the eggs were overcooked. The only good thing was the soda and the french toast. Won't be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Okay.
So I always receive good service when I come to this location. I like this location because it's located downtown and I am always there and plus I love pancakes. 
However, the food wasn't the problem and the hostess and the servers weren't either. The last time I visited this location was on 8/16, I arrived with a group of friends and our waitress was amaaazing! she was such a sweetheart. The only thing that really bothered me there was the way the Manager at this location was treating the employees. It made my stomach hurt. I witnessed him scolding the employees every time they passed him, it was always something, he just looked so mean. I felt so bad for them. I believe when a manager needs to speak to an employee about what they are doing wrong, it should be private, not discussed anywhere around costumers. He was very unprofessional and  It made me uncomfortable. I left a really good tip for our waitress because she deserved it and so do the rest of the employees there at iHop. No one should be treated/embarrassed like that, ever. 

The 4 stars goes to the hardworking employees, not the manager."}
{"text":"I dislike this place but it's close to my house. The service is poor. It will be at least 5-8 mins before anyone comes to your table. Food is ok. Don't ask for extra ranch because you won't get it."}
{"text":"So I decided to take my son here at 2 PM today, New Year's Day. I figured the rush would mostly be over. There were a total of eight people waiting for tables, four couples including us. We waited for quite some time and so did everyone else even though there was no reason for it. There were empty tables but they were dirty and they weren't cleaning them off in a timely manner. And when the girl was cleaning the tables there was no sense of urgency, if she moved any slower she would have been standing still. No one should have had to wait for 15+ minutes. Then they did not bring us any silverware until they had already brought us our meal. I ordered my bacon crisp and my eggs over medium and I got limo squishy bacon and burnt eggs. I mean the eggs were crispy and brown and I had to send them back. Then my pancakes sat there getting cold so I told them I wanted fresh pancakes to go with my eggs.  A disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times. Always super busy on weekends with wait times. 
Service is moderate. There are areas that need improvement but overall, not too bad. 
Food is average. Nothing I couldn't make at home. Biggest complaint is the coffee is usually old and the scrambled eggs are the fake kind. 
All in all, just your average breakfast place."}
{"text":"We had not been in an Ihop for 10 years or more. Went for breakfast at about 9:20 on Tues. Lots of empty dirty tables.  Hostess wiped off our table with a napkin though stuff still stuck.  After 10 minutes I grabbed a waitress.  We ordered and waited; 30 minutes. Someone who came in 10 minutes after us got their breakfast right away.  Finally breakfast came out luke warm, bacon thickness of paper, \"fresh\" fruit on  rubbery waffles frozen. Coffee was barely warm.  Then we waited to pay the bill.  I finally grabbed some guy and he took it.  Very poorly run and service was very bad.  Hostess was kind of rude.  They obviously do not follow sanitary guidelines and the food was not worth the charge.  Service worth nothing.  We will not be returning for at least another 10 years."}
{"text":"I wasn't real hungry and asked for 1 pancake and was told I could not order 1 so I ordered 2, was told the least I could order was a short stack of 3 so ordered this but only ate 1, later I saw others receiving orders of 2 and questioned the waitress why I had to order 3 while others were being served 2. She said something about there being another menu to order from to get smaller servings, dah, could have told me at the time I was ordering.  Last 2 times there have experienced very incompetent waitresses, don't plan to go back again."}
{"text":"Worked out great. Wife is pregnant and craving pancakes. Boom IHOP to the rescue! And I got giant man omlet. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Words can't even describe the DISSATISFACTION and DISAPPOINTMENT i had last night!! I ordered BIRTHDAY CUPCAKE PANCAKES!!! This is Christmas shitty ass  pancakes Reason I requested them last night for dinner after a long exhausting day is because I felt it was well deserved! And not only did they take forever to seat us knowing we were walking to the door and saw us approaching they took forever for drink orders and for our actual orders as well. The girl didn't seem interested in working or seeing how everything was going if we needed appetizers refills etc. nope. And the food was so poorly made!! There's a cook and server and not many people in the restaurant... so therefore there should be no reason or excuse to having poor service and food!! I hope the manager or owner sees this review and knows how disappointed I am with having to spend almost $30 on food that wasn't even eaten!! I had even told the guy I'm assuming was a supervisor or something about our experience and I didn't get an apology or any kind of help to make me feel better about the lack of service that was provided!! All I got was \"umm I'm not sure what happened maybe we ran out, I don't know , and more excuses!! This is outrageous and I will never be back again!! Then to make things more fun all these photos are food that look amazing!! Where was that cook when I was wanting this cupcake pancakes?!!... smh don't go to IHOP go to DENNYS!! They have better pricing and more quality and quantity there!!"}
{"text":"I tend to avoid chain breakfast joints, but last month Brak and I had a great experience with an IHOP in Roswell, NM. So good, in fact, that we went twice on that trip. So when I suggested a visit to the new local IHOP this morning, he was agreeable.

What a mistake. Our first frustration was the noise-levels in the waiting area. The music (include radio DJ chit-chat) was so loud that the hostess had to walk from group to group and repeat the customer name in almost a shout in hopes of figuring out whose table was ready. I asked her to turn down the music, but she gave me a puzzled look and said \"What? What?\"

We were seated within a few minutes, but our table wasn't exactly ready. It had pools of water on the seats and the table itself. Even after the hostess's attempt at drying it off, there was water still pooled around the condiments after we had finished eating. Perhaps this is the source of Mesa's mosquito problem.

The food itself was standard and not bad. I had a short stack of buttermilk pancakes, which were good but not memorable. Our waitress was pleasant, but she had to talk to us in such a loud voice (over the music, still bad in the dining area, and now also the loud talk of the customers trying to hear one another) -- basically I had a hard time not feeling like she was yelling at me.

Twice during our short meal waitstaff came out of the kitchen to sing for a customer's birthday. It was singing, I think, but my ears were ringing too much to know because the waitresses started out the song by walking through the dining area actually shrieking and screaming. It was so awful I can barely describe it. Several people in other booths had their hands over their ears, and one little boy across from me was visibly upset.

On the whole, I think a couple of good lessons can be learned from this experience:
-- This new IHOP location hasn't been able to hire a competent manager yet.
-- Everything is better in Roswell.

We won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill fast. We got seated right away but the orders came out super slow and they were all messed up. Our waiter was awful and extremely undertrained. They need Robert Tepper to come in here and turn this hellhole around."}
{"text":"Definitely friendlier than Denny's. Our server is so kind and even the manager came to check on us. Also we got seated quickly and our food arrived fast too! 8.25.18"}
{"text":"The worst iHop in North America. Poor service, takes 20 minutes to get the coffee and another 45 to get your food. People are crazy loud, impossible to enjoy your breakfast. This place needs a manager! Don't ever come here if you don't want your day ruined or to be late. 1 egg, 2 sausages - 45 minutes. Mind blowing."}
{"text":"We were sat at a table and never spoke to again. After 20 minutes we got up and walked out. No one cared. Zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Been to this location several times and this time the service and food were awful. Food was cold, Kathy our waitress was only at our table to take our order and bring us the check. Pretty sure I will not be going here again ."}
{"text":"The service here is always friendly. It's never too crowded. The food is good, but pretty expensive for pancakes and eggs.  There is not much on the menu whether it's breakfast lunch or dinner for under $10 per plate. Add a coffee or drink and that's another three dollars.  While I like IHOP, I'd rather go to a nicer place. The last time I ate there my husband got breakfast I got a sandwich and we both got a Coke and it was $30 not including tip."}
{"text":"Great food...but ATROCIOUS service. Got the strawberry lemonade only to find a slimy soggy muck of strawberry's at the bottom of my drink. I asked one of the employees to get a different drink, only to get an extremely rude response, making me made it feel like it was MY fault that the drink was soggy. 

Update: I found a piece of hair in my food!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't express how grateful we were for the staff and manger Irvin at this I Hop!!! They were so attentive and friendly and just wonderful.  You made our 2 Christmas parties just wonderful!   ThAnk you from the bottom of our hearts !"}
{"text":"Had a coupon for a two for one entree and happened to be cruisin by so stopped in.  Since it was dinner time opted for tilapia and M had the shrimp.  Food was cafeteria style 'ok'.  Nothing to yelp about, but not bad.

Did I really say 'nothin to yelp about'?  Doh!

Brocoli was overcooked but tilapia was tasty.  Shrimp? meh.  I could be a fan of the potatos though.  Wait staff was friendly so I give this place a few stars for their kind effort.

Final ticket was $22 after the discount.  I would have felt jipped if I paid the full price.  A tad spendy for what you get."}
{"text":"My mom, sisters, niece and nephew and I went to this IHOP location on 10/1/2016 after attending Race for the Cure. The service was outstanding! Our server was an African American gentleman with a nose ring (I didn't catch his name). He was so polite and friendly. He constantly checked on us, our food came out quickly and he got our orders perfect. He never seemed irritable or tired, and it was pretty busy at the time we went. Not only was the server outstanding, the   manager who was a female (I didn't catch her name either) was also super friendly and courteous. I loved my experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"This IHOP is amazing!!! From the greeter to the server I had a great experience. The food was cooked to perfection and everyone made sure we were taken care of. I am blown away because I have never been to a IHOP with such exceptional service."}
{"text":"Went here for a late night breakfast when a pancake craving hit. Was decent. I stuck with the original pancake syrup. They have flavored options such as strawberry, blueberry and butter pecan, but they tasted like medicine to me. I was allowed to order from the kids menu, so that was a plus as i was not feeling like having a huge stack of pancakes.  Waitress was friendly and attentive, kept the water and coffee coming. Interior was clean and quiet."}
{"text":"Wow, IHOP is killin it tonight. We were originally gonna go to Buffalo Wild Wings, then we decided we were gonna go to Denny's, but we ended up at IHOP. Pleasantly surprised as soon as we got our drinks, swift and friendly service from Larry. He somehow brought out 5 drinks at once, without dropping them. He was very helpful when we were a little indecisive. We decided on the chicken & waffles, the stuffed French toast, and the country fried steak. Everything was bomb. Larry killed it. We will be coming back very soon."}
{"text":"I would of gave them a 5 maybe even a 3, but they don't clean their bathrooms, they let B.S. answers, whwn letting them know how they can do better; over all when they find that their is no more BS room, because they know that I videoed it and in do so, you will get tokd, not asked \"To not come back.\" All do to letting them know that the BS, of their words of a \"Walk through are just that a BS,\" as they, can't just say thanks for letting us know. ..so, it has nothing to do with the food or even the people that server the food...simply, they let the bathroom get so caked on with pee and then say they do walk through, I do wonder how they passed the health food test, they had to BS their way, I bet or pay them off because theirs no way that if they cleaned the bathroom the kitchen is any different."}
{"text":"worst service ever!!!!!!! ordered my food at 10:30am i notice all of the other customers where getting thier food before me (and they got there after us) so i tell the hostess 
he checks on the cooks and i guess theyre backed up.... they finally bring our food out at 11:50 (more than an hour) eggs look nasty with chocolate and some green onion ( not sure but it was something green) on them... \"manager\" came to \"apologize\" (which it seem he didnt really cared)  he just said \"sorry dont worry about the bill\" ( not a sincere apology) so mad worst ihop ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, as I write this review I realize IHop is not the finest-of-dining establishments, but I still feel like there is a certain-albeit minimal- expectation, and this experience didn't even live up to that. 

We got there, were seated and the waitress took our drink order. So far, pretty good. Then we ordered. ..

Taking our order the waitress did not write it down, which I know a lot of servers don't anymore. If you are a seasoned server and can remember all that, go for it! I applaud a person being able to remember the orders of multiple people, the changes, substitutions and all that and not get wrong. 
I didn't know until our food came that our waitress was not a seasoned professional and could not handle the order of two people without getting it incorrect. 

I got an omelet without the onions. My bf got a custom kind of thing were you get to pick two of this, two of that or whatever. He also ordered and extra 2 pieces of sausage. The food comes and the first tip off that she was new to the serving world was that she asked us if the pancakes looked like the pancakes we ordered. We were confused, obviously, so she explained that she knew he ordered blueberry pancakes but she didn't know if the cakes she brought out to him were blueberry or  not. REALLY! Being the private eye that I am I looked at the pancakes and said no, they are not blueberry. Being the easy going guy the bf is, he said it was fine. Problem #2 he noticed he didn't get his sausage so he asked about he reminded her. She admitted she forgot and said she would place the order for the extra sausage and because she forgot and the pancakes were wrong she would not charge us. 

We were all but done eating by the time the sausages came but the best part is when she brought the forgotten links she asked, AS SHE WAS PUTTING DOWN THE PLATE, if we wanted our check now. I always thought it was customary to let the guest eat before paying!

 (Also, keep in mind that by this time she had not checked in on us once! Not for water of coffee refills or even just to see if our food was ok! And the poor bf was dehydrated because I drank all his water after I finished mine.)

He just says oh sure that's fine (because he's the easy going one), and noticed she did charge us for the sausage, Now, it was $1.59 so it's not about the money but the principle. He was going to pay it, I am the other hand am all about the principle. Still not angry (upset, annoyed, miffed or any negative emotion) mind you I showed her the bill and asked about the charge. She looks at me like I was crazy and trying to rip her off, rolls her eyes and says \"OK fine I'll take it off.\" and storms away. All those negative emotions I was not feeling, I am beginning to feel. So to avoid conflict we wait calmly for our pay and proceed to the register to pay. 

Another server, the one seating and taking the final bills, comes over and takes our check. I had a couple of gift cards, which is why we went, and she tries to process the transaction. It apparently wasn't working so the girl tries again this time telling the computer it sucks and muttering annoyances, jabbing the touch so hard it was rocking. The bill was $18 and some change.  All I wanted was the dollar and change to for a tip for the horrible dinner, BUT NOOOO I have to argue with the girl to get my Dollar and change! Now, I don't know if I was in the right or not but I was NOT going back after that bad experience and didn't feel like I should have to forfeit my change. In the end I did get my change, left it and a couple extra singles for the tip and left."}
{"text":"This place needs help, I'm warning everyone to stay away from this IHOP unless they want bad service and an hour long wait for food. My boyfriend's steak looked like it came from a microwave and my daughter's eggs were cold and looked like they were sitting in the window for a while. I'm not one to complain but after waiting patiently for an hour for our food, all the server gave us was a discount. Not worth it dennys gives better service then this."}
{"text":"Above excellent service. If I could give 10 stars for the great late Friday night service I would. 

The food was out in a timely manner  and the order was 100% accurate. 

Thank you IHOP for being so great on a Friday night and on the Blvd."}
{"text":"Well its sunday. As we all know Sundays are just about the busiest days for restaurants,  I always like to watch the waitress' to see how they are handling the stress. Our waitress today , however.  I have not seen much of. I've been waiting about 20 mins for a drink refill.  Now I know their busy,  but they ain't as busy as usual, she must be hiding out I've seen the other waitress 1000 times. Now after a 40 min wait for a sandwich ( berry turkey melt ) and an omelette, they put our order at the end of the table and walked away. So we switched to the right place and served ourselves. The omelette I had was the Colorado . The meat inside tastes like something you'd get in a lunchable. Never again. 
 The sandwich however was pretty good.  But as for our waitress BEE. I think we will go elsewhere. Thanks anyway"}
{"text":"If you have time to stand around and gossip with your fellow coworkers then you have time to refill your customers water glasses instead of making them wait another 45 minutes to get something to wash their dry pancakes down with. Waste of money and waste of time. Too bad it was the only breakfast place convenient to our hotel."}
{"text":"This is the last time I come actually don't really come here I always stick to blueberry hill way better service and the food actually comes out warm been here like 30 min barely gonna refill my drink wtf some bullshit wasted money food was shit"}
{"text":"I don't write on these, but I have to say something about this place. Food...ok. I think Denny's food is better. The thing that got me was taking my son for his birthday breakfast and the waiter flirting with my girlfriend in front of my son. So much so to where my 14 yr old son even called it out to the waiter. Never going back to this IHOP ever"}
{"text":"Where to start...I guess when the hostess brought us to our table.  As we approach it she notices that it wasn't cleaned yet, and it was a mess.  She proceeds to wipe all the crumbs and chunks of food right onto the carpeted floor.  I should have left right then.  We sat down down and they had a lot of tables that needed cleaning.  The same hostess cleaned all the tables by pushing the crap onto the floor.  Gross!  I try ti ignore it, even though my gut tells me to leave right then.  I order pancakes, wife crepes.  After 15--20 minutes, still no food.  I can see the kitchen however and there is a plate of pancakes sitting under the heat light, been there about 10 minutes.  Another 8-10 minutes, our food shows up.  The stack that was under the heat light is gone.  Low and behold, my pancakes are cold.  Waiter takes them and another 5-8 minutes brings another plate.  They were mediocre at best.  Wife's food looked disgusting.  Folks, there are so many good breakfast choices in the area, don't make the mistake of trying this one."}
{"text":"The food at IHOP always makes me feel horrible afterwards..and this was no acception accept now a days the food is ridiculously over priced..so for 20 bucks a person i get to be posioned...what a deal....the service is ok..but i imagine that after working in this place for any length of time is depressing...horrible...clean up the food quality IHOP"}
{"text":"Haven't been to an IHOP in years. I remember why. Even the healthy options make you feel gross. I didn't get the cheesecake pancakes because u don't want diabetes. I ordered myocardial infarction instead."}
{"text":"Amount of food was great for the price but that is as far as the pros go. It was extremely loud and service was not good. I didnt get one refill and I had water. Our waitress was very inattentive."}
{"text":"First things first. Get with the times IHOP, why can't we use digital coupons? It is ridiculous to have to print out a coupon. Secondly, since we weren't able to use the 20% off coupon I had on my phone, we did get a 10% military discount so all was not lost.  Service was fine, friendly and appropriate. However, this was the longest we have ever, at any IHOP from all over the country, waited for our food.  It was kind of crazy honestly. The main reason we came was because I wanted to try the new French toasted donuts. We tried both the strawberries and cream and apple fritters. Both were good, but not worth an extra $5 each if you added them to a different entrée. If you got one of the specials that included them it was a good deal.  Our meals were just as expected excluding the ham on my dish. It was way overdone and dry as a bone.  Sometimes you just need breakfast no matter the time of day, so I'm sure we will be back again."}
{"text":"Went there with my husband . The service was terrible. Silverware wasn't clean, the Waiter overcharged on the order, the restroom wasn't clean. I would not recommend this restaurant...."}
{"text":"The wife and I went for breakfast this morning and it was a good experience.  We both ordered omelets and they were large and well prepared.  The highlight was our waiter Desean (sp?), he was very attentive and an outstanding server.  We will request him the next time we visit."}
{"text":"I was greeted and seated quickly, but no one ever came back to take my drink order or food order. Three waitresses on duty. Only 4 tables had people in entire restaurant. I tried to flag down a waitress and she didn't come over but heard her tell another waitress to go to my table but she also never came. I walked out. No excuses for it. Won't come back or recommend this location. Needs new manager. Staff wouldn't do it if it weren't being allowed and modeled."}
{"text":"The worst IHOP I have ever been in, I asked for fruit instead of the two pancakes that came with my meal and this is what I got. The lady that took my order was clueless and did not get my order right. Just bad all already!"}
{"text":"People love IHop I did not have to wait to long but the restaurant was full. I order a omelet which was good. The food came out fast and the service was ok. I may go back depending which restaurants are closer to me."}

{"text":"This is a brand new IHOP that opened about a year ago to replace the older one that closed off Main and Dobson.   The place is bright, new and fun, with the same old IHOP menu that we all know and love.

I have been here a few times now and like it.  The new place really brings some life versus the old one off main that closed.  Service is great, and I got the pancakes with 2 eggs this morning.  Plenty of seating, parking is good, and not much of a wait for 9 AM on a Saturday.  Like every other place, the longer you wait to get in here, the longer your going to spend waiting for breakfast.  Obviously, most breakfast joints are packed on the weekends anyways, and IHOP is no different.

Food was tasty, service was great, and I will be back in the future for more!"}
{"text":"This is the new and improved IHOP that just opened after the new year due to the light rail construction.  They built this place from the ground up, and it looks fabulous inside and out.  IHOP seems to be doing a lot in regards to upgrading its properties, as this is not the first time I've seen a brand spanking new IHOP here in the valley over the past 2-3 years.

I came here early on a Saturday morning and was seated right away.  Place is new and clean, and the staff was really nice and friendly.  I went with the chocolate chip pancakes, hash browns and bottomless coffee.  My bill was $11.77 after tax, and I really enjoyed myself. I got 4 pancakes, but I should have gone with 2! I couldn't finish them all!  I paid my bill and left before the food coma set in.

The reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 was for two reasons.  First, when I got seated, my table didn't have any silverware. I didn't realize this until I got my coffee and went to stir in the cream and sugar.  I looked around and realized that non of the tables in my section had any silverware either!  (the section was empty except for me).  I finally spotted a set of silverware a few tables down, and grabbed that so I could use the spoon to stir.  

Secondly, I had my computer with me, and the girls at the front gave the password to get online.  I put it into my computer and the internet said \"limited connectivity.\" I was somewhat flustered with this as I did have a few things online that I wanted to address while I was eating my breakfast.  I tried a few times during my stay and was never able to get online.  

While I was eating my breakfast, a family of 6 sat down from me. He tried to get online with his smartphone and was unable to connect as well. He had the same problem I did. The password was good, but he couldn't bring up the internet. 

I don't know why they don't just have a password free environment. I imagine this would cause more stress for the servers trying to help people get online, and it's really annoying since they aren't IT people. It seems like they have some sort of problem going on with their internet, and no on there could get on.  They need to A) drop the pass word stuff, but more importantly B) figure out why the internet isn't working in the restaurant for customers.  It's frustrating!  Also, the servers do a good job and its not fair to them to stand there and try to play IT while people are also eating there food.

Overall, I had a good experience, and the few things that were aggravating were small and can be worked out.  Will be back in the future for more good breakfast!"}
{"text":"It's IHOP what more can I say...Expected quality,cleanliness,  good service and food."}
{"text":"Best IHOP in all of  the Valley. 

Great place to grab a quick meal if you find yourself on the Southern end of the strip.
Like all IHOP'S the price is reasonable but this one stands out for convenience , fast service and great food."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service at this location!

Came here Christmas morning for breakfast and was greeted by a bunch of happy staff waiting to help customers as they entered the restaurant. I was seated right away and was greeted by a very nice and happy waitress. She took my drink order and was back with it quickly. I wasn't sure what I wanted, so I asked her if she could come back in a few minutes so I could have some time to look over the menu before making my decision. I have the problem of wanting too many different items on the breakfast menu!

I decided on getting the Denver omelette combo which came with your choice of pancakes, hash browns and I think fruit. I decided to get the pancakes. I didn't have to wait long before my food came out and it looked delicious!! Omelette was cooked perfectly and they remembered not to put the peppers in it!! Yay! Pancakes were hot and fluffy. However, like most of the time, I got halfway through my food and I was stuffed! Everything was too good. 

My waitress was very attentive to her customers and she came around often to check on me to make sure everything was good and to refill my drink. It's very nice to come into a place and have the staff act like they really do care about their customers."}
{"text":"I come to this IHOP to do some homework and maybe eat a little something. Dont come in at night to do anything like that, they told me i had to spend a certain amount to stay there and do my homework even though i was running off MY HOTSPOT and paying for a little something to eat. Ive been to other IHOPs that are more than welcoming for me to sit and eat and do my homework regardless if i spend $7 or over. But this one, forget it. Not only that but they were very hostile about the whole situation when they didnt need to be. They let people come in and sleep and take a bath in the restroom yet they cant let a paying customer sit eat and work on some homework.  I will not be back. Very unwelcoming from the night crew and manager."}
{"text":"It was busy when my friend and arrived this morning for breakfast. I was pleasantly surprised that no matter how chaotic it was, the staff was pleasant and got us a table quickly. Our bus boy Samuel was really polite and made sure we were comfortable. We had a great waiter, named Michael, who continued to make sure we had everything we needed in a very timely fashion. The restaurant was clean and everyone seemed to be in a great mood. Very positive experience!"}
{"text":"TBH it's only my second or third time dining at an American restaurant. Glad it left a good impression on me. Pancakes are not bad but defo not that good, breakfast is typical so nothing special. Nice staff came to check up on us many times. A small but cheap tidy restaurant"}
{"text":"Hubby and I went there last Saturday. He got the double hamburger and onion rings. I got the steak sub and fries. Both were over done. Willn't order both again. The place was busy. wait time a little long. Tiny place.
Maybe order breakfast the next time. Most every one was. D"}
{"text":"Selena was our waitress and she took amazing care of my girl friend and I. We had a bad run in with IHOP in Prescott AZ and she definitely redeemed IHOPs honor! Thank you very much for the service!!!"}
{"text":"i've always liked ihop as a kid but now that im older i watch where my dollar goes and when i have poor service im not giving up my dollar to anybody with that said we entered this IHOP we were seated rather quick by the host our waitress came once asked about our drinks we never saw her again this was early sunday so myself and my family promptly get up and exit no one attempts to ask what's wrong the host was really the only one concerned but made no comment in fact she kinda looked as if that happened before this is not good IHOP"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said?
Reliable chain food
Had the roasted poblano omelet and it was rather tasty.
Getting a pot of coffee is nice especially since the wait staff probably won't come around often.
Pancakes we're fluffy too, I don't usually get pancakes."}
{"text":"Service was really bad. Food was worse. Had to ask 4 people for silverware. We got our bill and they added an extra OJ and avocado. They really thought they were going to get extra money from us. Never coming back."}

{"text":"Good customer service good food and for a good price. My wife and I went for breakfast and she got the country fried steak and eggs, she gets it everytime and I do have to say it is amazing. I got the new biscuits and gravy, not bad but also not the greatest. I have had better but they have other selections that are much better."}
{"text":"My waiter was great and super attentive. I'm full and happy. I came in and right away I was greeted with a smile and I was seated promptly. I was able to order my drink right away, which gave me time to look at the menu. When she came back I was ready to order. My order came in a few minutes hot and delicious. It was my first time at this one, it's far from home but worth it."}
{"text":"Disgusting.  This was, hands down, the most disappointing experience I've ever had at ihop.  The menus are different, and the food cheapened along with it.  Scrambled \"eggs\" (not real eggs) came out tough and orange looking, my salad had over cooked gray hard boiled eggs and grilled chicken that tasted like sausage, the staff was slow, the hostess was unhelpful.  Don't go!!!!"}
{"text":"Got to agree with others, I am not an IHOP fan.. but this one.. well it takes the pancake!

Had some time to kill before a flight last wed and we went here, daniel iirc was a great waiter, the crapes were tasty and overall just a nice time at an ihop for a change!

Congrats to the management for not being just another chain store that would not have been remembered.

{"text":"I'll agree 99% of this Alison T. lady's review and maybe add my experience since I was the one sitting across from her.  The thing I want to point out is that a greasy spoon breakfast shouldn't literally come with 2 eggs with pools of clarified butter on top.  It was borderline acceptable and I think I actually felt my heart stop while eating on multiple occasions.  

Probably a good thing that IHOP is a pancake joint but after Alison's recent review, I'd have to say that maybe a kitchen overhaul is needed.  From the quality of the food that she ordered and the fact that the front of the house seemed disorganized really makes me think that maybe this location needs to take a step back and reorganize.  Wasn't very pleased with our meal to say the least.  Worst part was that this place was relatively busy which pains me to believe that there were all these people eating mediocre meals too.  Meh....sorry Baker's Square, we were wrong to stray."}
{"text":"Beautiful facility, but the sewer pipes are not vented properly, so place smells.  You adjust quickly.  My waitress Crystal was amazing and the only employee I saw working.  My one star is for her and maybe the cook.  Eggs and pancakes were good, but the chicken fried steak was very salty.  I stood at the counter for 5 or more minutes waiting to pay.  Crystal was giving her great service to other diners.  I saw three young ladies chatting in a booth when I came in having a grand old time.  They were the \"managers\"- one of which was \"somewhere but there was only Crystal.  If this one makes it changed in personnel will have to be made"}
{"text":"My wife found not one string of hair but two!! (two different plates of food) The nice waitress reported it to the manager. And this was the respond ...and I quote; that's normal for \"HAIR\" to be in the air, it's all over Las Vegas!!! I said oh really! {My meal was fine} She tried to bring other small \"make up\" dishes but that took the cake for my wife. In the end she said; I'll pay for your wife's meal. (that she never ate) This place needs an INSPECTION\" soon!!!!! 

service 3 & 1/2 stars

management skills 1/2 star

sanitary plate of food -5 

WHAT A SAD EXPERIENCE!  Note to the owners ...for my family and I to patronize your restaurant again (driving west, past \"ihop\" to eat at Denny's) PLEASE investigate and have a team to preform a general cleaning!!!!! 

after that send a few shoppers in (not on the weekends \"it's just to busy\" or high peek time) to get a natural feeling for your establishment. Thank you"}
{"text":"Beware the syrup! Stopped in here because I had a hankering for some french toast early one sunday morning. The service was fast, sometimes too fast. (My waitress asked me if I was ready to order about 15 seconds after I was seated and brought the bill with my feel which made me feel rushed.) For some bizarre reason they have implemented a system where the chef calls out over the loudspeaker to let the waitresses know when the food is ready which does not make for a pleasant environment to enjoy breakfast. At all. So finally my french toast arrives and I prepare to dig in. I read the top of the syrup closest to me which says \"old fashioned\" oh yea that's how I like it. I notice that this syrup has a purple tint to it. Definitely not old fashioned. I called the waitress over to let her know that I don't eat that kind of syrup and now my french toast is ruined bug assured her I at least tried to do the right thing by reading the top where it said old fashioned. She said \"oh they all usually say the same thing.\" um...what is the point of that? She brought me out some new french toast likety split and I tested out the syrup before I went in for the big pour this time. Overall food was good, this guy yelling in my ear the duration of my breakfast was not."}
{"text":"waffles (with apple cinnamon), sausage, grits, toast, orange juice 3x times out the week... love it!! customer service so nice they mde sure to ask if u was being helped, very organized, clean also! took 13mins to make food! love it!"}

{"text":"Its taken me three trips - count 'em - THREE, to come to the conclusion that your satisfaction with the restaurant is totally linked to who is working that particular day. The first time I went, I showed up at 9AM on a Saturday morning, having just moved to Oakdale and hungry for pancakes.  I ended up walking out when the young, blonde, and totally disconnected hostess sat me at a table for six (I was all by myself) when there was a family of five standing in front of me in the lobby who'd been waiting far longer than I had.  I rejected the table, and she told me that there were no other places for me (with six other booths that I could see that were vacant and needed bussed). So I walked, which I rarely do.

Second time, it was late on a Saturday afternoon, before the dinner rush. Perfect service, perfect food.  Couldn't ask for a better experience.  I truly thought they'd redeemed themselves until......

Third trip in. Sunday afternoon, with family. OMG, the service could not have been worse, nor the pancakes colder. Mine wouldn't even melt the butter. 

It is interesting to note that no manager was around (or at least not in sight) when I had NO problem, and had perfect food.  At both of the other trips into this place, the management was front and center, and not doing a damn thing to make sure things ran smoothly. In fact, on the first trip, I truly think management was making things worse by not allowing the employees to do their jobs without interrupting.

Third trip..meh. The manager needs to be replaced, and whoever they replace him with needs to know what good food is.

I'll add two things here.  I trained waitreses for a few years for a MAJOR restaurant chain that is in direct competition with IHop, but not in Robinson.  And, I've worked retail.  Retail and training waitresses makes me a pretty darn good observer of the problem at this restaurant - all fixable, but not by the current management."}
{"text":"Came here because there are precious few places outside the Strip and fast food eats where you can get a meal past 10 pm. First, only given breakfast menu, I had to ask for regular menu. Then, only one soup, out of the others.

Service was extremely sloppy, making me feel like I was an inconvenience. Then the \"Bennie\" was not all that good. Stopped eating the turkey and am hoping it doesn't make me sick. Avocado was tasteless, and I love avocados, so that was a disappointment.

Icing on the cake was when they seated a family with two screaming children at the table next to me. Restaurant nearly empty, and they had to put already screaming children in my ear.

Didn't even finish my meal, but searched for my waiter (talking to another waiter) to get my check do I could leave.

Doubt I will return."}
{"text":"Worse service I have ever received.  A three top showed up after our two top and were seated BEFORE US.  Two cups of water took 20 minutes, our server took just as long to take our food order.  The food took an HOUR to get to our TWO top.   Server came to our table once, never apologized....I had to steal ketchup from another table and we had to ask for silverware.......

BOOOOO!!!"}

My food came out in two parts the meat was burnt eggs were right on, hash browns were precooked and the consistency of wood chips. my date was done with her pancakes before my mashed potatoes came out. 12 minutes after the rest of my meal. I didn't see my server the entire time. I didn't get a water or even a do I need anything. I love IHOP but am sad with this crew. So sad for the restaurant owner"}
{"text":"A typical IHOP place. Food was good but the service was better than most that we have been to. Friendly staff and good prices."}
{"text":"If you are gluten intolerant, this is one of the rings of Hell. They put wheat in EVERYTHING, from expected things (well, expected by us who try to avoid it) like the gravy and salad dressings, to totally stupid places like their egg dishes. They will accommodate, but you must be very diligent.

That said, the staff is here tends to be fabulous. They are always in a good mood and smiling. They've been very helpful to our Toastmasters club, which meets in the back banquet room."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever recieved, our waitress went out of her way to be as rude as possible. Violently putting our plates on the table, yanking my card from me. I will never eat here again"}
{"text":"Typical IHOP fair, so the food was decent. The service was quite good. Janette was cheerful, efficient, and checked in just the right amount. I have no complaints about food quality, cleanliness, or service. 

The music was so loud that it overcame all conversation, ability to order, or enjoyment of my meal. People had to scream their orders and converse at 4 decibels above \"inside voice.\" It was not background music, it was center stage and in your face. It was like being in a karaoke bar with the amps at 11. Even with my headphones cranked until my phone gave me the nanny warning, I could not hear over the IHOP concert. Seriously, why?"}
{"text":"As my husband was complaining about someone being sat before us, the manager not knowing I was his wife looked over at me and rolled her eyes in disgust not realizing we were together, the manager is Rude and Incompetent. The rest of the staff is nice, the manager should learn from the staff. My daughter ordered the chocolate pancake and it was horrible! We will never be back again."}
{"text":"Menu had sweet tea but they said we don't have sweet tea. The regular ice tea was super dark and strong. Other than that no waiting for a half full restaurant. Yay for them."}
{"text":"Unbelievably atrocious. 35 minutes for a to go order with a completely empty restaurant and a confused staff. I watched people wait for nearly 15 minutes to even be acknowledged at the host stand. No Apologies or sense of urgency. Awful"}
{"text":"Overall okay.   Service was friendly and efficient.   I ordered a scramble that I had ordered at a different location on a previous day.   Too much cheese and the cheese did not taste good to me.  The French Toast was okay.  Everything tasted.... just okay.  Don't plan on going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food is typical american diner fare even though it is supposedly \"international\".  The only thing I find to be remotely a specialty item from another country -for breakfast- would be the crepes.  They are actually what I typically order as I prefer the crepes over the pancakes.  A lot of selections seem very sugar-ladened with whipped creme, sprinkles, sauces, etc, so I tend to stick to basic savory breakfast fare.  The service has always been good on the few times I go to one of these locations.  Patty melts are as good as any other I can get at any other diner style restaurant.  I rarely go to IHOPs as there are other breakfast cafes I prefer."}
{"text":"Ordered food and waited over an hour to receive. No updates from wait staff on the delay. We went on a Saturday around noon. Lots of staff walking around, but the store wasn't very busy. Party of 5 adults and two kids."}

{"text":"I took a group down for their annual free pancake day(July) and it was fun!
We went at 8 or 830am with a time limit. 
They made sure to be fully staffed so everything was quick and easy. Even though they were full of people, nobody was waiting more than 5 minutes for a table and no longer than 10 minutes for their pancakes. 
Our server was new and still did well. 
Last but not least, the pancakes were buttermilk with that little but of golden crisp on the outside that all good pancakes should have. 
I am syrup snob so I don't like the quality of their syrup but it tastes good and, hello, it's ihop! You know what to expect and they performed at the top if their ability. Good job"}
{"text":"I'm sure ihop used to have great food in the beginning. Now that they are large, they quality of food is cheap and everything is from a can. Batter from a box pancakes always taste good and exactly the same. Friend ordered an omelet.  It was soggy and there was a suspicious looking liquid in the middle which I though was raw egg. Turned out it was some kind of cheese product from a can. The server im sure was nice enough, but you couldn't understand a word she said.  In fact the entire staff you could tell was hired for cheap labor.  Cmon ihop, get you game together!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for the last ten ish years and I've only had one decent experience here. I would not suggest this location but to drive a little extra to another location. The service is horrible, the severs are rude and the food is only mediocre. The place smells of old towels and the bathrooms are horrible. If I had a choice, I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Im only giving 1 star to leave a review! I came here back in april our waitress was I believe bianca she was energetic fun an memorized 10 different orders an didnt screw up!!! Well this time way different. .. our waiter was great didnt mess up buuuutttt as I was eating my \"big steak omlet\" I found a short black hair! So I told him he took it an brought me a fresh new one... but would your appetite still be there? Nope not mine also by tbe time I got a new one everyone I was with had already finished smh. So he didnt charge me for it. Well we went to the front to pay... I asked for a manager & let her know how pissed I was.  he failed to let manager know what happend which is wrong. An also the cook was there with no hair net an a beard (blk hair just like the one in omlet) he was staring the whole time I was telling manager what happend. She gave me a extra $13 off sorry but I think the whole tab should a been given back . An I did still tip waiter. Next time im in vegas I will not b going here. (Ihop breakfast is our tradition when out of town)"}
{"text":"Overall not bad, just a bit \"institutional\".

Parking - 5 star, plenty of parking in their area.

Ambiance - 5 Star, plenty of tables, and areas to sit from large groups to one or two people.  Also, very clean, well lit and spacious.

Reception/ Reservations - 3 star - You have to usually put your name down on a weekend or holiday. This painful.  I have tried to make reservations and it is not possible.  I think it is hard for them to manage lists and if they did it well, then they should be able to manage reservations also!

Food - 4 star - Very nice choices!  The fattening stuff, the lunch stuff, the dinner stuff, the dessert stuff and all the breakfast stuff seem to always be available.  I also think they do a great job for calorie and weight watching people.  Low salt, low calorie, low everything.  Very nice overall.  However, the taste of everything is okay, just not very discriminating.

Price - 4 star - Very good pricing.

GK says, check it out for sure."}
{"text":"Tried to order a create your own melt through this restaurant but was told it was not on the menu. As if a scrambled egg and cheese sandwich isn't standard in most diners? Anyways, called a few other locations, they all had it on their menu. Unsure as to why this locations menu is different then the others or why it's online menu isn't updated. Be weary when ordering pickup, every time i try it's been a terrible experience on multiple occasions."}
{"text":"This place was ok. nothing to write home about. neither my bf nor myself really enjoyed what we ordered. Not sure if that had more to do with what we ordered though. I ordered one of the midnight specials - pancakes, eggs, bacon. pancakes were ok - didnt eat them much. eggs were bland, come to think of it... it was like eating hospital food. you eat b/c its there and either you eat that or you dont eat. 
It was after the GeorgeStrait/Reba concert @ MGM so we were just glad it was food, and it was open. we were ignored for a bit but I felt bad for the waiter b/c it seemed like he was the only one working at that hour. 
we wondered if he was the cook, the waiter and the cashier.. w/e he's getting paid... it aint enough."}
{"text":"I come here on occasion because I stay in a hotel close by for training in Madison.

I ordered scrambled eggs, toast, hash browns, sausage links as well as a fruit bowl. My food came out except for the fruit bowl - I didn't noticed because I was so engrossed in the book I was reading. I forgot about it until I got the bill. I told the waitress and she took it off the bill as well as gave me a discount because I have been there a lot, which she didn't have to do at all. 

I felt bad because the waitress appeared to be the only one there at about 7:30 am and there were about 8 - 10 tables full of customers. I would maybe recommend hat they have at least 2 people on, in case it ever gets busy or at least have the manager help."}
{"text":"This place is plagued by slow service, not very tasty food, crappy location. Definitely would rather visit another IHOP in the Phoenix area as this one is probably the worst of the bunch. Not likely to come back here ever again"}
{"text":"Went on a very busy Saturday ... and yet we got in rather quickly.  Service was very good for the price, and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Our server was pretty cranky. We have a large group (8 adults and 5 kids under 4 years of age), which I know can be stressful. But the service was terrible and the food mediocre. There weren't enough table settings (and they never got us any more, so none of the kids had silverware). The only upside is thy the food came out of the kitchen fairly quickly."}
{"text":"It was ok. I ordered the rooty tooty pancake deal (had a free birthday coupon for it, otherwise I would have gone with something else) and specifically asked for the blueberries on the side. When the order came out, the waiter said \"rooty tooty, blueberries on the side\" and set the plate in front of me. The pancakes had a massive mound of blueberries directly on top. To be fair, the blueberries had overflowed and were also on the side of the pancakes too, but that's really not what I meant. I didn't feel like addressing the issue, so I just scraped half of them off. 

Overall, it's ok, but don't expect much if you order something on the side."}
{"text":"The last time I was here, I deviated from my normal chocolate chip pancakes and opted for the blueberry pancakes. They turned out to be just as good as the chocolate (which is a bit surprising, since chocolate tends to trump all things). They did bot skimp at all on the blueberries, these were just chock full of them.

Though my pancakes were delcious, the service did not match. It was quite mediocre. Although that may have been because the baby started crying every time the server came by (she's very attached to me)- I would be hesitant to regularly check on a table that a baby cried every time I came close too. The server only came by to take our order and drop off our food.

I'll come back because I'm a huge fan of pancakes."}
{"text":"It is an IHOP. the food is fast, hot and great for a hangover. The day I went they were packed but everything was still good."}
{"text":"I honestly had the worst restaurant experience EVER at this IHOP location. It was really bad. I don't usually like throwing businesses under the bus, and I definitely don't want to be reason why someone gets fired, but the management in this place needs to brush up on their actual \"management\" part. I will explain....

My wife and I came here on a Sunday in anticipation that it will be busy, and that proved to be true. We put our name on the waiting list and was told it would be about 20 minutes by the manager on duty. We waited patiently, and slowly but surely everyone who came before, as well as after us were being called. 30 minutes past, and finally after \"giving it a chance\", 10 more minutes past without our name being called. Finally, I got frustrated and walked in to speak to the manager that put our name on the list, and told him how long we've been waiting. With a somewhat \"forced\" apology, he told us he could sit us then. 

The service was just as bad and so was the food. The waitress came and \"apologized\" as well, and took our order. Clearly at this point I realized that they were terribly understaffed. The floors were dirty, tables weren't being cleaned, and people looked clearly upset because their food wasn't coming out in a timely manner. 

Our food came out, and it was cold, as well as terribly presented on the plate. It was as though the cook just threw the food on the plate and was like \"here you go\". No love or effort put into the presentation whatsoever. I decided not make a fuss because we waited long enough, so I reluctantly ate the food in hopes that I wouldn't get sick later on. 

The waitress put our food on the table, and didn't even bother to ask if the food looked okay or if we needed anything else. Furthermore, she didn't show her face until after we were pretty much done with our meals. 

Finally, she came to the table and told us \"not to come on Sundays\"....well if this wasn't the icing on the cake for me not wanting to come back to this location anymore, I don't know what is. If you are blatantly aware that there's a staffing issue, and you're not doing anything about it, there's a problem. Mind you, there's a huge sign on the window saying \"Now Hiring\",and yet they're still understaffed on probably the most busy breakfast/brunch day of the week. 

This location clearly has a management 
/staff problem and needs to be resolved, otherwise they will have continued complaints, and lose lots of business.
I've been going to IHOPs up and down the East Coast for years, and I've never had a bad experience quite like this one......there really isn't much more to say that's positive unfortunately, other than it's a good location, and has potential if can get their act together."}
{"text":"After the waiter did a \"fly by\" giving us our food we didn't see him again until he finally arrived with the bill which was not correct. The waiter gave all 3 of my kids Jr cups. On the bill it showed 2 Jr cups and a regular which is $1.80 more (can't imagine a regular cup holds THAT much more... Just sayin). Which brings me to the cost of the food... For the prices, I expected the quality to be WAY better. The quality was absolutely horrible...
 Fast food places have better service and quality. I now see why the place was almost empty when we came in. I won't be back"}
{"text":"They crossed out our names without ever calling us by mistake, reassured is that we'd be next only to forget us again. Waited for 40min for nothing. Never coming back here again"}
{"text":"Don't eat here! The staff is so rude and inconsiderate. My friends and I visited after a fun time in the city. Our first choice was a local diner, but the crowd was unbearable, so we chose to visit Ihop. Mistake #1. The crowd was also large, but for another reason. The staff upfront let us know that the kitchen was backed up, but that is all. We weren't given a wait time or anything. After about 45 minutes, the manager of the restaurant came into the lobby and did not address any of the customers about the supposed \"kitchen backup.\" Mistake #2. After that, my friend attempted to get her attention, she ignored her and moved along. Mistake #3. So, we didn't wait around for mistake #4 because I'm almost certain it was coming. We left before our hunger got the best of us. I personally would have been fine with the wait if management would have addressed the crowd to explain the hold up, but since they did not, we left. I'm certain in saying I'll never return to an Ihop again. Especially this one!"}
{"text":"The wait time was indicated as \"only 15 minutes\" and waited close to an hour. When being sat down, our order was taken and proceeded to wait an additional 30 minutes for our food. Other guests who had sat down and ordered received their food about 10 minutes before us. When getting our food, my bacon was close to uncooked and strawberry pancakes, as ordered, did not have any real strawberries. Also, our server did not even provide us with the most essential necessity, maple syrup. I then had to get up from eating and request it from a different server. I also had to request my own refill on my drink. Poor service."}
{"text":"The food here is very undercooked. Servers are friendly but the food is not worth the price. We won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Very disappointing location. My guess is that it is under poor management by their slow service, lack of food quality and overall disorganization."}
{"text":"While the food was OK, yes OK, the service was terrible. I would like to point out that not everyone is at fault. Some servers are great mine was just rude, took 5 minutes to serve a coffee, and best part I had no set for a while. I had to get it myself. Just terrible customer service all around."}
{"text":"We waited longer than notified by the hostess. Wife inquired about setting, only to discover numerous sets available for two people. We ordered a simple breakfast (55+ breakfast and blueberry pancakes), this took even longer to get. Place needs a good cleaning on the coffee and syrup dispenser, cleaning of walls too."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this morning and had a below average experience. I ordered eggs over medium and they came over easy. 

Asked for bacon crispy and it came out under cooked and rubbery.

Pretty basic requests that a breakfast focused restaurant."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, clean environment, and we'll cooked food. My waiter was attentive and friendly. Biscuits and gravy with eggs, sausage, and hash browns was cooked perfect. Would return to this location."}
{"text":"My wife always wanted to try the pancakes here for the breakfast and finally after so many years the wish was granted :). We ordered strawberry and chocolate chip pancakes, yummy  and veggie omellete...its good  to have a place little off the strip to have refreshing and filling breakfast in morning."}
{"text":"I did some research as I usually do when I eat at an unfamiliar/non-local restaurant. My son and I are gluten free. I called in and asked about their ability to be served \"shelled eggs\" versus their \"normal\" eggs with pancake batter added in. The gal who answered the phone was quick to say they wouldn't be able to accommodate our allergy. Feeling defeated, yet hungry, I asked for a manager. Nery came to the phone. I explained our allergy and the research I had done about eating gluten free at IHOP. Nery was very nice and informative. She knew exactly what I was asking. She informed me to ask for my eggs \"country style\" which means from a cracked egg with no additives. She also said, she would serve us personally when we arrived. 

With a little training for the hostesses (or whomever they have answering their phones), this IHOP could be running at 5 stars for customer service."}
{"text":"It was very slow when we came in, only a few tables and almost all of them had food, and yet with three servers on the floor it still took them over 5 minutes to seat us. Our server, Javier, seated us in the closest booth, got us water and never returned. After over 10 minutes, another server felt bad and volunteered to take our order for us. He didn't follow up; instead, we waited a full 30 minutes for our food (for two people) as we saw people who came in after us get food in 10 minutes. After that we simply decided we'd rather spend our money elsewhere. The service has been poor at times in the past, but this was inexcusable. Hands down the worst server I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Best dining experience ever!! Service was awesome! Food was amazing!! You should eat here!!"}
{"text":"Okay, normally I don't like to give bad reviews.  Really I don't.  However, I can't let today slide.  I've been to this IHOP a few times in the past and never had an issue.  Today was different.

The young lady who waited on me was nice enough at first but it became obvious before long that she was disorganized and forgetful.  I ordered pancakes and coffee.  Did not see her again until she sat my plate of pancakes down and NO coffee.  When I mentioned the coffee, she apologized and ran off before I could get the chance to tell her she forgot the syrup too!  She had to make another trip to my table.  The manager came by; this was my opportunity to let her know I was not exactly pleased.  There was an assurance she would speak to the server.  Which is fine...but...the manager should have waited until after I left.  The server did not follow up with me during the whole time I ate.  And when the server did come back, it was only to drop off the bill and run off.  I could feel the chill in the air as she whisked herself away.

Now, what about the food?  The pancakes were dry and tasteless, and the bananas were a bit hard.  Coffee was good.

Will I go back to this IHOP?  Uncertain at this point.  As far as chain restaurants are concerned, Perkins is better.  To be honest though, I much prefer giving my money to local establishments versus national chains."}
{"text":"Sad experience we waited at the table for 35minutes no drinks no menus four more guests enter and get sat down menus down and drinks i would shut down this place horrible experience if we didnt call down a waiter we would be here for another 1hr waiting pero nimodo que vamos hacer smh"}
{"text":"This is a crazy location, since it is basically at the intersection of Bell and 101.  It can be super crowded, especially at peak times.  The service is very friendly but otherwise this is your typical IHOP."}
{"text":"Decided to give it another try, BIG MISTAKE!!!!! Service is even slower than my first visit. The management here needs to go!!! Come on IHOP wake up, you can do better than this!!!! I only gave it 1 star because I had to give it something."}
{"text":"Came here at 630 am on a Monday and you'd think the place would be clean right? Nope. Filthy floors, booths and walls. One soap in the woman's restroom doesn't work. I can only imagine the kitchen if they let their customers sit in a booth with old hash browns all over the seat, syrup on the wall and who knows what in the booth crack!"}
{"text":"The rating here is about right. Why do the pancakes seem smaller here than at other ihops? Service was ok. Meal was ok. Forgot my jelly, but then they gave me a ton of it. English muffin seemed like it was left out for a bit. Wife's order was the wrong food. Food was what you'd expect for ihop."}
{"text":"Love this ihop! I come here often for breakfast. Great service and very hard working employees. Ziara is very kind and helpful! Food was great!"}
{"text":"Food was great, but the overnight lady (Lisa) has a garbage attitude. Not going back to this location after 10. I'll just go to Denny's and save the $$"}
{"text":"Seated right away because it was 6:05 am. They get one star because it took 30 minutes to get eggs and bacon which were like warm. Waitress blamed it on the kitchen saying their computer ran out of paper."}
{"text":"It's Ihop so there's not a lot too say. The service was nice but not the quickest, seemed a bit too relaxed and bored:) The food was ok. It's never perfect. It's not very hot when it arrives at your table, the bacon is too crisp, plain coffee... but it was ok for a breakfast. We just wanted to eat something before we drive up to the Grand Canyon."}
{"text":"Usually there are only a few compliants and we let it go, like when I was served warm applejuice the last few times. 

Today we were seated right away which was sweet! But  Our table was dirty, a worker came over to wipe it down but left the table super wet.

Took a long time to get our drinks, when they arrived my husbands coffee cup had lipstick all over the one side! Grossed out....  when we asked for a new cup the waitress didnt say a word. 

Took my husband almost the whole time we were sitting before he got his water. I go to use the bathroom, no paper towels. Finally we get our food, the starwberries that I had on my pancakes were frozen. It was a shock when I bit into it. 

Wasn't pleased at all today, and we will be going out of our way to make sure to go to a different IHOP. Little things here and there are understandable, but today was 1 thing after another. And the cup thing was gross, she should have atleast apologized."}
{"text":"Just stopped in to grab a quick bite to eat by myself before work. My server was Alvaro, I just wanted to write a review to mention how impressed I was with his service. I had been waiting up at the front to be seated for awhile, it was obvious he had 1000 other things going on, but he took the time to stop to see if I had been helped. He got me seated quickly and then took my order right away. My food came out in about 8 mins!! Since I was dining alone I use that time to observe what is going on around me. I noticed that while Alvaro had been 100% attentive to me and my meal and experience, he was also attentive to several other tables in the building, including one that I believe wasn't even in his section. I could easily see that he was anxious to keep moving because the entire building was packed full of people. The reason I am posting this was to make sure Alvaro was given some credit for his hard work, I also noticed what appeared to be 4 managers dressed nicely just standing around chatting while everyone rushed around them to take care of customers. While the reason for this side chatter is not really relevant. It is alarming not to have them actually help a brother out during busy hours. Thank you Alvaro for you excellent service, I will recommend this location in the future."}
{"text":"Came for brunch on Friday and we got seated quickly but after that everything went down hill. We waited 10 min for the waitress to come. We placed our order and waited for 30 min for our food. The waitress came 1 to tell us  \"we will get the food as soon as we can\". Once we saw another table that showed up much later than us get their food we decided to WALK OUT. Don't know what happen in the kitchen  but the waitress did not care. Horrible service DO NOT GO THERE!!"}
{"text":"Avoid this IHOP. All told, we spent 2 hours here. Once we got our drink orders, we didn't see anyone for 30 minutes. It took 45-60 minutes to get our food. Our waitress was apologetic but still absent for most of our meal. No apology from a manager. Several patrons were talking across tables about how they were having the same experience. Our food order wasn't accurate, but we just accepted it rather than wait for the correct food. As we left, the man at the register seemed as if splitting a check was a hassle. I've always appreciated IHOP as a chain but this location did not live up to even my most basic expectations."}
{"text":"I just picked-up my brother from the airport with my family and decided to eat dinner in this branch which is near our home last Monday, October 5.  The waitress was good in serving us through our stay.  So we left for home.  My brother finally realized that he lost his brand new laptop.  After discussing with him all the alternative places/chances he lost it, I finally called IHOP to check it out.  The guy confirmed that they got the laptop of my brother so we immediately rush back and after all the necessary ID presented, we got the laptop back.  Most probably the waitress serving us that night was the one who found it and definitely I am grateful for the 'HONESTY\" for both of them.  Very seldom now a days that you can see people like this working hard to earn a living and have a genuine honesty to return an expensive item to a customer.  TRULY GRATEFUL!!!"}
{"text":"So I was here today at four in the morning. Let me just say that Bernadette was very rude.  And the service was most awful. We arrived and we were seated 15 minutes afterwards because she had to count the drawers . Then  after we were seated we had another server  come through because I explained to her that I felt like that was extremely rude that we were not seated first before she went on to carry out the order of her business. We were then greeted by another waiter who had us wait for another course of time before he even took our drinks we never received our drinks we never received our order even though we gave him a full order . We could see them servicing other people that came in after us and I felt completely ignored and I will never ever be coming back to this establishment . I will be coming back in tomorrow morning to speak with someone about my experience here. I am not happy I love IHOP it's one of my favorite restaurants I just really do not appreciate the poor service that I received."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!!! The waitress forgot almost everything. My food was brought out with side orders missing, when we would ask for refills on on beverages she would forget. The coffee cup had lipstick stains on them and all she did was rinse it out with hot water. Very, very, VERY unorganized restaurant. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I went to this place it was beyond packed,not clean they handed us a drink with something floating in it that was Black said it was a lemon. Then I got asked how I was going to pay 500 times before I could even enjoy my food that I hadn't received this place is a mess. I wish I would've told management I spent my money down the drain didn't enjoy my food horrible service. Don't go here pick a different location. I had to give it one star because it wouldn't let you rate it any other way."}
{"text":"Worst customer service, walk in with a group of 6 no one greeted us then another couple of people walk in and they take them right away to get seated after like 10 mins they finally come get us and seat us. 10 more mins pass and no one comes over to ask for our drinks or anything. Ended up having to leave."}
{"text":"Good old IHOP open on Christmas. The food was as expected. I was grateful for the service to be good, despite the staff having to work on the holiday. The food was quick, tasty, and cheap."}
{"text":"Waited 45 min for food . Food was good. No issues. Would not return as service was horrid."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast while in town - our server, Angelo, was so friendly and very attentive.  Great smile and just great as his job!

We both ordered two egg plates with bacon, hash browns and wheat toast.  Eggs perfect, hash browns undercooked, bacon good, toast fine.  We ordered two really yummy orange juice fizzed drinks, free refills so we got two to go as well. 

Okay breakfast overall, atmosphere friendly, restaurant and ladies room spotless.  This IHOP is in a nice little strip, not a free-standing building.  

Would eat here again if in town."}
{"text":"I love this IHOP, the waitress was attentive, and I wish I remembered her name. Coffee stayed full, and even though we sat visiting for an hour after we were done she didn't make us feel rushed.
 She did tell us she was giving our table to a different server, so she could leave, after waiting an hour, poor thing. So we quickly paid.
 The food was hot, and the syrups weren't sticky. What more could you ask."}
{"text":"They did away with the crepes except lingonberries. Boo.
 Service is good, and I like the syrup selection but we probably won't be back, without the crepes.
 Food same as every IHOP. 
 Pancakes come with everything, so if you're trying to eat healthy you are limited or pay for something you don't want.  :/"}
{"text":"The particularity for this location was not the food, but the service.
Lovely hostess that served us was not only very sharp and helpful, but she was very funny and had very particular personality that I find enjoyable.
She made me laugh and that counts; at least for me.
I must mention that it was so we here around 4:30 am when we came to eat after a long night so I'm glad I found this place.
Server was highly helpful and happy to serve us.
The food was average, nothing particular about it. Good enough to eat, especially after a few drinks with friends.
Definitely coming back just to have that same lady help us. I wish I could remember her name."}
{"text":"This location is neat and clean, not too busy, food is fast and good, same for service. It's also easy to get to, and parking is plentiful."}
{"text":"Everything was great except for the hash browns were stale. Restaurant was clean and service was quick and efficient. When I cashed out I complained about the hash browns and they gave me 10% off."}
{"text":"Wow. Feel bad for the waiter who is doing everything here seemingly because someone didn't staff the place properly. We got here literally 1 hour and 15 minutes ago and we just now got food, no it's not packed. There are maybe 4-5 tables. The food is disgusting, cold, rushed. The waiter is so stressed out it looks like he was given both horrible treatment and way too much responsibility. I get that this is IHOP and not a fine dining establishment. I get that this is a different style of casual dining and expectations shouldn't exactly by at 5 stars.  Someone seriously needs to address the lack of staffing in this place and furthermore - simply shut down the place if you can't stay open or don't have the people. CLOSE. Every single plate is disgusting, undercooked and cold. We come here every week and it's not usually great, but this... This was unacceptable. I really don't know how IHOP is willing to put it's name on this building. Something's got to give here. 2 hour visits are unacceptable."}
{"text":"Avoid this place. The service is horrible and the food is very bland.  What makes tea an Iced Tea? ICE! The hot tea packets were stuck together by some sticky substance. The server asks if we want a box to take home the leftovers but she never returns. If it wasn't for the Groupon we would not have gone here."}
{"text":"My husband and I felt like breakfast fir dinner tonite so we headed to IHop. We were seated immediately in a booth. Unfortunately, seated in the booth in back of me were 3 boys, maybe 18-20 years old. They were loud and obnoxious and every other word out of their mouths was profane! I was going to say simething but my husband doesn't like confrontations and begged me to keep my mouth shut! We endured our meal, but I was not a happy camper! They finally got up to leave and when our waitress came over asking if everything was alright, I couldn't keep my mouth shut any longer! She told me that when they first walked into the restaurant, it was obvious they were drunk. She got the manager and he told her that one of the boys used to work there and it was ok to seat them. He even told the waitress to give them a discount! I told the waitress I would like to speak to the manager and she told me he had already gone home!! So not only did IHop seat and serve these boys knowing they were drunk, but also let them leave, get in a car and drive away! Unforgiveable!"}
{"text":"I place large orders (25-30 meals) every other month or so and the staff here always takes great care of me! Christian, the manager, is super friendly and helpful and always has my order ready on time."}
{"text":"Daniel was a very attentive server, beyond the expectation of I have of most servers, and certainly beyond my expectation at IHOP.

The manager allowed us to get kids meal free since it was still on website, despite the promotion having already ended.

The food was tasty, albeit plain.

The strawberry lemonade was a disappointment; I wish I had known they used only strawberry syrup.

I go to IHOPs occasionally, but this one isn't close to me, so I will not likely return."}
{"text":"Ihop pancakes are the best! I ordered the breakfast sampler. Main reason for review is the excellent service that was received. Today we got Nathan L and let me say great customer service! He was very professional, attentive to our needs, and friendly. It's good to know there are still some great servers! Keep up the great work! :)"}
{"text":"IHOP is a good choice for a standard breakfast. Lots of choices and you can switch to a lunch or dinner menu. Good stuff."}
{"text":"WORST IHOP  
Manager is unloyal coupons ! 
ALWAYS understaffed 
It is sad that the cook had to come and help my table when there was only 3 tables in the whole restaurant.  Horrible service. Sad to say the cook should be manager."}
{"text":"Didn't check the yelp page for this particular IHOP until afterwards, and sure enough this place has pretty bad reviews anyway. 

Came here with 2 friends towards the end of the evening, restaurant wasn't crowded, only had maybe other 3 or 4 tables. Getting someone's attention to get ketchup or refill the water was like pulling teeth, and one of the workers actually looked so grumpy, you could tell she didn't want to be there. Wow. On top of the typical mediocre overpriced food from IHOP, this just made it worse and all the more reason to seek out better alternatives around this area."}
{"text":"Like most chain restaurants, the service is hit or miss, it depends on the waitress/waiter you get. Food is good, most of the time, it also depends on the cook. Sometimes it's cooked to perfection, other times it's not. 
   The manager is super attentive and stands by the door to ask everyone who is leaving how the food was. One thing that they never get right is the soda. My husbands likes to drink soda when we go out  except at this location. For some reason it is ALWAYS flat. I don't know why, it seem that they serve soda from a bottle rather than from a tap. Their tea is always diluted and taste like water. So for us, unless we are drinking coffee or oj, We just stick to water when we come to IHOP."}
{"text":"Almost an hour for pancakes and a sandwich. This place is empty. Repeatedly asking doesnt help either. Service and kitchen gets 1."}
{"text":"food is what you'd expect from IHOP nothing wrong with that. Restaurant always clean. We have had issues with service every time we've been here. Many of the employees are clearly VERY unhappy to be here and I've felt like an inconvenience everytime instead of a guest. If you hate your job folks, go find another one. no reason to make everybody feel unwelcome"}
{"text":"I love this ihop I always have. I will drive from my house all the way near south point to come here because there's never any wait and such great food and service. I don't even know why I waste time at the one on Eastern and pebble. I always end up driving here because I know there's no wait!! Go sahara and forts Apache store!!"}
{"text":"Tried their new burgers. I had the mushroom swiss burger medium rare . It was cooked to perfection and was delicious.The service was better than in the past. Great burger fries and a drink for 7 to 9 $ Worth a try"}
{"text":"I will never bring my kids here again! We arrived at 12 noon..the place was not packed but i did notice that the work crew was fairly young! We sat down and the waiter took our drink orders. We waited 55 mins for our food and as of this post my 13 year old still has not gotten his food. I just watched a family who came in after us who still had not been served get up and leave!! The service was terrible and the kitchen was very slow. This was an awful experience for my kids! I will tell all my social media followers not to eat here!! Our waiter was nice and i don't blame him for the bad service! Oh and to make matters worse instead of serving people their food they decided to sing happy birthday to a patron while others had to watch without their food!!"}
{"text":"I do not know what was going on with the staff today, but other than the hostess, everyone else were completely clueless at their job. Our waitress came and took our oder for drink, but got them (water and coffee) 20min later!!!! After we got our food!! And i went to look for her and ask for water. She still didn't bring them until later. Seriously?!?!?! At 8am coffee is needed before breakfast!!!!!!! And she brought us ONE cup of coffee only. Not the cups and coffee pot. No, just one coffee cup 
And in top of everything, the tuscan scrambled had a suspicious taste."}
{"text":"Ihop is my favorite breakfast chain, and the service at this location is outstanding.  Blanca, our server, was amazing. She is friendly and made sure my husband's eggs were perfectly over-medium.  My \"Pick a Pancake\" combo with the New York Cheesecake pancakes, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, and extra-crispy hashbrowns got my day off to a great start.  Great location by Sunset Station!"}
{"text":"The pick-a-pancake combo is a full breakfast for under $10. I ordered the cheesecake pancakes with scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage, and crispy hashbrowns.  While the eggs and hashbrowns were adequate, my pancakes were delicious. These pancakes are the reason I drag my husband to IHOP. Our server was Claudia, and she was amazing. Fantastic service!"}
{"text":"I would give it zero but I can't! Service passed us multiple for 15 minute, (I can't make this up people). And they never even asked what drinks we wanted. Literally, 3 family's in the restaurant and they took this long!? Once we had enough, (still never asked us for drinks), we got up and as we were walking out the hostess had the audacity to say, \"have a nice day\". Like no it's 8pm..... WTF!!?!!?! Lol but I'd strongly never recommend coming. Well, maybe if they replaced the workers but that's about it."}
{"text":"Don't bother, not only do they not care about keeping up with appearances, (floors have garbage and debris everywhere, etc.)  apparently it's okay to forget about a whole table.  We waited 45 minutes only to watch four other tables around get served, get checked on by a manager, to just sit there and be ignored.  They only noticed us because we got up and decided to leave the restaurant.  The manager should probably take another course in how to handle her employees instead of throwing them under the bus for what clearly could've been a complete mistake, but sadly, she just added more to the problem by lecturing the poor girl in front of us and a doorway of people."}
{"text":"Five stars for the pancakes!!!  The portions are a bit small but I love the choice of pancake and breakfast items."}
{"text":"I ordered strawberry crepes the outer edge was hard as leather, the coffee pot was dripping dirty black dish water, the smell of the restaurant had a dirty sock smell, and I don't appreciate waiter telling me to have a blessed day and go with jesus"}
{"text":"Invitation to breakfast. At an I-Hop. OK, so they have ok breakfasts. Traditional. Eggs, bacon, hash browns, hotcakes, toast, coffee and OJ. I was hungry. Eggs were cooked just as I requested. Two slices of crisp bacon. Two medium hotcakes. Butter and syrup.  All good. Not spectacular, but a good solid breakfast. I am full and happy. Now back to work."}
{"text":"I used to love IHOP...until I went to this location. Most IHOPs are consistent with decent food quality however this location on Tropicana had terrible service. To start our waiter was polite but not overly welcoming. Once we placed our orders, we never saw him again. A runner brought us our food and we had to request our check from the front counter. When they asked me what happened I told them our server disappeared. She let me know he had gone on break. It was a breakdown in communication but it left such a bad taste in my mouth (the food wasn't great either) that I will no longer eat at an IHOP. for the price I can get an incredible meal at Egg Works, The Egg and I, or Sunrise Cafe."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner combination tonight. All you can eat pancakes with sausage and bacon. Hot chocolate was great as well."}
{"text":"My sister & I went here around 4 am STARVING & as soon as we sit down we saw a nat on the table. We killed the nat and brushed it off since we were so hungry. When our food arrived we saw TWO more little bugs CRAWLING on the table. We were so disgusted because at this point we knew it's just a problem here. (We've been here plenty of times before and I always tell her this place is nasty looking. It doesn't look clean at all. I've seen little nats before but since we were sitting by the door and people were coming in and out I brushed it off. )
So I told the manager (who looked dirty himself) that there were bugs on the table, he looked & saw then said \"okay then what do you want me to do\" I said \"excuse me? This is nasty\" he goes \"I know but this is vegas it like this everywhere. We just got it sprayed yesterday. It was worse last week there were a lot all of that table over there. I'll discount your meal\" 
I KID YOU NOT!!!!!
We left and will NEVER be back. SOOO DISGUSTING. If you like buggies on the side of your pancakes you'll love this place!!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I came here after a long night of drinking at the Blind Tiger.  We wanted to eat pancakes and knew this would have been a sure bet.  

At 3am, trust me, you'll be the only one there.  That means more face time with your server.  That also means you better come with a friend, or you'll be lonely LOL.  I was also in the mood to get it down!  In other words, I was hungry.

This night/morning, I got the breakfast sampler: Two eggs, two bacon strips, two pork sausage links, two pieces of ham, hash browns and two fluffy buttermilk pancakes.  It offered a lot of what I was looking for.  The eggs were over easy and cooked perfectly.  The bacon tasted a little weird and not smokey like I'm used to or was craving.  The sausage links were on point and what I expected.  Hashbrowns seems undercooked and not crispy enough and the buttermilk pancakes were fluffy and hit the spot.  Very on average as you can see.

Because I was drunk, I also decided to get another dish.  DON'T JUDGE ME!  I'm just trying to make a well rounded review. My second dish was the ham and egg melt, because I LOVE the Moons Over My Hammy at Denny's.  This dish is a grilled sourdough bread stuffed with ham, scrambled eggs, Swiss and American cheeses.  First off, NOTHING near Denny's competition.  The sourdough was too soft and not crispy enough.  The ham was alright and the combo of cheese tasted great.  I just could get past the bread.  I seriously think the texture of the grilled bread really makes the sandwich come alive.  They also served it with potatoe wedges which were also undercooked, but seasoned good. 

All in all, I may have had alcohol in my system, but trust me.  That allowed my taste buds to really get a great feel for the food and thus making it easier to review truthfully.  I know, I know, that's a bunch of BS.  LOL.  I'm sticking to it and that's that."}
{"text":"Here after church for friends bday. The wait time was not bad for a party of 6 and baby. 3 out of the 6 people enjoyed their meals. But this is my review and unfortunately I was one of the not happy customers. I ordered a simple turkey club. It was brought out missing the bacon and the bread wasn't toasted either...so I had a bland turkey sandwich for 11 bucks? Not a good experience. I am sure other options would have been better but this item will be off my radar from now on."}
{"text":"Horrible! HORRIBLE  I SAID HORRIBLE WAIT STAFF ARE WAY TO IMMATURE  AND INEXPERIENCED! I and my wife and children waited too long for our food in a empty IHOP. Go to the one on W.T Harris its was better. Female manger didnt even acknowledge us. Dont wastse tour time or money at this location."}
{"text":"A rare experience it is, to have an enjoyable meal at a chain restaurant that forces you to give that extra fourth star, but today is a rare day. Thanks in large part to a very sweet and please tell waitress who was very kind and had an absolutely cheerful disposition, this late morning breakfast, almost lunch, was helped to be awesome. When you have the kindness of a 3rd world impoverished person whose grateful for the air they breathe and a name of a supermodel \"Giselle,\" things are bound to be better. The world needs more kind people that have can do attitudes and that's what Giselle exemplified this morning. She did a wonderful job from start to finish, unlike the train wreck that was my waitress at Buffalo Wild Wings last night. The food at IHOP was fresh and it tasted pretty good. My only complaint, it could have come out a little faster. I had the bananas foster french toast, scrambled eggs with cheese and some hash browns, not too bad at all. The greeter was also very kind and a bright spot to the beginning of a day. The corporate culture at this location, cleanliness and flat out can do attitudes give this IHOP a well deserved 4 star rating. Thank you for making the start of my day better. Cheers to all of you."}
{"text":"they do not make good scrambled eggs. the pumpkin pacakes were pretty good though"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE COOKS. TERRIBLE SERVERS. I ordered the SIMPLE & FIT Blueberry Harvest Grain 'N Nut® Combo. Guess what they gave me: A Harvest Grain pancake with blueberry \"compost\" AND whipped cream on top, overcooked pork bacon (not turkey bacon), eggs (those were done correctly) and hash-browns (not even part of the combo). My husband's pancakes and my second batch of corrected pancakes were dry and overcooked. The location in Avondale/Goodyear is much, much better. The servers listen to your order and know the menu, and the cooks make everything perfectly. We're big IHOP fans, but this location is just bad. Our server told us the cooks had been in training for the last 2 weeks... Glad I asked. Won't be going back. On the plus side, there's no wait on a Sunday morning. And the patio is bug-free."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is rated so low. We had a very nice brunch. The service was attentive, food was good: fresh, plentiful and tasty. We had to wait a bit, but hat only means things are being prepared to order. I've taken a star off for oily tables and the silverware that I instinctively wiped the moment I saw i"}
{"text":"The Best Ihop in Phoenix area. Always clean and delicious food. I loved going here when I lived in Scottsdale.
On weekends their is usually a line so you will need to make reservations"}
{"text":"Tyler, our waiter, is friendly and helpful. The tilapia seems a little more dry than at other IHOP's, but the plate was hot. Tyler made sure our drinks were always full even though he was very busy, checking on our needs throughout the meal. Our service from the waiter and manager were better than any IHOP I've ever been to before."}
{"text":"It is decent for what it is and I think sticking to the basics is where you can find a satisfying late night nosh. 


The food is alright. It's a fruit crepe with sausages, bacon and a sunny side up egg. Hard to screw up, but can also be made with \"love\" too which makes those ma and pa's better.... obviously breakfast chains do not put \"love\" into it, but just a consistent, expected standard. 

The service was alright. Refilled our drinks, seemed nice but held us check hostages for a few minutes.

Sometimes though, a crepe or a cheese blintze sounds good at 2am and you just gotta hop to IHOP."}
{"text":"Efrain was the best server ever! He was very attentive. The food came out quick and hot! He even offered warm syrup."}
{"text":"So we had dinner here last night; the service was slower than a herd of turtles stampeding through peanut butter, and I was even tempted to cancel our order and walk out, but we didn't.  We waited for our food and when it finally arrived it was very tasty, as is always the case at IHOP.  But the wait, oh holy cow that wait was something else...  I've been here numerous times in the past and never experienced a wait like that before.   They must've been training a new cook or something...

Also, annoyingly our waitress failed to mention that kids eat free between 4 and 8 PM and so not wanting to order a $4.00+ dinner for my toddler (who'd waste most of it by playing with it) I just had her eat off of my plate. We did order a kid's meal for our 6 year old son though.  It wasn't until we got to the register and we're told by the cashier told that kid's eat free every day between 4 and 8 PM, and that they'd take the cost of my son's dinner off of the bill.  That was nice to know after the fact, but it would have been VERY helpful to know that when we were ordering too.  That way I could have had more of my own food, instead of sacrificing about a quarter of it for my daughter to mash in her tiny fists and attempt to throw it on the floor. (I don't think she actually ate more than two tablespoons worth!)

My husband ordered the 'make your own omelet' deal with spinach and tomatoes and he absolutely loved it.  He raved about it afterwards.  Our son ordered a chocolate chip, smiley face pancake which he devoured, and I had the 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 bacon strips and hash browns combo dinner.  It was all very, very good.  

I'll tell you what, people can make all the high-brow comments they want about how IHOP is so pedestrian and mundane, but damn, they do pancakes PERFECTLY.  I'm not a food elitist, but I certainly know yummy food when I see it.  Let's be honest, I'm not going there for the hipster vibe, or to check in on Foursquare and take pictures of my food with Instagram, or because it's some cutesy boutique-fair trade-vege-soy-atarian-blah-blah-hip place that all the critics are swooning over.  Nope, I go there because their pancakes are delicious and their prices are reasonable.  You should go there too.

PS:  Their new cook (if that's what the problem was last night) better get their act together ASAP.  When a die-hard IHOP fan is contemplating canceling their dinner order and leaving over the wait then you are *officially* taking too damn long to deliver the food!"}
{"text":"AMBIANCE: 4 - This IHOP is a very busy location since it is on Maryland, near the college and airport and strip! There is always noise and some kind of wait involved! It looks like your regular, run-of-the-mill IHOP! 

SERVICE: 5 - I don't know about everyone else, but I always receive great service here! The waiters are always attentive to my needs, and they were constantly refilling my water.

FOOD: 3 - IHOP breakfast food is very average, it's not the best breakfast place. but it makes me really happy because of the traditionalism; it has the same taste as an IHOP in any other state! My food came out quickly (even due to the crowd) and it was hot and good!

--Local Specific Tips: sirloin tips and eggs are my fave :) Be prepared to sit down and wait a bit! They're always busy. If you don't see a syrup on your table, always ask; they have some in the back (like boysenberry)"}
{"text":"I really love IHOP because it's a family tradition, but in this location, the food is always sub-par and the service is slow! 

But let me tell you my regular meal: I always order a tropical island twist! it's a yummy, super sweet, sugary soda. 

Next, I get sirloin tips and eggs, with the eggs overeasy! It's always a good medium between breakfast and dinner!! it's an average place to be, where the food is average, but you can ALWAYS rely on their pancakes and syrup to brighten your life. They have the best pancakes!"}
{"text":"AMBIANCE: 3 - This is an average ihop, there really isn't anything special other than the normal. It's a bit dirty at times, but manageable! 

SERVICE: 3 - The service is okay, though they are kind of on the slow side! They are very polite and kind at this location. 

FOOD: 2 - this is one of those iHOPs that don't serve the best quality food! Today, my eggs were cooked inside instead of over easy, and the sirloin tips are too sweet! 

Local Specific Info: As always, you pay at the front after eating. Their heater is nice and warm during winter time!"}
{"text":"Horrible service . We had a miserable waitress that took 10min just to take our order, and while she was taking our orders she had this pissed look on her face like she was pissed to be working today. 12/26/17 10:30am . She didn't check if we needed refills, we had no silverware napkins , nothing ! I had to get up and ask for a different server because this \"waitress\" just didn't give a crap. Also our food was COLD , my eggs I ordered sunny side up and they were practically undercooked, I couldn't even eat them. This is the worst ihop I've ever been to . Don't come here!!!"}
{"text":"(4/16/17)
We come here a couple times a month for breakfast. Ellen is my favorite waitress. I usually get beef tips and pancakes yum! Recently I tried something new strawberry crepes! Yum! My new favorite! All the food is good! Only thing I've found I don't like is the strawberry splash drink. Maybe more of a kid drink. 
The restaurant is always clean. Usually a short wait time. Balloon guy is a fun bonus. Kids love the balloon master peices. 
My father-in-law has to use a walker. I'm impressed that your staff always goes out of their way to seat him in a booth close to the door. Your staff rocks! See you next Saturday!"}
{"text":"Poorly structured IHOP which is inexcusable for a developed chain. We arrived on a prime time breakfast schedule and there is only one server for the establishment. Managerial support was lacking if at all present.

 It took 15 minutes to get sat and 20 minutes to receive drinks.

I would have been better off sitting in a McDonalds drive thru twice and received better customer service in my car than sitting in this IHOP booth in the future."}
{"text":"My aunty's toast was burnt, my husband food was cold, we didn't get our oj and water and only saw the waitress two and had to ask for the waitress twice."}
{"text":"I'm not big on giving out one star reviews, but this IHOP deserves it. Bad service definitely makes your meal feel like it tastes not that good. But what really agitated me was that my mom chocked on her food bit and spit her coffee out and I'm pretty damn sure that somebody saw but not a single employee did anything. Some server dropped by and left extra napkins but just walked away. No one asked if she was okay but no one cared. Finally our server dropped by and asked if everything was \"ok\". I went to the bathroom before leaving and it was disgusting. Sink was taking forever to drain and it looked extremely gross, I can't imagine what the women's restroom is like. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 iced teas, I noticed they all had white flakes floating in the drinks. I thought it was the way it was brewed. However, when we ordered waters there was MORE white flakes swimming around in every cup. It was BAD. Absolutely disgusting, it almost looked little dissipated flakes of toilet paper. Absolutely unsanitary and completely appetite suppressing. After we voiced our opinions, they took the glasses back to the kitchen to examine them. They all laughed about it while looking back at our table. 

There was also a server who we waived down for little things and he would stare at you rudely and not say anything when you asked for something. Then when he'd grab what you needed and you'd say thank you, no replies. Just nasty facial expressions. 

If you love unsanitary drinks (and probably food) along with unprofessional staff this is the best place to go! Eat up!"}
{"text":"Wow! Crowded, but got seated right away!  Waitress was very attentive.  I didn't have to even get her attention for a refill on my drink.  The food was ok, I just got pancakes, eggs and bacon.  My husband  got French toast eggs and bacon, I must say, I think it was worth $28.00  I think I will think twice about going here again for that price!"}
{"text":"Food was consistent with other IHOPs. Slow service, unfriendly staff. Will not come back to this location."}
{"text":"I don't go into IHOP looking for a Tour de force for the tastebuds, clean bathrooms, or even a coffee cup without any lipstick stains on it. But, service should bad in the very least. Not sure how the service is because no one served us. One star because they have a roof and tables. We got up and left after waiting for 10 minutes to receive our drinks. It was not busy."}
{"text":"It's ihop people, not some home town local diner where the staff greets everyone by name. Now it is on the crappy part of the strip that's near the bum part of town in between downtown Vegas so be prepared to see some weirdo walking around the area especially if you go late night.

I walked over from my hotel on a Friday morning just to get some breakfast. Like you'd expect from an ihop in a tourist town it was really busy. The place looked like it held maybe 50-65 people & there were about 30 people waiting. The host told me a wait for 2 would be about 15 minutes. We got seated in that time frame, placed our order in about 5 minutes, & the food showed up 7 minutes later. We were in & out of there in about 30 minutes. For as busy as that place was they did a good job of turning over tables & getting people fed without a long wait. IHOP isn't the place where you want to have BS conversations with your friends while you soak up the environment. You want to eat & get on with your day & that's exactly what we got from them."}
{"text":"So after eating at this IHOP, I now know why the place was pretty much empty. And why it took so long to get our food is still a mystery. My hash browns were practically raw, the eggs were just gross, and they even managed to burn the toast. The only reason they aren't getting one star is because the server was nice."}
{"text":"While there are other, better breakfast places to go, there is just something fun to me about going to an IHOP every now and then.  The food is pretty good, their prices are reasonable and they're always coming up with new ways to make pancakes exciting.
They actually have a half way decent lunch menu too. 
So next time you're cruising down the street and see an IHOP, don't just drive on by, stop and have a meal, you may just thank me."}
{"text":"Upon arrival we were told the wait would be about 25 minutes, it was only about a 10 minute wait! Our server was very friendly and greeted us promptly and brought our drinks out right away and then took our food order. Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time and was hot. My husband had the breakfast sampler and I had the breakfast combo, the stuffed French toast was amazing and I would highly recommend it. Over all great service and great experience. I would definitely go back. Over all the facility was also clean and welcoming."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly and fast.  There are the occasional crazy people that walk in and raise hell and she was something else on the morning I visited, but that is downtown Phoenix for you. 

Menus were a little sticky, the waitress was 10 years past retirement and my breakfast was delish.  IHOP never disappoints."}
{"text":"Good stuff but only worth it with coupons for free entree when you buy one and it is still pricey, they really get you on the price of the coffee."}
{"text":"I went to ihop this morning with my boyfriend! The server was very friendly for it being 5 am. The food was good and it was a very pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"OMG! How does this place stay open??  If I could only give 1/2 star, I would, but only because they did respond to our complaints in a somewhat satisfactory manner and the servers were courteous, but very slooooooow.  But as far as the food goes, I wouldn't give them any credit.  The mashed potatoes on the fried chicken plate was like cement....dry and obviously instant.  The gravy looked as though it was scraped off of the prior patron's plate, and the chicken was chewy and probably last week's.   Oh, and the biscuit was literally hard as a rock.  We banged it on the table and it didn't break!  The tilapia plate was just as bad, except for the fresh slice of toast.  They did eventually bring replacement sides, but the anticipation of what we would get made the wait even worse.  

While I understand late night service is rarely great, there is absolutely no excuse for this kitchen's complete disregard for quality control.  Robert Irvine to the rescue!"}
{"text":"Seriously under trained staff, no manners or suggestions. Dirty restaurant. Wow. Fire the manager, I don't care how cheap you got him for."}
{"text":"I've dined at this Ihop plenty of times, and never had problems until just recently. A month ago a couple of friends and I dined there at midnight and we all got our food and one of my friends didn't. It took a whole hour for my friend to receive her food after of course we were all done eating and ready to pay. Apparently the cook was too \"overwhelmed\" with all of our orders to keep up. So that was a bit bothersome until the next time I went to eat there which was about a week ago when I found a nice long black hair on top of my French toast. The waitress said she would discount my ticket but then of course \"forgot\" after she rung me up. That will be the last time I eat at that Ihop. The night cook can't get orders out in a reasonable amount of time or keep his hair off of my food so It's safe to say I'm done with that location."}
{"text":"Was ok ... Kinda greasy stale taste on top of the horrendous smell of syrup maple stench when you walk in ... Pretty sure I lost my appetite just from the moment we made it past the front door ... and that's not exaggerating.. anyhow service was horrible prob will never visit ihop or at least this particular location ... Maybe all ihops in general. .what evs... Tomorrow is another day and another day will bring better breakfast ....at least I hope. ."}
{"text":"So I gues I will start out with what occupies by mind so with that being said ... on the yelp page for Ihop I noticed the red box which says Today is a national holiday.... wow I must not be in the know about this that and the other but I'm pretty sure Valentines Day is for sure not a national holiday but I could be wrong. Just had to mention this because its left me right and then left .... right and left... more left me thinking I need a serious update with the ever changing world we live in or have I been asleep at times when I really should have been awake.... hummmm so this location is centrally located in central Phoenix a lovely hotspot I call home... this particular location is conveintly located just north of Downtown Phoenix.... nice! Lots of parking and friendly staff always clean!!"}
{"text":"I used to eat at an IHOP on the east coast when I was a pre-teen.
I used to go all the time and the food was always good, and still is.
But, when I was young, 1. My appetite was smaller, and 2. I never paid the bill. 
So I decided to bring back some old memories, and go to the one right near my house.
I ordered breakfast. I had a an omelet, toast, bacon, hash browns, and a short stack of pancakes. Sounds like a decent amount of food, right?
The portions were so small, that I could have ordered it twice, and still had room for desert.
I figured, \"Okay, well I'm obviously bigger now, and my appetite has followed in-kind.\"
But then I got the bill...
With an iced tea, it came out to be more than $20 including the tip.
Like I said, the food is good, but the value is severely lacking."}
{"text":"When you're hungry at 2am after a long night of fun, this is definitely the place to go. The country fried steak breakfast, with chocolate pancakes cooked with bacon INSIDE and topped with a full can of whip cream is the perfect way to end a perfect night. 

Generous portions, and endless cups of coffee. What's not to love...."}
{"text":"So my family and I are trying to enjoy our meals while a group of customers on the other side of the incredibly small dining room are having a loud conversation, taking calls via their cell phone speakers, and listening to YouTube videos on their phones.  I tell our server about it and the manager is then informed.  When the manager walks past the group to investigate, they're not being noisy so nothing is said.  The noise then picks up again and our server comes by to drop off our check.  We're told that our meal is comped by 50%, which I'll obviously take, but that nothing was being done about the noise because the manager didn't hear anything.  So my complaint was without merit and the loud group shouldn't have been told that other customers were complaining about the noise they were making?!  What an incompetent manager!  The food was merely meh.  Other than the noise issue, our server was fine."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend had an early breakfast here and we had a great visit. Kristinn was our server she did an amazing job. We'll be coming to this location a lot more because of her thank you for your attentiveness. The food was pretty good and my favorite part the oj was delicious we even got some to go!!"}
{"text":"Awful service!! Took over 20 minutes to take our order (Abel was our supposed 'waiter') then it came out about 40 minutes later burnt! Awful service, disgusting food! We ended up leaving when we saw our food since the bacon was burnt beyond repair and the omelette looked less than appetizing.  I've gone to other IHOP locations that are much better in serving their customers! Avoid at all costs!!"}
{"text":"We never, ever have good service here.  About a year ago, we waited at the hostess stand for so long that we decided to leave.  When we got to our car and put it in reverse, all of a sudden, a waitress comes knocking on my window!  It scared the living daylights out of me and made me almost feel sorry for her.  I guess times really ARE hard when a waitress comes outside and figuratively begs for her lost tip.

Anyway, I was dismayed when that same waitress ended up at our table last night.  It was obvious why we waited so long to be seated during the previous visit.... she was slooooooow and seemed completely oblivious to my agitation.  There were only two tables in the whole restaurant, so a glass of water shouldn't take 15 minutes to deliver.  Ugh.  

The three stars are for the STEAK TIPS.  Oh my, they are good.  Whether you get them as a breakfast platter or a dinner platter is irrelevant.  The sides don't matter at all either way.  I haven't actually had more tender, flavorful, and consistently good steak tips anywhere else.  I don't say that lightly either - I'm a carnivorous sort of lady.

So come here if you've got all night to waste, because it's probably gonna take that long to get your order.  But if you order the steak tips, it'll be worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Went to have a late breakfast at about 9:30 P.M. Chicken Florentine Crepes were amazing and service was still spot on. Usually that late at night the service tends to wain. Good job and great food."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had with a restaurant. Theresa was our  waitress and was nice at first, but all she did was take our order and drop off the check. No refills, no checking up, nothing. Then I woke up the next morning with food poisoning from my  chicken. Thanks IHOP."}
{"text":"When I come to Vegas with my mom, this is usually our go to spot for breakfast or lunch. It's easy for her to move around and the service is always good. 

When we walked in, we were seated immediately. There wasn't much of a line.. Just a few people waiting to pay for their food. 

I ended up going with the Pancakes, eggs and bacon combo. Mom had the same. No complaints there.

If I had to recommend anything, I just wish the lemonade would be sweeter. Kind of tastes like water.

But we'll definitely be back. You can count on that!"}
{"text":"Gross!!! There were tables all around filled with people's left overs and trash and weren't cleaned up the entire time we were there. No one should have to eat around trash. 

Our server took FOREVER to get to us and when he did come around he was full and disinterested in us or doing his job. It took 30 minutes to get waters and coffee, ridiculous! We didn't get straws, I don't know who or what has touch my glass, I'm not putting my lips on that glass. There was a couple that came in after us and ordered after yet got there food well before us. How does that happen, we order probably about 10 minutes before them. 

This was a very disappointing experience at IHOP!"}
{"text":"I've given this place several tries since it opened and each time has been awful. I'm done. Most recently, we went around 11:30 on  Sunday morning. We were seated right away. The server came to take our drink order 10 mins later. I asked her a question about what a menu item included (kids' silly named pancake)since it wasn't spelled out on the menu. She told us \"I think strawberries\" and walked away. She came back to take our order 15 mins later. I ordered the said pancakes and asked her to check on the strawberries and if they were not included to add some if possible or let us know so my daughter could order something else. Still didn't receive our drinks. After another 10 mins went by I flagged down a random worker and asked to see our server for our drinks. She brought them over then. Another 15 mins went by and our food came out. There were no strawberries, of course. We were really hungry and decided to just let it go. I asked for drink refills, utensils and ketchup. After 10 mins we didn't receive any of those w/our full plates of food sitting in front of us and no utensils to eat with. I got up and helped myself to utensils, ketchup and napkins and another table near us followed me. She never came back with any of those things. A few mins later she went by and said \"you okay?\" as she kept on walking by. Our food was just eh. Maybe it would have been better warm. I asked for well done bacon and it was slimy and rubbery. I was supposed to get 3 pieces of french toast but got 2. I added cheese on my eggs and there wasn't any. We waited so long to see her gain to get our bill that I seriously considered just leaving. When I finally flagged her down and asked for our bill I just got a receipt kind of thing with the total- not an itemized bill. I paid it and just left. It was such a long, terrible, experience that we just wanted to get out of there and I didn't ask to speak to a manager about any of this. I don't expect much from this kind of place but this is so bad that I won't give them anymore of my money."}
{"text":"Came here last Friday for a team lunch 2/10/2012. The service wasn't that bad and was pretty good. I ordered their new burger, the bacon n beef bacon burger. It was pretty good and tasty. The patty was cooked well done and I enjoyed it to the last bite."}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars.

I was last in Las Vegas a couple of years ago. I didn't manage to review a bunch of places that I had visited. It happens when there is a ton to explore in Vegas!

On Independence Day, I was watching the fireworks at the Stratosphere. My friend flew in from Denver. I headed over to the airport after the fireworks were over and traffic started to decongest. 

After picking her up at arrivals, we headed over to this IHOP for a bite to eat. We both hadn't had dinner.

I wanted pancakes. I saw the cinnamon roll ones on the menu and knew that I wanted to have them. I also got scrambled eggs, sausage links, and hashbrowns. 

I loved the pancakes. They had a decent cinnamon flavour. They were yummy with maple syrup. 

My eggs and sausage were delicious. I have never been huge on hashbrowns. I don't like them super crispy, so I left the crispy parts and ate everything else. 

This place was fairly quiet at midnight. The food is decent for this hour. It's what you expect at an IHOP.

{"text":"My one star rating is for the employee who was off the clock, dining in the restaurant. 
My server, I can't recall his name but he is hard of hearing, definitely gets 5 stars from me. 
The employee that was off the clock (don't know his name but he's a skinny, tall, African American male) he proceeded to walk behind the counter where the employees are only allowed to go. My server told him politely he can't be back there. And this guy freaked out and caused such a scene!!! 
He screamed \"I can do whatever the f*** I want.\" The cook came out to see what was going on and the off the clock employee cursed at him repeatedly and threatened to fight him. Even at 4 in the morning, the place was pretty filled up with customers. I'm sorry but when I go to a restaurant to enjoy some good food with my significant other, I don't want to see or hear some stuck up egotistical pretentious asshole try to fight everyone in the building just because he isn't allowed in the back while he's off the clock. Which is understandable, because when I saw him walk in the employee section, I was wondering why this customer thought he was entitled to go back there to fill his drink. He showed 0 respect for the customers, 0 respect for the staff, and he screamed \"I MAKE MORE MONEY THAN ALL Y'ALL HERE\" ... really dude. You work at IHOP. And with that attitude I don't see why anyone would tip you. 
So the off chance I do come here again, and I get this guy as my server, I'll write a big fat 0 on the tip line since he \"makes more money than all y'all\" anyway. IHOP why are you hiring these people? The employees don't deserve to have to work and deal with an asshole like this guy. And to whom this review is about, I hope you see this. Show some class and respect. Nobody owes you anything. Respect is earned, not a right. Double middle finger to you, sir. ;)"}
{"text":"Good for big loud parties without having the servers hushing you.  Food is ok but we come here because it's a great place to eat and chill with a big group after a long night.  Servers have always been nice and patient with us being loud and sometimes un-decisive.

As one who is trying to keep my weight down, I order nothing but the spinach omelette which also comes with buttermilk pancakes and you can add your choice of toppings for an additional $1.49.

I also tried their sirloin tips recently.....eh stay away from it, wasn't that good."}
{"text":"Waitress Mickey was awesome. Her personality is the hit of the place ! Place needs an extreme makeover thou. Check out the seats. Ya think they can fix this. Food is good thou"}
{"text":"So for a National chain you'd think they'd be consistent-not the case with this newly built IHOP. It really is about the people you hire and customer experience.  We started going here a few months ago due to limited options close to Vistancia. I'm finding out that it's worth it to drive away from this area to dine out.  The service and food is getting consistently more subpar at this location.  Time before this the servers were terrible. Then Stopped in for breakfast on a slow Friday morning once again.  Ordered French toast and the menu said it was served with powdered sugar and butter, which I've ordered several times before.  The waiter proceeded to tell me that it's now served with bananas but I can order it plain?!?  What?  The menu states otherwise....and I'm thoroughly confused.  I said \"ok, plain then\"?  What the hell?? My friend ordered his hash browns slightly crispy.  Food came out awful!  French toast was plain - no butter, no nothing!  Hash browns burnt! Waiter couldn't care less - he never came back- he only dropped off the check early \"in case he might get busy\" he says! No one refilled our drinks. Manager didn't care when notified- our whole meal should have been comped. Needless to say I won't be stepping foot in  IHOP again.  One star for food and service! Save yourself the hassle and drive out of the area to eat."}
{"text":"The service was bad. The waiter got us our drinks once. We got our food 30 minutes later and then we got a refill on our drinks. Not coming to this one again."}
{"text":"I have not been to IHOP in a long time and this one has just opened. Not off to a great start with me. I've been here 30 minutes and just got my food. I waited about 10 minutes to be seated, glad the phone rang so the lady finally saw I was here. Got my lip stick stained coffee cup to greet me at the table. I ordered the steak tips breakfast. After about 7 minutes was told it takes longer to cook the steak. Now I've been on the restaurant business for a long time. And this place just opened about 2 weeks ago. I know you don't do this to people until after you've been open at least six months. Good luck everyone."}
{"text":"Worst Ihop I have ever been to. Took an hour and 15 minutes to get cold food. Ran by a bunch of kids. Beware!!!!"}
{"text":"First: Portions still aren't right for the price you pay on breakfast items, second: the service is usually okay but they always forget something... Literally every time I've come here the last 13 years they have forgotten -something-. But third: the worst part about my most recent visit, was the restroom. Two of the three women's restroom stalls had unflushed waste in them. And they had been sitting in there for so long the entire restroom reeked! The stench was so bad you could smell it outside the freaking door.. Idk why some women are so nasty. Flush  your sh**. You flush at home, right? Okay don't leave your crap in a public restroom, it's rude. If you stop up the toilet they'll fix it later, just don't leave your poop there to stink up the whole restroom for everyone else to smell. 

I'm thinking I should lower my expectations of people and restaurants these days, because I'm just going to end up disappointed.. as always  The food always tastes fine and the servers are usually very polite. Just don't go here with any \"expectations\", then hope you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I had the Californian scrambled eggs and my husband did the build-a-breakfast. The food was quite good. We had chocolate chip pancakes as well, which were fluffy, moist, and warm. The place was not too clean, though, and the servers were curt. Whatever you do, don't order tea here. They give you warm water and random black specks masquerading as a tea bag, all with cold milk. Also, there was a gentleman at this establishment who had possibly the worst hygiene I have ever seen in a restaurant. Totally threw off my appetite."}
{"text":"Do not try to split the check on 2 credit cards that seems to be an impossible task for the staff of this IHOP to accomplish. It took about 30 min and I ended up having to pay in cash because they could not figure it out. No compensation or discount was offered."}
{"text":"I'm not big on IHOP but was hungry and figured what the heck......

It didn't take long to to be seated nor to place our order......however when we did get our food we have an utensils I had to get up and grab from another table only after a mgr or sup. Saw me do it did they offer me more utensil....really after I got what needed....the food as expected good....the iced coffee however was left to be desired.....did taste good at all and cost $3.99 with free refills which I never received btw .....when asked if everything was good I said it could've been better and to the response of oh.....never coming back to an IHOP again....this not an acceptable way to respond to people that don't get or find everything good....service could've been better...plus there weren't that many guest eating the restaurant"}
{"text":"The stars are for our server Tenny. 
We were there on New Year's Eve for breakfast. The place was packed and the average wait time was 30 minutes. Tenny was serving several tables at once, she was very polite, professional and attended every table with a smile. 
Throughout our meal she checked in with us several times making sure we were doing ok. 
If you ever visit this IHOP make sure to ask for Tenny."}
{"text":"Giving a one star rating because
It's 10am and we sat down at 930am
It's eggs and pancakes not steak and lobster. 

What the heck is taking so long??

The restaurant is only half full too.
Glad it wasn't full.

Very disappointed."}
{"text":"A reasonably priced decent all you can eat cod fish fry. Friendly  staff - ask for Jerron!"}
{"text":"Good food for a decent price. A burger may be basic, but the cheeseburger at this IHOP was amazing."}
{"text":"Very slow. Ordered a mushroom cheese omelet and it had no mushrooms! Waitress says, \"we're out of mushrooms.\" What? Don't tell me, just deliver it WITHOUT A MAJOR INGREDIENT. Coworker had chocolate chip pancakes; same thing; delivered even though out of chocolate sauce. How about checking with us first? Idiots."}
{"text":"Went in around 130 in the morning and waited for 10 minutes to be seated.  Male waiter took me to my seat and I waited another 10 minutes for him to ask if I wanted something to drink.  After watching him stand and talk with other tables for another 10 minutes I left.  This guy only had a couple tables, terrible service won't be back."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm soo good i love the splash berry drinks and the omlets r so packed"}
{"text":"Not to satisfied with the service had to waive down another waiter just to place our order after sitting for about 20 minutes then when it came to the food we waited about another 30 minutes and couldn't wait any longer therefore we left!"}
{"text":"Wow we had a great breakfast here this morning the food was great the service was great it was crowded but it went fast nice people working there great coffee gave me some to go and OJ was also good I recommend this place highly way better than sunrise in South Concord the kannapolis sunrise is ok"}
{"text":"When you think of IHOP you don't imagine what you experience at this particular one. The repeated awful service ruins it every time. Ignored at tables for long stretches, wrong or missing orders, some food is not hot when it arrives. I swear some of the staff must be on drugs by the way they behave. I went a couple times when it first opened and again recently in hopes that it would have improved but it hasn't. Stay away. Find an alternative."}
{"text":"For a few reasons this location has been me and my boyfriend's go-to location: it's a few miles from where we live, the food has been consistently well-cooked, the service has been prompt, they offer 20% off your bill with a AAA card, and the manager (older, hispanic woman) has always been friendly."}
{"text":"My family & I have been eating here since they opened this location. We usually have a great experience. Unfortunately, due to a negative manager, we will be taking our business elsewhere until the owners make some changes. We waited ONE hour before finally just walking out on a Sunday early afternoon. The manager, Austin, was so rude & inconsiderate, it was obviously a waste if our time to try & engage him when asking why they weren't seating us. I even sent an email to IHOP's Corporate Office I was so disappointed... I have yet to receive a response to our unfortunate experience. Spend your money elsewhere, where customers are treated with kindness & respect & restaurant managers are positive representations of a good business."}
{"text":"Server messed up entire order, food wasn't that great and it took forever. probably my last time coming to this location."}
{"text":"So here it is 4 30 AM, and the only thing I can see open is Ihop. I'm greeted with a friendly welcome, as we share some humor of me being their only customer at this hour. I have to say the coffee is amazing, and the food was cooked perfectly. I was expecting a Denny's type restaurant but I was shocked, Great job!! Thank you ihop for making my early morning breakfast Awesome!!"}
{"text":"Waiting room full of people but staff was seating people as quickly as they'd come in. Our party (of 3) was sat within 3 minutes. Server got us drinks right away, took our order and it was out in no time. My drink never got low, and an empty plate never sat on the table for more than 1 minute. Manager came around checking service and telling us about upcoming Halloween events for the kids. Very polite staff. We'll definitely visit this location again."}
{"text":"Once again visited IHOP! First time coming in Monday and the breakfast and service was great!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Food did not come out the way it should have. Eggs undercooked and mush, bacon not crispy. They ran out of food for our order but didn't tell us until way after we had ordered. Told my waiter about my food and he just took it away and didn't offer to fix it or ask if there was anything else I wanted. Will not be going to this IHOP again."}
{"text":"I don't expect much from diners, but GEEZ give me a break!  We went on a Saturday morning and yes it was busy but ALL 3 meals were COLD as ice and my husbands eggs weren't over easy, they were over raw.  I expect over easy eggs to be runny and maybe some white portions not perfect but they were clear!  I almost lost it while watching him try to eat around it.  My daughter's pancakes were cold, my french toast was cold and none of it could even melt the butter a little bit.  When they ask if everything's ok they are literally walking past and you just know if you asked to heat it up who knows when you might get it back and how it would be then.  It was a big disappointment because really, how hard is it to get warm french toast and pancakes at an IHOP?  So so sad..."}
{"text":"It's consistent with other ihops. Ate breakfast here w my friends this morning and we enjoyed the food and service."}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times. I've never had an issue. Every time I go they are quick with the service and pleasant. However, today I tried to call in an order for pick up because I didn't want to go and sit there by myself. That changed my view of them completely. The first time I called I was asked to hold for placing my order. Eight minutes later I hung up and immediately called back and was asked again to hold again, and I said, sure I don't mind holding but please don't make it eight minutes like the last girl. she said OK I'm sorry just a minute. I hung up six minutes later. There is no reason for me to have to wait 15 minutes on hold just to say I want an order of the 2 x 2 x 2. I don't know if I'm going to go back after this. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Was hoping for a great experience

My seven year-old is an IHOP fanatic. She'll notice every one we pass by and wax poetic about the chocolate smiley face pancakes. So, we were really hoping this store would be great since it's a long trek to the others in the Valley and our visit was a reward for our daughter having a good performance.

On the positive, the service people were very nice. VERY SLOW, but very nice. 

Beyond that, my daughter barely ate her pancakes as she said they didn't taste good. Similarly, my wife and I commented to each other that the food was off in taste and temperature.  

The delay being seated, long stretches between visits by our waitress, and time waiting for our bill added up. Syrup containers were super sticky. Booth seats were a tad messy. And we had to ask twice about the kids eating free to get things to register correctly. 

This IHOP isn't bad. It's just missing the service speed and attention to detail to make it a place you want to stop in at for a meal."}
{"text":"The first time I had my Scrambled eggs not fully cooked I let it slide since I had pancakes to devour but after a couple visits after that and my eggs looked like they rinse them off with water. 
I'm a very patient guy and I love sitting here enjoying my multiple cups of coffee but that experience easily led me to think that they all about quantity versus quality. When I complained about my eggs all I got was \"oh I'm sorry I'll tell my manager\" but my bill remained the same...

This was my favorite spot to just chill, relax and drink my coffee. Very upsetting!"}
{"text":"I love crepes.  More importantly, I love crepes in the middle of the night, served with eggs and hash browns and a giant carafe of coffee.

You wouldn't normally think of IHOP as a five-star kinda joint, but for what it is, this IHOP gets five stars.  It's clean, the service is good, the food is good, and I can go there anytime I want to get my yummy crepe fix.  Sure, I can get a better, more authentic crepe at Le Oui Oui Cafe in Ohio City, but it's further away and not open in the wee hours of the morning when crepes taste the best.

They also have a wide selection of omelettes, french toast, and other breakfast foods, oh, like PANCAKES, for example, in case I wasn't clear about that.  I was blinded by my crepe craving.  Though to be fair, you probably should know that already.

So yeah.  Yum.  I love IHOP."}
{"text":"Would be good if they would fill your drinks. Or bring your food after 30min. Terrible service!!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible experience! Waited 20 minutes for a table. Ok, no problem. It took 40 minutes to have our order taken. Had to ask twice for waters. Then after waiting another hour, we finally got up and left because Al, the server, said they still hadn't even started making our food. The place was full and horribly staffed. 2 seating hostesses...3 bus people....and 3 servers in the entire restaurant. No manager on scene at all, even after we requested to speak to them. Get your act together, management team! Your staff does not deserve this crap."}
{"text":"Eric is the best ! Treats his customers with kindness and great customer service. Unfortunately the past couple times I've gone and haven't gotten him have been not so so good. One of the times my waitress brought out our food and then disappeared within the time being, but my stuffed french toast was totally burnt on the bottom and i couldn't tell her about it because she was gone for a good 20 minutes :( we were also given a new waiter who seemed totally lost and possibly not properly trained and we would have to repeat ourselves to him a couple times about most things. Recently the thing that got to me was when i ordered my crepe combo, i was given one crepe and after i talked to a waitress about it she stated that it only comes with one.. i have ordered this multiple times dude, not cool but i just left it because they were really busy that night."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time but then they dropped a bomb an discontinued one of my favorite plates..... The International Club. I thought all restaurants like these had at least one version of a club on their menu but that doesn't seem to be the case here anymore. Aren't club sandwiches a staple food for diners? Oh well :(
They did remodel the whole restaurant awhile back but I haven't been back since the so called \"Improvements.\""}
{"text":"Always dirty. Utensils not clean,service is awful. Kids, babies constantly screaming and crying,bad.  Homeless hanging around,sleeping, bothering people for $$$$.awful"}
{"text":"Nasty dirty place! Coffee cup was dirty when it was brought out. 2 silverware setups were dirty. Bathroom had no soap and toilet paper rolls all over the floor. 
We had already ordered our food, but decided to save ourselves from hours of stomach pain and left. 
And the service was terrible to boot
Unbelievable"}
{"text":"Our experience with IHOP was great from start to finish. The lady who took our order didn't miss a thing with our order. we were impressed with their service. we would highly recommend this area to anyone considering a place to eat. -very please and quite area."}
{"text":"Great place to eat when you are headed back to CA. Place was packed and they sat us as soon as we came in. Service was good. Food was fresh!"}
{"text":"I came on a weekday AM, not busy, about 10 servers standing around wiping down chairs.  The server we had seemed to have all the tables and no help.  The food was not so great, very greasy with a weird taste.  The service wasn't so good, not because the server was bad, but because she had no help, even though they were fully staffed.  Just not a place I would recommend, I'd rather go to McDonald's down the street honestly."}
{"text":"There is usually a wait here, mostly on weekends, but this Sunday we were seated right away.  The service here is always quick and friendly.  I have never had any issues with my food or quality of service.  I ordered 2x2x2 which is eggs, sausage, and pancakes.  I like to use the different flavored syrups and strawberry is my fav.  This location is closest to my house and I will be back to visit."}
{"text":"We walked in there and my God what a mess; there were five or six tables unbussed because obviously employees did not show up the day before Memorial Day. We've been in there before when the server was so stoned that they couldn't even function. That place needs to be nuked ;-)"}
{"text":"This IHOP is my favorite IHOP to go to! Very friendly employees! Make my visit fun and interesting cuz they all conversate with you and it's nice. Specifically Ernie, he's an amazing employee man won't mess up and if he does its all good he'll take care of you no matter what. He's a people person as well. Very clean store as well"}
{"text":"Bad service. Waited 30 minutes to get served. Received the wrong order and everyone ate all their food at my table before I got my meal. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Not sure if they were understaffed but waited 30 minutes to get greeted and the restaurant was empty.  Then waited another hour for our food after being told they didn't have avocado which was ok asked to substitute with something else food came with no substitute and meal was missing a hash brown when we told the waitress she said she was tired of yelling at the cook bad service won't be going there again"}
{"text":"Someone else attempted a haiku about this IHOP location. I thought I would also take a stab:

International
It may not be to most folks
But it beats BK

This is another one of those places near work that I end up at from time to time, and since I have been catching up on those restaurants I thought I would say a few words.  I generally take a half hour lunch, so I don't get here as often as some of the other places since it is a full service restaurant. But honestly, I have never had a terrible experience here--other than the last time I was there when I could not get a refill on my ice water for love nor money.

But still, compared to the surrounding establishments you get decent food at a good price. Service is usually pretty good. It is clean enough. Good enough to come back from time to time since it is walking distance. 

And it does beat that hideous BK up the block."}
{"text":"Quick, majority breakfast menu. Kind of an old place, staff looks questionable but what you would expect from an ihop."}
{"text":"Diana was our waitress today and she was a doll!! The food is mediocre at best, but the service was very good. Because I cannot eat bread she was kind enough to offer options in lieu of bread and pancakes even though I told her it was okay. Coffee was okay and I'm glad we asked if there was any flavored creamer because they had vanilla, hazelnut and Irish cream - they just didn't put on table until we asked  -Only regular cream. 

Parking lot is small but fits size of the restaurant. We were hungry and food came fast. Diana made the experience the best."}
{"text":"One star does not do this location justice. No stars would be much better! Show up on Sunday with my family around 1-2pm. We were greeted at the door with smiles and hi how are you doing. That was about the extent of where the pleasantries stopped.  After our 15 minute wait(which wasn't bad), we were seated, our drinks were brought to us, and orders taken. Here is where we started to have problems. 
It took our food over FOURTY FIVE MINUTES to be brought to us. Saw two couples get up and leave without paying because they never got their food. Can't blame them honestly! No clue what the hold up was either! They were empty tables all around us. So it wasn't like they were busy! And not to mention, any time you'd take a glance around the restaurant, there were no waiters or waitresses to be found! Now once they brought us our food, they still forgot to bring my sandwich also. Which took another 10-15 minutes of waiting. 
I promise you this. I will never be coming back to this IHOP again! Can't even pay me to go here! 

Oh and by the looks of other reviews for this location. Seems to be the same experience other people are having as well. Hm, makes you wonder why this location is even still in business."}
{"text":"Poor service. Understaffed, and the staff did not seem to care. For a table of two, we are still waiting on our food as I type this. It's been close to about 35 minutes now. Waitress had to check 3 times to see if they had orange juice. Oh and the place is not even close to be packed. Wouldn't recommend this location for any occasion. Go elsewhere.

Update: finally got our food. It was cold and looks like it was thrown together at the last second. Speaking of thrown things. When the waitress brought us our food, she basically threw our food on the table and ran away before we could even ask her for butter. Seriously... go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Although the food is good, it's a shame every time we come to this location we have horrible service. It took 50mins to get our food and our server had only been to our table once and that was to take our order. After 45 minutes we requested to speak with a manager who was just as careless as our server. We told her about what happened and the only excuse was,\" well it was a 15min order.\" Ok I can understand if it was a longer order but I would have like to been told or warned about that. It was NOT busy at all! I had my family with me and my one year old was getting restless and they messed up his order to top it off. I'll make sure to NEVER come to this location again."}
{"text":"It's a tradition of mine to hit IHOP on the way out of a vacation if I'm driving in the morning for breakfast. So on the way out of Vegas we stopped here. 

There was a bit of a wait, but it was worth it for the strawberry's and cream crepes. Man, they were amazing. Service was also top notch. I've never understood low scores for IHOP. It's not a five star place, but it gives you five star quality breakfast's at least. Their lunch and dinner options are not what you come here for. 

Love IHOP and this location is another upstanding IHOP in the universe of the pancakes!"}
{"text":"Stopped for some pancakes and hashbrowns. The coffee was hot, hashbrowns warm and pancakes cold. By the time the server returned I had eaten all but two bites of pancakes. Server related that I would not be charged for the pancakes. The another person came to the table and related that since I ate the pancakes all he could do was give me a 20% discount. I wasn't concerned about the discount I was concerned that had the server checked on us before we had finished our meal I could have shared my concern earlier. Peace."}
{"text":"I am a big ihop fan although I rarely indulge given the portion size usually leading to an afternoon nap. However, we were on vacation and it seemed like an ideal time to indulge in a pancake fix wit a side of some egg concoction.

The waitress was prompt, professional and took and delivered our drink orders quickly.  We weren't as lucky in the food. The ordering was prompt but we waited about 25 minutes to have the food delivered. Unfortunately the pancakes were too brown and the syrup was cold. Omelettes were good so all was not bad, however, my pancake indulgence was severely disappointing."}
{"text":"Yuk! This Pineville location is gross!  Plus we waited an hour and 15 minutes for the wrong orders to come out. Spoke with the manager twice and he didn't seem to care about our situation as the place was busy and our server seemed ill equipped for the job and smelled like weed. So: avoid this place and cook breakfast at home, folks. Much love."}
{"text":"The waiter was great but he just could not do it all MR IHOP 
YOU had one server working the entire floor and one bus guy/ cashier
 Ordered The chicken dinner mashed potatoes....oops sorry we're out of mashed potatoes!!!!   They brought me fries instead. 
We asked form sugar free syrup....oops....OUT of sugar free syrup Mr IHOP

 My omelet was good .....


Just want you to know how you are doing."}
{"text":"Today (03/25/18) was probably the worst experience I had with IHOP.  And I didn't even eat. I placed an order by phone and arrive approximately 20 minutes later. Food not ready and they didn't even have my complete order. Supposedly they fixed it and had me wait and finally I got fed up and asked for my refund which took just as long as me waiting on my food. My entire lunch time was busted. They've messed up my orders in the past I should've knew better to give them another chance. Now I'm completely through with them.  Let's see how long it takes for my refund to post."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Haven't been here in years and now remember why. Ordered crepes and the photo in the menu showed two but served only with one, very misleading, shame on me for not clarifying. BTW.... crepes are flour, egg, baking soda and water...2 should not be a stretch. The combo was very weak and it they served it knowing it was wrong but did nothing to correct it. The philly cheese steak was dry... needed au jus to make it tolerable. Won't return!"}
{"text":"Longest wait I've ever had an IHOP online order. After 30 minutes past when it was supposed to be ready I had to go. So I asked if I can get a refund, it took 10 mins for someone to come help me get a refund and the food still wasn't ready. They told me someone will call me the next day and get me a refund so I walked out $10 less, no food, and 40 mins of wasted time."}
{"text":"My cousin and I came in this morning just to enjoy some yummy all you can eat pancakes. We were seated as soon as we got in...Given the fact that it was about 630am. When our server seated us, she didn't appear to be happy to be there and didn't even take the time to introduce herself. Through the course of our breakfast she didn't check on us once, she charged me a dollar for a small soufflé cup of whip cream(in all the years I've been going to IHOP I haven't been charged a penny), and as we were getting ready to leave I asked her for a to go box. Her response was super unappealing as far as her tone and her attitude. On our receipt I saw that her name was LAURA H. If you're reading this: I'm not sure if you had a rough start to your morning or whatever the case may be, but you should never bring that kind of attitude to work and especially make it apparent to your customers that you're having a crap day. I shouldn't have even tipped you the dollar that I did. Definitely would not have her as my server again."}
{"text":"Note: It doesn't look as if they're open 24 hours yet. As of now, they're open until 12am at the latest. 

After the less-than-stellar experience we had at our first Robinson IHOP visit (check my reviews), I was sent a $20 gift certificate upon filing a complaint through IHOP's website. Now as my second IHOP review will attest, our experience was improved, but we decided to use the gift certificate at this East End Hill location. Hey, it's new y'know?

Yeah, what a neighborhood for an IHOP. Ya think they'd have stuck it out in West Mifflin or Bethel Park. You know, out in the sticks? 

It's an itty bit tricky getting into the lot off the highway. Be careful.

I gotta say it: This IHOP beats the one in Robinson. The service was exemplary and as friendly as could be. Two workers who were on their way out greeted us and held the doors open for us. They aim to please here and seem to really, really want to make a good impression, which they did.

Our server Dave was attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and was terrific at his job overall. The entire staff seemed happy to be working there. There was a feeling that they all want this IHOP to take off. 

Based on our visit, it should be a flying Chinese dragon of a success. 

The place was way busier than the Robinson restaurant, yet no one seemed to miss a note. 

What did we order? Oh yeah...

I went with the simple pleasure of a Ham and Egg Melt with fruit on the side (why is their fruit so damn fresh and refreshing?), a Splashberry to drink, and a Banana Crepe for dessert. 

What else could I say about such fare? It was all...good, good stuff and served to illustrate why IHOP is becoming so popular. 

I still can't get over the scope of their menu. They have shrimp? Burgers? Steak?

I almost got steak and eggs, by the way.

Why do I feel like I'm at Diesel when I order an IHOP Splasher. I know more than a few people that would put some spirits in 'em.  

Lady Kay got the Corned Beef Hash and Chocolate Chocolate Chip Pancakes and liked them both. Maybe I can coax her to write a review. 

Yeah, this IHOP works for me. Stop in, and request Dave if you are able. He'll take care of you."}
{"text":"All righty, we came back here Friday night, and the service was much improved. Our server, Avery, was willing to work with me too.

She let me get the Spinach and Mushroom Omelet, with the fruit, and those Chocolate Chip Pancakes on the side complete with the choco- batter. 

The S&M Omelet, which so DID NOT come with whips and chains, was ok I guess. The hollandaise was a little bland. I almost ordered the Bacon Temptation again but wanted to try something different. 

The fruit bowl came before anything and was nicely palate-cleansing. This wasn't canned pears and peaches in syrup. Everything tasted as if it had been freshly cut to order. Grapes, orange slices, I forget what else (haw!), this is why I dig fruit salad. 

The true highlight was that stack of chocolate malevolence I had so looked forward to for years. I never knew a choco batter pancake was even possible. 

I, with Vic Frankenstein acting as my muse, attempted to create one at home once. It got up, ran out of the kitchen, knocked over a neighbor's shed, let out a horrid groan, and died. 

I kid my sad-sack culinary skills. But allegories aside, it didn't work out.

Once again, by belief that pancakes are dessert has been emboldened. These were soft, newly-baked, plate-sized, oooey, gooey, chocolate chocolate chip cookes, topped with a heap of whipped cream that nearly slid off the top until I intervened!

3 bites in, and I had achieved a cocophile's Nirvana, saving my late- night meal. 

Try the Splashers for something different beverage-wise. Many restaurants are doing this, and I applaud them for it. Splashers are mixed soft drinks. Of the two IHOP offers, I tried the Tropical Island Twist,which is lemonade, lemon-lime soda, and mango syrup. Glug, glug, aaahhh. 


Oh, I contacted management about my previous IHOP bop and have a gift certificate on the way. All is forgiven. Maybe I'll use it at the new one in Squirrel Hill. 

Unskinny hop just blows me away, unskinny hop hop, all night and day..."}
{"text":"An IHOP... Getting a 5-star review... An IHOP...  Wow.  I do have to say, the place was either remodeled or simply brand new.  The place was clean throughout, super busy, well staffed.  Our server (Chris, if I recall), was this totally awesome dude.  He was on top of everything the whole time we were there and made sure throughout our meal we had all items necessary, plus refills on our drinks.  The managers were informed of his exceptional service and they let us know they get compliments on him all the time.  Way to go IHOP!  And, the food was actually exceptional, for an IHOP.  I'd been to other locations over the last :??: decades, and food is just normal old chain restaurant food.  This actually was good!"}
{"text":"UPDATE! : This review was left while we waited. I've only moved it up another star based on my experience with the manager. I completely do understand, but my girlfriend sent her food back to the kitchen and part of the order was not correct or forgotten. I've never seen my girlfriend angry cry, but tonight was a first. We are thankful to the manager we spoke to and took care of us, but the two hour wait and the constant mess up along with the food that came out the kitchen that was unforgiving was what had it for the experience. Not to mention after we waited for our check and got up not one not two but THREE people walked pasted us (one of them did it twice) and saw us and never stopped to check us out. We hope to come back in the future and change our review, but this is where we stand. (5/6/17)

My girlfriend, her best friend and I stopped in around 1130 on a Saturday. While we understand that it is prom season, we waited about  30 min before my girlfriend got up to to ask someone who our server even is. The service is unbelievable ridiculous. My girlfriend has stated she will not be back to this location ever again. We nearly walked out. Brittany was nice, but it doesn't make up for the horrible customer service."}
{"text":"I haven't had a problem with the service,food Is good & servers are nice"}
{"text":"I came early on a Monday morning. I was quickly seated. The gentleman showed me to a booth that was nice and clean. He took my drink order and came back he got my order in and it came out really quick. I had a really good experience at this ihop."}
{"text":"This restraunt was super slow. It took awhile to be seated. We were the only 2 people waiting. The restraunt only had four tables of other customers. We waited for 15 minutes to get our drink order taken then 20 minutes for food to come after putting in our order. If your in a hurry don't come here because they won't be."}
{"text":"Love I hop food and the server was excellent. The reason for only 3 stars is the night manager stood over by the kitchen and stared at customers eating. Did she not have something to do. To help out in this restaurant like clean something. Or is it her job to watch customers eat. If I walk into this IHOP  again and I see that night manager standing doing nothing but watching customers eat. I will get up and leave and not come back to this IHOP
."}
{"text":"Food was good, however the service was absolutely horrible.  Not attentive at all.  Three tables of customers and after food was delivered it's like the staff vanished. I am rating only three based solely on service. It was the worst.  I don't think the servers understand that tips are earned."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I absolutely would. Ordered online and showed up to pick up, the guy greets me and tells me he'll check on my order. After standing there for 10 minutes, he comes up to tell me that my order never printed and the kitchen was making it then, okay that's fine. 25 minutes after my order was supposed to be ready, a lady comes up with the bag, hands it to me and turns around and walks away. No apology for the wait, no \"have a good night\", nothing. Unfortunately it's 10:45pm and nothing else is open, but even that will not stop me from not returning. Would've been just fine had anyone in the building have some sort of hospitality. I work as a server myself so I find this absolutely insane and rude. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Service is mediocre at best. Too bad it's the closest location. At times you get servers who are on point, then there are times you get basic. Last week's dine-in was real basic. Our server didn't greet us upon coming to our table. Never knew his name. Granted, he kept our drinks filled but he failed to bring our complete order to the table forcing us to always remind him. He never smiled nor asked if we needed anything. We always had to ask. Every good server would know that if kids are present we need extra napkins! 

Today's pick-up order was even worse. I was very specific in how I ordered my salad. Not only did the lady read it back correctly, my receipt was printed correctly. So why did my food come out incorrectly?! When I expressed concern that I was adamant about no tomatoes (due to allergy) the cashier just looked at me dumb founded. Her reply to my concern was, \"Well, I see you ordered it no tomatoes.\" Never once did she offer to remake my salad nor take it to the back to have them pull the tomatoes off. Poor customer service! 

Again, it sucks this is the closest location."}
{"text":"15 minute wait as expected. Fairly normal wait. Waitress was good till we ordered then could careless that we existed. Everyone had empty glasses waiting on food. We stopped the and asked for refills. Got ignored. Asked again got ignored. Still waiting on food no drinks lazy wsitress. What's not to love about this place. Got our food. Pancakes are Rubbery for sitting to long, eggs are so undercooked they are cool not hot, bacon is nearly all fat and barely cooked. Got told that's how it is unless you ask otherwise. Over medium eggs don't come out Sunnyside up. Pancakes for a pancake house should not be Rubbery and old. STILL NOT DRINK REFILLS FROM OUR ANGRY PISSED OFF HORRID WAITRESS! Our wsitress just had s screaming match with hostess about not being a fing mind reader. This is going grest. STILL NO REFILLS. See a theme yet. Had to get management for refills on drinks and togo boxes."}
{"text":"This loction is ok. The meals were ok. The service on this vist was exceptionally friendly."}
{"text":"The food and service were ok.  The location is run down, and the restrooms were dirty."}
{"text":"Would love to eat here more often as we can drive here in under two minutes from our house, but we can't because it is woefully understaffed with an incompetent manager."}
{"text":"Shane was honestly the funniest and nicest server I've ever had. Would come back here just to have him again! Fantastic service"}
{"text":"This is my second time eating at this location since I've lived in Vegas. Lucy, was exceptionally hospitable from Tuesday night. We were drawn to come back for the good fresh and hot meal. Lucy wasn't here, but Ricardo was just as pleasant. He also said \"He'd taught Lucy everything she knew. Lol
Will definitely make this our spot to go for good breakfast."}
{"text":"This place get more horrible every time we come. My husband has been waiting for a refill for about 20 minutes. He place his order and asked for sourdough bread and got regular white bread. Now I need a refill and still not refill for both. He finally got his food out with the right bread but same fries and they are cold. Very horrible customer service. And this is in the afternoon."}
{"text":"the food was alright. The silverware and dishes were unclean. The staff was very loud and obnoxious except for a very few, one or two at the most. The service was extremely slow. couldn't check up on us because the server was too busy talking to another employee."}
{"text":"So, I know it's IHOP, but there are just some expectations that any restaurant should have. We came on a Saturday morning and they were out of sugar packets....our server said the truck wouldn't be there till Monday, so she brought over a (clearly) used small ramekin of sugar to sprinkle in our coffee. We then ordered our breakfasts and after we ordered, or server came back and said she forgot to mention they were out of bananas (part of my order) and smoked sausage (part of my husband's) - stating the truck problem again. My husband switched to bacon, but I didn't get an option. Our food came out, and our eggs were great, but both our hashbrowns were brown and crispy on one side and basically frozen/cold on the other. The bacon was very rubbery, and some parts undercooked. Our server was nice, but had more table than she could fully pay attention to, so we didn't bother her with the still cold potatoes or anything.

Again, I know it's not a high end spot, but there are just some breakfast staples you need to get right."}
{"text":"By far the worst experience at an Ihop I have ever had. The hostess was great and we were seated immediatly. Our waitress, Stevie was horrible. She didn't even give me time to open my menu before asking for my order, and at the time the dining area was not busy. I then had to wait a while before she came back to take my order. Over twenty minutes went by and our server checked on all of the tables in our area except for us, we sat with empty glasses until a different server came around.  My sons order finally came and mine was wrong so I waited another 15 minutes for my order. Once we finished eating we sat for another 15 minutes before a different server asked if we wanted our check. We were told the computers were down, though I watched patrons who arrived after us receive their checks, pay and leave before Stevie even brought mine over. What was supposed to be a quick trip to IHOP ended up being a frustrating meal with a bored three year old that took over an hour and a half. Simply acknowledging your guests and being attentive would have made us happy, but the service we received was beyond poor."}
{"text":"Good breakfast selection  restaurant is clean and the service is usually good. Love the pancakes!!"}
{"text":"-bacon tasted horrible 
-food was late
-food was made wrong
Asking questions while I was choking..
-bathroom was gross
-over all food was gross."}
{"text":"Love Ihop they are over priced but I do enjoy the $5.99 breakfast which btw is not on the menu ok make sure you ask for it ok it's a pretty hefty breakfast too guys . You get 2 pieces of bacon or sausage 2 eggs any style, hash browns or grits  and toast or two buttermilk pancakes . It's a great deal so why isn't it on the menu I don't know any who get it it's great !"}
{"text":"Went with a group of 15.  The restaurant was busy, but service was good.  Waitress had a great memory.  Food came out hot.  Only 1 order was messed up.  I"}
{"text":"You could hear the servers in the back gossiping about people. Once the manager went in they all went back to work. Our server was good \"newbie\" 
The food was okish. My hashbrown was hard ontop and the eggs were more raw than med well. One bacon was hard close to burned while the other was cooked perfect. 
I tried the berry crepe... I'd give it a 6 out ot 10
I'd rather have a pancake instead 
Overall its an ordinary ihop nothing special. I'd rather go to a small family owed bf place."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible, terrible. Granted, it was Mother's Day, so expected to wait a little longer than usual but they were so disorganized from the get-go. There was no greeter so those who came in didn't know who to go to place names on the waiting list. 

Finally got seated and a server did come right away and took our drink orders and we put in my son's meal first so it gets done right away and we also asked for a high chair for my other child. Took forever for a high chair to come and our drinks. 

Another server came, Bianca, and she didn't take very good care of us either.  She took the rest of our order and after waiting for some time, our food was served cold. We're pretty sure it had been sitting in the kitchen for a while.  

And then, our son's order hasn't arrived yet because the order was never put in. My children were starving and started to complain.  So eating cold food didn't make it any better. UGH!!! Coffee is terrible. And our server never checked up on us.  

This was a terrible location. It looks all fancy and dressed up but nothing to show in service. Even though their other locations may look dingy we got better service there. Definitely management needs to step up a notch or two."}
{"text":"It's 7:30p. Only one person working the floor. No place servings on our table. Our beverages were served though after waiting 10 minutes. Obviously cutting on help. Server very friendly...a plus for them. Don't recommend coming here unless there's no other choice."}
{"text":"The wait was too long for a table. The wait to ask a waiter to take our order was even longer & the wait for our food was the LONGEST! Don't eat here. Go anywhere but here. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Servers are great and have a resilient attitude unfortunately there are hoodlums that dine and dash and if effects the staff! Continue to give excellent service and thank you for tasty meals!"}
{"text":"The service is unacceptably slow. It took 15 minutes just to get us our drinks. Would not recommend to anyone looking for a quick place to dine."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast and it was a bad experience!  The table was dirty.  The waitress was rushing us.  The food came out incorrect. AND there was hair in my omelet!  Needless to say we didn't eat and left.  We spoke to the manager Charles on our way out and he said \"he heard about what happened with the hair in our food,\" but didn't bother to come to our table to apologize...or even apologize altogether when we came up to talked to him.  BAD SERVICE, VERY DIRTY, & WE WON'T BE RETURNING!  *Another place the health department needs to make a visit to, way overdue for an inspection!"}
{"text":"The worlds saddest pancake made for the worlds saddest 4 year old. I was really disappointed when this mess came out for my kid...even a 2 year old could tell you the difference between happy and sad. I felt like this was spiteful. 2nd experience with this location, both make me never want to return. The server seemed a bit bothered by us and should have said something when this mess came out of the kitchen. We won't be back again. It's no surprise Ihops sales are down."}
{"text":"Headed to I hop for free birthday pancakes. Note - sign up! I was permitted to get any pancakes on the menu which was nice and no additional purchase was necessary. The food was good and came out quickly. I had strawberry banana and my husband had chocolate chocolate chip. They had 4 types of syrup available - maple, butter pecan, strawberry and blueberry. I really liked the butter pecan! 

My only complaint was that it was super loud! The servers and cooks were screaming orders back and forth to each other. I know it's somewhat of a diner, but I think it could be a little quieter."}
{"text":"The food is fine, but the service here is awful.  Servers don't even look your way after you are seated, never come back to check if your food is OK.  Usually they just stand around and talk to each other.   I have left after sitting at a table for 15 minutes without so much as a drink order being taken."}
{"text":"Food is always good . We go here atleast once or twice a week, since we are in love with the Sirloin Tips and the fact that they have so many different kinds of pancakes, crepes , and french toast that we can choose from and substitute that as desserts, unlike Denny's and Waffle House . The only thing that disappoint me is that the wait for the food to come out is always long. Either it's lunch or dinner, there was not a time that the food would come out before 15 minutes. Seems like they are always short on staff, when they do get busy, it's worse. Every time we finally found a waitress that we like, we never see them again . Makes me wonder if the people who works here just  quit or do they get fired :/"}
{"text":"Took a friend here for breakfast, and the service was awful. Went on a Friday and it wasn't very busy, and our server was pretty rude from the start. When we ordered our food, she had an attitude because I asked if I could get my quesadilla without chicken, being vegetarian. So I just said nevermind and got mozza sticks and fries. When she came back with our food, I asked if I could also get a cup of coffee. She SIGHED, rolled her eyes and said \"yea sure one sec\". When she came back with it, she slammed it on the table and walked off. Me and my friend ate, drank our coffee. And were ready to go. We sat there for 20 minutes before I got sick of it and asked another server to get our check. Worst $40 I've ever spent."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 or negative I would. We and in and there were 3 tables we waited 10 minutes and NO ONE was in kitchen, on floor, at the counter, or at waiter station! Not 1 welcome or anything!"}
{"text":"Very poor service. We came at around 8 am and not very busy, but the service was slow and substandard. After being seated for about 10 minutes, we sat watching another table, who came well after us, received service before us. Once the waitress came to our table, she never introduced herself, but only ask if we're ready to order. She didn't bring out creams for the coffee or straws for the water and juice, we received the creams after we asked for them but not the straws. As for the napkins, we had to use the ones that hold the utensils. After we received our food, it was literally no more than 5 minutes, when she came back and put the check on our table. And here's the best part, as she walked away she asked us if everything was ok, and did not pause for even 1 sec to hear our response. And that was the only time she ever \"checked\" on us."}
{"text":"I would've given 5 stars if my wait for food wasn't so long. Other than that, I can't believe I'm saying that this Is one of the best breakfasts I've  ever had. Either that or we were both starving, which we were. We waited 15 minutes out of the 20 we were told, to be seated. Our coffee was really light and watery. Younique, our server. Who was warm and friendly, happily took it back and brought us a stronger one. She informed us that as part of what we ordered, we also get a whole other breakfast! When it finally arrived, our eggs were perfectly cooked and my hash browns were crispy,
Just like I had asked. My buttermilk pancakes were light and perfect. As well they should be.  IM IN IHOP!! Don't look for any bells and whistles here, it's a simple breakfast and it was simply delicious!"}
{"text":"Planned to grab a bite at this IHOP location after an evening meeting in the area was over. Walked in an was thinking of leaving when no one was coming to seat us but practically ran out when my husband told me to turn around and look at the large cockroach climbing on the booth wall behind me. Definite turn-off."}
{"text":"This IHOP is on point. Service great. Our server checked on us regularly, but the food did take forever."}
{"text":"So I'm sure lots of you are going to find this strange however WE LOVE IHOP. I don't know how they train their employees but we have never ever had a complaint. We have always had consistent food and the best service. The servers are always super friendly and accommodating. This time our server was Egypt and she was great. We go to ihop at least 2 times a month for breakfast and have never had a bad server or bad food. The staff always seems happy which leads me to believe that they are treated well and respectfully and they are happy to be working there. For sure a favorite of ours"}
{"text":"It was dead in here the place was clean and quiet 
Our waitress was very nice (Olivia) 
But when the food came all of it was cold
I sent back the pancakes and they came nice and hot but my family decided to eat there cold food 
I don't understand how the place can be dead and the food so cold
Needless to say the waitress was pleasant and very attentive"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast (duh) the food wasn't too great. The waiter wasn't too friendly, seems like he didn't want to be here. When our food for to the table, the waiter just basically toss our plates on the table and walked away didn't ask us if we need anything else. My hash browns was pretty cold, slightly warm, seems like it was someone's else order and they just slap that on my plate. My sausages wasn't cooked all the way, it was raw in the middle. Maybe I'll give this place a second chance in the future. The manger or the lead not too sure what he was but he was wearing a tile shirt, he was pretty awesome. He was happy to be there, the energy vibe was pretty good. The three star goes to the guy."}
{"text":"Food was well cooked. The place was clean. The bathrooms were cleaned as well. Clean bathrooms means clean kitchen which means a clean restaurant. The only reason why this place gets three stars is because our waiter Jesus O started our great but at the end, we waited for about 10-15mins for him to pick up our check to pay. He was sitting across from us and he was just on his phone and talking to the other coworker. Poor customer services. Other than that place was pretty good. I'll definitely be back just cause I like IHOP :) it's better than Denny's and that's the tea. Lol"}
{"text":"Never Ever again!!! Last time I went with husband eggs were cold and raw, place was filthy and it stunk. This time (thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt) was with my kids and 10-15 minutes went without even asking what we wanted to drink, so we left and I will never go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Waitress is friendly and cute. Drinks out quickly. She also remembered the hot sauce. Food was out in 14 minutes, still hot and everything tasted fresh. Waitress was awesome, attentive, and nice. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"If i could give this place no stars i would! me and my boyfriend placed a to go order a while ago, i ordered a burger w fries and asked for extra seasoning on them. when we got home there no ketchup for the fries, burger was dull as hell, and fries were soooo dry and hard (no seasoning). i only had an hour for lunch so i guess unfortunately that had to do.  you 
Anyway, my coworkers and i ordered some food for pickup because we only had 30 minutes to eat something and i got a breakfast. i hate hash browns so i subbed them with french fries with extra seasoning. Dude so we get the order and i open my food... i kid you not there's like 8 french fries in there. DRY AS HELL AND HARD. like if they were the last that they had. on top of that my eggs weren't even cooked right. my whole lunch was ruined again smh lol ANYWAYS will definitely not be eating here again. (at least not take out) you literally have to check the food in front of them or something. 
Don't get me wrong the service has always been good but the cooks forsure need some extra training. or a different job."}
{"text":"The service was slower than I would have liked but the food was tasty and our waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Ordered a Togo order. Pretty simple. Yet however, they still managed to get the order incorrect. Ordered 5 pancakes and only got 4. The Togo order did not come with any Togo silverware. And the appetizer sampler was not only cold but not all of the items advertised on the online menu were included. I'm disappointed considering we ordered at a time when it was not busy and still was not satisfactory. I recommend a different location or a different restaurant entirely. I will not be ordering from this location again. Imagine if my order was difficult? Who knows how bad it would have been."}
{"text":"The food is standard across the brand.  But the service at this location is warm, friendly and genuine. This was not just our server but seemed store wide."}
{"text":"This has to one of the cheapest eats in Surprise for kids. Free kids meal from 4 to 10. Yes you have to buy an adult meal, but even my meal was not really steep. I enjoyed a steak omelet and it also included 3 pancakes. A serious meal for 8.99 I could not resist some coffee to make it a real breakfast for me. The endless pot of coffee was a little over 2 bucks. 
My son enjoyed the large create a face which ended up being his dinner and breakfast for the next day. Not a bad deal in my book. 
If you have kids and want to treat them to a night out, why not try an American classic Ihop? This particular one, in Surprise does get busy and yes sometimes the service is not top notch, but I give them credit.... When the place is packed I am sure they can get slammed with work. I practiced patience and enjoyed another cup of joe from my endless carafe. Don't worry the french vanilla cream sure does make the coffee taste good.  Take the kids out and enjoy."}
{"text":"It's been a very long time since I was at ihop. Food tasted ok then although it's locking of quality. Today was not a good day at all. Waited 20 mins for the food and when it's arrives it was cold and tasted really bad, not rotten bad, but.... just did not taste good. I guess you really can't expect much from ihop."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst IHOP ever. I went on November 27th, 2010 and waited 20 minutes just to be acknowledged at our table and a whopping 48 minutes to get a half a sandwich and soup. The waitress was friendly enough but slooooow."}
{"text":"This review is a 3 ONLY because of Corrine at the front register where you pay, she is rude and needs retraining on customer service. When my husband went to pay he asked if IHOP   offered a senior discount, to which her response was rolling of the eyes and she seemed bothered almost annoyed, my husband said to her when he saw her reaction I don't want to put you through any trouble then she pressed the button for the discount...A BUTTON! That was all it took. Really young lady? If pushing a button is what makes you so rude get another job. On the positive Kelsey C was awesome."}
{"text":"Food was OK....had to send pancakes back to have them done correctly. If it says \"just like a jelly donut\" & the picture shows how it should look well? Why didn't the kitchen prepare it correctly. Had to send drink back...something floating in bottom. And waitress not real attentive.. Never came while eating to check on us or refill drinks."}
{"text":"First off I just want to say that I'm a breakfast type of guy. I can eat breakfast at anytime of the day. And also I love bargains and good deals on food. IHOP is the way to go if you like the same things as me. The quality food is not as high as you might want but the food taste great if you just order the right things. IHOP has very good and very large omelettes with the many different ingredients. Also IHOP is very known for their pancakes and their chicken strips.  When I decide to go to IHOP I normally go with a bunch of friends and we stay up and hang out for a long time. I hope is a 24 hour restaurant that gives you the privilege to sit and relax and really enjoy your nights in there. What is very cool about this restaurant is that the people there are very laid-back on night shift."}
{"text":"Just ubered from this place. They had the nerve to give me some frozen watered down gravy and about two bites worth of pot roast with my bread, corn and mashed potatoes. To top it off, it tasted terrible. I will never ever in my life order from here again. The portions were literally suitable for my 4 year old niece. Wtf, IHOP. AND YOU FORGOT MY CORNBREAD? I'm hungry as shit. (Pancakes are decent though)"}
{"text":"Major disappointment!  Was really looking forward to an IHOP breakfast so I decided to swing by and get take out between appointments.  Now I can understand them charging me for the extras I wanted (chocolate chips in my pancakes and cheese on eggs) but the bacon was undercooked and they barely put any chips in my pancakes yet put bananas on it which I didn't ask for. For some reason this really pisses me off but I was in a hurry so I took it as is.  I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Never seen a lazier manager! The poor wait staff was running all over trying to keep up & the manager kept disappearing to the office. Our server was cashier, hostess, to-go order taker, AND server! This place needs a total rehaul of staff! Definitely won't be back!"}
{"text":"The service is terrible! Everything is unorganized and servers cannot decide which table is theirs. Sat at the table for about 20 mins without being acknowledged before we walked out."}
{"text":"While Ihop is your typical breakfast food joint, I have had nothing but great experiences at this certain location. My last visit there (after a very long night of drinking), I was immediately greated and asked how I was doing. Well, i informed the nice young lady that I had been out late the night before and needed as much grease as I could get. She was very polite and let me know she had my back. She informed my waitress what was going on and she checked up on me quite a bit during my visit. 

I don't remember what it was called, but I got four pancakes, potatoes, bacon and eggs. It might have been the fact that I was hungover and starving, but it was  good. It was your typical IHOP breakfast. Not absolutely fantastic, but not nearly as bad as everyone says it is."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying this is IHOP, it normally wouldn't be at the top of my list for breakfast, but heck we had a coupon. So, why not give it a shot? BOGO was too good to pass up.

Not passing IHOP up was definitely the right thing to do. I was starving after a hard workout and my partner loves going out for breakfast on Sunday mornings. 

This particular IHOP was formerly an Islands Burger restaurant. I'm not much of a fan of Islands and was wondering what IHOP had done with the space. Islands is typically dark and barsy, not what you'd think of for IHOP. Luckily the space was totally made over. Lots of sunlight, nice yellow colors on the wall and very open. Best of all it was very clean.

We arrived at 8:30 AM expecting to have to wait, but to our surprise the restaurant wasn't that busy. We almost rethought our choice but went ahead anyway. We were immediately greeted and seated. Great first impression!

It turned out the person that seated us was also our server. She gave us a minute and promptly came back to take our drink orders. I had Grapefruit Juice and my partner ordered Iced Tea. I asked for ice in the juice and she was thoughtful enough to bring an additional glass with ice in it so I wouldn't be shortchanged on the juice. Now that's what I call service.

I ordered an omelet and my partner went with eggs and pancakes. Everything was prepared just as ordered and very tasty. Not the best I've ever had, but darn good. Remember, it's IHOP not T Cooks.

So if you're in the neighborhood and want a good breakfast at a decent price head over to IHOP."}
{"text":"This iHop is always packed. Well ever time I go, it is.
It's a great place to go when you want to have a family meal but there is always a wait to be seated and it feels so crowded and it's always loud all the time. 
The waiter that I had this time wasn't really attentive and took forever for everything. I understand they get busy but I observe when it comes to things like this and he was talking the whole time with this couple instead of helping his other tables, which looked just as irritated as I was. 
I can't say all the staff are like this.. cause I usually get really good waiters/waitresses. But not this time. 
Overall, enjoyed the food not the service. At least not today.."}
{"text":"So far I haven't had any bad experiences in this iHop.
We always get seated quick. And the waiters/waitresses are always quick, attentive and nice.
We usually don't ever have problems with our food. It always came out exactly how we ordered it and always tastes delicious.
I have to say one of my favorite iHops."}
{"text":"We didnt enjoy our time here, because me and my mom are busy shooing flies away from our food. 
The waiters response with an attitude, \"i can't do anything about.\"
Well there is you can do. Kill all the flies in the restaurant and clean your windows before opening the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I've been here in the last month, and both times I had pretty bad service. Hispanic looking guy maybe in his 30's w/high energy. He was very nice, but really lacked good service. When we asked for ketchup and hot sauce we had to wait a really long time. Also he said he would refill our drinks and never came back. I mean the place was not busy at all, and it's the same scatter-brained guy every time we go there it seems like. Plus their hash browns are always so hard and you can barely even eat them. I would recommend any Denny's before I ever eat here again. At least Denny's has nice people and their food is very consistent!"}
{"text":"I decided to stop in to this IHOP chain on a Sunday after church around 10 ish for their never-ending pancakes. I love IHOP and I love their pancakes but this location lacks so much of the IHOP Essence and brand that it really needs to be shut down. Upon arrival the restaurant was half full and it appeared that the wait staff was moving about appropriately. After being seated it took my waiter 15 minutes just to come and take my order and I was a party of one. After about 45 minutes of waiting after my order was taken I finally received my order of two pancakes, a side of hash browns, and bacon.   My pancakes were ice cold I never received any syrup for my pancakes, the hash browns were ice cold and the bacon was burnt. I had to wait an additional 5 minutes for my waiter to come by so I could send my food back to be cooked or reheated just so it was edible. After about an additional 10 minutes I'm waiting for my food to return , it finally came back to the table and the pancakes were burnt Pitch Black but the hash browns were warm. At this point I just simply gave up and realize that this  establishment really cares less about customer service and the food that they present to them. I can truly say that people should avoid this location because their food is disgusting, their wait staff is absolutely slow, and their customer service lacks luster."}
{"text":"The banana pudding pancakes were surprisingly good and I would order them again. My scrambled eggs were a bit on the hard side but nothing to really complain about. Other than that, it was an enjoyable visit."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm reviewing an IHOP, but we actually had such a great experience at this IHOP.

The food was expected, standard ihop food, no surprises there but the service was exceptional!! Our waitress had a huge smile on her face and was willing to make as many adjustments to our order as we requested.
We stopped here on our way from Las Vegas to Grand Canyon and were in a bit of a hurry. When we mentioned this, she went out of her way to have everything come quickly and even helped refill our water bottles for the trip!

I was a bit apprehensive about stopping at this iHOP after looking at the bad rating but it ended up being a great experience!!"}
{"text":"Hello World,
Hope all is well! I ate there today with my wife and had the worst experience!
 I believe the managers name is Mike. While we were waiting with others on the bench.I saw this guy insulting and harassing his own staff. I saw him yell and berate a waitress by the name of Nancy! I am in the same buisness and never in a million years I talk to my staff in the tone or unprofessional  manner  he does.   Reprimanding should be in private not on public display for the customer to hear and see! I heard him tell her\" if you can't wait on people just go home ! And pointed at the door. She tried to explain her self . Mind you this is all happening at the front podium were you check in with the hostess. She tried to explain and he gave her the T with his hands referring to her to stop talking.Then starts talking about Nancy with Hostess an older lady with violet short hair and wear glasses who yells people's names out like she works at a truck dinner off the I-90 !!! Honestly I've thought seen it all! Our waitress Gabby was great and very kind hearted. But I feel IHOP is doing a disservice by keeping Mike and the gossip mill Hostess  around and should really evaluate about getting a more professinal assistant manager! By the way. I'm calling Shawn the store manager on Friday when he gets back from vacation . I can't beleive people like this represent such a fine company!
   Sorry for the long story !!! To the staff at the IHOP!!! Stop suffering in silence. Work should be fun not degrading. This happened on a Thursday I can only imagine Mike on a Sunday he must be Epic. Mike not to be mean but being an assisant manager of a resturant is not your calling! Im just saying .Corprate should give this guy a climate survey!!!!!!!
 \" There's micro management and then on the other spectrum there's  harassment\"
I'm sure he's gonna be singing a different tune after this YELP! 
Great omelettes, big portions wrong managment team. Just calling it the way I see it!
Who promoted that guy! Seriously. It's more then just writing a schedule."}
{"text":"I like this location. Staff is friendly, location is convenient and the food is consistently delicious. I love the original buttermilk pancakes and omelettes. The chicken fried steak is great, too. My favorite appetizer are the mozzarella sticks"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Really no different than any other IHOP location. Service is decent but they do
Need to work on their delivery time."}
{"text":"An alright IHOP in a nice, quiet part of town. Service is a little slower than usual. Food is average. Best appetizer is an order of mozzarella sticks. Best breakfast are the double chocolate pancakes and burgers are ok."}
{"text":"Convenient when I need to shop a little. But food was cold. Egg whites omelette. Had to send it back. Just takes longer but nice and hot now!"}
{"text":"Plane landed late after being held up in Denver waiting for a flight crew, Got here late, and hunger, this was next to the hotel we were in, so we headed over, and although it filled us up ( and did not feel right), we have not been back their since, and will not go go back."}
{"text":"Wanted pancakes for dinner and went to IHOP. There were only a couple customers in the restaurant but not a worker to be found. Waited at the front until the hostess emerged. It was very cold in there. Shortly after we were seated, the server came over to take our drink order. Hot tea and water. For food I selected the pick-a-pancake combo with blueberry pancakes, eggs scrambled/well done, hash browns, and bacon. I purposely said blueberry pancakes to see if they would interpret that as double blueberry pancakes with the blueberries in the batter and on top. They did. Fun little experiment. The eggs were cooked to my liking. The hash browns were also cooked nicely. You could see they used a lot of oil to get the browning even. Nothing to really say about the bacon. But I enjoyed the meal (very filling!) and the service was pretty good. So far this location has been quite a bit better than Dysart. 3.5 stars rounds to 4."}
{"text":"Well we decided to give our new IHOP a try on Christmas afternoon. We had a bad review from our neighbors and thought, well everyone's different. They said the service was horrible and they had to wait for ever to get their food. And when they did get it , it was cold. Well we went on Christmas afternoon, there was maybe 3 other booths taken, so they were not very busy at all. Their was more staff standing around than guests. We got there and ordered our food and we waited and waited. We ordered a simple sandwich, sliders and breakfast nachos. Really how hard can that be? Well 25 minutes later our server brought our food and said our breakfast nachos will be a little bit longer,Really? Nachos...Chips and cheese!! After we got our food we began to eat, nor did the server or manager come by to ask how our food was. We had to flag down another server/busboy to get our waitress to cancel our nachos. Even after we cancelled our nachos, she brought them to our table. We told her just to please take them back. After that the manager came over and offered to take the cost of the nachos off the bill. When we told him we had just read a bunch of other bad reviews and was going to post our lack of service on the web, he said he would cover the whole check. Tho this was  the very least he could of done we will not be back until the service and/or management is retrained or replaced. This is the ONLY 24 hour restaurant in our area and with this service....we do not anticipate it being around for long. Guess our neighbors were right."}
{"text":"Usually great service and quiet but the last couple times, poor service and no management to be seen, as a manager you should tell people that let their children run wild in the place to control them or leave, others would like to enjoy a peacefull meal."}
{"text":"Before my job interview, I promised myself that I would treat myself to pancakes afterwards. The interview was a breeze; so the search began. Everything you could crave is off of Bell Rd. so I decided to stop at IHOP for their blueberry pancakes, scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon (oink!) and hash browns cooked hard. The parking lot was crowded so I was expecting a wait. The greeter/seater asked me if it was \"just one\" and I said \"yes\".She was quick to find me a seat but not very enthusiastic about it. My waiter showed up quickly to get my drink and food order. He was very pleasant and fast. My food arrived quickly too, considering all of the cars in the parking lot. Everything tasted awesome; the only thing I would've wanted was more blueberry topping, even though I had more than enough. The pancakes were fluffy and had just the right amount of salt to balance out the sweet. I would give this review a higher rating but the coffee was horrible! I will return but next time request to be seated away from the kitchen because it was a little noisy."}
{"text":"My one star reviews are few and far between. I'm a big breakfast/diner fan and love pretty much all Dennys and IHOPs and can appreciate them for what they are. This particular IHOP is worthy of the diss.

Everything I ordered, they were out of. Mocha? Nope. Vanilla iced coffee? Nope.  

I really wanted a dessert crepe or sundae, but they were out of fruit. That killed everything that I was in the mood for. How about a scoop of ice cream? Could you do that? 

\"Um,, yeah why wouldn't we have it?\" *me staring at the waiter dumbfounded*

The place was pretty dirty too, so I'm glad I didn't order anything. When I went to use the bathroom before leaving, it looks like it hadn't been cleaned in at least 3 months. There was also a strange woman in there and I'm almost pretty sure she was doing drugs but I didn't hang around long enough to find out. It's unfortunate that this place is so dumpy but I think it's mainly because of the area it's in.

Just say no to drugs in bathrooms and to dumpy IHOPs."}
{"text":"Thinking about eating breakfast at IHOP on a Sunday morning? Usually a bad idea. When we pulled up, the parking lot was full and there were a few families standing outside of the doors. I fought my way up to the hostess stand and made a reservation for a party of two. 20 to 25 minutes she said. My husband and I waited for less than a minute out in the sweltering heat when we spotted an empty bench in the mid-section. We sat down in the in-between section and then after another minute passed by, my husband motioned for me to move seats again to a bench closer to the hostess stand. What is this, musical chairs? Anyways, my point is that the seating area was being cleared out in pronto like fashion. 

Our name was called seconds after. Instead of waiting 20-25 minutes, we were seated within 5 minutes even though it looked crazy busy here. We were seated in a booth section and our waiter quickly took our drink orders. I'm a fan of IHOP's vanilla and mocha iced coffees ($2.99). The drinks are a little pricey but at least you get refills. I ordered a short stack of pancakes ($5.99) and the Mr. got some kind of ginormous combo plate. The food was out in less than 10 minutes. The food was made to order and tasted great.

If you're going to IHOP and ordering pancakes, french toast, or waffles, I cannot stress the importance of using their Butter Pecan syrup!!! It makes everything better and knocks the socks off of plain ol' maple syrup. My husband introduced me to Butter Pecan syrup and I've been hooked ever since. I swear I dump half the bottle of that sweet stuff on my pancakes. ;)

Our waiter was on his game. He checked up on us often and made sure everything was okay. When my husband's plate came out minus some hash browns, the waiter said he'd take care of it and the hash browns were out seconds later. Our bill came to $22 and some change. The only complaint I have is that when we went to the counter to the pay, the cashier either tried to withhold the receipt or forgot to hand it back to us. I've had this problem at least three times before, so it can't be coincidence. Thing is, that receipt has a survey on it which gets you a free short stack on your next visit. I rarely fill them out, but hey the point is, I want that receipt! 

I liked the fact that we were able to get in and out of the restaurant with virtually no wait time. The customer service overall was average, but our waiter in particular was awesome. The IHOP in Centennial Center is your usual everyday IHOP. I'll be back when I want some more Butter Pecan syrup with a side of pancakes."}
{"text":"Really really hungry on the way back from dropping my brother off at the airport..  Would not normally stop at and IHOP, but we were starving.  It was 1130 on a Sunday morning it was the only place open (now this doesn't sound good but this restaurant rocked.)  We were seated immediately they had a gluten free menu my wife got served a lovely meal I had a nice omelette the coffee was fresh; not the best, but I'll take it!  The service was impeccable; a woman named Summer took care of us and I love her.  But servers should be making $15 an hour and allowed over time"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the pancakes, but service so slow even when no one else is there. Bathroom was a mess."}
{"text":"Worst.  Waitress.  Ever.  We waited for an hour after ordering, only to have the waitress show up with a to go bag and say \"silly me, I put your order in as take out and it's been sitting up there all this time!\"  No apology.  Then literally proceeded to pass out the styrofoam containers with the cold food (eggs) and said \"best part is, I won't have a mess to clean up!!\".  Will never go back."}
{"text":"Like this place for breakfast and visit every time we are in Vegas. Good service though mostly you got to wait for 5-10 mins before getting seated. Food is good and if you get a good server, it makes the overall experience that bit extra good."}
{"text":"Been waiting 20 minutes for coffee.  Horrible service. I understand busy but coffee would be nice."}
{"text":"Half a day of school means lunch with my little big man. You can never go wrong at IHOP. Thank you lord for this beautiful day. I love spending time with my kids. Yohan Edwards and JQ Craig I wish we you were here so I could have all my boys here at one time."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here with my mom. The waitress was very nice. We got our food and drinks under 10 minutes. The garden omelet Is the best thing on the menu. The pancakes for fresh and very delicious. They have different kinds of syrup's to choose from. I love the maple syrup. Please give this place  chance. It was a great experience. One that I won't forget."}
{"text":"BEST IHOP MEAL WE'VE EVER HAD!

The turkey sausage was delicious, my over-medium eggs were cooked to perfection, and the staff was very nice. The place was packed as it was a Sunday morning, but the food came quite quickly. My girlfriend said the strawberry cheesecake pancakes were like a \"hug in the mouth.\" So good!

Bonus, the bathroom was very clean!"}
{"text":"Worst iHop I've ever been to. Dirty. Loud. Servers arguing and practically throwing dirty dishes into their dish buckets loudly. The food we were served was terrible. A grilled cheese with the cheese not melted, barely warm. Hash browns were burnt, basically just shredded potato chips. The Cashier took 10 minutes just to come process my receipt and we were the only ones at the front! Its located in between two, what seem to be,  abandoned buildings and homeless people are constantly loitering right outside the door. 0/10 would not recommend."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!!!Food was lukewarm at best. Pancakes not right, not fluffy and cold. Iced tea was so bad that I couldn't drink it. I had waitress replace with Pepsi. 2nd glass of Pepsi served in a greasy dirty glass. I have given them several chances and I'm done. I Will never go back to this location"}
{"text":"This is probably why I have not been in @6yrs. Went in after school event, not busy at all maybe 5 groups (4max in group). Waitress never introduced herself just came and asked for order. Never came back to ask if everything was good or we needed anything. Had to ask for more water when she brought food out. The couple behind us had a different waitress and overheard them complaining of same thing. Asked for a manager and was told none there but could call next day to speak to one. Someone obviously doesn't want Tom Ken money in tips. Never will be back"}
{"text":"Took the fam to Ihop for dinner on Friday night.  To my surprise, kids eat free on Friday nights.  Bonus!  

I ordered the sirloin tips dinner which came with garlic mash and corn.  Good old American fare.  It was very good and I fed some of it to my 1-year-old son.

We normally don't order for the 1-year-old because he can't eat a full plate, but since it was free, we ordered him a pancake and he gobbled it down and wanted more.  I had to taste his pancake because this is Ihop and I think every time you come here, you should order something from the breakfast menu.

The four of us ate for $27.  Not bad at all for a quick dinner before we visited the park on the beautiful day that we had in Cleveland.

{"text":"If I could give them zero stars I would. This is the worst mess I have ever experienced. Empty tables all over the place and they have guests waiting in the lobby and they reasoning was because they did not want to over work the wait staff due to the kitchen being short staffed. We asked for the manager 4 xs and she never came! Really! Won't be back! Despicable customer service."}
{"text":"I would have gave them a NEGATIVE stars if they had them. Continuos horrible service, rude and all we ever get is a \"I am sorry\" from the manager. We keep coming back hoping for a change. But it never changes. We will NOT be coming back here. We will take our money to cocos (which is across the street) IHOP is officially on my \"most horrible restaurants\" DONT GO HERE, safe your money and time..."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this location. Planned on Sunday morning brunch and was ready to have to wait to be seated but that wasn't the case. Other IHOP locations I've been to in the past are a little too busy for me on a weekend morning but we had a nice experience. Our server was friendly and pretty attentive. Food was probably out within ten minutes of ordering. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"HOW ON EARTH IS THIS PLACE STILL OOWN FOR BUSINESS? I seriously need an answer, PLEASE!! I have not eaten here in over a year because the service and f of quality was so bad. I've never gotten sick, but who wants to have to have bad service AND have to send their food back two to three times....every visit!! I was at a conference and the hotel next door and decided to grab breakfast here afterwards. BIG MISTAKE! While waiting to be greeted (a few employees walked right by me without so much as speaking), another woman was at the podium looking for her server who had apparently taken their order and disappeared. We chatted and both said we had not had good experiences here in the past...yet here we both were again...wait, did I just answer my own question? That's how they're still in business. My waitress was nice, but it was apparent that she had more tables than she could handle. Asked for over easy eggs and twice they were fried hard...not sure how that happened. Asked for pancakes cooked light, they were light on the top, but the bottom was over cooked and hard to even cut through. In addition to that it tasted burnt. I ended up just eating the bacon and hash browns and asked to be charged for just that. The manager never came to the table. I was told she knew who I was and would take care of it at the register. 

Add this to your list of places NOT to eat...like ever"}
{"text":"It's not a vacation to Vegas without stopping by IHOP for breakfast.  

They offer WiFi during your visit.  The place is always busy.  The wait is about 20 mins or so.  

Breakfast is good.  After your visit you can complete a survey on your receipt to a free short stack of buttermilk pancakes (value $6.99).  Yum!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Very good. And that's all that was good. There was something going on and they didn't have enough help and the waitress was rude. There was a rude woman over the phone before I went there. I just wanted to know if my 2 year old would eat for free. She said \"Yes.\" and then hung up. I don't care how bad the night is going, you don't have to be that way."}
{"text":"IHOP has certainly gone done in quality the past 8 years at this location especially. Food is mediocre at best. Servers are friendly depending on the day. Sundays, forget it. I remember the day when IHOP was a place to have a good breakfast and leave happy. Not so much anymore."}
{"text":"Service was good, food not so much. I've ordered chicken and cheese crapes. Chicken used in crapes was the absolute lowest quality possible- it was not chewable and pieces were holding on to each other with something string-like... I took one bite and ewwwww! Otherwise it wouldn't be bad.  Not ordering anything with chicken there anymore."}
{"text":"Went for the fish fry. Fish was mediocre. When asked if we wanted more fish, we declined but asked for more fries, but apparently that wasn't part of the deal.

Server wasn't friendly or fast or good about refills. They had one cook so everything took forever and the pancakes my kids got weren't even cooked all the way. 

Also, even though the restaurant has posted all over the place that kids eat free, the kid's meals were on the bill and I had to ask them to remove it.

We will be hitting a local parish next time for a friendlier atmosphere and better (cooked) food."}
{"text":"besides being over run by evil snow birds at this time of the year they are good."}
{"text":"I love ihop. But this one is terrible. I finally decided to try pancakes there and asked if they had real maple syrup. I was told they did and didn't believe them so argued with waiter. He went to the cook to ask and came back saying the hot syrup was real maple. So I trust that advice. Immediately I got a reaction and felt lethargic. Told manager about it and he didn't seem to care that I had an allergic reaction to the false information provided by the staff.

Other times I love the tossed salad with chicken. Description says it is tossed with yellow mustard. Normally, at other places it is tossed like it is described. At this one however, they just give it to you on the side. Small nitpick I know, but if you describe something as tossed in he menu, it should be tossed.

There are several other examples of bad service and food. I will not be coming back to this terrible restaurant. And I suggest everyone else turn away as well."}
{"text":"The food is great, I recommend the double chocolate chip pancakes are great! The service was good, but maybe a longer kids menu?"}
{"text":"Yep pretty much going to second everyone that gave them one star. Arrived at 12:00, waited until 1:05 (stupidly) to ask the waitress where our food was. She proceeded to tell us the computers were down and it would be another 10 minutes. We left, no apology, nothing. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Won't be going back. Each time we go, no matter the location, we have had issues the last 4 times. They are very slow at bringing out the food. But usually the regular location we go to in Avon at least knows what the table ordered. And apologizes. Today we waited 30 minutes for our food. And then when it came out, it was wrong. I ordered scrambled eggs and a slice of ham. I get fried eggs and bacon. All locations seem to have issues with the waitresses having to be impressed into service in the kitchen cooking. This location was no different. And you could hear them yelling and bickering in the back. They finally got our correct orders out to us. We ate our meals, and the waitress came and asked if the little one would like another lemonade. The response was yes, please. It never came. My husband had to flag down another waitress and give her his card saying we had been waiting for the check for a very long time and we really needed to go. And still......no lemonade. The waitress goes back and shouts I have a credit card here for someones food. Um hello! Would it not be more professional to say I have the card for table#.........quietly instead of shouting out like a fishwife? And then while she is back screaming for our waitress, she herself shows up at the table, no lemonade, and asks if everything is ok. My husband told her no, it isn't. And our card is back there, can we please pay so we can leave. She did knock $5 off our check for the \"inconvenience\". But seriously.......

I don't know if you like your job or not. Not all of us are fortunate to actually like what we do. But if accept that job, you need to do it to the best of your ability and take some pride in it. You are my waitress. remember what I ordered, check it against what you wrote down if you must. But be accurate. And be prompt and attentive. I don't expect you to stand by and wipe my chin with a napkin. But I do expect you to check on us once in a while. And if you promise my little one you will be right back with her lemonade, then you had damn well better be back with her lemonade.  For your information, the only reason we go to IHOP is because SHE likes it there. We don't care for it so much. We'd rather go to Blue Sky or Dennys, or even Cracker Barrel. So when you snub and lie to the only reason we are there in the first place, well it's the last time we go.

Just an FYI, we still tipped. Nowhere near as much as she would have received had she actually done her job and at least remembered her table's order."}
{"text":"This IHOP was just terrible. A friend and I went to IHOP to have a nice breakfast. The food we ordered took about 20 minutes to get to our table. Then when the food came out it was cold and the French toast was drowning in strawberry syrup. We tried to eat some of it but after a few bites it was just to gross. The manager came over and looked at us as if there was no problem. He then asked us \"did you eat it \" as if we ate all the food off our plate. Mind you we only took a few bite...He was rude and not helpful. I would recommend going to a different location!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location several times but I don't think I will be back.
The food & the service is always good but the portions seem to be getting smaller each time. I always order the same thing, Pancake combo, 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon & hash browns. 
The past 2 times I've eaten here, I've left still feeling hungry after eating all that. I don't even think there was a 1/2 cup of hasbrowns & the bacon slices are so thin.
I think I will just go a little out of my way & eat at The Good Egg where you get realistic size portions, 4 slices of thick cut, meaty bacon for the same price and I NEVER leave hungry. Sorry IHOP you've disappointed me one too many times."}
{"text":"We came in and 5 tables are occupied and we have 45 minuets in waiting. Not even water yet! Nothing! They suck! Will not be returning!!!"}
{"text":"I remember the good old days when you buy 4 Stacks of New York Style Cheesecake Pancakes and the were bigger... I'm  not satisfied at all!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place great service you must ask for Jessica or Wendy as your sever. Food is amazing and of great quality try the sirloin tips they are the best."}
{"text":"Place was horrible. Server dropped a drink all over the table & then when we asked if he was new he said he wasn't, but then we found out that he is. When we got our food everything besides the plates was barley room temperature. Manager said he would get us all new meals, but the server had to re-take the order because he forgot the original order we had. He came again & the food was STILL cold. We left & the manager said that \"there's no way the waffles are cold because we just pulled them off the waffle iron.\" If that is the case, they should check to make sure their waffle iron is functioning right. My father was able to grab & hold the \"freshly cooked\" waffle in his hand. If it was fresh from the iron, he shouldn't be able to without burning his hand.

We went with my parents, my brother & my son to be mother-in-law for my fiancé's birthday breakfast & it was not a good way to start her day. I worked in the restaurant business for 4 years & my father is a cook at a restaurant, that is not how you handle business & Customer Service 101 days never lie to a customer. This restaurant should be closed."}
{"text":"This is a weekly stop for me and my girl. We always feel welcomed when we enter, are seated quickly and our server is great (Her name is Nery). This visit we got a breakfast sampler that includes hash browns, 2 sausage links, 2 pieces of bacon, 2 slices of ham, eggs done your way with buttermilk pancakes. But i got strawberry banana pancakes. The split decision with egg white, french toast, bacon, with sour dough toast. And we also got a side of biscuits and gravy.

The food came out to us fresh the server Nery is my favorite shes always on top of her A game. Anyways we well def come back to this location. And i didnt ask them bout the redem on the free hash browns but will next time"}
{"text":"I get to IHOP at 510pm praying it wasn't busy. I get inside with my 2 boys and noticed that its practically empty inside and no line. I was thankful because I had 2 hungry kids after a long day of shopping. Well the hostess made eye contact with me and ignored me. I waited 15minutes....15minutes!!! The only reason she came to have us seated was because I called the location to be seated! The hostess then had a little attitude like I was inconveniencing her. I waited another 15minutes and still wasn't asked what drinks we wanted. I walked out disgusted. Never coming here again! 
Only reason they have 1 star is because I had to to post this."}
{"text":"Ordered bacon ham and cheese omelette. Never found the bacon and just barely found the ham. Plenty of egg but they were all dried out."}
{"text":"Stopped by this Ihop yesterday after dropping my dog off at the vet. It was fairly busy, but it was Sunday morning, and we were still seated very quickly. As I sipped on my coffee I read over the menu and decided on the Colorado Omelette. It comes with bacon, sausage, shredded beef, ham, onions, green peppers, and cheese. It came with a side of either pancakes, hasbrowns, toast, or fruit. I opted for the hashbrowns. Our server was very friendly, quick, and didn't hover. I really appreciated the great service and I feel terrible I can't recall her name. Not really much else to say. The food was pretty good and the service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Hard to even give 1 star the service was slower then a dead turtle the food came out wrong not once, not twice, not three times but actually 4 times. One of the worst dinning experiences we have ever had. Let me do you all a solid save your money and dine somewhere else!"}
{"text":"If you like food served cold , and undercooked, better yet raw then look no further then going to IHOP. When we showed the mgr the raw and cold food he did not seem to care nor wanted to be bothered. In all honesty you are better off eating a pop tart!"}
{"text":"While I was eating this: NEW! Blackberry & Vanilla Double-Dipped Brioche French Toast, I suddenly felt something sharp on my tongue. I carefully reached in my mouth and removed a stem with thorns (about 3/4\" long) that had been embedded in the blackberry sauce on top of the french toast!

Thank God I eat slowly because this would have gotten stuck in my throat due to the little thorns!!! And Thank God a little kid didn't gulp this down. But, unless they're all removed from all the menus, who knows who will be next???"}
{"text":"Came here over the weekend worse customer service food was nasty place was dirty the table next to us was full of dirty dishes I will never go here again"}
{"text":"Very poorly managed store.  Wait staff were extremely overworked but still friendly.  The poor receptionist was bussing tables, checking in people and cashing out people.  This all on a Sunday morning.  Never saw a manager the entire visit.  Food was good but took forever to come out."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst IHOP I have ever been to! Went there after a party it was around 11:15pm...didn't get out of there til almost 1 am! First of all they took FORVER TO SEAT us, 2nd it took even longer for a waiter to come to the table, and 3rd the wait for the food was just unacceptable . The floors were very dirty & there was trash (napkins & straw wrappers) everywhere! The waiter was nice no doubt but the service completely sucked! I've never been in an IHOP that long! Also when we went to pay we waitied probabaly another 15 minutes until they came to the front. I was so close to just walking out! Don't think I'll ever set foot in this IHOP again! & the food was alright but everything else was a bust!"}
{"text":"This was my very first time eating at IHOP. The French toast was really good and so were the eggs. The Hashbrown was burnt though. The waitress we had seemed to be overwhelmed and somewhat irritated. Its a chain food diner so u can't expect anything exquisite. I would eat here again though."}
{"text":"Edna i believe was my server today at aroubd 745 am. Let me tell you she was so nice. When i go to a restaurant the only thing i really expect is food at a decent time frame and it taste good. But the server tmwas so attentive. A plus all the way. Im glad i drove out of my way. The usual Ihope on decatur is like a soup kitchen compaired to this one"}
{"text":"review would have been higher had we 
1. Been given water after we were seated
2. Did not have to waste half my time looking for \"Tennielle...\"
3. For a light night you would think they were dealing with a full house.
4. From the first bite.....inhaling the aroma of food prepared on a 
\"grill-not-so-scraped-smelled-a-tad-burnt.\"
5. Cooked eggs the way we asked for

As my better half reminded me
Our waitress was very pleasant
And nice and if it was not for the Large Bodies Party with baby makes Nine..!

My suggestion
If cook cannot clean  grill before prep of breakfast
You lose big points for easy meals

The rest of the family enjoyed meal"}
{"text":"When visiting a chain restaurant, I often neglect to read or write Yelp reviews due to the existing expectations of the food; however, I am making an exception because the service at this IHOP location was superb! Despite the fact that half of the restaurant was packed around three in the afternoon on a Monday, our server greeted and seated my boyfriend and I immediately. There were only two servers on shift. Our server Deserae was attentive and immediately apologized for the wait with a smile. We each ordered the meal that included pancakes along with bacon/sausage, hash brown, and eggs! I don't eat red meat and was pleasantly surprised to see that there were several turkey options available as a replacement to the common pork bacon or sausage. I ordered the cupcake pancake with sprinkles and it was a great contrast to its salty counterparts. Deserae continuously checked up on us and refilled our drinks. She even gave us a cup to take our drink to-go! We honestly had no expectations upon dining here and just wanted to get our breakfast food-fix; however, the service was 10/10 and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great veggie omelette!  Special order - no sides, extra spinach, mushrooms, onion, and tomato. Delicious!  Great hot tea selection - English Breakfast by Revolution. Finally, great service!  Thanks IHOP!"}
{"text":"Worse place to go. Came in she sat us down didn't give us a kids menu. When we ordered I asked for country scrambled eggs and the manager who was helping said what is that? When we got our food they didn't give us utensils and nor they didn't give us avocado on top of the omelette on top of that in my meal their was a black hair on my eggs. For a summerlin breakfast joint you would think they would have their shit together."}
{"text":"I had a coupon from the RetailMeNot app, buy one entree, get one of equal or lesser value free up to $9, if you buy 2 beverages, yadda yadda. Only reason we chose to go to ihop for a late dinner. My husband ordered the recommendation from our server, banana waffle, and also got eggs and bacon. He asked for medium well eggs, and mentioned they usually come out too runny, to which our server said she would 'make sure they are more medium well'. Needless to say, they were barely cooked enough to hold their shape, hardly any coloring from being cooked and my husband couldn't eat them. The waffle wasn't that great either. I ordered the SW Club. Super dry!  Once the check came and I showed my coupon, the server left to check with her manager and came back and said they are no longer accepting offers on phones, they have to be a print out. There is nothing on the offer that says this and there isnt even an option to print through the app. I guess they can get away with this because of the fine print that says the offer is subject to change withput notice. Our server was friendly, otherwise it was not a good dining experience, even for an ihop."}
{"text":"PLZ REPLACE WITH A DENNYS! also why is ihop so expensive it's like there's an extra charge for every little thing i mean the food is good but literally the exact same as dennis just more expensive and soooooo slow (most times it has clearly been the cooks fault, not server) the only good thing about this place is the server cole but he could still work once they turn it into a denny's"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I love ihop. At this location the servers needs to not forget about us and not be rude! We waited 1 hour for our order and when it finally arrived, it was wrong. While waiting, I have also noticed there is syrup all over the holder where the syrups sit. I recommend that needs to be clean every time they clean the tables...not sure how long that's been there."}
{"text":"Went to this one a while back and there was a roach in the bathroom stall.  And I don't mean one of those big desert roaches that you're likely to come across every now and then when the humidity is higher.  I mean those small, dirty cockroaches that, where there are one, there are a million.  New Yorkers will know what I mean.  Enough said."}
{"text":"We came in last night around 8pm. There was 3 groups of people trying to pay while 3 groups walked in including us. The groups that were waiting to be seated did not get any attention until after everyone paid. Took about 10 15 minutes. Then they tried to take the groups out of order and we had to tell them who came in first. Once we got seated we noticed no one had food. It didn't take long to get drinks but we asked for another minute with the menu and they gave us 10. We almost got up and left but I really wanted pancakes. The waiter filled up drinks one time and we asked for more then one glass sense it was taking so long. Every order that came out was wrong or missing something. I ordered sausage and got bacon. The other order was supposed to come with pancakes and we were almost done with our meal when they came out, cold I might add. Not the best service."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast after 4 days of expensive meals on our vacation. Needed some financial relief so we went to IHOP. Walked in and the hostess ran down a list of items that they didn't have. The list reads: pancakes, eggs, toast, orange juice. They did have sandwiches but no fries to go with it. Needless to say we walked out. How the hell does that happen? Freakin' clowns running this IHOP. Plus the area is ugly. Small IHOP and in a terrible neighborhood. I wish I could give this place zero stars."}
{"text":"Of all the IHOP locations I have ever been to I would have to say that this is by far the best one. After having numerous bad experiences at other IHOP's I didn't expect much from this one, but I was wrong. It was full yet we had are order taken and our food came out in no time. This is a great IHOP real close to the Las Vegas sign."}
{"text":"Horribly slow service. There wasn't that many people in there and we still waited like 30 minutes for our food to come out. Then another 20 for the waiter just to come take our card for the check. Ended up just leaving cash on the table and walking out. Food was as decent as any IHOP's, just too slow service."}
{"text":"Friendly employees. The Food comes out fast and they keep your drinks refilled. I was originally going to order the Belgium Waffle Combo with Eggs and Sausage. But the server suggested the Ham and Egg Combo with Hashbrowns and you get a half of waffle with strawberries and bananas. Im glad she did. It was delicious.  What is a little odd is when you walk inside at 1130 pm and the server has her what appeared to be 8 yr old son working there. Im sure some sort of labor law is most def being violated. Will i go back?? Hmm Maybe ill visit Dennys next time in the same lot."}
{"text":"So my beautiful girlfriend and I decided to come to IHOP. First off pulling into the parking lot was a pain, it has a dip in the driveway. 
We got in the restaurant and there was chaos everywhere and felt very humid and sticky. Once we were finally sat, the area had garbage on the floor and the booth seat was wet and disgusting.

We decided to just stay and order thinking it would be okay, for the most part we got our drinks and proceeded to order, it took a little bit of time to get our food, once we did get our order our food was cold.
 
First and last time for me"}
{"text":"Really great food and Shonte was an excellent server.  Fast and friendly.  My waffle was delicious and she asked before we left if I wanted a cup of coffee to go.  score!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Breakfast Sampler and the eggs, bacon, ham and sausage were all amazing.  Hot, fresh and cooked perfectly.  The hash browns were not crispy enough for me and I normally request crispy but I forgot, so I had to give them to my husband.  (He likes them lightly browned). The butter on the pancakes would not melt because the pancakes were room temperature, however the maple syrup was hot so it worked out OK for me.  (I don't care for their flavored syrups because they leave a weird after taste and they are not served warm).

My husband ordered the Rooty Tootie Fresh and Fruity breakfast..  He liked everything and it was all cooked to his liking.  He ordered a side of toast to go with his meal however, he was disappointed that it came with only one slice of bread and not the typical two slices.  It wasn't worth an extra $1.50 for just 1 slice.  

The server was amazing!  The hostess and staff upon leaving and paying the bill were very welcoming and friendly.  Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Super slow service, mediocre to poor food..I'd check out other IHOP's in the area....not worth your time."}
{"text":"After my experience tonight, I may not go back to an iHop.  That saddens me.

I went with 2 friends.  I ordered an order of Swedish Crepes and a new breakfast dish that I don't recall the name of but it had pieces of grilled chicken, scrambled egg, tomato, and avocado with what was allegedly a cheddar cheese sauce, all on what was allegedly a Ciabatta roll.  One of my friends ordered the beef tips, which he had eaten before and enjoyed enormously.  He ordered them medium rare.  The 2nd friend ordered a cheeseburger.

The crepes were hard around the edges.  Not crunchy or crispy; no, they were hard.  Hard to cut and hard to chew; unpleasant to eat.  There were a number of issues with the grilled chicken platter.  First, it was dry.  Second, the chicken looked as though someone had pre-chewed it for me.  3rd, the alleged cheddar sauce tasted like ranch dressing on one end of the plate; at the other end, because the sauce had started to cool, it had also started to thicken and did actually taste like cheese.    I thought perhaps they had run out of cheese sauce part way through and had finished it up with ranch.  The problem is, I don't like ranch dressing.  I had one of my friends taste it to confirm that it really did taste like ranch dressing and he said yes, that it did.  And he likes ranch dressing.  Finally, the Ciabatta roll on the bottom actually tasted more like Texas Toast.  This is a new menu item and what I would say is, it is dry and has no flavor and I would recommend that you not keep it on the menu.

My friend's beef tips, ordered medium rare, came out well done.  He sent them back.  The server was very nice; she said something like \"he promises they'll come out the way you want them this time or you won't have to pay for them.\"  As you may guess, out they came and well done they were.  We cut into the largest of the pieces and there was the tiniest whisper of pink on the inside.  Not medium rare.  My other friend's burger, well, we opened it up and almost had to send in a search party, the burger part was very small, dry, and flavorless.  And the onion rings, he said, were a whole lot of breading and not very much onion and he didn't think he would order them again.

This is the first time I've been to a restaurant and everything was terrible.  The reason I rated it a 2 was for nostalgia; I've had food there that was good and I miss those days."}
{"text":"Can I give zero stars? It was so bad we couldn't even make it to our table. My friend came in the door carrying her baby and was ignored. We (3) came in about a minute later and ignored. Two other groups were waiting in the lobby while the hostess walked by ignoring us all. Two girls came in behind us about 15 minutes later, and they were acknowledged in about 2-3 minutes with a \"I'll be with you two soon\". I said \"but we have been here a while\". Ok so without going into the specific tit for tat - the bottom line is the hostess started arguing with us about when we came in and who was before us. I am fully aware of who was before us - don't speak to your guests like that! After letting that resonate for about 60 seconds I decided I didn't even trust these people to serve us food and we left. So now I am sitting here at Cafe 100 getting amazing service and giving my money to people who deserve it."}
{"text":"Here on 4/28/12

Decent food for breakfast . Colorado Omelettes was better than anticipated . Had potroast, bacon ,ham ,sausage , and cheese stuffed into and on top of the omlette. Coffee was ground and brewed here and served in the gold pot kept on our table. Syrup served warm in a clean, non sticky caraf. Very good !"}
{"text":"I've eaten here for two days in a row now while in Charlotte on business. 

It is clean...tables floor...everything.  Staff was very friendly.  And prices are in the park. Try the new chorizo omelet. ..spicy.

Best IHOP I've done."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband to get brunch,  and we were seated in a booth back to back with an employee that was on maternity leave. I love children,  especially babies- but hearing about this Womans labor processes and the tools used to \"pull him out\"  was definitely NOT what I wanted to hear before EATING.  I think 80% of the employees were surrounding her table.  And all we heard were birth stories and fussy baby from being passed around. Congratulations to the new mother-but next time please choose a more secluded area to talk about this stuff rather than in front of patrons. Food was overall good- a few things were messed up over excitement.  But nothing major.  Overall just... idk
Grossed out."}
{"text":"This restaurant gets a BIG FAT F!  The server was nice his name was Vitaly.  We waited about 10 min to get a table not too bad for a Sunday morning.  We ordered and my bacon came back with a hair cooked in and no extra charge for that!  My banana's on my pancakes were really black and spoiled. And my date's pancake was really burnt.  I sent mine back....they brought a new order in ok kool. The girl at the table across from us also had hair in her food and the plate was sent back. Amazing!  They need new cooks, c'mon its Vegas, everyone is looking for a job. Server got lost  for 40 min.  Came back but didnt have check then he got lost for 20 min when we stood up and really wanted to walk out as in dine and dash, not like that meal was worth anything.  We told cashier the server never came back then Vitally walks by and says nothing, we pay and leave.  We get offered no apology, no discount, no nothing. I dont think Ill ever be going back there!"}
{"text":"I used to love IHOP and then I really hated going to IHOP.  I haven't tasted ihop for over two years, until one day my mom wanted to eat there.  I was completely against going, but she convinced me to go.  

We went to this IHOP near our home and I was completely blown away how clean and refreshing the place looked.  I was just shocked! All the IHOP I have been going to looks dirty. 

Service (4.5): Our server was completely amazing and friendly.  He checked on us regularly and made some funny jokes.

Food (4.5): Omg, the bacon does not look like it was microwaved. Whoa! My plate is full of food! Double whoa, the food tasted amazing and my waffle is so yummy and fluffy! I cannot believe this right now! 
-Usually all the food I have gotten at IHOP looked so unappetizing and everything look like it has been microwaved.  However, this location the food looked amazing and tasted great.  

Overall (5):  The service was great and the food tasted the way I never expected IHOP's food to taste.  So i was very pleased and satisfied.   I am so happy it is walking distance from my house."}
{"text":"Sometimes all you want is cheap breakfast at a convenient time of night. Am I saying that it is the best breakfast you will ever get. No! Yet when you need to eat and only some pancakes will do, then IHOP tends to be my go to spot. I love how fluffy their flapjacks are. For some, the option of flavored syrups are a plus, but traditional is the only one I need."}
{"text":"IHOP folks, that's right. Let me tell you that this one is great on service and the food was really great.  My family was also amazed on our experience here at the IHOP.  I got the monster cheeseburger, the wife had the breakfast sampler, oldest daughter had the 2x2x2 and the baby had applesauce. Breakfast was really good, butter wasn't frozen, the cheeseburger was made to be eaten.  I will definitely bring my family here again and it's good to write something positive about an IHOP."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast memories as a little kid was going to IHOP and being able to pick out anything I wanted for breakfast.  On Saturday we decided to try the recently opened McCandless IHOP.

We arrived around 8 am.  The lobby was very crowded and the hostess informed us that the kitchen was about 15 minutes behind.  We didn't care, I wanted some breakfast!!  We were seated fairly quickly and greeted right away by our awesome server Darryl.  He checked on us frequently, making sure that we were happy. 

 BJ got a French Toast combo with scrambled eggs, sausage and hash browns.  The kitchen sent out bacon, Darryl went back to the kitchen and immediately returned with his links.  For my breakfast, I got the Smokehouse Combo with two smoked sausage links served with two eggs, hash browns and two buttermilk pancakes.  The smoked sausages where huge and yummy.  And the hash browns here were perfectly cooked.  They have the exact amount of crunchy crisp on the outside and the inside is tender and tasty.  They were out of this world hash browns.  I am serious.  And the pancakes.  Oh, my.  I love them here.  So fluffy and I love the buttermilk flavor.  Oh, my.  Love IHOP!"}
{"text":"It is 4:28 PM and total of three tables are seated, total of 7 people. It is SLOW. I mean 10 minutes in and have not even placed an order yet. Are there just two employees?! If so please make customers aware of waiting time. I rather drive to some other IHOP than wait here for ever.

Also for the love of good service waiter should write down what customers order rather than ask two times after ordering what we ordered. Just write it down and stop being unprofessional! It does not require special education to understand this basic concept."}
{"text":"Pathetic place, will never go back!! My wife was drinking her coffee and there was something gooey in it half way through. Called the waitress over and she took it to the back and came back and said \"oh, it's just a coaster\" that was it... no apology, no manager. Still billed her for the coffee. Went to take the survey when we got home, it had already been taken. Submitted feedback through the web site, no one replied.

Will never go back."}
{"text":"Really sad and unfortunate that this couple came in as I was placing a to  go order. After about 25 minutes, I see the couple upset and leaving. The man  explained that they were seated, but no other acknowledgement for drinks or ordering of food. The couple was not rude to any employee. Not 1 single employee apologized as the manager came out and he proceeded to tell the couple to stay. The man advised they had to leave for other business. keep in mind, not even the manager apologized to these people. As the couple was walking out of the door, the manager, all 3 employees started speaking spanish! How very rude what they were saying! No, i'm not hispanic, my brother is a mix of a black and hispanic! Yes, being bilingual is awesome and sad at the same time when people think they can just say anything about anyone. When I spoke up and advised them they were unprofessional & very rude, the look on their faces were priceless! I'm not the hating anyone type,but I will pray for God to have mercy on their prejudices towards other races. I won't ever go there again and I'm spreading this story everwhere. Truly sad. Shame on you all and maybe you should find a different profession or take classes to have professionalism!"}
{"text":"Never again will my family and I come back to this IHOP! Never mind the fact that the service is awful, and the food is overpriced for being a mediocre restaurant, but today, this morning for breakfast, I was blown away by the staff and their behavior! 
 I'm with my three children and a girl friend! Anyone who has children knows that going out to eat with one child is work, with three it's a challenge. So there we are, we finished our breakfast. I need to use the restroom, so I ask my friend to take my children to the car and get them buckled in, while I do my business and pay the check. What happened next, three of the serving staff run up to my friend and my young children accusing them of skipping out on the bill. First and foremost, it is not a service persons job description to strong arm anyone to get payment. Not even a security guard can. The most they can do is report my license plate number! My kids were scared and confused, not understanding why or what is happening. I was physically upset by the accusation that I threw up my food. I'm completely baffled by this and cannot understand how IHOP can allow their staff to act in this manner! 
I still paid my check of $60.03 and left a $10.00 tip. That will be the last time I spend my money with them. The manager, April did apologize, but the damage had already been done.... 
TRAINING YOUR STAFF AND MAKING SURE THEY FULLY UNDERSTAND THEIR JOB DESCRIPTION IS KEY! 
If you decide to eat here make sure you pay your bill before using the restroom!"}
{"text":"This IHOP location is convenient to the near West side of campus.  Between the University Hospital and  Hilldale Mall.  Weekend mornings,  this place is busy!  There are extra parking spots on the other side of restaurant or park on Ridge and walk over.

I usually go on a week day morning because it's quieter.  I have had good service when I'm noticed.  There has been a time or two that I've had to shout to the back kitchen that I was there.  But the coffee comes quickly and the food shortly after that.

Food wise, it's like an IHOP anywhere.  Order a breakfast and get pancakes, or go lighter.  They have something for anyone.  Sometimes they run out of bananas, which can be a bummer.

If you are looking for an impressive brunch, you know this isn't the place.  But looking for a good breakfast that is cost effective, come on it."}
{"text":"\"It was IHOP on a Sunday, what do you expect?\" will be your first reaction to my review.   I've done take out a couple times over the last two months, and both times the experience wasn't exactly my idea of a good time.   Yes, both take-out calls were on a Sunday morning, and I'm well aware that IHOP on a weekend morning is going to be a madhouse.   And a madhouse it was!   The girls who work the front/cashier spot and also take the take out orders definitely had their hands full.  The 1st time half of my order had never even been put into the system so I had to wait an extra 20 minutes for it to be prepared.   The 2nd time my omelet came out as a regular one and not the egg-white version I'd asked for, so yes, another wait.   It would have been much more discouraging to enter the establishment, find these mistakes and see the cashiers just swiping their Tinder apps on their phone.    But instead they were faced with constant traffic of customers wanting to be seated, customers wanting to pay, people foolishly calling in take-out orders on a Sunday morning (what morons!), and customers like myself waiting for their revised orders and also inquiring if they had any sort of blackberry or boysenberry jam (they dont, only Strawberry and Grape?!)    So I forgive them for the mistakes, as they were very apologetic each time and kept a pleasant attitude through the maelstrom that is IHOP on weekend mornings.    I was a little disappointed in the lack of care management seemed to have about the situations (and yes, I did see a manager informed of the first issue).   No kind of offer of discounted or gratis items for the honest mistake, and not even an apology for the wait.  

Onto the food.   Both times I ordered an omelet for myself, and outside of the long wait, I was pretty pleased with them.   I'm weird when it comes to the amount of mushrooms I like on pretty much anything, so when my custom ordered omelet with swiss, bacon, mushrooms and spinach came out absolutely loaded with them, I spent a bit of time removing 3 lbs of them before consuming.   But I didn't preface my order with the fact I 'd only need a handful, so maybe they thought they were being generous.   NOTE TO IHOP:  feel free to substitute 4lbs of bacon instead of mushrooms next time.    Outside of mushroom-mania, everything else was to my liking and I would recommend the food here.    Just don't call it in on a Sunday.  duh."}
{"text":"This location was within walking distance of my hotel.  I went about 5:30 on a Sunday evening.  Promptly greeted and seated.  Server was polite and attentive.

Ordered a bacon cheeseburger and fries.  Minimal wait time before my food was ready.  Good sized burger patty and tasted good for a non burger specialty restaurant.  Bacon was an ample topping and cooked to a good crisp.  Nothing fancy, just a good basic burger meal."}
{"text":"This place disgust me I would come here at least once a month. Earlier today I got 2 coffees and 2 waters unfortunately one of the cups smelled like a wet dog and even the manager admit it . And all she did was apologize my wife and th table next to me were shocked at the smell of the water... why is this place still open. If I get sick in 3 days \"takes that long for bacteria to get someone sick\" I'm going to get blood test done and this IHOP will have a big dilemma \""}
{"text":"Horrible experience. If I could give negative stars I would.
I go there with my family of 5 to be told the ac isn't working and its crazy warm.. Ok we can deal, I've wanted Ihop for a cpl weeks now so we'll deal. 
45 minutes later we ask the server next to us that we're looking for our server and our food.. She said \"oh he walked out and quit and you'll have another server soon, and truthfully your food might be lost somewhere back in the kitchen.\" 
We're at Denny's now. IHOP can suck a big one. We're never going back until new management and they renovate the inside and make it more customer friendly.. I shouldn't have to walk thru the kitchen to go to the bathroom. What type of crap is that.
The LEAST they could have done is have the manager come and explain the situation!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This particular IHOP is without a doubt the slowest and most ill kept IHOP that I have experienced. Last time I went the coffee creamer was curdled..and it was non-dairy. I'm not sure how that even happens. The servers always seem polite, but service has been remarkably slow each time that I have visited."}
{"text":"Just walked out!  My son and I sat on the patio for over 10 minutes with NO service. I had to walk back into the building to get someone's attention. I have never had a good experience with Ihop and now I will never go back. I am forever boycotting Ihop!"}
{"text":"I typically avoid IHOP and I should have stuck to my guns on this one. Newly constructed and close to Nellis so I decided to go against my better judgement. Bad idea. Service was OK but I am finding that good service around Vegas is scarce."}
{"text":"It's been years since I had breakfast at IHOP.  After my visit, I remembered why.  While the food presentation was slightly better than the last time, my food was cold.  Usually that means a server is talking with another employee.  Food does not get cold instantly from the grill.  Our waitress had to be told things 2, and 3 times!  We needed someone who would listen attentively.  It will be years before I step foot in any IHOP again.  At least it's not as bad as the one on Eastern Avenue"}
{"text":"We experienced the same horrible service that most are mentioning. More than slow service. Waited almost a half hr for our food. Was not hot and no apology. 

Management has a problem or a new manager is needed. The kitchen is definitely struggling. 
Needed to hire some experienced servers as well. 
Will NOT be going back to this IHOP ever again.

We will also be telling all our friends to choose another breakfast establishment"}
{"text":"Ordered some hashbrown a to go since my girlfriend was craving them. To go service was fast, hostess was friendly and the location is good for the southern residents."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner so it was pretty empty. Took a second for the hostess to greet us but once she did she promptly sat us at a table near another family. We waited and reviewed our menus.... and waited.... and waited.... and waited. The table next to us had a waiter come over multiple times. We had no one even bring us water. Several other workers were standing around, wandering around, and whenever I tried to make eye contact with one, they promptly shuffled away. 

Forget it. After 20 minutes we got up and left. Hostess didn't even inquire why we were leaving. Never again will I set foot here. I don't mind a bit of a wait, or slow service if it's understaffed or busy, but come on."}
{"text":"My family and I tried this location for the first time today... They were pretty busy but or waitress was friendly and got our drinks and order quickly. I heard no complaints about the food.. Everyone finished their plates...but when it was time for our check we couldn't find our waitress... We waited almost 10 minutes before asking another server for boxes and our ticket...she then reappeared and we were on our way. We love IHOP so I'm sure we will try this location again soon."}
{"text":"Always a favorite no matter where I am.  Had a late dinner with my cousin and we couldn't decide between chicken or breakfast - so we chose iHop.  Because of the area they aren't open super late but it hit the spot.  He got the chicken and waffles, my uncle got the BLT and I had the breakfast sampler.  Even though they were closing up as we were finishing we didn't feel rushed."}
{"text":"I've never received such atrocious service in my entire life. Tried calling ahead to place an order last week. The phone rang for 3.5 minutes and no one answered. So I went down to the restaurant in person to order and pickup for the rest of my office. Was not greeted at the counter when I walked in. When someone finally came to the counter, I was treated rudely and the employee turned his back on me several times, even going so far as to walk away in the middle of my sentence to seat someone else. 

Then, while waiting for the order to be ready, I asked if there was something wrong with the phones. The employee felt it was appropriate to tell me that he doesn't answer the phone this late at night because another organization orders to-go and doesn't leave a tip. This is extremely unprofessional and definitely not an appropriate way to speak to a customer. 

I was willing to overlook this and try again this evening, but lo and behold, when I tried calling, no answer on the phone. In conclusion, IHOP, you've got some serious work to do if you want to keep your store open!"}
{"text":"IHOP is pretty much the exact same anywhere in the entire country so if you're ever hungry and you're low on money and you want to get stuffed on some solid food I would say stop by here"}
{"text":"I don't really like to leave bad reviews on anything,
But I have been to 3 different IHOP's I've the last 3 months and walked out twice do to ridiculous waits. This time the waiter told me that they forgot to place our order after sitting there for over 15 min."}
{"text":"I love coming to ihop and my favorite thing to order is the sirloin tips and eggs! The steak was cooked just to my liking and the rest of my meal was fantastic. Will definitely be back to this location"}
{"text":"Food was great!! The only thing i have to say was customer service could've been a little better. I sat and waited a long time for a refill on my drink, as well as to get my bill"}
{"text":"A sad day in Breakfastville this morning! The hostess stand couldn't get it right, the kitchen was a total fail when they didn't add tomato to my omelette, then sent it out with COLD tomatoes just thrown on top of the omelette I had already sliced it open.  Multiple mixups with food as well. Couldn't get coffee or syrup to save our lives. They forgot to remake my omelette and then it finally came, my whole family was already done eating. Plus, they have no cashier (What IHOP does not have a cashier?!) so our poor server had to come cash us out.

We are optimistic and thought we would give this location a try after family advised us against it. We are not ones that ask for special orders or exceptions to the menu. Very understanding and empathetic as we come from former food service careers. Not so much going further for this location."}
{"text":"Variety was what we were looking for before heading to the airport for our return home, and this is exactly what we got. IHOP offers a wide variety of good old American staples. Our table had breakfast (pancakes), lunch (sandwich and fries) and dinner (fried shrimp an fish) on the same check and everyone was satisfied. Surprisingly, the service was excellent. In my experience, IHOP service is typically mediocre at best.  This location, however, was the exception to the rule.  Our waitress was rewarded nicely for her smile and attention (making balloon animals for the girls didn't hurt either). 

Only 3 stars however because, in general, the food (although satisfying) was just average."}
{"text":"This is seriously the worst Ihop in Las Vegas. I've lived in this area for 8+ years and this location has become considerably worse over the years. Today was the final straw that I decided to write a review. Besides the fact that the food has become average to just plain bad, today the non service we received was absolutely horrible. We were seated almost immediately because they were not very busy \"but I guess I can see why now\". We were there for all of 25 minutes and decided to get up walk out and leave I will never return to that place ever again. In that 25 minutes no one offered any drinks and we sat there watching our server talk with the people in the booth next to us the entire time and never acknowledged us being there or offered to bring us drinks. When she finally walked over to offer drinks we got up and left. After we left we were asking for the corporate information and apparently nobody had that information so I was forced to go online and find that information for myself. I am very very disappointed in this location and hope they can get some new management in the near future. Until then I will never be a patron to this place again..."}
{"text":"Friendly and helpful employees. Didn't have to wait too long for my meals when I came here around 1-3 in the afternoon to eat. Parking is super close and never have any issues finding any close. The food is typical IHOP food but it's good and reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"I've been to multiple I hop locations and this one by far had the best customer service I've ever encountered! The staff was so friendly. The manager Shannon was attentive and made sure we were seated right away and suggested a delicious milk shake! I absolutely recommend this ihop!!"}
{"text":"Hmmm OK...well I'm not much of a diner or IHOP type of person. At the handful of times I've eaten at IHOP's they are all pretty much the same. Service is always OK and cleanliness is alright. On this particular day we went because of a coupon for AYCE pancakes (not me as I couldn't even eat 1 pancake). I had the omelette...as always pretty standard. This location is probably better than most as it is in a nicer area. Waitress was slow and service was slow but that's to be expected during breakfast time.  Breakfast is a meal I just rather eat in my own home as I'm used to cereal, almond milk and a fruit.
I'm not much for large breakfasts and def not much into a lot of heavy pancakes and such. For those that are.....I'm sure you will be satisfied with IHOP."}
{"text":"I just love the speciality omlettes here. Ambience is cool and the staff is very nice. Would to love to visit again."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here everything was fine the food was great the service was great even though it was packed. My second trip here was an absolute disaster. Our waitress had too much going on that we were ignored constantly. The worst was the food. I order the same thing every time I go to IHOP and this was by far the most tragic. The pancakes were so small I sent them back only to come back again not too much bigger (I've ordered the same dish for about 20 years now i know how big they r supposed to be). My friends eggs and bacon were disgusting. They tasted like they were cooked earlier and left out for hours. And what was the most surprising was that it was hardly busy yet we got worse service than when it was packed. Be warned your IHOP experience here may be good or it may suck."}
{"text":"Normally I don't waste time giving a bad review of a restaurant. I just don't spend my money there anymore. 

But this needs to be said. 

This is the first time I truly felt like the staff was demon possessed and didn't like their jobs. It was the first time I actually suspected they might have tampered with my food. 

It's a chain restaurant and I expect a certain processed food quality to it all. But when I see that half the restaurant is dirty, AFTER I had to wait 10 minutes before being seated... 

When the manager gets a phone call and comes to answer it while folks are waiting in the lobby, but no one is bussing tables...then goes back to the floor like they see no one in the lobby...

When you are served your coffee, then immediately after your pour your cup all the wait staff finds a reason to go past your table and ask \"are you ok?\" You start to suspect someone did something to your coffee and they are looking for a laugh when you drink it. 

When you don't drink it and instead leave it and go with the rest of your meal which tastes terrible like someone spiked the pancake batter with unmentionables and they take forever to bring your check as if they're waiting on the show... there's a problem.

I already had a great experience at an IHOP in Ballantyne after church. That place was great any clean and tasty and the staff was on point and very friendly.

But THIS location, looked like the projects and trailer trash all came together to make a terrible dining experience. It smelled terrible like when you have a cockroach infestation...you know that musty oily smell that only a cockroach would love - apparently they're used to it...and one of the servers apparently put blue cheese dressing in the ranch bottle, another order wasn't cooked completely (chicken apparently) and the manager looked like she didn't have it together. Maybe bothered by here boyfriend who called her at work. 

There are other IHOPs. If you aren't stuck at a nearby hotel with no car rented, or got no access to Uber, be warned this is still not a convenient place. Deal with no pancakes then. 

Otherwise, drive another 5 minutes away to the one on Tryon street or something. You'll feel skeezed after this place. 

I still feel dirty 2 hrs later.

Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"We wanted to find somewhere to eat before our 1 AM red eye.   The food was not too bad for everyone. The service left a little to be desired.

We arrived just after 10 PM on a Friday night with about three other tables in the restaurant. 5 minute greet time. 23 minute ticket time. The server didn't bring out the side salad we ordered and still charged us for it.

The big steak omelette with three pancakes was cooked well and had a nice mix of ingredients: steak, hash browns, green peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, cheddar cheese, and sides  of sour cream and salsa. I was challenged to finish everything. No complaints from the rest of the family with their food which was a burger and strawberry crepes.

With plenty of options for late night food, wouldn't put this place on the bottom, but definitely wouldn't put it at the top of the list."}
{"text":"Great service, didn't wait long for our food, and weren't rushed after our meal to pay! Food came just as we ordered didn't need to send anything back, and our drinks were never empty! 

Good place for breakfast or dinner! :)"}
{"text":"Hey this is by far the shittiest IHOP I've ever been to. Not only are they rude to their customers but they hate each other as well. I sat way in the corner late night as they all talked shit about each other very loudly and didn't hold anything back. My friend got called a bitch by one of the waitresses by the name of Kat, she's like super short and miserable looking you can't miss her. The manager also didn't do jack when we complained to her. I will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Not the best IHOP I've been to. Servers are usually rude, and the service is unbelievably slow, even when there's no one else in there. The food usually tastes good, but the restaurant isn't exactly clean, so I'm not sure if it's trustable or not."}
{"text":"First off, let me say the service was excellent! Shelby kept us happy & the manager checked on us a couple of times. We've been here a few times for breakfast or lunch with a friend who lives close by. I have a wheat sensitivity, so I avoid the pancakes, toast, crepes, etc. However, I love eggs & omelettes. So today I tried the bacon omelette. Sure, it was tasty -- but I literally should have followed my gut & not had it because IHOP puts pancake batter in their omelettes & I've been paying the piper ever since! This must be something special for them, but it doesn't serve those of us with food sensitivities. Next time, I'll be ordering bacon & eggs...it's safer that way."}
{"text":"Service was horrible, attitudes are negative all around. We were sat down after waiting for 5 minutes with only 4 people in entire restaurant. Then waited 20-25 minutes for the waitress to tell us from across the room that there are 2 tables ahead of us and she would come get our order when she had time. Wish there were negative stars to give."}
{"text":"This visit received a prompt greeting by the hotess/manager after efficient service, food in a timely manner, and as we ordered it. Restrooms were well kempt. And as Forrest Gump says...\"that's all I got ta say about that.\""}
{"text":"Go here often being it's right down the road from me, it's always a hit or miss wth this place. You'll either get really good service or really bad, it's much better than the one on 67th & Peoria that's for sure. Don't let the 3 star review fool you, I go there enough to see it all but if this is your first time you will most likely have a good experience."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. Rob got three of our five orders wrong and even forgot to bring back some coffee after we returned the burnt coffee. We had to ask for silverware and napkins. He was always in a hurry despite there being only one in five tables occupied. I hope this was only a one time occurrence, but it just happened to be the one time I was visiting from California."}
{"text":"I ordered the T-bone steak and eggs for $16.00 and was so disappointed not only because I order it rare and got it well done but the waitress (Marsela) dropped my food off and never came back to check to see if it was made to order!  I had to wait until she came to serve another table when I could catch her attention.  I took 2 bites out of the steak and knew it was too overcooked for my liking!  Unfortunately the only time my waitress found out is when I asked for a to go box and complained.  She said she put the order in right and it wasn't her fault.  I told her a good waitress would check to make sure it was properly cooked shortly after serving my meal!  I normally leave at least 20% for a tip but the service was so bad I didn't leave her a penny!  Maybe I should have and maybe she would have gotten the hint!  I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN AND WILL DISUADE ANYONE I KNOW ABOUT EVEN THINKING ABOUT DINING AT THAT IHOP!  I Wish I could give a negative Star instead of giving them the satisfaction of a single Plus Star!!!!  So go there if you want badly cooked food and lousy service!"}
{"text":"I stopped eating at Ihop for like 10 years i decided to give them a try . I eat here at least twice a month they have great food their omlettes are awesome and pancakes with fruit excellent. Kudos to the cooks  they make it happen along with the nice servers."}
{"text":"took 45 minutes to get a table, the lady at the front wrote our name down and when i went to check she even had lost the page with our name on it, after a long wait the waitress seemed to be in such a hurry that closed her book and was about to take off and we wherent even finish ordering, after that she brought the food and every single plate we got was wrong....every order was wrong and she didnt do any changes we asked for,  i have been at alot of ihop restaurants and this is by far THE WORST i do not recomend this specific location to ANYONE, never going to this location ever, DO NOT GO HERE"}
{"text":"Went in here this morning and stood at the front for 7-8 minutes and was not helped by anyone. Needless to say  walked out. Won't be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Service would get a 5 star review, Benjamin was awesome and attentive.   Healthy selections would get a 5 star review.  They will make your omelet with Pam if you ask, dry toast, egg whites, and 2% milk instead of half and half if you ask for it.  My only compliant was the price.  An egg white omelet with some veggies [see pix], dry whole wheat toast, and a coffee was approximately $17.50!  So at that price, you might as well go to  a Vegas buffet and have them make your omelet right in front of you.  I always find it hard to believe in a town with so many options that people will pay those prices for breakfast."}
{"text":"Food came out cold, order was wrong, manager was not very understanding. Kaya was a great server though"}
{"text":"Now I'm use to the type of service at IHOP where it takes 90 minutes plus from sitting down to paying normally with subpar service. Having just moved to the area, my hubby and I decided it was time to give IHOP another try. So we were here on Mother's Day at 7 pm for dinner. We were immediately greeted and seated by Armerado (Not sure on his name spelling). He was back within a few minutes to get our drinks and our order. We promptly got our coffees and waters. He came by within the next 5 minutes just to update us that our food would be out in the next couple of minutes. Our food came out and was nice and hot.  Armerdao came back to make sure everything was well with our food and refilled our drinks. He also chatted for a minute and remarked on how cute our 5 month old was.  At the end he brought us our check and asked if we needed anything else and no rush on the check.  We were very impressed with not only how friendly and fast he was with our experience but also how he managed the 5 other tables with parties from 3-9 people at each table.  Very please with our visit and we are looking forward to going back again, soon."}
{"text":"Honestly, this IHOP is amazing.  The service is very quick and the food still ends up being delicious.  Service is even super quick during rush hour!  The staff is very friendly.  I would totally recommend going to this IHOP.  I go there most Saturdays for a reason."}
{"text":"My dad and I weren't going to our usual IHOP because we didn't want to pay for an Uber to go that far.  I was a little nervous about going to this IHOP because a saw a lot of bad reviews, but it was great!  It was rush hour and there were a lot of people.  We waited for 15 minutes which was pretty short considering all the people waiting.  We were seated by our waitress who was really nice.  She left for a quick moment, and a few seconds later, she was back asking us what we wanted to drink.  Drinks came quickly and we ordered our food.  While waiting, I took the time to analyze my surroundings and noticed the restaurant was very clean.  We got our food in no time and ate.  It was delicious.  There is only one small disappointment about which didn't really affect too much of my meal.  The scrambled eggs were a very small portion.  Smaller than snack size.  Otherwise, it was great!  I would totally go back.  The service was extremely quick for rush hour.  I have no idea why the other reviewers had a bad time."}
{"text":"No one was in there for dinner. Except for a homeless man who went around begging at the tables. He eventually asked a waiter (who was sitting at a table on social media) and he gave him some money. I never got my water refilled and although the waitress was polite, she never checked back in with me."}
{"text":"Evening service. Some poor guy was waiting for his takeout for 1 1/2 hours. He should have walked out.   We sat and played table football with the sweetener packets for an hour before we got our so-so food.   This place has done a lot better."}
{"text":"My visit was trash my server was very rude when I had ask questions regarding the meal I had wanted and once we got our food she put whipped cream on the pancakes when I asked her not to then just handed me the check? Like how do you know I'm done ordering maybe I wanted a desert.. once I got my check she disappeared and my eggs were bland but for my trash ass service I got 20% and my bacon was dryer then my elbows"}
{"text":"IHop is the coolest club hang out in Robinson. For the employees, that is.  Walk in and see a crowd of 9 people kickin it, relaxing, laughing with each other. Customers are welcome to join each other in talking and relaxing while they're ignored for 10 minutes, then seated.  You'll have plenty of time to watch the employees have a blast hanging out with each other, and not doing their jobs.  The 10 minute wait for coffee is also an ample opportunity for this, just remember to ask for a spoon, because they won't give you one (you're supposed to stir coffee with your finger I guess?).   Great place to work if you don't like doing your job.  Great place to eat if you like customer service that reminds you of a Gulag."}
{"text":"Excellent IHOP.  Very pleasant atmosphere, courteous, friendly staff and excellent food.  No negatives to report.  It is the best IHOP we have been in.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hostess sat us down on table that wasn't even ready. She just took the dirty plates off the table and asked us to sit down. Dirty used coffee pot still on table. No utensils. Food crumbs still on table and seats. Ketchup bottle open and Keptchup on table. I then asked if she could clean our table and she responded \"oh, is not clean yet\" as if she didn't already know. Then I get a coffee mug with lipstick on it. I ask the waitress for a new, clean cup which she never brings. Needless to say, I didn't order any food as I just upset at the way my experience started. This is the second time I have a bad experience at this location. Will not be returning. Thank you to Mike, I'm assuming is another hostess, for trying to make this breakfast trip better."}
{"text":"Wow this place has completely turned around. We used to go all the time when it first opened. Then portions started getting smaller, service became a very low priority and the staff just seemed like they wanted to be anywhere but here. I was with a party of 9 on Thanksgiving Day. We came in at 1:45  they seated us immediately.  We took our time to order. We were playing catch up with old friends. We ordered and  the food was served quickly. The turkey dinner was much better than expected. The portions were huge. We laughed and talked some more before finally leaving. Come to find out they closed at 2pm for Thanksgiving and at no time did we feel rushed. The manager came by to ask how everything was. The server even got us drinks to go. We all tried the new pancake cake. This was awesome. Thank you for making our Thanksgiving dinner so wonderful."}
{"text":"We got here at 9:30am, were told they would need to ask a server if she wanted to take us...umm ok cool to know they give them options Then after a short wait while the lobby filled with people we we were seated by someone else who said she was tired of waiting on the hostess to seat people. Our table had a cleaning rag still on it. 15 min later someone else  came to take our order. 45 min later customers that were seated after us had eaten and left and we still had no food, all we had ordered was scrambled eggs and bacon and plain pancakes, seriously nothing special or complicated . The hostess couldn't even find a manager for us to complain to so we just walked out. Almost the most ridiculous experience I've ever had at a restaurant and especially with a hungry 3 year old.... never again."}
{"text":"Within walking distance for much of residential ASU and, most importantly, open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Many breakfast spots near campus close at 2:00 in the afternoon or require a car to reach. The pitchers of coffee on the table are perfect for late nights studying or recovering.

Long, narrow space. Everything is still new. HD televisions. Tables can be moved around to accommodate large groups and lots of booths are available to seat two or four.

Still an IHOP, not Snooze... but a nice addition to the area. The former IHOP near campus was a casualty of the Graduate Hotel, not a bad trade off, but I'm happy IHOP is back. Service this day was very, very, very slow, a huge negative. Servers were friendly and the food was solid when it did arrive, except for the pancakes. They were beyond cold, odd for a restaurant that has (or once had) the word \"pancake\" in its name.

I sensed early on that there was a service issue this day. I watched an apologetic manager checking on tables. I'll definitely be back, however, to give them another try. The facility and the location are just too good."}
{"text":"Two stars might be a bit much for this place, but I have never had issues with service, just their blah food.
Everything has a lot of salt in it. EVERYTHING. Everything is pre-made as well, from the eggs, to the pancake mix, to their stuffed french toast. How do I know this? I asked once if I could get the stuffed french toast without raisins in the toast. \"Oh, they are already in there. We just thaw it.\" Um. EW. 
I've gotten still frozen strawberries (which were not good at all), greasy eggs (do they saute them in butter back there?) and limp, ill looking tomato slices.
I use to go to this place when I was in high school, when there was no other place open late for teens to mingle and eat junk. It seems every time I have ever gone, something gets messed up. Whether it is my plate of sliced tomatoes that somehow turned into a plate of pancakes (they really try to give those things out), or my eggs being over easy, not scrambled. 
Service is alright; sometimes you get a slow waiter, and sometimes you don't, but I have never had a rude one."}
{"text":"If only zero stars was an option. Never have I ever just walked out of a restaurant before. We sat there for 30 mins and nothing in sight. I did however sit in direct view of the kitchen. I watched plates literally get stacked up and hardly leaving the kitchen. Two plates would leave and one would come back wrong. I even watched one burger come back and sit on the line of food. We left before I could see who the lucky recipient was going to be. 
We saw the manager in the back moving plates around then next thing I know, he was in the back cooking. This location needs a lot of work. Based on the reviews looks like they have some serious problems."}
{"text":"Friday 12:30 AM 

The restaurant was clean and the food wasn't horrible, so that's something. It wasn't great, but if you've read my legendary review of Steelyard Walmart and thusly and most correctly believe that Steelyard anything might be an exercise in WTF, you'll know I'm actually being complimentary to IHOP. 

One thing - our server rushed us and that's something I really don't enjoy. There's a fine line between efficiency and annoyance. If customers answer yes when you ask if they need a few minutes, give them say 8-10 by my standards, maybe less if you look over and see menus down and napkins being eaten. 

That fact aside, he was a good server. Our drinks were promptly refilled which is something I do enjoy. 

I thought for what we got the total bill was a little high, but it's not a place I'll go to often so I suppose it evens out in the end."}
{"text":"This was an awesome breakfast experience. The dining room was very clean which I always like that see. 
We were seated without a long wait.  And for that brief moment the hostess was very polite, conversational, and happy.
Our waitress Lynn was by far one of the best I've had in quite a long time. She is the prime example of what superior Customer service should be like.  And because of the outstanding service we received here I can't wait to come back and eat here again."}
{"text":"My sister got Chorizo, she took one bite and automatically she made a face, it was way too salty!! Being the nice person she is. She tried to cover it up with ketchup, that was still a horrible taste. So the waiter came and took it away. Didn't even bother for a new order or ask if she wanted anything else.

Strawberries banana pancake. Is what my nephew got. I told him to put the banana on a separate plate because I am allergic.( we're sharing). 15 minutes later, his pancakes came out. No bananas in sight.. We ask him four times that were missing a plate of bananas. Yet. No bananas. I was annoyed because my nephew didn't want to eat, so I got up myself and ask the people in the back to give me a bananas. And when they did, the banana was bruised!!!

I ordered the vegetarian omlette, it was volcano on with massive cheese. When I eating eggs? Or cheese? cheese! I just took off the cheese and try to eat what I have on my plate.. it was bad. All bad. :/

Overall, the food was horrible,  I still paid for it, andd TIPPED. This was just a horrible experience."}
{"text":"As far as IHOP establishments are concerned, I felt this place is clean and immaculate. Our server was friendly and attentive. There isn't much else you can say about IHOP in terms of food. Their menu is consistent, so if you've tried their menu once, you know what's it about. Though I will say this IHOP chicken and waffles serves chicken tenders, not chicken wangsss. Also, they had their AYCE pancakes promotion going on when we went. 

If you sign up for their e-newsletter, you get a free rooty-tooty fresh and fruity pancakes on your bday. It used for the a full meal instead of a full stack of pancakes. Kind of a bummer, lol"}
{"text":"Nice that they are 24hrs but me and my bf were the only late night customers and the waitress still messed up the order. Bathroom was very dirty!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the shady part of the strip.  There are drug addicts asking for change in the parking lot.  The parking lot was filthy.  Inside was kinda dirty too.
The food was not the same as other IHOPs.  The omelette was half the size and didn't have very many ingredients.  We won't go to this Hood IHOP ever again.  The poor waitress even wrote on our check that gratuity is not included.  Apparently she has been stiffed alot to write such a thing.   
The IHOP on the south end past Mandalay Bay is way better.  Skip this one and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Vegas location was very busy. Sat down got our drinks and ordered right away. It took us 45 mins for our food n my eggs and crepes were cold"}
{"text":"The food was alright, but where I got ticked off was the service.

What I wanted wasn't on the menu. I wanted french toast, eggs and hash browns. So, I talked to my server Nicole J. and considered these two options Griddle combo (2 french toast, hash browns, 2 eggs, 2 meat) and the 2x2x2 (pancakes, eggs, meat). The server said he'd charge me for the 2x2x2 which is $6.79 and he'd substitute the french toast for the pancakes and replace the meat with the hash browns. I said that sounds great. He never mentioned an upcharge or a substitution fee. So, at this point I'm thinking my meal is going to be under $10 with meal included, which is a price I was okay with- mind you I ate it all in one sitting, so it wasn't that much food.

The bill comes and there's a substitution charge $2.29 for french toast instead of pancakes, but no substitution for the hash browns. The total is over $10. I was NEVER told about any different price, so i'm a little irked. I would have chose something else or left. Mind you my plates are clean, so I'm in a bit of a predicament. The manager comes over and I explain the situation, she says she'll take care of it.. so I'm assuming the $2.29 is coming off. NOPE, she comes back and says she's going to charge me for the Griddle combo and not subtract the meat BECAUSE it doesn't have a price- last time I checked, you can get a side of meat and there's clearly a charge. So, i'm like hold up- if you're going to charge me for something I didn't get, give it to me- i'll give it to someone else- a friend, a pet, a homeless person. Geez! Needless, to say when it was all said and done, I only left a 0.92 cent tip because I was frustrated, nothing was explained prior or during the ordering process and the attempt to Fix it was a FAIL and after all that crap, i'm surprised I even left a tip. $10 for that experience.

On a side note, August 10th they advertised 0.50 cents for pancake stacks from open until close- please let me know if they honor that. I'll be going to another IHOP. WORDS MEAN THINGS. ACTIONS ARE LOUDER THAN WORDS."}
{"text":"Vonna was our waitress. She was nice, brought the food and extras out in a timely manner, and pretty to boot! Food was decent and very filling."}
{"text":"Destiny helped us with my online order and she was amazing!!! I am a very picky and specific customer and she made me feel confident and comfortable and excited about my food I love Ihop & I will definitely be back to this location!!! ;D"}
{"text":"Old, outdated, and definitely not on the best side of town, but I already knew that going in, so I wasn't expecting much.

Will I go back?  Yeah, sure... If I'm in the area, and wasted to the point where anything I eat taste good.  

You know, cause when you're drunk, you think you'll sober up if you eat something so you eat anything. 

Sober?  Definitely not."}
{"text":"This place consistently succeeds in disappointing me every...single...time. I decided to give them yet another chance because I'd received a BOGO coupon. Well shame on me for falling into that trap...because even after I showed the waitress the coupon before ordering...it turns out my coupon was not valid for anything I'd ordered...which I was not told until after I was given the bill and questioned the total due. I called their customer service and they were not very  friendly and didn't seem to care either. I'm officially done. There are far better places to have subpar breakfast and service. \"Bye bye\" iHop"}
{"text":"Terrible service at 12:30 AM, bottom
Pancake on
Both orders burnt
Trying to get waiters attention \"yelling WAITER\" after 10 minutes he shows up.
No I'm sorry , just I'll get another plate for you! 
Never come here again!"}
{"text":"We came here twice in two weeks because of my craving for their cinn-a-stack pancakes and waffles. On both occasions, the service was great and the waitresses who served us were both very friendly and attentive. 

Being in Vegas, there are plenty of cafes located inside casinos that offers breakfast food such as eggs, hash brown, pancakes, and toast for cheap but I'd rather spend a little bit more and go to IHOP.

It's located right across from the outlets so I would suggest coming here to eat breakfast, fuel up before going on shopping spree."}
{"text":"Not in the least bit surprised in the low rating. I've been sitting here for now 40 minutes and watching tables that arrived 15 minutes after I did get their meals. I asked for a manager and he had the nerve to tell me I cussed out my waitress. Never happened,  but I had complained to her about her spending 10 minutes taking to a table NEXT to mine (  24 inches) with her back to me just to have her leave to go to other tables. Before I even got a coffee. The manager is a real piece of work. I left the breakfast at the table without taking a bite after his false allegations he just turned around and went on his merry easy"}
{"text":"Slow service.  Not as \"on the ball\" as my old IHOP back in Maryaland.  Had a total customer service \"fail\" when I went here on Free Pancake Day.  Managers made it up to me with a $5 off voucher for my next trip.  Still feels like a place bored college kids go to goof around instead of to work.  With all of the awesome and affordable independenly-owned breakfast places to try in Pittsburgh, I don't think I will be wasting my time or money at this IHOP."}
{"text":"As always the food was the best in the valley...gotta eat at th IHOP on the Blvd. by the South Outlets.  Alex the mgr and his staff are the best"}
{"text":"Go every so often.  Always great service & good food.  Plus they give 20% off when you ride your motorcycle in!  Never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"It's IHOP, was it the best breakfast I've ever had? No but it's convenient, affordable, with little to no wait time to get seated. There's eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, pancakes, and coffee which is sometimes exactly what you need. It DID take awhile to find our waitress to pay, and then get change back. But the service was fine. We went around 9am on a Friday morning."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in on a Saturday morning and could not get a seat, not because it was super crowded, but because the hostess apparently just didn't want to seat us.  We stood right next to the hostess podium, and were told \"we'll be right with you\" for about five minutes, while the hostess continued to seat people who were just coming in through the door. They seated four brand new parties while we stood there waiting. Sooo we ended up having a nicer, less expensive, quieter breakfast at the PT's down the street."}
{"text":"This iHop is one I have stopped at late night multiple times over a few years. They're a lil noisy with the drunk groups but the food is always fresh and good. My waiter tonight, Gabriel, was very sweet and attentive even with all the activity!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, sirloin tips burnt the last time we came.. This time - we were unlucky to get the same server (Bianca). 

The first visit, she never checked up on us and when she gave the check.. We then said the sirloin was burnt& she had a blank expression on her face then walked away..of course she did not get a tip!

The second visit( after a month ), we asked about the kids menu having free refills on drinks & she said soda only. We told her that the little sign said chocolate milk too.. She then responded with \" I've been here a year & you dont get refills on that. She also told us that she will be getting another server for us??
This server has evident service issues!!

The servers name is Bianca and she was very rude & obviously hated her job.. She should never be in a customer facing position, it would benefit any company more to put this type of terrible personnel, more back of the house. As a patron, we come to different ihop locations & this is the worse one. 

We spoke to Bernadette the manager, we did not feel that she did anything immediate to satisfy our complaint so we asked for her boss's number because we were treated horribly by Bianca& she needs to go! The manager did however ended up being the one to just serve us and was very pleasant with another server ( soleil or something )

We were here to relax, enjoy our saturday morning & have a nice family breakfast not experience all this non sende"}
{"text":"Our server (David was his name) was fantastic. He was enthusiastic and friendly, tried to upsell (offered drinks vs. asking what we wanted, offered cheese on our eggs, etc.) and took the time to show us the changes to the new menu. Very helpful and cheery..honestly not what I would typically expect from a breakfast restaurant (usually the servers seem stressed and rushed). Food was good, as usual..but his service would have brought us back regardless!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this IHOP before heading out of Vegas. They usually do things fairly ok, pretty similar to every other branch. 

Service was a bit slow at this location and cleanliness was lacking. Probably wouldn't visit this location again."}
{"text":"We tried to order three meals to go Monday night memorial day. After a long ring time and then being put on hold a woman started to take my order. When I got halfway through the first meal she said they had no to go containers so we couldn't place our order after all ?!? REALLY?!?"}
{"text":"The service was a little slow, but the server was friendly and attentive. The food tasted great and I felt that I got my money's worth."}
{"text":"I usually love IHOP. However this morning they couldn't get nothing right at all . I asked for the 2x2x2 eggs over easy with no brown , it was very brown around the edges. I ordered the breakfast sampler with extra extra cheese in the eggs, and if the hash browns could be extra extra light with no brown on them . Of course they came back dark and and the smallest amount of cheese ever. I asked for sugarfree syrup because my mom and I both are diabetics, we was given regular syrup. Needless to say we threw away most of the food. I will not go back to this IHOP again . I'm extremely disappointed in this location since it's the closest to me."}
{"text":"I hate going to ihop but my sister is a big fan so we always go if she can convince me to leave the house. We're always treated well and if there were problems, it would get fixed right away.

The other day, our waitress was named Dalilah. She served us several times before and was always nice and refilled our drinks without us having to call out to someone."}
{"text":"Every time I have me some brunch it's always delicious. This time I came to have bacon, scrambled eggs with hash browns and some strawberry crepes! There was one manager who was hosting and serving. He did pretty well for a mini rush . :)"}
{"text":"The hostess Yvette  was really nice. Perfect smile and greeting.  My server (Blanca).was  no smiles, no patience and sat in the corner table just talking gossip. She seemed irritated that I couldn't decide on my meal so she walked away 3 times without even a word. She dropped my check soon as she brought my food and didn't say enjoy or asked if I needed anything. Haven't been to IHOP in so long and I for sure won't be back to this one."}
{"text":"Heed the ToGo warnings! I tried the Happy Valley location but they had the phone off the hook and it went to voice message system.

I was told my order would be ready in 10 minutes. It takes 10 minutes to get there. I still waited more than 15 minutes while there because it wasn't ready. The hostess lies when I arrived and said they were boxing it now. That shouldn't take 15 minutes. The order was correct with the exception that I asked for extra crispy hash browns and they were not.

The food tasted great and was a large portion. All the condiments were included but I'd have to remember to ask for more than one package of syrup.

I highly recommend NOT using this location for breakfast To Go."}
{"text":"I was craving some iHop and my coworker and I came here because itd be the closest one. We were seated immediately as we walked in and our orders were taken. However, as always at any ihop it took a while to get the food. The waitress was nice but also kind of forced like she was annoyed at her customers and the restaurant was practically empty. Lol

I ordered a full sampler as the whole meal because that's pretty big amount. And a banana berry crepe. All pretty good and came out to be 18 along with OJ."}
{"text":"Love IHops. The customer service here is great. Food is AWE-SOME. The ladies working here are just seriously nice. Only thing is that they take forever to serve the food. I don't know why. . .  But it must take like 30 minutes for me to actually receive my order."}
{"text":"Went here Sunday morning because I had a coupon from the email club for free pancakes. It is good on any menu item $7.39 or less and if the item is more it will take that much off. I got pancakes, eggs, sausage, bacon, ham, and hashbrowns.. I couldn't even finish my pancakes and the man got strawberry cheesecake pancakes that made me regret getting my meal because they were so good. So next time get the strawberry cheesecake pancakes! lol. Other than that it is your typical Ihop..... fairly small portions but good food."}
{"text":"Really not sure why all the low reviews. I was kinda split on what I wanted but the server was really patient. I ended up deciding on the biscuit and gravy combo with a pancake on the side. The combo gives two large biscuits with 4 sausage links, 2 eggs cooked to order, and hashbrowns. All the food was cooked without any problems and had plenty of flavor and the total came out to just under $10 which for the amount of food was a dang good deal. Will I be back? Most likely."}
{"text":"The wait was pretty awful but that's nothing out of the ordinary on any holiday... The staff was very friendly, attentive and efficient. Our drinks and meals came out fairly promptly and obviously there was no shortage of hot sauce or ketchup seeing as several servers offered to get some for us. We appreciated their concern but I assured them the meal was great all on it's own. The pancakes were the classic fluffy delicious buttermilk and the hash browns were perfectly browned, not too soft or too crunchy - simply perfect for sopping up the yolk on my perfectly cooked eggs. Now I've been using the word perfect a lot to describe the food but it was in the bacon I found a flaw.. The Turkey bacon my boyfriend ordered looked like it only briefly met the griddle and my own bacon was a tad chewier than desired. All in all a pleasant experience once seated, however I would advise against going on fathers day. There was no seating available during my half hour wait and there was a lot of screaming children worsening the condition my growing hunger had wrought in my head."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Sunday Breakfast before a baseball spring training game. I have to admit that this IHOP was a bit smaller then the ones i have been too, but they did a great job, there was one young girl in the front that was a bit silly, but everybody else was fine. Service was quick and efficient. I understand its like any other IHOP, but they do a good job with their space and the quantity that arrives to eat there. 

So if your in the area and need some food in your system, stop in."}
{"text":"For a chain, this was awful. It's north of the Strip, near the Stratosphere, in a not-so-great area. The inside is dark and drab. The restroom was dirty and broke while we were there. The food was okay, the omelettes were bigger than at most IHOP's, but still, nothing wonderful. Avoid, unless you're really hungover and need this stuff. But there's Denny's right on the Strip, so..."}
{"text":"Really wishing there was a way to give zero stars.  I was excited to come here since I noticed it was under new management. 

I asked for the harvest nut and grain, but as a waffle oppose to pancake which I've had at every other ihop and the server without even knowing says it's impossible.  Then he brings a hot chocolate that I ordered but the mug looked very dirty and there was chocolate residue all over the mug.  There was no way I could even put my mouth on it so I just ordered a water.  The hostess gets a star because her interaction with us was minimal, but she noticed my husband was an officer and told us about the 50% discount that ihop offers which I never knew, but never thought to ask either so for that she deserves 5 stars. If the hostess was our server I'm sure our service would have been five stars, but instead we got a man (Anselom) who seem to not care at all about what I wanted or even the presentation of what's brought to the table.  If you brought a drink in a dirty glass would you drink it.  Maybe the new management has brought about zero changes because I wish I had went somewhere else. The manager said the waffle iron was broken, but others had waffles. Needless to say I will never return this ihop because the managememt lied and they lack customer service. This is in no way a reflection of the hostess who's name was  Olivia.  If you visit ask if Olivia can be your server.  Our server didnt bring napkins or the warm syrup, but Justin stepped right in and had no problems assisting us. We received 5 star customer service from Justin and Olivia. A good manager would make them servers because  we are giving our tips to the hostess because that's who gave us the best customer service. Justin and Olivia keep up the good work. In good ihop fashion there was no issues with the taste of the food."}
{"text":"It's a chain and great place to get a pancake fix but my favorite menu item is their sirloin tips with scrambles eggs.  You haven't lived until try them.  The service is what is to be expected from a busy restaurant.  

I would like to personally thank Viola who took care of us today.  Our waiter apparently forgot us this morning and she took great care of us.  I made my husband tip her more because of it... And she was training someone too.  

Ask to sit in Viola's or Amanda's section if you go in the morning.  Both are awesome waitresses and care about the customers!"}
{"text":"We used to frequent this location on Sunday morning and they did a fantastic job at quality and service. Well that is not the case anymore. Service is still great however food quality has gone down... drastically.   My husband's scrambled eggs were not fully cooked and runny in the middle.  Mine were extremely greasy and the French Toast was overcooked and thin.  Just not worth coming here anymore."}
{"text":"Food is really good!!
I came here alone in the rainy day. There were a few servers here but there service was so good.

They always check if it was everything ok every 10 minutes. 

I love this place."}
{"text":"Have not been to an I Hop in 40 years This one looked brand new very clean great service I felt like I was a kid. Again. Everyone was so friendly food came out perfect hot and fresh. This will be my new breakfast place  best best pancakes omelettes etc. great lunch and dinner to. Thank You I Hop"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever did an online order so you know easy to read what it says but the still meat up my order then I call complain and the lady tells me they will give me a gift card if I can go the next day for the card then I call to make sure it's ready and the manager says she don't know what I'm talking about and hangs up."}
{"text":"MOLDY FOOD! 
Daughter ordered stuffed strawberry French toast this am and went to eat as a snack later in the day and discovered the inside of the bread is moldy! I've been trying to call to report it but they won't answer the phone.

Update: I've called 7x over the course of about 5 hours and still no answer"}
{"text":"Wow. Well first off it took our waitress 10 min to get to the table.  Some people went to the bathroom and another 10 min they get to order. Mind you only 2 to 3 tables are there. Another 10 min or more we order. They forget my friends order. We all get ours by a runner.  Still 3 or 4 tables are here. Don't see the waitress until another 20 min or so, saying she forgot his order, and it's on the fly. 10 or more mins he gets his food. We are all almost done by this point.

Then, does the tickets. Stands behind the table, then goes back to the front. 5 min later comes with tickets...all f*D up. Then says to meet her up front. Sorts it out still screws it up....got a 2 dollar tip. I tip min 10 dollars and up no matter what.  They make s#it. But this hooker...aint making nothing. She has runners doing her work. So I tipped the runner. That lady sucks. This place is okay, but not great.

Ughhhhhhhhh...damn. I hate writing a bad review."}
{"text":"5 stars for service. Our server Chris was EXCELLENT. He didn't write down none of our orders for our party of 7 and got everything right!. The food was just OK."}
{"text":"Consistent bad service and the food is always cold. I have been to a few restaurant owned by the Romulus corp. and I have to say they all have terrible food, dirty dining area, billing errors, and most of all the WORST staff!"}
{"text":"Giving it 5stars because there really wasn't anything wrong with our food or service."}
{"text":"Ok its Ihop. IU was surprised they no longer have corned beef hash. That is why we went in. so the place is clean and the service is pretty good. I woudl think its more a a breakfast place only place."}
{"text":"Went on a slow afternoon during which there were more staff than customers and it sill took 35 minutes to get a takeout order. Very poorly staffed and managed. Will not return. Avoid the bad odors, service, and food, if at all possible."}
{"text":"IHOP is my second favorite restaurant so I am probably being super picky with my review. I've definitely had better. The customer service was great but the food is mediocre and the coffee watered down. I couldn't even eat my hash brown because it was burnt. I probably, most likely, will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Not many places motivate me in such a way that I feel compelled to walk out but say for 40-minutes, at least 25 of which were unattended.  The 25-minutes were order-to-walk out."}
{"text":"This is probably the WORST IHOP ever... I come in craving some good crepes, I had to get someone from the dinning room to seat me and my breakfast guest, thank you for the dirty look when I interrupting you from your conversation while nasty music was playing in the background while there were families here!(Hardly anyone in the dinning room) Anyway the crepes were overcooked, and so was everything else except the eggs.. I wasted 25.04$ at a place that hardly deserved a penny... Bad food and worst customer service!"}
{"text":"Food was not done the way we ordered, items did not arrive at the table at the same time. Never did get toast that was ordered. Service was very very slow. About as organized as an overturned ant hill."}
{"text":"This is the WORST ihop I have ever been to. My friends & I had a horrible experience here. We decided to come here for breakfast one morning. We got seated & our waitress was extremely rude right off the bat (I wish I would have gotten her name). When we ordered our drinks she threw the straws on our table instead of putting them down nicely. When she took our food order one of my friends ordered the country fried steak & eggs. Our waitress proceeded to ask her what kind of pancakes she wanted. My friend didn't even know it came with pancakes & decided she would just get blueberry. For some odd reason she was only rude to our table. At all of her other tables she was as nice as can be. Maybe because we were a group of young adults? Idk but I found her act to be very disrespectful. As we were getting ready to leave we got our bill & noticed my friend got charged extra for her pancakes that she originally didn't want so we kindly asked our waitress about it. Our waitress lied trying to say that she said it came with buttermilk pancakes ONLY when in reality she asked what kind of pancakes my friend wanted because it came with it. My friends bill was rather high so she wanted to know why she was being charged extra (not a big deal she was going to pay for it regardless if they took it off or not). It became an issue/argument & even got the manager involved who did absolutely NOTHING to help out. She was basically on the waitresses side claiming \"oh well she's been here for 10 years & we've never had an issue\". I used to work at a restaurant & my manager would have NEVER doubted a customer rather if they were right or wrong... The customer is always right. It is the restaurants job to make sure their customers have a great experience, am I right? Anyways, nothing got solved & we payed our bills & moved on. After the last bill was paid (because we had separate checks) the MANAGER chased us down asking if we stole a cell phone in one of the cashiers drawers?! What the hell?! I was so furious at this point. We all felt so judged, it's unbelievable how they treated us. I will NEVER go back. If I could give this place 0 stars, I would."}
{"text":"When we got hwre it was a busy but they were able to get us seated within 10 minutes.  Our server Kim eas exelent and took great care of the wife and I.  Portions were fairly sizable, and the food was good.  The building was a little run down showing signs of wear but other than that, hey I enjoyed it!!  Plan on spending $15/person"}
{"text":"Food is food. It's IHop, so they start out with 3 stars just being \"average\". BUT, there are 3 amazing servers here. Anthony, Yvonne & Lyn. Service is always a big part of the experience & because of these 3, this IHop gets 4 stars.
The many times I've been here the food has been fine. The food can take a bit longer at busy times but the coffee pot is on the table and other drinks are kept full."}
{"text":"I love this IHOP. Our waitress and hostess are always so nice and the food is always great. I also enjoy their to-go containers as I can reuse them at home."}
{"text":"My family was craving ihop so we found this location down the street from the hotel. Parking is a nightmare and we had to wait about half an hour for a table. The food was good, but I guess they ran out of clean cups because they served our drinks in styrofoam cups. I wouldn't recommend this location."}
{"text":"Guess what, we were seated... ordered right after... one hour later our waiter tells us \"We just started making your food, there was this party that was before you guys.\" By the way that party only had 5 people. We were starving and falling asleep. This is why I rarely go to IHOP. Just go to McDonalds if you want food, It's honestly 50x better then this snail of a restaurant, or should I even call it a restaurant. 1000% disappointed and not coming to an IHOP in at least 5 years. I bet the only reason why they call this place a \"late night diner,\" is because they keep you here to midnight... don't even enter here of you want food"}
{"text":"Pretty sure this IHOP got an interior remodel to the table, booths, and new flooring but I'm not sure any of it really improved the interior and if anything the quality of the food has gotten slightly worst. 

For instance the hash brown was mushy and lukewarm instead of being crunchy and warm. The sunny side eggs was definitely more runny than I would've preferred. Additionally the syrup for the strawberry was quite sweet (apparently there's no regular strawberry option that's not drenched in strawberry syrup). The bacon was nice and crispy, along with the French toast, although the last half square tasted both mushy and undercooked. 

Service was decent, although I'd say after taking our order and bringing out the food, we were never really checked upon afterwards. All in all, it was an okay dining experience, as we were seated awkwardly around a round table for 4 when it's just the two of us (would've preferred one of the open booths that no one else was sitting in)."}
{"text":"Pretty good service at this location. Seems like everyone is running around with their head cut off but it's at least in a orderly fashion. I know that my food was made well and my waitress was very nice. Had a great breakfast here with the fam!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. Food is ok. But the pancakes are to die for. My kids love them. Sunday is very busy. Got to get in early!"}
{"text":"My mom and I had dinner here and were a bit disappointed.  It was a Sunday and their new cook who works Sunday cannot had a large load of food tickets.  We probably waited an hour for our food.  Unacceptable!  I guess this has been a regular occurrence with this new cook.  The manager ended up calling in the general manager to help out.  The waiter did tell us about the slow cook but an hour wait is not right.

The food was tasty though once we finally got it.  I had the short stack of buttermilk pancakes.  They were hot and nicely flavored.  My mom had the egg sandwich which she said was good.  I did have hot tea and the waiter never asked if I wanted more hot water.  

So this was definitely a miss this time around."}
{"text":"Our morning started with a splash!  Our poor waitress was embarrassed because she spilt our drinks. We reassured her that all was fine. We were quickly moved to another table and fresh drinks were brought out.  Hubby and I were there with our daughter and her sleepover friend.  We all enjoyed our meals and even had leftovers!  Hubby had the Bananas Foster French Toast combo. I snuck a taste of the sauce,  Oh Wow Caramel delight! Daughter's friend had Cheesecake pancakes with Strawberry and pronounced them as super yummy! I ordered the Spinach omelet with hollandaise. Delicious!!! Daughter got the Chicken Florentine crepes.  She absolutely raved about them!  We are NEVER disappointed when we go here.  Service is always wonderful even with a minor accident  :) The food is always more than enough for a great price.   We have made this our sleepover tradition! Gotta go now... my Harvest Grain and Nut pancakes with Butter Pecan syrup are calling my name!! { I always order these to go, because I cannot resist them} !"}
{"text":"I won't be I-Hopping my way back every time I am in need of a breakfast fix. It is a decent place to eat with good prices and plenty of food. My favorite is the pumpkin pancakes that roll out in the fall season. This is truly the only time I really go to I-Hop. I wait all year for them and just love them. You can get them with eggs, hash browns and bacon for only $5.99. Its a great price.

I don't usually hop over unless I am hopping through for the pumpkin pancakes at IHop, and I Hop you take my recommendation as well :)"}
{"text":"just went to the IHOP for National Pancake Day. I didn't intend to be cheap and go for just the free stack of pancakes, but also to order extras and to order off the kids menu for a sibling I took. Got seated quickly. Our server MIRNA B. was just RUDE, had a FUNK smell to her, she never checked on us, the ONE time she did check on us, we already had asked another server for things she failed to do/bring us. She was more worried about her false lashes than the service/smile she was suppose to provide. FOOD was good, MANAGEMENT was cool just the server 'MIRNA' was bad."}
{"text":"Came here with the fam and my 4 month old.
So usually when we go out I have a time window to sit,order, and eat before baby gets fussy and I have to pick him up and entertain him or feed him. And usually restaurants fit that time frame and all. But it took so long to get our food. I would say 30-40 min and there wasn't that much people."}
{"text":"I made the extra effort to come to IHOP just for a bad experience. It was super noisey, Uncontrolled kids, and to top it off the food was bad. My bacon folded like a tortilla, My hash browns were gooey as mash potatoes, The eggs were okay because you can't really mess up eggs. I'd say the best thing out of my meal was the wheat bread.  

A+ effort for my waiter having to work in such an environment, she made the experience tolerable."}
{"text":"This place service sucks !!!!!!!!! Sitting in here now at a table for 15 minutes straight and have watched every employee pass us bye and offer no service. It took us asking a manager for one of his employees to help us . Poor poor service here"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed went in for Father's Day dinner and there was only one waitress couldn't get waited on so bad had to leave"}
{"text":"1 star only beacuse I could not give 0 stars.  Food was undercooked, waitress was unattentive. Had to take condiments from other tables. Couldn't get her attention because she was busy talking to one of the bus boys. Definitely not our best Ihop experience."}
{"text":"ordered food to go and in the middle of eating found a long strand of hair, never eating there again.  #sicktomystomach"}
{"text":"I am so upset. I ordered the new toffee apple cheesecake pancakes and all I received was regular pancakes. This was a carry out order. When I called back, the lady advised me that everything was in the bag. Why would a customer lie about pancakes? This was an insult! Very unprofessional!!!! This is the second time that my order was messed up. Very disappointing!!!"}
{"text":"This food review is only for the pancakes ordered on Saturday 06/18/2016 @9:45am

If you want good pancakes, heck, even so-so pancakes, then stop at the store and pick up any generic box of pancake mix and make them at home because it will be better than any pancake that comes out of this place! Seriously! But if you are in the mood for bland, dry and not so fluffy pancakes, this is the place for you. Remember, you have been warned (on the pancakes). Maybe I'm being too harsh, then again maybe not. This place is called IHOP (International HOUSE of PANCAKES) I think the original IHOP moved and some other owner or business is setting up shop here. Ya never know. There was no wait to be seated. The host Mikayla (I think that is how you spell here name) was very friendly and courteous. She delivered 5-star customer service! It all went down hill from that point. I ordered the short stack which consisted of 3 pancakes. When they arrived 25 minutes later, I got three lukewarm pancakes with a ball of butter the size of a quarter! A quarter! How is that going to cover three supposedly delicious hot pancakes, how? I will tell you how, it didn't and it wont. Our server was M.I.A. for the first 10 minutes of us being seated and she did not bring us our water with our orange juice like we had ordered. I had to go the front and Mikayla brought it to us in seconds! Bad service (not from Mikayla) and bad food. I could go on but, why?"}
{"text":"(this review is breakfast only)

Actually wish I could do half ratings as I would give this IHOP a 2 1/2.
For kids I give it a 4. They do great kids specials like smiley faced pancakes, fruit, etc.
For adults, well the food is mediocre at best.  I guess it is the whole national chain thing but the choices aren't as varied as other breakfast restaurants, the flavor is lacking, the presentation mediocre and the restaurant is not the cleanest.  It is edible. The hash browns are actually pretty well prepared but the omelet i have had the last two times just wasn't good. I have had better omelets in buffets at the Omelet station.

Still, if you want an inexpensive breakfast that will satisfy your hunger if not your thirst for flavor, this is a good place.  The benefit of a chain is you know what you are getting no matter the location.  The drawback, well creativity and flavor.

Still, my daughter likes it and it is walking distance from my house so it stays in the rotation."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place to go for breakfast, but have fond memories of visiting the downtonwn location at bartime. That was interesting! Anyway, yes, ihop is a sort of dive, and they pack you in like sardines. Their pancakes aren't my favorite... and neither are their omelets (Perkins up the street makes their pancakes nice and fluffy and has ihop beat on the omelets too). So this last time, I ordered the Belgian waffle with berries and cream, and it was to die for! The waffle was nice and tender. Not dry or \"cut the roof of your mouth crunchy\". The tender waffle combined with the delicious sweet cream and berries was addicting. With a side of crisp bacon, and scrambled eggs, my cravings were satisfied, and I keep thinking about it. Our waitress worked hard. Good service and a happy tummy means we will need to go back soon.
EDIT:
I've been back twice, maybe more, since my last review and I have to say I've been disappointed each time. I did order the Belgian waffle with berries and cream again, and the waffle wasn't as delicious. The first time  all the toppings just danced delightfully with the warm waffle. This time, they all seemed to lay there sagging and uncomplementary to one another. The fruit and the vanilla cream were nearly frosty they were so cold. It just didn't do it for me.
I also ordered something that I had been impressed with many moons ago, which was the stuffed french toast with strawberries. I remember it being sweet and gooey and sinfully good. This time the bread was tough and dried out. It was a disappointment. 
Needless to say, if the fam wants to do breakfast out, we will opt for somewhere else."}
{"text":"So far no good! We came in last night and they were fighting with the cook that was about to quit. So we left. Tonight we gave it a second shot but the service is really slow. We waited at least ten minutes with 2 already served tables and an empty house to have our order taken. I walked to the bathroom after about 12 minutes to see our waitress casually talking to the cook. So it must not matter to her how much she makes in tips or sales for the company, but rather a forum for her to socialize with co-workers. Maybe we'll get lucky and the food will taste good, but this is a chain so I'm sure not expecting much! Good luck with your late night food struggles. I'd recommend Twin Peaks any day or night over this because that's where we ended up last night and everything was great. Service to quality."}
{"text":"Nice. New clean. Prompt service. Waitress was respectful of my questions regarding the menu."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative score I would. We came in at 12:02pm and still waiting for our food at 12:54. Waitress says they are making it now and put it ahead of other tickets yet there was no ticket wait when we arrived. I don't think she (Katelyn) ever put in our order. We asked to speak to a manger and he still hasn't come by yet. He ran to the back room and said he would talk with us later.  The order comes at 12:57 and is completely wrong. No toast, no ranch, no straws and the wrong bread. Manager ( has still yet to show up and speak to us. Couple next to us arrives after us already have their food and half way done. At 1:07 pm we finally get a complete order thanks to Lore."}
{"text":"Unimpressed with the staff; they were dismissive and paid little attention to us, even when we asked for refills on our water. Boyfriend and I came here on his lunch break to grab something quick before he had to go back to work; we had to ask for the check two or three times and waited an extra ten minutes for him to finally print it out and give it to us. Food was okay, but not as good here compared to other iHOPs."}
{"text":"This IHOP is definitely the best one that I've been to. My server Edgar was super nice and very attentive with his service. The food was ready really fast and it was really well cooked. I had the 2 egg breakfast with a stuffed French toast and it was very tasty. Their prices are great as well. The entire staff there was rest sweet and treated me like family."}
{"text":"What is happening here? Live near by for years now, usually come here for lunch and dinner, today were here for Brunch....we have always enjoyed coming here and it's been a few months but honestly I'm bothered. Upon entering there are 4 people behind the 2 registers - no one acknowledges us, the hostess glares up at us with a sour look on her face and just stared, we say \"hello\" she keeps staring...I say \"party of 3??\" She says \"follow me please\", the place is not that busy at all...she stagers her way and keeps stopping and pausing as she walks, kinda looks lost, than brings us to the south part of the dining room and just stands there, all the tables were empty and dirty! She stands there waiting for us to sit....I ask her \"could these tables please we wiped cleaned? There are crumbs, paper and pancake syrup on it?\", she does wipe down the table eventually, server is good, smiles ect...no complaints on her but looks a little lost since we were missing a setting. Food tasted great but the plating was very messy, I had the \"country fried steak and eggs with gravy\" ...and we asked for mozzarella sticks to come out first....I couldn't find the Sunnyside up eggs ..oh yea cause they put the steak right on top of it....the mozzarella sticks came out last and warm!?  Our waitress ( Kalin S ) was great. She cleared our table and we relaxed a few minutes, than some lady walks over to our table and asks how we're doing, than wishes us a Happy Valentines Day, than as she does the same to other tables we realize she works at ihop...Ohh ...so managers/supervisors no longer wear name tags? Cause that was odd and to top it all off, where was she the whole entire time? As a GM and over 15 years in the industry I have to say I or better yet we were very dissapointed with this visit."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way home from Vegas, should have kept driving to Baker or tried the Pancake House. We waited close to an hour for our breakfast to come out which was a very simple standard order of eggs, pancakes, bacon, etc. for a party of 2. People that came after us were being served and were gone before we got our food. Our waiter was intentionally ignoring us and when he would come by, I couldn't even understand what he was trying to say to us. There wasn't a manager anywhere in sight. We were tempted to leave, but I was about to pass out if I didn't eat and eventually our food made it's way out. By the time we got out of there, the usual Sunday traffic was already beginning...what a waste of time and the food was nothing to write home about.

If you have the option, I highly recommend avoiding this IHOP inside Whiskey Pete's."}
{"text":"My girlfriend didn't want to go to bob Evans which is usually where we go so I suggested here because I still wanted breakfast. The server brought us a huge bowl of soup instead of a little cup and we had to send it back because it was cold. Our food took way longer than expected since it wasn't busy at all. I ordered egg whites with cheese, turkey sausage, plain brioche French toast, and grilled red potato hash. Instead I got regular eggs with a ridiculous amount of cheese, turkey bacon, hash browns, and my French toast had stuff all over it (no clue what was on it). I told my server and he insisted those were egg whites and that I had said turkey bacon because they don't have turkey sausage. He got me the red potatoes which weren't grilled like he had said, they were definitely fried so I didn't eat them. The onions and peppers put on top weren't even grilled. All in all I had a pretty horrible time here and probably won't come back to this location."}
{"text":"I try to avoid this IHOP at all cost because of their less than favorable service. My sons birthday was on the 13th so I let him pick his lunch location. He chose IHOP. We waited to be seated for 15 min. I thought wow they must be busy. The restaurant was only half full when we were finally seated. I'd also like to note that while sitting there an elderly couple came out and made the comment to us I Hope you are not in a hurry. I should have heeded their warning. But I digress.

We did not get a waitress for another 15 minutes to even take our drink order. When she did I wanted to put our order in since we had already been there a half hour. Her reply was oh I'm not your waitress.  So it takes another 10 min for our drinks which were a water and a chocolate milk. But our waitress did drink it over. My son ordered cupcake pancakes, I ordered the Mexican style pancakes on the waitresses recommendation. 

It took about another 35 minutes to get our food. How my 5 year old was orient this long was a blessing because I certainly lost mine. His pancakes were delicious. His word. My pancakes were not, they were dry and the vanilla sauce might as well not been on there for as little as they used. 

To make this review a little shorter we didn't see our waitress again until 15 min after our meal was complete and had to flag another waitress to go find her. 

This experience was horrific. Stay away."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever had. Even at ihop, I expect a table check, and a refill on water. And when we went to pay, we had to wait even longer because there was no server up front to seat or check customers out. I don't expect the best food or service at ihop, I mean come on! Just look up and see what customers are doing. The restaurant was dirty and they just kept slowly working on tasks instead of food and service and customers. Never going back to this location."}
{"text":"I came here this past Sunday around 10am. Bad idea. Everyone was friendly but there are a lot of kinks that need to be worked out. 

The host was very personable but the list was a traditional old school list and there were a lot of names on the list for him to manage. 

Our server was horrible. I felt bad because she looked overwhelmed. The food was delicious through so I can't complain on that part. 

The set-up was off because you have to maneuver around the people waiting for a table just to pay at the register. The restaurant itself is also so much more smaller than it truly needs to be (smaller than the University location). When the Banfield next door opens, I can see parking possibly being an issue. 

Overall, I will return. I hope that they can get the kinks worked out and the staff to get some experience because the location is perfect and the food was also good."}
{"text":"Just like any other IHOP but brand spanking new.  They have some kinks to work out, but overall decent.  VERY friendly and they are extreme on their cleanliness, which is a plus in my book.  I'm happy so far and will probably return in a February to see if they've worked out their kinks.

Parking is a bit on the small side."}
{"text":"IHOP is probably the closest 24-hour restaurant in campustown other than Perkin's which is on Springfield. The selections are pretty standard and the portions are huge. The service is good but not great. Well, it's IHOP, so I wouldn't expect anything more than average."}
{"text":"The wait staff here was literally fighting over tables. One waitress was crying. The Spanish speaking waiters and waitresses where making fun of the non Spanish speaking waitresses. Very unprofessional. Food was good. Just not a great environment to eat in"}
{"text":"The right formula!  Gourmet Food, No, but good food served in a very clean setting by thorougly friendly staff, and all at value-oriented pricing.  We love Gourmet Foodm but are also regular fans of IHOP!"}
{"text":"Well let's just say we're in Cleveland first of all. Expect the unexpected.

Booth cushions have nothing in them basically, you're also right on top of the family right next to you (at least where we were sitting) the drive on the way to this place is also very entertaining. Our waiter, Craig, is very good at what he does at least, so our service was fine. Eggs were amazing, along with my waffles and hash browns. Craig is also very punctual with taking our food when we're finished. The wait for our food was quite long, but there were a lot of people here so we did expect as much. Overall we had a positive experience and we would eat at this place again."}
{"text":"Tyler & Justin are literally the best servers ever. I really won't go to any other IHOP location anymore. They're awesome servers and are super quick about getting you your food & drinks. They're super funny and nice!"}
{"text":"So I know this is not a good restaurant (horrible customer services and dirty), I still came because it is close to my house. Today when we came here, we have been sitting for 10 minutes and no body came to serve us even though hostess saw us looking for the server. SO we just left."}
{"text":"I came in to get my free pancakes for my birthday. The food was the regular but they went above and beyond and made me a special birthday pancake and I thought that was so nice! It was a big pancake with happy birthday written on it and even though I don't like chocolate I appreciate the thought behind it!"}
{"text":"I come to this specific location because of the server named William. He is the best. He provides great service and has a fantastic vibe, he seems very genuine! He is very kind. He is fast and asks about the quality of the food, He has made sure to make everyone comfortable. 

The reason for only four stars is because my party was served by another server named Clinton. He had a terrible vibe. He didn't talk with us at all, let alone smile.. I asked for lemons to go with my water, he proceeded to add it to my tab under \"Avocados\".. 
The countless times I've been here I've had nothing short of a good time. I was not expecting to be charged for my request seeing as I've never been charged for it, they were extra lemons not just for myself, but for everyone at the table. He should brighten up a lot..! I'd give him 0 stars if I could but I feel as though this rate is for the establishment rather than the person. From now on I will not eat here if he is the only server on duty, I will go somewhere else, or request a different server."}
{"text":"Along with some other Yelpers, it's an IHop.  On my most recent visit, the morning after daylight savings, and having to be in the office at 6:00am, I headed to IHop for breakfast.  Just looking for a variety of items, IHop came to my mind, knowing they have a lot of \"build your own\" platters.
We arrived around 10:30 Sunday morning and only had a 15 minutes wait, not bad at all for Sunday morning.  And, less than 15 minutes later our name was called.  Here's where my review went from four stars to three.  We sat at our table for over 15 minutes waiting for our waitress even to take our drink order. Another 10 minutes to get our drinks and after almost 45 minutes our food.  Our waitress was no where to be found. Yes, the place was crowded, but other tables seemed to be coming and going around us getting food and drinks.

With that said, we each chose a build you own platter. I went with the French Toast Platter, French Toast, 2 eggs any style, bacon or sausage and home fries.  A great amount of food.  My friend ordered the Pancake Platter, same meal above except for the pancakes instead of French toast.  The eggs and meat, cooked perfectly. Loved the home fries.  I enjoyed the French Toast, but my friend said the pancakes were a little dry.  One thing to get, ask for hot syrup for the French Toast or Pancakes, a nice treat.

Overall the food was on point, as it has always been, however, service and cleanliness of the restaurant could be a little better."}
{"text":"Service by the waitress (Laura) and cleanliness were fair.  Problem became when I had asked for my eggs to be scrambled with the cheese in them while they cook not melted on top of the eggs after.  Laura assured me no problem.  Eggs came out and the cheese had been melted on top after the eggs had been cooked and then mixed up with a fork.

Laura asked if they could remake the eggs and I politely responded that I just never feel comfortable sending food back.  Asked if they would just charge me for the pancakes, bacon and coffee.  Again she asked if they could remake the eggs.  I said no thanks and she responded she would get the manager.

Manager came over asked if they could remake the eggs and I again responded no thank you.  She said they would take the eggs off the bill.  Brings the bill and in fact did not take the eggs off but also instead of charging me the $1.00 upcharge for the bacon that came with the meal charged me $2.99 for a side of bacon.

I had to ask for the manager to come back and argue with her about the charge for the bacon and have her bring over a menu to show her the upcharge was only $1.00.  (She apparently as a manager does not know their own menu).  She gave up at trying to listen to me at this point and just said \"Well we are just comping the meal.\"

Very annoying!  I am always happy to pay for what I eat but shouldn't be charged for food that was not prepared as requested.

Won't be back."}
{"text":"Would give it 0 stars if I could but...
1) server took forever to take our order
2) food took so long we watched as the table right next to us receive their food AND finished it
3) had to ask for utensils, hot sauce, and a togo box multiple multiple times 

My boyfriend almost fell asleep waiting. All in all I'm more than disappointed."}
{"text":"We went here for a \"Father's Day Breakfast\".... along with everyone else in the neighborhood around 9am. Ha!

But with just a party of two, it surprisingly really only took 10 minutes. 

Gladys, our server, was extremely friendly AND efficient! 5*'s for her......

But I opted for the International Omelette (of course, I have a flair for international anything) and the whole-grain pancakes. YUMMMMMM....
The omelette was CRAZY HUGE... and the pankcakes were the bomb! My first time with the IHOP nutty, whole-grain pancakes... and I want more. 

The whole-grain pancakes are extremely filling... and nutty. Sooo sooo good! I'll definitely order those kinda pancakes next time we're back."}
{"text":"I grabbed a late breakfast here one morning after a hike and had a pleasant time. I was helped quickly, the staff was friendly, my food came in a timely manner and was the way I requested. All in all I had a nice breakfast and will be back. I love the Swedish crepes by the way, I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"So after a night of not drinking and going to bed early, we decided to get breakfast since nothing opens in Vegas until 10 and we were up at the crack of dawn. 

If you get here at 8, there is no line. Walked right in, sat right down, and ordered the 4.99 pancake special and my friend ordered a veggie omelette. Everything was good except for the fruit that was over ripe but we asked for toast to replace. 

Overall food was good for the price and service was quick and friendly.

We'll see how fast I hit the bathroom."}
{"text":"While not the quickest in service and cook time (which I think is due to understaffing), everyone has always been nice and accommodating. The food has always been tasty and made to order (I like my eggs poached and some things \"on the side\"). A for effort. It's clean for the most part. All in all, this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I have been coming to this IHOP for a very long time. Literally since it opened. I have never...NEVER had a problem. Not only did my friends and I not get a drink refill before my our food came out, but it took over 40mins to get it.  There was no silverware on the table so I asked for some.  In 2 of the packs there was dirty silverware, literally crusted on food.  Requested to speak with the manager,  she got to the table right when the food got to the table, I explained the situation to her and she personally got us drink refills.  As for the waitress, (Victoria) she did not seem to care about her job.  Even after our food came out there were still issues with it being cold.  After some food was remade there were STILL mistakes.  The egg white omelet smelt and tasted like sulfur. 

I am sorry IHOP, you just lost a life time customer, and this is not the first time I have had a problem with IHOP.  A free meal is not good enough to apologize this time."}
{"text":"I was in need of some food after a night out during my most recent trip to Cleveland and  this location was suggested.. I was not surprised to say the least! 

Lets start with the fact that our waiter was also the hostess and the person ringing out to go orders. Normally this wouldn't bother me but it seemed like each waiter only had one table each! Why not give me a waiter that's focused on being a waiter and not someone I have to go to the front to get when I need something for my table!?!

Then there's the food... I'm pretty sure they were the worse pancakes I've ever had! The only reason this place gets the stars it gets is because the bacon and eggs were great and our waiter was funny.."}
{"text":"We spent the last few days in Vegas and decided to stop in here for pancakes. First thing, they didn't have the holiday pancakes because they forgot to order the stuff for them.... the place was a mess, but the staff was nice. What we did have to eat was not bad,  but compared to other locations, I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Used to be a good place to come and have a nice quiet family dinner, but the food  is unbelievably slow to get out and getting refills on the all you can eat fish or drinks is like pulling teeth with a crane. Really hope they get this figured out because it's obvious the business is suffering"}
{"text":"This place is a frequent spot for breakfast for me and my wife! Food always comes fast and correct never have any complaints. Jaime is an awesome waiter always happy when we get him!"}
{"text":"Service here sucks. The staff is extremely rude and you have to repeat I will drive further to get better service"}
{"text":"This place is a wreck! Management needs to step it up. Good things: Was sat right away, waitress was courteous when seating me and the food came out quickly.  In the meantime, the table I was given had a syrup basket coated in syrup. I saw my waitress once when my food was delivered and then she was gone. By the comments from the other wait staff it seems Taylor likes to milk the clock and not work. While eating, another server went to greet his table and I was able to hear how hilariously funny he thinks it is when he drives 115-130mph on his motorcycle on the freeway.  Then motorcycle guy and another server start talking about personal stuff very loudly on the serving floor while using profanity. I finished my meal and sat there for 5 minutes with my plates stacked before I was offered my check. Keep in mind there were only 3 tables .  I understand this is ihop and not much is to ever be expected when dining here but when it falls below your already low expectation then that's a problem."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast last Monday and had to wait almost 20 mins to be seated as it was very busy. This also showed in the food which seemed to be hurriedly prepared. I had the pancake combo and found the turkey bacon to be extremely salty and the pancakes themselves to be flat rather than fluffy. The other members in our group also felt that the food was lacking. So overall a very OK type of meal and nothing like the IHOP that i normally visit in Torrance."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of stopping by for breakfast during our last trip to Vegas. This IHOP's location is a couple of miles off the strip so we chose it thinking that it would be less crowded but when we reached it was packed with a bunch of folks waiting outside. We put our names down and were told it would be a 20 minute wait. As that did not seem too bad we decided to wait it out. Finally after 30 minutes we got a table but as the servers were in over their head things just progressively kept going downhill. First they took out drink orders and then after a long wait got our drinks, then disappeared without taking our food orders. We had to literally corner someone to take our food orders followed by a long wait to get the food and finally another long wait just to get the check.

The food itself was terrible. You could see that something was just thrown together so that it could be sent out the door. I got the country Fried Steak ($12.99) while my friends got the Classis Breakfast crepes and the Californian Scramble. Only my order was delivered correctly mainly because I took it as-is without customization. The other orders either had incorrect sides or wrong ingredients, but were consumed as-is as we did not want to wait another hour to get replacements. Taste was pathetic. I like IHOP but this was literally the worst meal that I have ever had in an IHOP period. The egg's were burnt on one side and undercooked on the other, the hash browns were looking for an excuse to fall apart, the steak was dry as a rock and the sauce had absolutely no flavor finally pancakes seemed soggy and flat. Feedback on other dishes were similar. Crepes were soft and mushy while the California scramble lacked seasoning. One of us got a Vanilla milkshake which was the only decent thing that was served to us that day. I don't even know what to write about service. Each round we had to deal with someone else. Asked for water no ice, got it with ice, asked for hot sauce, got it at the end of the meal, did not even dare to ask to correct mistakes in the dishes served. It was not like there weren't enough people, just that they were running around clueless.

Without exaggeration it took more than three and a half hours to get a breakfast which gobbled up half our day in Vegas. If you plan to come to Vegas to spend half a day eating breakfast please do make this IHOP your destination. I have better things to do when in Vegas so I won't make the same mistake of stopping here again."}
{"text":"Okay, I know this is just an IHOP, so I shouldn't expect culinary excellence.  

But.

We've been to this location a couple times.  They do breakfast VERY well.  Their coffee is always fresh and hot.  Their pancakes are always fresh and hot.  Their orange juice is never too tart, never too sweet.  I've never found foreign items in my food.  Wait staff is always courteous and helpful.

But.

Beware - when you order NON-breakfast items, you may not end up with a satisfying meal.  This past weekend I took my daughter and my grandmother to the IHOP for a quick & cheap post-church lunch.  My grandmother ordered coffee and a belgian waffle - she said it was very delicious.  My daughter got the baby cakes kids meal, and she ate most of it.  I made the mistake of ordering the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and corn on the side.  The chicken fried steak was so tough as to be inedible (I took a couple bites and left the rest).  The mashed potatoes had clearly been in that serving bowl since the morning.  I took one bite and when I realized I was eating aged potatoes, I left the rest.  The corn was the best thing on the plate.  Needless to say when we got home I made myself a sandwich since I didn't really get lunch at the IHOP. *lol*

As I said, we've been to this location before, and they definitely do breakfast right (which makes sense given what an IHOP is).  My daughter and grandmother were very satisfied with their meals.  But stick with the breakfast menu.  Don't venture anywhere near the non-breakfast menu.  Then you should be fine."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have ever been to an IHOP.We were there at lunchtime and the place was a little busy, but no one was standing around to be seated and the tables were not full. I ordered a bacon cheese burger and onion rings. My friend ordered a \"Rise and Shine breakfast\"  that includes eggs, toast, hash browns and meat that she substituted with  sliced tomatoes because she didn't want meat. Both our orders took at least 20 min. and both were cold when it reached our table. The bacon was half raw, the hamburger was cold and greasy as were the hash browns. The toast was only dry bread. I complained  and the waitress took the stuff back and the manager came out to talk to us. Every thing was remade and was served warm. The manager apologized, comped our meals and gave me a gift card. This I consider to be excellent service to keep us as customers although I'm not sure I will try anything other than pancakes as I sit here hours later in gastric distress re-tasting that greasy burger."}
{"text":"Poor reception when we walked in went down hill from there. Took long-time to get water and coffee. Omelet missing the ham in it. No management insight. I was just remembered why I don't eat hear."}
{"text":"Ok - but seriously. I know we all know IHOP for what is, what it serves, and the last time I had been to one was not memorable - I just ate there. But this one actually made me rethink my opinion. We went on a Sunday for breakfast cause it was close to the new home and well, we got a little unexpected \"wow\". The place was packed ( always a good sign) but we didn't have to wait too long. Our server, Brian, was super attentive and offered just 'old-school' good service. I mean, I know it's IHOP but still - you're spending money and eating their food - it's appreciated! The menu even surprised us - they have made some decent, healthier updates and it tasted as good as we hoped. Though we don't frequent chains - we will def be back and even thinking to add this location to our breakfast spot circulation."}
{"text":"Today was my first day that I've been to this IHOP, and I'm happy to say that I'm a big fan of this franchise. I tried and tried to think of any cons about this place, and I can't. The servers were really nice and the food didn't take too long to come out. The place is nice and clean. There are TVs here where you can watch the game(s). It's great! One of the BEST IHOPs that I've ever been to! Definitely eating here again with my little one."}
{"text":"I came here today with my family for the free pancakes, and I was really impressed at how great their service was! We only waited for about ten minutes to get seated, since it was packed and full! We got our food (we ordered other things besides just the pancakes) in about ten minutes. It didn't take that long for them to bring out the food, so I was relieved since I thought they would take forever and lag but they didn't! Food was delicious. I mean, you CANNOT go wrong with breakfast! 

Our server was great and the food was delicious, so I would definitely come back here especially since I'm a big fan of breakfast foodies!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've visited an ihop -while I do often go to other breakfast type restaurants. I've been to this location twice. This time was worse than the last. Didn't think that was possible. 

We walked in and the benches were full. Stood for a solid 5 minutes before the 6th waitress who looked over decided to come by to seat us. As it turned out, everyone was busy conducting interviews which is why the front was full.. So we sat, with menus and waited.. And waited... 

Crickets... Although 3 tables had customers, they too seemed abandoned.  Finally the waitress came apologetic and took our entire order. She said she simply didn't know we were there. In the middle of the restaurant. 

I can't say I expect anything spectacular from ihop so I won't get into the food. 
After we ate, I received the bill and gave the waitress my card. She returned with my receipts thanked us and left. While I was filling out the tip and signing I didn't realize she had returned within 60 seconds to watch and told me she needed to collect the receipt ASAP -huh? Umm ok. That was a first! It was the middle of the afternoon. They're open till 9? What's the rush? 

The only reason I went was because I had a coupon. I think that's really the only reason anyone goes... Bad/no service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying: 

This food is absolutely disgusting and horrendous beyond measure. The services professionalism both on the phone and on the floor is disgusting.
The blueberry pancakes that I ordered had fucking disgusting green inside of them the green color was like into the discovery of penicillin green. I'm so disgusted I think I've gone off pancakes for a while."}
{"text":"Service is consistently THE WORST, but at least their consistent right? You always wait forever to be acknowledged at the hostess stand. You can never find your server when you need something. Only when it comes to paying your bill that you actually manage to flag someone down. 

They have tons of competition in Robinson, do your self a favor and visit one of them instead."}
{"text":"You know when you've been to a restaurant about a zillion years ago, and you forget how the food, service and price is and come out annoyed? That's what this IHOP reminds me of - lowered expectations. 

My sister had been harassing me to go get some food with her yesterday (5/15/11) before I had to go into work for about 14 seconds. I told her to pick whatever because I wasn't as hungry as she was. We drove all the way down to the south end of The Strip and had about 45 minutes to eat. It was either Panda Express (Ummm EFF NO!) Chili's (worst service ever, see review) or the always overpriced Raising Cane's... or IHOP. Eh, we went to IHOP.

The place was a ghost town. There was maybe two old couples in there and that was it. Our waiter seated us and handed us a menu. There's so much to pick from, I'm not even sure where to begin. My sister quipped \"I didn't know we walked into an Olive Garden. For a few bucks more we could get salad and bread sticks.\" Aren't IHOPs supposed to be cheap? $10-$13 for a salad is pretty steep for a breakfast joint... 

I ordered a pot roast melt sandwich (really good) and a side salad. My sister got a BLT with a side salad. From the time our order was placed to the time we got our food was seven minutes! Stuff had to have been pre-made. Our waiter even said, \"I was so surprised that it came out this fast.\" 

Our waiter never came back, except to give us the bill. I was dying for water, yet I never got a refill. Unforgivable. 

When we paid our separate checks, the manager or whoever rung us up at the counter and didn't give back the receipts that had the barcode that you use to fill in the online surveys, which I thought was odd. 

Our waiter ended up getting $2 each from my sister and me, even though the service wasn't good. We felt sorry for him because he looked like he came over from Eastern Europe, looking for the American Dream, but wound up waiting tables in a dead restaurant on the crap side of The Strip, so we felt bad for him."}
{"text":"Poor service. Placed an order for pickup.  Arrived to the restaurant.  Stood in the front area for 15 min with 2 small children,  The cashier ignored us entirely and kept on ringing up other vendors.  I even asked them where I should stand to pay for my order.  Weird.  Next time, I will release the kids wild and see how they handle it. We gave up after 15 min.  tried to call the store while in the car and they left the phone off the hook.  What a place!"}
{"text":"This place is a zoo. We placed a to go order. Got there and spent more than 20 min in line trying to pick up the food. The cashiers are overwhelmed. Noone knows who to help. After being ignored for 20 min after telling them we're there to pick up food, we left and ate at McDonald's instead. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"Woke up feeling like pancakes so went to iHop and had 2 pancakes, 2 French toast, eggs, and bacon. Got seated right away and everyone was actually pretty nice. I did notice an arrogant manager use his finger to have one of his employees come his way. When his employee went to him he proceeded to discipline him on the restaurant floor other than going to the back and talk to her about whatever she did wrong. Personally I don't like that. As far as food goes it's not bad for 10 bucks although I did feel they shorted me on the eggs. But eh... It's ihop."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. It took 12 minutes before we were even greeted. My waffles were molded. Wish I could give it no stars. It wasn't even BUSY!"}
{"text":"The service was great. John, our server attended to our every need. Glasses were filled to the top courteously and with a smile. Our order came quickly as promised. Price was fair. John enjoys his job....management,  give this man a raise!!"}
{"text":"The worst ihop I've ever been to. Half the restaurant was empty and we were told it was a 45 min wait. When we were seated it took 17 min for a server to come to us after I had to go ask for a server. Then was told they were busy with another table. It took so long for them to make a hot chocolate that part of our party had to leave. If I could give it 0 stars I would. Do not come here."}
{"text":"Don't stop. Keep driving! The prices were really high for IHOP. We ordered soda that came out tasting nasty. The feel in the place was off. We packed up and left. No need spending our money on bad food if they can't even get the soda right. We even worried about how the water would taste if they thought the soda was ok."}
{"text":"took my wife and 3 kids for breakfast at dinner time. The employees were very nice and helpful but....my wife found a long hair in her eggs, they forgot to take the kids meals off the cost (kids eat free happy hour) I gave the waiter $10 for being so polite but then they charged my card twice. I then sat on hold for 10 minutes the following day to try to resolve. the manager said I would have to bring my bank statement in so she could send it to corporate and get it fixed. What a nightmare."}
{"text":"Kim V. Is the best! Great food, great service, every single time! Especially if you have kids. It's always nice to have a server that understands. Thank you for being so great and helpful!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We walked over from our hotel for a quick dinner. Our waitress took our order and brought us our drinks. That was the last time we ever saw her or any other employee. I got up and went looking for her at the entrance (I'd last seen her walk that away). She was gone, nowhere to be found. 20 minutes had passed before i began my search for her. I wasn't about to wait any longer. Very disappointed and I wasn't about to waste my time searching for and complaining to a manager. We went back to the hotel and ordered a pizza. BTW, the pizza tasted great!"}
{"text":"The food was as expected.  The 5 stars come from the service we received from Laura and the hostess Ashley.  They were very friendly and efficient.  We were greeted well and felt at home by Ashley and Laura was very quick and accurate as our server.  Perfect trip to an IHOP."}
{"text":"The food was literally perfect - exactly what I was looking for.  The server Dee was amazing - she handled the whole place seemingly on her own.  The hostess Ashley was terrific and friendly - made me feel very welcome.  Overall very pleased - this was a Sunday around 7:30A"}
{"text":"Came here with my babies to get some yummy breakfast food and was quite impressed by the food best IHOP I've eaten at. The wait staff was friendly, the food came out fast and was very good."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and I ask myself \"why the hell do I even come back\" I was there a few weeks ago with 8 people. We waited 15 mins for our server to get us drinks. We said fine they are busy the server said they are short staffed so we placed our order in right away for those reasons. No joke it took them 45 mins to bring us our appetizer then we wait another 30 mins to get our food. This is just unheard of!! If it wasn't for a big group and having relatives from out of town to kill the time we should have walked out!! Then today we went back there with family. Only 4 of us and it wasn't busy. Believe it or not it took them 10 mins to even come and get our drink order and another 15 mins for our drinks to come out!! I said this can't be happening again. I asked the server what we going on and with an attitude she reply were short staffed today and I need you to be patient. I was ready to snap off and give her a piece of my mind but I had my kids with me and they were hungry and it was to late to go anywhere else so I swallowed my pride. We placed our order and the food took 40 mins to get to our table and of course they had to get the order wrong especially for my kids who were hungry. I told the server my kids order was wrong and she looked at us like it was our fault so we had to sit there for another 20 mins for my kids to get there food while our food got cold since we weren't going to eat without my kids eating and my kids didn't like the food we ordered. While all of this was happening to us I was looking around to see what was happen and I'm sorry to say I wasn't the only one going through this experience. The table next to us had the same frustrations and walked out which was an extremely smart move on there behalf. I'll never go back to this place and would recommend you don't go there either until they know how to run a business and staff accordingly and show some customer service. Extremely disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Our server made sure we were not late for our flight. I don't remember her name but she was awesome. The food was good and fresh. The utensils were clean. We didn't have to be delayed to be seated. Good neighborhood. Close to the airport."}
{"text":"Yay! IHOP!

There isn't anything too exciting to say.  I normally order take out from here.  I am not a morning person, or a breakfast person really.  But sometimes I really want steak and eggs, but not to deal with a restaurant.  When I call in my order, they are always really helpful.  As is the hostess/cashier when I pick up my order.

I have also dined in the restaurant.  If you actually go for breakfast, it can get REALLY crowded.  If it is a weekend, be prepared to wait.  I love that their chocolate milk is actually milk and chocolate syrup instead of pre-mixed crap.  I am pretty easy to please.  I don't think I've ever had a bad meal from this IHOP, so it's hard to find any complaints.  They get 3 stars because, well, it's IHOP.

Just your typical, chain breakfast joint (although they obviously serve much more than breakfast)."}
{"text":"We ate here late last night because of the poor food at another restaurant. We decided to try a chain to make sure we would get food food. Well we were disappointed again. The scrambled eggs were sweet and the turkey sausage was salty. Not very good at all."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from eating here last night.
Currently peeing out of my butt for the millionth time....
Thanks, IHOP!"}
{"text":"very sloooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.

but fine pancakes."}
{"text":"Generic Ihop food, cheesy corporate surroundings, but bolstered by outstanding service that elevated a 2.5-star experience to 4 stars. On a previous visit here, the music was so loud we couldn't hear ourselves think, but no such problem this time. Good overall experience for a \"chain\" breakfast."}
{"text":"My waitress was horrible. I believe her name was Maryleys. When I walked in she just gave me a blank stare, didn't even greet me!!! Coffee tasted old and when I ask her can I change it to something different she gave me an attitude. I felt uncomfortable so I left. Didn't enjoy the meal or the service I got. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Was told they deliver to Nellis Suites. Too bad I'll never know because no one answered my 6 attempts to call at 5pm."}
{"text":"3 Adults and 2 kids at 11:30 am on a Tuesday.  Place was very busy but were still seated right away.  It is very clean and everyone friendly and smiling.  1 adult had a burger platter and 2 had the \"Split Decision\" which I highly recommend.  There are so many things to choose from for breakfast/brunch that you can't go wrong because you get 2 of everything and I am always excited when I don't have to cook!  The coffee tastes great too. Everyone was very satisfied with their meals including the kids."}
{"text":"This location is not good.  We stopped here after heading back to Chicago from Wisconsin Dells.  PLEASE don't waste your time here.  Although the hostess/waitress we had was very pleasant the place was very disorganized.  Also I asked for clean silverware since the one I was given was dirty.  The replacement silverware was dirty too.  To be clear, dirty - hard chunks of food on the fork.  Ugh.  I was very turned off by this.  I didn't touch my food.  PLEASE keep driving by this IHOP and choose a cleaner restaurant."}
{"text":"I picked out what I wanted to eat for breakfast via the official IHOP online menu before arriving. I ordered my Tuscan Scramble immediately after being seated. I told the waitress that I'd like corn tortillas in place of pancakes. She replied they only had flour tortillas at this location. I asked what gluten free sides she could offer me, since my request stemmed from possessing an allergy. I accepted her offer of fruit.

My meal arrived. My fruit was all seedy & discolored, like some produce rejects. I was more concerned with my scramble, though. I looked it over. Of course, it nowhere near resembled the photo online, but the egg was overcooked, the spinach was pretty wilty, the diced tomatoes were miniscule, the red peppers were decent, but it was missing the cheese and the #1 ingredient I was looking forward to, the fresh basil. Once I finally got our server's attention, she came over and said they also don't carry these ingredients at this location. Giving her a blank look, she continued that food is ordered at the manager's discretion, and the manager opts not to carry these items. 

I had hopes for this restaurant, albeit not high ones. They are 0 for 3 in my book. It's sometimes things that seem minor that make a big difference. Eating out with food allergies is very limiting. This meal was ideal, as I studied the IHOP allergen guide online. It was a huge let down, as my palate was prepared for what I should have received. I told the manager as I paid my bill that I was disappointed. \"Yeah, we just don't have that stuff,\" she said emotionlessly. And you will not get my business again."}
{"text":"This one is near me, I go there about once a month. Very kind, attentive staff, fast service, consistent food, fair price. What more could you want from breakfast?"}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience at this location, but Rebecca the manager took phenomenal care of us and of the situation and turned the experience around. Thank you, Rebecca!"}
{"text":"IHOP food is pretty standard across the chain, and although I love breakfast food, I can't stand this location! Absolutely the worst service I've ever experienced at an IHOP. Whether it's dine-in or take-out, they never get our orders right. I dropped by this past week to grab some food to go. I was told the food would be ready in 15 minutes, but it actually took 45 minutes. I had to correct my order at least 3 times because something was missing or prepared incorrectly. Instead of apologizing, I was charged even MORE money because they rang up a side order of broccoli wrong the first time. You should pay me for this torture."}
{"text":"For such a busy location on a Saturday morning, it was surprisingly how incredibly SLOOWWWWW the service was. 25 minutes for pancakes and eggs? Seriously?

It's open 24 hours and after dark, they usually have armed security or a local cop on duty in the lobby."}
{"text":"Pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage. Mmmmm... breakfast! Sure, it's fatty and salty and greasy, but there are options for healthy-ish choices at the IHOP if you want. It is, however, quick food!

Yes, they have stuff that's not pancakes. But who comes to IHOP for a cheeseburger or a fish and chips platter? I mean, really!

Service seems a little hit and miss. Sometimes you get a waitperson who comes by quickly to take your order and bring your check, sometimes you get one who apparently decided now was a good time to take their 15 minute smoke break. (And you know it was a smoke break, because they stink of it when they come back.)"}
{"text":"I have been here so many times! However for some reason i have never come here before the time of 12am. I have been coming here for years. I went here one time after my junior prom lol. I have never had an issue here and my food always comes out as expected. Its always empty when i come and the servers are always amazing."}
{"text":"Dropped the ball even before we started,
Seated two tables that obviously got there after us, 
Finally ordered steak and eggs, and my wife sirloin tips, and eggs, no toasted bread was offer, had to order after most of the meal was served, FOOD PARTICLES STILL REMAIN ON THE CUTLERY, had to wipe it clean whit the same napkin it was wrapped, 
Steak was raw and bloody, had to be sent back, came rubbery and chewy,
No toast yet, coffee was iced cold in an almost empty pot, finished my eggs and hash browns and, no toasted bread yet,
Waters seemed to be a bit overwhelmed by a few tables, no coffee refill was offered, had to ask for it, and, no toasted bread yet, 
As I'm about to finish the steak, finally toasted bread was brought to the table, few bites before I finished my whole meal, 
I see why this restaurant needs some TLC 
Prices are a bit high for the quality of food and service, ..!
Will do my homework before visiting any more of this restaurants..!
Surely never to come back to this one .."}
{"text":"I despise when I go into a restaurant to eat and the server comes back smelling like a pack of freakin' Marlboro's.  If I could give this place a NEGATIVE FIVE STAR I would.  This is the SECOND time they forgot my sons food.  The last time, we thought, maybe it was just busy and they were short staffed.  But to have it done again, when it wasn't busy, was some bullshit on the real.  

Look, I've been a server before, and if one of your tables orders is missing or delayed, you better get your ass back there and get it fired on the fly!!! Not make a ten year old sit there and wait for his damn food while you go blaze up outside.  Needless to say, we all waited and shared some of ours because we weren't going to let him sit there without food. 25 minutes later, it came out, and it was the wrong food.  And these damn servers want higher wages? Please...here's a TIP for ya, when you give service that deserves better pay, maybe you can complain...better yet, when that happens, use it to buy yourself a nicotine patch to stop smoking and get a better job.  IHOP has lost this customer!!"}
{"text":"The best IHOP in Vegas. PERIOD. Thanks to the general manager Andy what a great experience we have had!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this location for breakfast this week.  I ordered a coffee - the mug came filled with hot coffee with a full red lipstick print on it.  I didn't initially notice it because of the way the mug was facing but my husband did.  We pointed this out to the waitress she apologized but appeared as if it's a normal occurrence.  She brought a fresh mug straight from dishwasher which was still hot from being steamed cleaned and refilled my cup.  I drank my coffee at this point from a straw.  I asked for extra napkins - she comes back with paper towels from the bathroom dispenser - wth?

Needless to say this was the worse experience we've ever had at this location."}
{"text":"Went to this location, we were greeted as soon as we entered. Right away caught the smell of weed! We were seated in the booth next to high schoolers. The weed smell was apparently coming from them, as the smell was even stronger. An employee got up from their booth, maybe she had been on break. Then I noticed about 5 young children across the room at the corner tables by the windows. They were elementary school aged and younger. Must have been \"take your child to work day\". Some of the employees were sitting with them and a couple of children came out from the kitchen. I wondered where the manager was or maybe the manager is okay with this type of work ethics. Won't be going back, we will go to \"The Sweet Spot\" Instead. Enjoy your IHOP employee onsite daycare!!"}
{"text":"On top of waiting forever to be seated, I had a coupon going in and it disappeared while I was eating their terrible pancakes"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to IHop at this location.  The place was crowded.  As folks were leaving, more were coming in.  It was a constant flow around 11 a.m on Sunday morning.  The waitress was kind, patient, and was quick to fill our order.  The coffee was hot and the company was great.  What more could I ask for?  I had one of the newer menu items, Simple & Fit 2x2x2 combos (2 scrambled egg whites, 2 slices of turkey bacon, and 2 pancakes).  On my next visit to IHop, I will get the Simple & Fit 2 egg breakfast (served with fruit and wheat toast).  The meal was delicious and fit the bill kept the incoming calories to a minimum.  Ambience was good, service was fast and courteous.  It was a much better than expected experience after reading the two write-ups by Ellen B. and Amanda B.  I guess the B's have it when it comes to IHop!"}
{"text":"Forget about this place on the weekend, very crowded, had to wait a long time. Staff was disorganized and running around like a chicken with no head. Fruit looked like it was scraped off another plate, and had to ask several times for my drink. This was a favorite off the strip breakfast place, but I'm going to look at Denny's next time."}
{"text":"Went to IHop for my birthday and also the verynext day. Desiree was my server both days and she was incredibly fantastic. I told Tina the manager and she agreed! Apparently many people notice the great service Desiree gives them. Thanks! Can't wait to come back to see you two!!"}
{"text":"I used to avoid this location but no more. Not only has the food and ambiance been heightened, but I have found the same great servers with welcoming smiles all over the place. Kimberly is an awesome and hardworking lady."}
{"text":"I was at this part of town and stopped at this IHop for lunch. It was such a pleasant experience with a really great waitress. She had only been working there fo about 8 months. What great service. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night, barely anyone here but great service, food cooked well and delish."}
{"text":"The staff was nice and on top of things. We ordered our food which was breakfast. I got the 2 sausage-2bacon-2 French toast-2pancake breakfast, wife got the strawberry crepe breakfast with grits on the side. And a Pepsi, 2 waters. 
The water was clean and good, The pepsi was fountain usual but at $2.35 is a little pricey to put it mildly but average fleecing price for one of these type of restaurants. My breakfast was good, although the picture shows it to be a little larger than what I got, small, or dare I say little slices of French toast. Why do things get smaller the older I get? The bacon was good, although one piece was not cooked properly and was all limpy fat. Sausage was good and tasty links, eggs cooked just like I like them, I substituted the pancakes for hashbrowns and got no hassle there at all, they were good. Wifes strawberry crepes were not so good, hard dough, the strawberries looked fresh in the pic but what we got was strawberry sauce with strawberries, was not very good at all and mushy strawberries. Her grits were ok, undercooked bacon on her plate too. There was a weird waitress (not ours) that was just taking her time cleaning the table next to us, while staring at the customers, rubbing the salt and pepper, it was very weird, wife made a comment about it too before I could. Creepy to put it mildly. I expressed my distaste about the strawberry sauce to the manager, she took .99 cents off my bill for the sauce. Wow, thank you! I was insulted, I did not want money off necessarily, all I wanted was an acknowledgement of what I thought of the strawberry sauce. We will probably go back, all the stuff on the menu looks great, staff for the most part is top notch, restaurant is very clean and looks very busy.  Just a note, getting into the parking lot took us 4 Uturns, don't miss the only entrance or you will be in a world of mess."}
{"text":"Picked up some lunch Togo. We had 2 omelets and a country fried steak. All tasted great except. I asked for no hasbrowns in my big steak omelet. I can't have starches so I thought an omelet would be the perfect option. Unfortunately, it came with hash-browns inside. Even though I specified very clearly when placing the order I couldn't have hash browns. I did my best to scrape them out but was very disappointed. 
I love Ihop and come very often with my family. I often choose not to go to this location because the service tends to struggle. I heard they are under new management so I am hoping it will improve. But so far I am not impressed. I thought if I got takeout I wouldn't have to worry. But it still managed to no be right."}
{"text":"Dear greeter and Al, the waiter. We have 6 kids and are avid coupon users. If we can save a buck, we do! Besides, to not use coupons and deals, when available, is a slap in the face to our economy. If you don't use them, it's literally like throwing money away, which is economic abuse. We are also extremely efficient and don't throw food away, ever. Nor do we typically eat at places like this because of the chemical ingredients in most of the food. Today, we made an exception due to limited options. They had a sign that read, 20% off to mall shoppers. I asked them if I could get the deal without the receipt, they said no and they were emphatic with informing me of everything I couldn't do. It was as though we were in a debate and they were lobbying for team \"NO DEAL!\" They offered no suggestions and didn't even suggest that I sign up for iHop rewards on their very own website. All they offered was NO. So, I offered no tip, and I'm a good tipper when the service deserves it. The food tasted good, hence the 2 stars, but the pleasure you took in telling me no has lost you a family of 8. ByeHop."}
{"text":"Sure IHOP is a chain but the food is decent and the prices affordable. What makes this location great are the people who work there. I'm not getting it's really top notch service. We're talking about a popular diner that's constantly busy yet the staff go out of their way to make sure orders are correct, checking back in reasonable time and doing it with genuine smiles on their faces."}
{"text":"Terrible. I've eaten at other locations and found iHop adequate. This one was terrible. The server was nice but overworked. We waited almost an hour for our food and it was cold when it arrived. Overcooked eggs and the chicken in my crepes were tasteless and rubbery. We informed the server when she eventually made it back. She informed the manager who gave us a discount and offered a discount if we came back the next day. Nice try but I wouldn't eat that meal again if it were free."}
{"text":"Welcome to IHOP, please leave your expectations in the doorway. IHOP is one of the only establishment open 24 hrs on the main part of campus, and you know what? It sounds pretty good around 2am once the bars have closed. I would only give this place a chance with a little liquid courage, and that's ok. If you're looking for a family dining experience you are much better off at the Original Pancake House on Springfield--but IHOP certainly has its place."}
{"text":"The past 2 times I have been here, the service has been horrible. Today, my boyfriend and I decided to give it one last chance since it's so close to our house. I'm glad we gave it another shot, because our waitress, Amber, was great. She greeted us quickly, got our drinks and orders in a timely manner and was friendly. The food was great and the iced coffee here is delicious."}
{"text":"Been coming here since we move to north side of town! 2 years ago food portion was normal then lately like today I come in with family as always the good portion getting worst for instant the hash brown usually is well per portion but today very thin and a layer it is like we only get the burn pet on top!!! Then asked for a little bit extra strawberry for our French toast server said I have to charge u! Why can the food just be consistence!!! Thinking to move our IHOP location to different store!!! Sad but it is what it is service goes down and food getting smaller portion but price is higher then it is time to go!!!"}
{"text":"International House of Pancakes...but where are the international pancake choices? OH :O?!

I gave this IHOP a 1 start because the coffee tasted like watery coffee and the pancakes my boyfriend got, which were chocolate chips, didn't really taste like chocolate unless you got some of the small chips in it...I got the hearty nut and grains ones with the blueberry which were too soft since it fell apart every time i picked it up...on the other hand, it's IHOP so oh well YOLO!"}
{"text":"The wait staff/ hostess are extremely rude. I will never eat at this  place again. Regardless of them being busy they completely disregarded their customers. No wonder they only have 2 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"2nd time there today.  Never been much of an IHOP fan, but my husband likes it.  Our waitress was nice-however, seeing we had our grandsons w/ us and they asked for apple juice she brought out the biggest glasses we've ever seen!  Didn't let us know there were different sizes or that they could have a child's size.  Were we shocked when those juices rang in at almost $3 a glass!
Then my meal came after everyone else ate.  The egg whites were so overcooked they looked like chopped cauliflower and tasted of rubber.  
Told the manager who apologized and took my meal off the tix, but honestly where was he while I sat there waiting for almost a 1/2 hour watching everyone else chow down?"}
{"text":"I've been to two franchises and this one is my favorite.  Parking lot stays pretty packed, so keep an eye out for someone leaving.  I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated.  Service is relatively fast, however, you must stress how you want your bacon cooked (or it'll be limp) and eggs (or they'll be either soft and/or runny). You must also request plenty of napkins.

Overall, the food is great and you definitely leave feeling full and satisfied."}
{"text":"My hubby and I stop at this IHOP every once in a while when in the area and never have witnessed such chaos as this mornings breakfast rush. It was very unorganized and long wait periods causing a big group to leave for lack of service and people complaining of cold food. Our food was ok but we too had poor service. We won't be back for breakfast any more on a weekend anyway hope management gets it together."}
{"text":"I went here with my family for a late afternoon meal on a Sunday.  One of us ordered the Pot Roast and another a Chicken Fried Steak, the rest ordered breakfast fare.  A few minutes after taking our order, the waiter came back to the table to tell us that the kitchen was out of Mashed Potatoes.  Mashed Potatoes come with both of the dishes mentioned above and are a key side for many of their dinner dishes.  Also, as I mentioned this was on a Sunday afternoon.  I cannot for the life of me figure out how the restaurant would be out of one of the sides that comes with many of their dishes.

While the meals were good, the missing Mashed Potatoes made the meals significantly less enjoyable.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Beautiful day. Asked to eat on the patio. The door was open. I was told that none of the waitstaff wanted to work the patio. Really? If the manager says work the patio, you work the patio. Fail."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. We went there on Saturday morning and had a decent experience. Because our hotel was around the corner we went there late at night after attending a concert. You couldn't get much worse service than this. They brought out 3 app samplers when we ordered 4. No sauce with them at all. Another person in our party had a dirty plate, and worse part was our waitress never came back (even after she was not the person to bring out our food) do yourself a favor....go to Waffle House"}
{"text":"This place is a typical breakfast chain that are run very efficiently.  The food is quite ordinary but will meet expectations of many church going people.  The servers are very fast, friendly, and efficient which is what is expected from a typical family style diner.  The server was one of the ladies who can hold many plates on her hand which is rare these days.  You will expect a 20-45 minutes wait on a weekend so make sure you go on a weekday to get great services."}
{"text":"Decided to try this IHOP on Craig rd.  I was very surprised to see that it was not very busy for a Wednesday morning.  My wife and I were promptly seated.  Our coffee was terrible when served.  Very weak and watered down.  When I complained, they brought us another cup, which was not much better. 

We ordered from the senior menu which is not much of a deal.   For a $7.00 plate, I was very disappointed.  Overall, our eating experience was not that enjoyable.   Maybe this was just a bad day for IHOP, but after reading other reviews here, I think this is their norm."}
{"text":"This is our go to place @ 11:30p when it's our Friday's after work & our son's weekend. We enjoy their yummy breakfast  pancakes, steak and hot mocha coffee.
One of the reason my family and I come here at all times is because the excellent service that Brian, the manager, who sometimes a server when the place gets busy ,provides. He make sure we are taking care and always on top of every thing when it comes to checking with our needs. Since, we made this place a tradition, he remembers my family and I. We just love his caring and sincere personality. 
We love this place overall , the food and service exceeded our expectations. We always leave full and happy!"}
{"text":"Went on Sunday around 11am, about a 20 min wait but they kept the line moving. I recognized some of the servers used to be servers at other local restaurants. Some of my mom's food was forgotten. The prices are pretty much the same as Bob Evans- I'll stick to them."}
{"text":"We had a party of 14 and they accommodated us on a very busy Sunday.  Javier was fantastic!! Recommend when you have lots of people with different food interests. Who doesn't like a reasonably priced breakfast??"}
{"text":"Slow staff, forgotten items ordered, looooong wait at the door and at the table, no explanation that cheese on the scrambled eggs was an upcharge (we were asked if we wanted cheese, so said yes, and we're charged $1/egg extra for about $0.20 of cheese), had to keep asking for ketchup & butter, and the eggs were cold when they finally came out.  The rest of the food was just average at best

Our waitress was polite, but slow, and not forthcoming w/ info, nor did she check back w/ us to see how things were doing.  By time the ketchup finally came, the hash browns were cold and all but eaten.

Save your money & time and make your pancakes at home.  Come here and you're only setting yourself up for disappointment."}
{"text":"Even after reading bad reviews on here I decided to go out on a limb, mainly because of how close it is. It took more than 30 minutes to receive a to go order on a very slow Friday afternoon. The staff was friendly but does this not make up for the fact that they kept telling me my food would be coming out \"shortly\". The manager was very nice, apologetic and also paid for my meal, but again this doesn't make up for the slow service. Hopefully they pull it together because they have potential!"}
{"text":"It's an ihop...lots of food, of acceptable but unremarkable quality. Service might be good or might not be good. I mean...it's an ihop."}
{"text":"Horrible service!! Was seated for 20 minutes before anyone came to take our order and when our food did come our food looked so sloppy and disgusting. I will never recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The five stars are for Deserae! She was all alone, seating the guests, answering the phone, and taking everyone's payments all with a smile on her face!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is awful! They finally updated their decor to reflect 2017 but the food is always poorly presented, cold and the staff visibly miserable. I've overhead them fighting, complaining and not working together to serve the client. Do not waste your money here, the service is not worth anything they offer on their menu."}
{"text":"Upon entering, there was no one to greet customers.  We spent multiple minutes waiting to be acknowledged and seated.  There were only 2 servers, so we had to wait to have drink orders taken.  The whole party was ready to order by the time our drinks arrived, but the server walked away without asking if we were ready to place our order.  My mother is a senior and tried to order the only senior dinner option.  She was told they were out of it.  She expressed to the server about the lack of dinner options on the senior menu.  The server offered her another dinner option to be discounted to the senior price and my mother picked one from the options the server pointed out.  The server came back a few minutes later to tell her she was told that she now had to charge full price, but offered a meal discount.  By this point, I was already frustrated, so I said that was fine.  My mother was not happy wanted to speak to a manager.  I went with her to the podium.  The young man (the 2nd server) was the one there.  We asked him if there was a manager available to speak with and pointed us to the manager on duty, but it was our waitress.  He told us she was the crew manager.  I did not want to speak to her about it because she was the issue so far, but she came over anyway.  I expressed to her the problems we were having so far and told us they were short staffed and that her chefs were not allowing the senior meal price that she offered.  Again, she assured us there would be a discount on our check.  My mother's food came to the table, but the waitress had more bad news.  None of the other orders had been processed.  There was an explanation that the computer had held those orders.  We were told that she was going to get them processed right away and that they were going to start cooking them at that moment.  Unfortunately, our meals didn't arrive until my mother was completely done with her meal.  Now, she had to sit through all of us (a party of 6) eating our meal.  I personally ordered the steak tips, but they didn't even taste like steak.  One of my children described them as tasting like ground beef with cinnamon.  The mashed potatoes were watery and the corn had no flavor.  I reminded myself that this is a breakfast establishment and that I should not expect too much from dinner entrees.  I was hoping that the issues would have been over at this point, but I was wrong.  Almost every glass one of us had an empty glass in front of us.  No one had stopped to refill anything.  Things were consistently getting worse.  My daughter reached across the table and pulled a long blonde hair out of my youngest son's pancakes.  All of our party are dark haired.  That was enough!  I caught the male server and asked him to take away the hair and the pancakes because I did not want my son eating another bite of them. The actual server from our table came by to see what happened.  I explained the hair and that I gave the other server the plate.  She once again reiterated that she would be discounting the meal.  How can so many bad things happen over one meal?  We each gave the youngest some of our food as he was not asked if he would like to order anything else.  We waited for the check, but after a while, we decided to just go to the register.  I needed to get out of this restaurant.  It was the male server that came over to print it.  He tells me that there was a discount added to the check and I can see it where it says manager comp.  The manager comp said $8.99.  I told him that the server/crew manager said she was discounting the meal.  He tells me that they have and that discount is the $8.99.  I pointed out to him the entry for my son's meal that had hair in it was $8.99 and the $8.99 manager comp is that meal being removed because of the hair.  He continued to argue about that being the discount.  I asked him to please just get the server since she is the one that has been dealing with this and promising the discount.  He kept insisting that he could take care of this and my discount was the manager comp amount.  He refused to get the server/crew manager.  She noticed we were there and came over.  The male server refused to leave until she told him to go.  I asked her about it and explained what he kept saying about the manager comp.  After all of the issues, her discount offered was $15.  That did not even cover the cost of my meal.  I asked her to put the name of the manager and what time they would be in so that I could speak with them about my concerns.  
The manager that I phoned was named Mike.  He listened to the concerns.  He did offer to have us back and he would cover the bill.  I had to politely decline and inform him that with everything I have been through, I have no intention to return to the chain, ever."}
{"text":"I ordered a pick up order...and I have never been more upset. I ordered a rooty jr. And the pancake with extra strawberries and i am so mad. They are so unprofessional and didn't even speak time when I went in to pick up the order and the pancake is cold and hard and has TWO STRAWBERRIES ON IT with a chunk ripped out...UMM?!!?! I had to give 1 star to post this review..but THIS IS A NO GO"}
{"text":"Waited 40 minutes for my food then got it with 3 hairs. I recommend  no one to come to this place. It's disgusting and I still had to pay for my food."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner with the fam. Kids eat free, service was amazing. From the server/host to the manager. Very friendly and stood out. The manager is the one from Washington. They have a great evening crew. Good food too."}
{"text":"Food was great and the staff was very friendly. We were in a hurry to get to a soccer tournament and they got us in and out in no time."}
{"text":"My wife and i went here today for breakfast...she ordered french toast and i ordered an omelet.....seemed like mebbe 3 minutes later our food was there...that is amazing. There was tons of food that tasted fantastic as well...Ive always loved IHOP and this location proves why yet again..Btw our server was really nice as well...Appreciate the great start to our day."}
{"text":"I understand Sunday mornings are busy, but our experience was ridiculous. I will say we were seated quickly and we got our drinks. After that, we waited a little over an hour to watch the tables in our area, some that were seated after us, eat and leave. Our server waited over an hour to come tell us that she kept asking where our order was and was doing everything she could to get it out quickly, and then proceeded to tell us that the order with poached eggs is why it was taking so long. I make poached eggs at home and it does not even take an hour. Needless to say we left without even getting our food. I'm 8 months pregnant. I'm not impressed with the way things were handled at all, not even a manager came to speak to us or apologize. We will not be giving IHOP our business anymore."}
{"text":"What's happened to America's Pancake house? The coffee is even on the \"Meh\", but I digress, oh wait, this entire experience this morning was a series of digressions.

6:30am and the AC was blowing like it was 2 in the afternoon, which made us want coffee any more, but like I stated, meh. Hostess was cheerful enough, and gave us time to look over the menu, and our orders came out promptly, no problems here...but the food?

My stuffed waffles tasted of thawed bread that was baked last month, and the glazed strawberries, well, we know those didn't come from this years crop! My buddy's meal of scrambled eggs and hash browns was edible (at least he didn't have a comment), but the biscuits and gravy was cold and when he asked for a warm up, we expected just that, but she insisted on having them remade...this took longer than the original wait time, so don't know what was up with that other than wanting to appear they weren't just zapped in the microwave.

Again, the people were friendly, prompt and efficient in their tasks, but the food was not anything I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Today I went to ihop and ordered the eggs with avocado bennie and a side of hash browns. Our server was really nice, but the food took a while to come out and when it did, I discovered a large beard hair on top of my egg. After inspecting the hash browns for further contamination, there was nothing out of the ordinary about them and I assumed they were all clear. After eating half of the plate I found a green substance that was probably old avocado from the previous meal. The dish that replaced the first one came out and that plate also had a white substance that resembled cottage cheese on the rim of the plate. By the third time I should have expected it I guess, but on the upside the layout of the restaurant was pleasant."}
{"text":"We ordered through uber eats about an hr ago. (We're in Vegas for the weekend)The driver had to wait for 40 minutes! Not only that when we got pr order there were no utensils, no ranch for the appetizer sampler(which I specifically requested) no french toast syrup or even powdered sugar and no ketchup! My husband and I were so hungry and pissed!!!"}
{"text":"Great veggie options and coffee but the service was super rude. She kinda ruined the breakfast out with a friend."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Im very lenient on my reviews but for me to give this place 1 star it had to be ridiculously awful! Came on a weeknight around 9:30 after choosing it over waffle house because the bf wanted to \"chill\" a little after a long day of work. Well, we did \"chill\" alright...an hour long chilled and waited for 2 entrees. They sat us down at a booth that just had got sanatized therefore it was still wet and i mean wet wet with strong fumes that i breathed in for 10 minutes before it dries out. Then came the utensils, wrapped in white napkins...only if it was completely white! How could you not see stains on both white napkins?? yet they put it neatly on our table as if nothing was there. If that was how they present themselves to customers, what could possibly be behind closed doors?! No acknowledgement whatsoever of timing and we had to ask how much longer for her to go check after 50 minutes wait. The food came overcooked, they forgot the bananas that supposed to be on the french toasts, asked for it and didnt get it till the toast was almost gone. Overall, quality of service and food were one word \"poor\". Never again."}
{"text":"We had a great experience and food at this IHOP!! We had a large party which they were able to accommodate us quickly! Our service was fast and friendly, the girls and myself had a great time. The all you can eat pancakes kept coming and we're delicious. The Nutella crepes were so yummy! Thank you for the great food and smiles. We will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing over all. Loved the food and the service. Waitress even asked us if we wanted drinks to go! I am definitely coming back for more stuff :)"}
{"text":"Too institutional.  Out of a can, bag, box, or freezer.  Parking is very limited.  Not a fan."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Ihop but i swear this location has the absolute worse management..every single fucking time we come here there is never a hostess ready to sit people (even when its not busy).. The lazy management will go back to the kitchen to shoot the shit and just not care about the people waiting in the lobby..The waiters are really good and nice but fuck the management.."}
{"text":"Friends and I were out drinking singing karaoke and of course when it was time to go home everyone wanted to go eat. We were in china town I wanted to go get some delicious pho or something. I got out voted and ended up here. Never ever ever again will I let my \"friends\" talk me into coming again.

The service was TERRIBLE and so was the food. I could make better breakfast in my most drunken stupor with my eyes closed! I'm so over it I don't even want to write about this place anymore....moving on"}
{"text":"I LOVE IHOP pancakes and have loved other food from their menu, but wasVERY disappointed in the Turkey plate tonight .  My plate came out warm but quickly cooled due to the a/C being on.  My wait staff was great to begin with, but became very slow after... Maybe she was cooking??  I will return, but, probably won't get dinner again.. This is a fun spot due to collage minded young adults sitting around, but Turn the A/C up and schedule another wait staff!!!"}
{"text":"In bed I awoke to see a GD roach looking over my shoulders SOS I swats the frigging thing off. I'm not running a GD hostel for insects you SOB! Can I help it if they like my sarcasm  and wit?  Screw  you!"}
{"text":"I don't know how you can order seconds on all-you-can-eat pancakes. I double dog  dare you!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. I had breakfast for dinner and it was good. For me, IHOP has always been one of those \"middle of the road\" type of restaurants. I only eat breakfast there when others are going or I don't have any other choice. They are consistent. 

We did have great service. Our server was slammed with so many tables and she was a rockstar working through it!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 11:45. My husband ordered oatmeal. I ordered a regular combo. After waiting for 20 minutes ( only 2 other tables tables were occupied) I get my plate. Egg was runny I ordered medium. My pancakes were minus bananas and strawberries. Talked to manager told her my hubby didn't  want the oatmeal anymore. She was very nice took price of oatmeal off and they still brought it out. Forgot the bananas. By this time we were behind schedule.  Ate what we could. Maybe we just came at a bad time. But one of my pancakes was raw in the middle. At ihop ? Oh well. We still left a decent tip. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"One server on a Saturday night?!?  I am writing this review as we are at this exact IHOP. Our server Clinton was very good but was extremely overwhelmed. He was the only server working and was trying to seat tables, take orders, refill drinks, cash checks and bus tables. He was very considerate and even told us that it would be a while due to the amount of people that were before us. We were in no hurry so this wasn't an issue but you could tell that it was getting harder and harder for him as more people continued to walk in. The table that was seated after us got up and walked out as did multiple others who waited to be seated and never were. Overall the food and service was great but the management needs to dedicate some major attention to staffing."}
{"text":"I just ate the peach cobbler blackberry pancakes with a touch of vanilla ice cream from their summer menu and it was delicious. I added the combo eggs and 4 strips of bacon too.
It was very good. It's an IHOP, this isn't gourmet food. Its just good quality food at a decent price. 

I read another review from someone looking for healthy fit meal choices. Hello??? Did you not see all the greasy goodness on the window photo displays? Did you not see pancakes heaped with whipped cream and berries? You came here looking for grilled chicken and veggies....really? Its a pancake house. Go somewhere else if you want bland and tasteless. 

I've eaten at this particular IHOP quite a few times because its close to work. Its clean, the service is usually pretty good and pretty quick and I'm in and out under 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The waiter barely came by to refill my drink. Waited forever for my food. Food did not taste satisfying. Waiter took forever to have us pay our food. DON'T COME HERE!"}
{"text":"good food just came a little slow"}
{"text":"I ordered a burger w/o cheese. Comes out with cheese -  sent it back. Burger #2 - was actually the first burger. They got rid of the cheese by cutting the patty in half. Not paying for less., so that went back. Meanwhile in the peanut gallery--the workers were yelling to each other across the restaurant. Trying to decide who was going on break and other matters. Yelling - it was ridiculous. The manager was there, we saw him have to apologies to two other tables because the kitchen messed up. Not sure why he didn't stop the yelling. Did I like the burgers -yes. Going back - no."}
{"text":"This was a great experience.  My husband and I brought our 4 young children in for breakfast.  The establishment is beautiful and clean.  The hostess was quick to seat us in a nice big booth.  Our server was incredible.  Our drinks came out quickly.  Our food came out quickly.  Our order was correct and the food was delicious.  I loved the friendliness and cleanliness of this IHOP.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Sooo.. I am a Little dissappointed that the Ihop here in vegas wont honor the discount program if you work at an applebees or ihop. I was super stoked that I work for an awesome company and then get turned down for a discount program. The server is awesome and I love the atmosphere. Crepe combo...mmm mmm good..."}
{"text":"The building is open for 24hrs. The only positive thing I could say about this place. Other 1 star reviews I've read are similar."}
{"text":"This place used to be great. I don't know what food they are using now because the food is bland and has no flavor. The staff there are not good with customer service. A person should not have an empty cup for more than 3 minutes especially when the place is not busy at all. The waitress should come around and ask \"How is everything?\" And none of them do that. The only thing they do is refill your drinks after they been on their ohine for 10 minutes asking about friends while laughing and giggling. I would not reccomend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally review an IHOP but this location is an exception! Their service, cleanliness, and food is great. Everything that you would expect from IHOP but better!"}
{"text":"Everyone knows what your getting at IHOP. There were no disappointments here. The staff at this location are wonderful. They have the best customer service. The food was just as expected also. I always get my two eggs over medium with hash browns and sausage. I will go back to this location (Charlotte at Woodlawn Rd.) mainly because of the staff.  Thank you IHOP at Woodlawn!"}
{"text":"For 60 cents you can add the Banana and Cream Belgian waffle to my breakfast. And that is exactly what I did!. And it was delicious! This is another great location. Service is always great and everyone is always nice. If I go to this location I like to go early because it does get pretty crowded. Even during busy time though I have never had bad service. Thank you IHOP!"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst run restaurant I've ever been to in my life. They keep tables dirty for 20 to 30 minutes no one approaches you to take an order or give you water. The chain should be ashamed of this franchise or the corporate store. Never wanted to give a negative but wish I could. Pathetic."}
{"text":"Always liked ihop but this location the service is deplorable, to the point I won't go to an ihop ever again.  I had my little girl with me and met up with my sister and her son. The staff was horrible, we were the only table in there and took almost 40 minutes. You could hear the people in the back talking about partying it up, even swear I heard sex noises. Left corparate the same review. We actually felt like us being customers was an inconvenience to there trashy conversation that the kids could hear too! Very disappointed multiple times at that location. My steaks sandwich had 7 fries on the plate like people were eating them in the back. We left really angry with the service. Only reason they got one star was because it wouldnt let me leave zero stars!! GO ELSEWHERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, their corporate office sent $25 in response to my complaint, so we tried this location again. This time they sat us (3 adults, no kids) in the backroom, where we were the only table without children. My hasbrowns came out after everyone else's meal, there was no salt on the table, the salad my mom ordered was wilty and slightly brown.  The iced tea was not drinkable, I sent mine back and they still charged me for it.

When I went upfront with the gift certificate, the same manager that was there for the previous visit, didn't even know how to check me out, using it, she had to get the hostess to do it, which I found really unprofessional.  She also didn't even acknowledge that I was there, so after this, I definitely don't think we'll be going back to this location, especially when Village Inn is right there as well."}
{"text":"Having breakfast for dinner or a late night snack is awesome. I just love the pancakes with the four different syrups I have a choice to choose from everytime I go and dine in.
Having a short stack with eggs and bacon is YUM! Having their dinner menu is OK but breakfast is better choice app IHOP anytime.
The only thing going at late night is that service is a little slower. Hi guess the staffing is not as well during the day . The trick is what you order your drinks water water coffee and a beverage, lol. I normally ordered orange juice or some kind of juice with the coffee.
I need to bring back all you can eat pancakes..... 
IHOP is always fun to hang out with friends and they don't rush you at late night hours."}
{"text":"I am typically pretty happy with IHOP restaurants but unfortunately this was not a pleasant experience. The restaurant is very run down. Our seats had tears in the fabric and the food was very bland. We ordered a child's funny face pancake and they didn't even bother making the face which is the fun of kids ordering it. Such a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Such a good place!!! The dancing manager Shane always keeps things fun and the service is always good. They probably have the best french toast around and I love big open space and all the lighting in the place. The hostesses are nice and the food is always out pretty soon. My favorite breakfast place !!"}
{"text":"Open 24 hours yet no one answers the phone at night. Don't get off work myself til late. It's obnoxious knowing that I'm sitting with a ringer for more than 3 minutes yet nobody picks up the phone and it's only midnight. Such a shame. I don't even use yelp but this actually irritated me because clearly the employees don't wanna be there. Shame for the business to lose money because they simply refuse to answer and take the order. Shocked."}
{"text":"Long overdue updated review:  I must admit that I have a weird tendency of eating late at night due to being a waitress myself.  Dinner for me is usually after 9PM, 8PM if I'm lucky.  Even on my off-days, I find myself more hungry around 9ish.  My whole schedule is set back but in fairness, I don't usually sleep until around 3-4AM.    

I've been frequenting this place since 2010 when The Mister and I bought our house in the area.  Service was rough the first couple of years but after a while, they've seem to picked up momentum, hired more staff for the midnight crew, and renovated the place.  IHOP has really stepped up their game!  Food is standard with all other IHOPs.  Their Peaches & Cream Brioche French Toast is my go-to.  The only reason service here gets pretty awful at times is when their teen-aged staffing calls off work and leaves them high and dry.  It gets chilly in here so if you get cold easily, bring a light jacket or something.

Here's a tip straight from our waitress:  If you're ever at the counter and the staff isn't around, open the front door.  It alarms and chimes in the back and someone will be out shortly.  Just don't be a dick about it."}
{"text":"I went to IHOP on 3/26/2013 at 12:28am. I went with my wife and mother to satisfy one of my pregnant wife's cravings.

 Since it was so late both my mother and I did not want to get hug meals so we inquired about ordering off of the kids menu which we were told was quite alright. The server seemed nice he wasn't great but I give it to having to work a late shift. 

My wife ordered the Pancake combo with over hard eggs hash browns sausage and the pancakes where NY cheese cake pancakes. My mother ordered the grilled Mac and Cheese. I ordered the Mac and cheese and then my wife gave me the IF YOU DONT ORDER SOMETHING ELSE I WILL STAB YOU LOOK simply because she did not want to be the only one seeming like she was eating at the table so I also ordered a crispy chicken salad.

The pancakes did not have a single hint of cheesecake but they were still good maybe its because I really like ihop pancakes but I thought they were still delicious, my wife on the other hand wasn't so pleased as she didn't feel her prego sweet tooth was satisfied. The hash browns sausage and eggs were the usual nothing out of the ordinary. The grilled cheese sandwich was exactly like the grilled cheese I would make at home toasted brad with a slice of cheese is in the middle. The Mac and cheese was regular Kraft Mac and cheese. The salad just happens to be one of my favorite salads at ihop and it surely never disappoints its filling and tasteful.

We asked for the tab and when I received it I was shocked to see that even after ordering off of the kids menu the entire bill was still over $30.00 O.O!!! Luckily we had a menu at the table and my mom quickly started comparing the prices. She immediately noticed that we were charged the incorrect amounts. My wife suggested that maybe the pricing was different given the hour. I looked through out the menu and the check to see any sort of fine print that may state that prices are subject to change based on time but there was none. I asked the server if the prices where different given the time it was he explained that they were not. I showed the server the inconstancies in my check and the pricing that was listed in the menu. He said WOW! I'm shocked I've never had someone point that out. He then picked up the tab and my credit card which was laying on the table and said let me see why it did that. My thoughts were oh well he's surely going to edit the amounts and bring me the correct bill and charge that to me. Well to my surprise he did absolutely nothing and simply charged me the incorrect amount. 

I have a very short temper especially when I feel someone is trying to take me for a fool but in this particular instance I held my cool and simply walked out of the establishment before I turned ihop into a crime seen over 2 measly dollars. My wife later asked my why I was so aggravated at the situation and I had to explain that if ihop is doing this to every single person because no one is checking their bills then they are committing fraud and false advertising. I explained that if I was committing fraud I'd be in jail so why is it ok for them to do it? And at the end of the day its not about the 2 dollars its about the principal!! 

I ended up writing a contact us form about the issue I doubt they'll actually reply."}
{"text":"My family and I traveled  from NYC to NC and this was the first stop we made after a tiring flight. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted nicely, seated promptly and our waitress was so pleasant, we wanted a hug from her. We each ordered various things from breakfast to lunch/dinner meals but each meal was presentable, tasty and there were no kiddie portions here (which is a pet peeve of mines). The check amount was great since there was total of 5 of us and this outing would be have more pricey in NYC. I really enjoyed this NC spot."}
{"text":"Love being there the same time as the balloon man.  Gives you something fun to watch while spending some quality time with your Rooty Tooty Fresh n' Frooty.  He's made some impressive stuff though.  

We all know what IHOP is, and it's little niche in the world. We only go on the weekends, and normally it's on a Sunday.  When we lived in the area, we hit this place quite a bit.  Gotta say, of all the IHOPs we've been, this is one with the least \"church flow\".  Ya know how those breakfast places always get packed at about 11:30 to 12:30?  That's church flow.  This one - not so much.  Not sure if that's saying something in general about the area's lack of churchiness, or if it's just constantly full on a Sunday.  It could really go either way."}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times. I go back to give them a chance. This place is horrible and the service is worst. We ordered Strawberry Lemonade and we get no strawberries. We asked about it and the server said they ran out and did not cut anymore. Then we get the sprinkles pancakes without sprinkles. We asked and she said she didn't make them. The servers have no training and the place is dirty. The bathrooms are gross and will never go back."}
{"text":"Sophia was nice but unable to provide good service.  Breakfast took about 45 minutes to come out.  I also ordered a meal to take with me for lunch and all I got was excuses as to why it wasn't ready.  After eating or breakfast she seemed to have forgotten about my lunch order and said it would be another 10 to 15 minutes. That's why I told her my order in the beginning because I didn't have time to wait"}
{"text":"oy. Okay.... So I was DESPERATELY craving pancakes, and so I decided that I would give IHOP another shot... and I wish I hadn't.
I went to IHOP on Tuesday, unaware that apparently it was national pancake day. Still, I got right in, almost no wait at all... And that's where all positives come to a screeching halt. 
I ordered a splasher (strawberries, oj, and sprite) and I'm fairly certain more drink was on the outside of the glass than inside of it; it was impossibly sticky. I ordered the split decision breakfast, and asked for cheese on my eggs. When I (finally) got my food, the eggs were lukewarm and had some weird, congealed version of provolone cheese. I picked off the plastic-y goo and attempted to consume my breakfast. (The best part of which were the sausage links... at least they were warm). 
When I got my ticket, I saw that I had been upcharged $2.99 for getting provolone cheese. $2.99! So, with ticket in hand, I went to the counter and let the cashier know that I was never told of an upcharge and furthermore, I couldn't even eat the eggs. She said \"Oh, sorry\" and removed the charge. 
I am not sure why I keep trying to give this place another chance... I think it's time to give up on it."}
{"text":"I visited on Sunday morning and our meals took 35 minutes to arrive - a bit slow even for a busy day. Today, the restaurant was close to empty and our order still took 20 minutes to arrive. Plus the kitchen forgot one order of pancakes. These took an additional 15 minutes... The food is good once it arrives and the service is great. I think the problem is in the kitchen. If they can get it together this restaurant will be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Last week, on the way from the Airport to the Convention Center, me and my buddies decided it was time for some breakfast.   Fortunately, we came across this IHOP.   The place was pretty empty, I believe there were only two other parties there besides us.   The service was fast and friendly.   Our hostess / waitress (Shee was her name) was awesome.   The food was average for an IHOP.   You know what you will get.   As a bonus, this IHOP is close to the Pinball Hall of Fame.   
This is a good place for breakfast.   
Will I be back?   Yeah, maybe."}
{"text":"I signed up on their website to sample their Pancake Revolution to celebrate their \"world famous Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity® Pancakes\" for my birthday.  You get an anniversary e-mail from them inviting you to come in and taste their free stack of 4 pancakes with a fruit choice: peach, raspberry topping, glazed strawberry (any of these fruits topped with whipped cream, and you may add syrup), or a simple stack of plain pancakes (w/ butter & syrup).  You have a week after your birthdate to redeem and it's good all day.  Have a photo ID handy also.  I decided to go ahead and celebrate that idea since I was in the area.  I had been at this location in the past for their Free Pancake Day (Shrove Tuesday) special and figured I'd give the birthday treatment a try...
I called first to be sure whether it's legit, and since the e-mail specified that it must be printed out and not scanned or photographed, I asked them what if you don't have a printer, but I guess they would accept a phone scan or taking a picture with your camera and not 'photocopied'.  Something to that effect?  But, the person in charge of answering my questions confirmed, so it's totally free with no tax (beverages exempt, of course).  How generous.  I arrived yesterday around 8:30 AM because I was advised that it would get more busy after 9 AM.  No problem.  I picked a Saturday because weekdays in that area has students and downtown office workers galore, so it wasn't overly busy.  As I walked in the door, brrrr, it felt like the air conditioner was kicked up a notch.  The hostess graciously greeted me and escorted me to whatever table I'd like.  I told her that I was the one who called about the Pancake Revolution birthday special (value: $7.49 according to the menu).  I asked for the manager to be sure, and he came with the hostess and said he's familiar with the special and to just show whatever proof I have and that when I get the bill, to bring it to the checkout and they'd take  the charge off for me.  My waitress had full-on braces with dental bands so it was kind of hard to understand her trying to talk with all that stuff in her mouth.  I ordered the Rooty Tooty drizzled with glazed strawberry, and with just a glass of water.  I waited about 20 minutes because they were fairly busy.  When my dish arrived, it was drizzled in peach instead.  The hostess who actually served my dish to my table had to stop the waitress as she was holding my dish to tell her I ordered strawberry, and the waitress came back to my table carrying my dish to say something (again, her braces) that either they ran out of the strawberry or the special is for peach only.  Since it was free and I was suddenly curious how the peach would taste with the pancakes, and because I waited long enough for my dish, I told her it's fine.  I eat lots of strawberry but don't eat peach so I figured let's eat a different fruit for a change, right?
My meal was actually delish, especially with a little maple syrup added to the mix ;)  Buttermilk moist inside and crispy on the outside.  It was a generous portion for breakfast, and I was truly full afterwards.  I think my dish was actually ready to serve earlier than 15 minutes and was sitting under a heating lamp because the outside was hot and the inside center was very hot; if it was served immediately, the temperature would be even.  However, the waitress with those braces did not check up on me to see how my food was- probably preoccupied (there was an obese family sitting near me who ordered lots of food, lots of it).  It also appears fully staffed that morning.  It's a free (and generous) meal so I let it slide.  After all, it's more of a laid-back restaurant then a fast-food diner(where waitstaff usually moves faster).  I'd appreciate it, however, if a glass of water was served sooner than for me to ask for it, after I was seated.
Overall, the ambiance was casual, with music and people chatting loudly, that gave off a downtown feel- which I enjoy (and that is why I live near downtown!).  And, where you don't have to worry about so many manners and rules ;)  Thanks for the birthday gift this year :)"}
{"text":"Food was bleh.. small serving for a $10 plate.. assistant manager was rude when I paid.. I'll go back to never coming here again.."}
{"text":"Food is good. Our server was mediocre. He was waiting the whole (near empty) restaurant alone; but didn't seem to mind as he laughed with the other servers who sat in a booth. His name, I think is Ricardo; though I wouldn't know because he never introduced himself. Food came out fairly quickly even though the other table who came after me got their food first. He never left my glass empty; but everything else was poor customer service. He dropped my tab on the table before I was half way done eating! Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"waited at the table over an hour an a half to get 3 PANCAKES... wasnt the only one. People were leaving left and right, fed up with the service. they werent even busy. i mean i dont know what else to say... just completely flabbergasted.

YOU STAY CLASSY IHOP"}
{"text":"Usually its a late drunken night for my IHOP stops but this was a random weeknight where I wasnt content with the Del Taco options across the way. This location is poppin on Saturday mornings as well but this night it was very quiet around 1:30 a.m. Two servers maybe three or four tables had people. Kitchen crew was quick. I had my go to Denver omelette and asked for the orange chili sauce that comes with the chorizo omeletee on the side. This sauce/salsa was so much better than the generic salsa that comes with the Denver. Next time I may ask for them to make my hash browns more crispy but to each his own."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of chains, but sometimes they are necessary evils.  When I am in a foreign city or amongst unfamiliar surroundings they are a welcome sight for my hungry eyes.

If you staying in a hotel in this area (the only Strip hotels in the area are the aging Sahara and the Stratosphere) you can take a gamble and partake in the buffetts and other overpriced foods in these places or eat at IHOP.

I chose the latter.  Yeah I know, the food here isn't the greatest but its familiar.  I know what to expect.  

The Big Steak Omelette and three fluffy pancakes with a large glass of cranberry juice (consume as much antioxidants as you can my dear Yelper) is what I usually get when I dine here.  Usually this will fill my tummy and ward off any later day hunger pangs.

I usually come hungry, and always leave happy."}
{"text":"What can I say other than, it's an IHOP, just like any other IHOP.  IHOP should normally be enjoyed only at 2:00am, after a night of heavy drinking and serious partying.  However, I'll admit that I actually went on a Saturday late morning, after a group community service event.  IHOP is almost obligatory after that, right?"}
{"text":"We always enjoy going to breakfast as a family. IHOP always has great food, but the service this time was not the best. We were ready to order by the time our server greeted us, but as soon as she got our drink order she left. Once we ordered and received our food we never saw our server again. We were informed she was talking to the manager, but I was still missing part of my meal, drinks were not refilled and we never got our check. We decided to go to the front to ask for the check after waiting a while for it, paid it and left. Our server name was Mia."}
{"text":"I paid check at register with half on gift card and half on credit card, told the cashier of how much was on gift card to ring it exactly for what was on there....what does she do...swipe for the whole check...ummm...yeah not smart....it denies the gift card that's why I told you how much was on there. *Shake my head*"}
{"text":"This is definitely our family go to when the kids are wanting breakfast for dinner. Very close to home & always a fun time when meeting with family or friends for breakfast. Service has always been great."}
{"text":"This is a good IHOP. Servers are freindly and food is good. It's IHOP, not much to elaborate on here."}
{"text":"Good food, service is good. the server we had seemed to have been new she keep apologising for things but still did a good job. Food was hot and prices arnt bad."}
{"text":"I went there with my friend to get food around midnight. We waited around an hour to get our food because they are understaffed literally there was one waitress and a cook that's us and they had decent amount of customers. Very unhappy with the location and the management. Although the place is clean"}
{"text":"I haven't written a bad review, but I feel that this would really benefit future customers. This particular location is always so crowded, which contributes to the long wait for a table and their slow service. There is also an awful smell that fills the restaurant at least that is what I experienced when I was there. 

Anyway after a long wait, our server had finally noticed us and took our order. I had ordered the steak tips and a side of pancakes. It took a while for our food to come and after getting my food I realized that my pancakes were never delivered. I told another server because our server was not around. The lady said she was sorry and that it would be out, but still no pancakes. I had to tell someone else that I didn't receive my pancakes. That server forgot as well. After being halfway through my meal I just didn't want to bother having my pancakes anymore so I just asked them not to charge me for it. 

You would thing they would have given me a free meal or something but they just took off $3. It was such a disappointing experience. The food is good, but their customer service needs improvement."}
{"text":"The service is consistently poor, the food orders almost always are incorrect, we had to request utensils AFTER our food was delivered, and we also had to request our check at the front desk after waiting over 10 minutes for our server to reappear. You do not receive quality service or food to warrant dining here. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"The service  is super slow, and it wasn't  that full. the food is ok portions  are kinda small."}
{"text":"I've mostly come to this location later at night, typically from 10PM-1AM. The few times I've been in, the waitstaff have always been very friendly and attentive, and the food has been good as well.

The only reason I'm giving this location 4 stars is because the last time I was in, I ordered the Bacon and Blue Cheese Sirloin. My gut instinct was to get something with pancakes, like usual, but I saw the sirloin and couldn't stop myself.

I should've listened to my gut.

I ordered the sirloin medium-rare. What I got was definitely well into well-done territory. In their defense, these are fairly thin cuts, and even a small mistake could push it over, but regardless it was slightly frustrating. The blue cheese was very, very strong. I love blue cheese, but I ended up scraping it off. Imagine what blue cheese made in a lab might taste like, and you've got an idea. The garlic bread was great, and the potatoes were fairly good, but I've always liked their garlic bread anyway.

Overall, I'll still be coming here, but I'll probably stick to pancakes and omelettes in the future."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible! The staff is more concerned with talking and laughing then serving the customers. This is the worst IHOP I have ever been to. The server rolled her eyes when we were ordering as though it was too difficult to take our order."}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars. Shame on the manager who would run an establishment so inefficiently."}
{"text":"Poor service, tables and seats dirty."}
{"text":"I was staying in the hotel down the street and liked the food that I ordered for takeout. My orders were assembled fast and the employees were very friendly to this out of towner. I had other options to eat but this place was just right across the street. While waiting for my food I observed the other workers interacting with guests and even checking to see if I had been helped and hopefully not ignored. When I come back to town I might just stop in."}
{"text":"My food was good. Eggs-good. Sausage-good. Bacon-a little underdone. Cinnamon roll French toast-amazing. The service is a little slow for it not being busy. My two other friends enjoyed their food, only thing was that one of their toast was very burnt. Server was nice, her name was Natali."}
{"text":"Got here at 11:55 am and ordered our food ... group of 6  it's always busy here so we are used to being crammed ... they added a small table to a booth ! This didn't seem safe .. waited an hour for our food then they told us our soup was out . Love this place but it seems that the last couple of times we've been here the service gets worse .. notified the manager and she was kind enough to give us a 20% discount. PSA save your money unless u want to wait for ever to eat ... u better make sure you like the people your eating with because you'll run out of things to say before you can actually eat"}
{"text":"Had the Philly Chzsteak and Mushroom Swiss Burger.  The Philly was really good.  The burger was eh.  Their current promotion has all of their burgers being made of a meat/bacon mixture, and we really didn't like it that much.  The fries and onion rings were hot and fresh.  Service was alright.  Overall, a good IHOP experience.  This IHOP is NOT open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Worst service from the time we walked in. We wern't even acknowledged. Got worst at the end as well. The short fat waitress even was flirting with my boyfriend when he asked for more orange juice as he got upset that she try touching his check saying oh your so cute...i will get you a refill of orange juice. Then he  pulled away turns to me asking me why didnt i say something to her?? He got upset she disrespected me like that. Then he goes to mens bathroom after we ate and paid our bill and all alone with no supervision he notices a 3year old lil girl with 4-5yr old boy alone running around so he just walked right back out! Really??? Where are the parents!???"}
{"text":"how can you go wrong with IHOP?  the food is a wide variety and the prices are really good.  i know that pancakes cost pennies to make but still.  the caramel hot cocoa is absolutely too sweet and my kids couldn't even drink them- it was nasty.  great value"}
{"text":"go to place for consistent breakfast  no matter if stopping at 11pm our waiter was so attentive and never had to ask for more water or fresh coffee  truly refreshing. Our food came out and would randomly ask if everything was ok. we agree it has been way too long since we eat here. although no longer work in area. we stopped here after visiting dad in hospital and made an additional atop almost 3 weeks later and we're fortunate to have same great waiter!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent here. Got everything correct, checked back often, filled drinks at a good pace. And it was packed, but yet service was excellent. Manager even came by to check on us.  5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"Very pleasant atmosphere here with an older crowd that is refreshing to me.  Food was typical IHOP, nothing bad but nothing great either.  Prices were fair.  Service was better tha most places today.  Among the better IHOPS in Phoenix area I'd say."}
{"text":"Good weekday spot because it isn't crowded with younger folks looking for that late morning breakfast.  Food here is average as far as IHOPs go and frankly I'm looking for another location to be my go-to spot.  Scrambled eggs often browned on the bottom.  Pancakes undercooked.  Service is polite & attentive on my visits though, and the parking is generous."}
{"text":"We decided to go out for Xmas breakfast...
 It was busy, a lot of people were waiting for a table... They told us 20 minutes... 
They gave us a table at a less time than that.

The service was timely and courteous,
The food was good, the coffee was great!
The overall experience was great, even though it was filled to capacity with more people waiting for tables!

We had a joyful Xmas breakfast!
I am glad this IHOPE is in my neighborhood.
We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"IHOP IS IHOP. Nothing special to report here."}
{"text":"After a night partying in uptown Charlotte some sustenance was certainly required. This iHop was not only clean but our server was friendly and hooked me up by charging me for a senior meal, which thankfully I am ages away from! The food was fresh but my bacon was certainly not as crispy as I asked for it to be. Overall the food was good and the friendly service for sure made it better. If I stayed over on that side of town again I would certainly return to this location."}
{"text":"service from nay was awesome :)

the only down side was it took us a while to get our food, but dispite that the food was pretty good. there apps are better than a majority of places.
and knowing that this location is 24 hours well be back"}
{"text":"So the area around this IHOP is a little shady and full of meth zombies and losers, that being said there's no real reason to venture down there anyways. And there's usually some bum or drug addict standing around asking you for change when you leave the restaurant too. However the food and service are great. Especially the SIMPLE & FIT Blueberry Harvest Grain 'N Nut® Combo"}
{"text":"I am not going to write a flowery review about IHOP, you know what you're getting...it's friggin' IHOP.

But, I will say it's always going to hit the spot when you need some golden buttery hash browns and light, tangy crepes at 3am (or 8am, for that matter)."}
{"text":"This place has ok service. My food sucked. My Brothers food sucked. My moms food sucked. But sister said hers was good. My Dads food sucked. It was bad. There was kid drawings with crayon on the walls."}
{"text":"After being seated, I had to wait for quite a long time before a waiter showed up at my table, who hurriedly took my drink order and quickly rushed away after dropping off the drink, before I could place the food order. Felt like 20 minutes before I actually got to order the food, a stack of pancakes with raspberries and peaches on top. The pancakes were quite...\"heavy\". The kind that makes you feel more bloated with every bite. They were honestly not very good, but were made edible by the fruit toppings. At times the restaurant felt frigidly cold, and I didn't sit in the immediate vicinity of A/C. Towards the end, the otherwise absent waiter came back a couple of times to check on my table, which improved the perception a slight bit. 

If you're craving pancakes, there aren't many alternatives around, but if you're on the fence about where to go eat, I'd suggest somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very good customer service.  Food was fast and just on time. Upon arrival wait time was 25 min. But only waited 15 min. Everyone was really friendly and Nicole S was very attentive to our table and every other table she was attending."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating at IHOP, first time at this location and it's great that they are open 24 hours - that sign is what caught our eye as we were leaving the Cinemark movie theater across the highway.  They have the standard fare for this style of restaurant but what I like about IHOP is their expanded breakfast selections.  There is a lot to choose from from the usual eggs, bacon/sausage, hash browns, and toast to a variety of omelets, their famous selection of pancakes, and both sweet and savory crepe options - most of which can be combined into some kind of combo meal at a reasonable price.  They also offer a selection of burgers and sandwiches, a handful of entrees, and some appetizer fare so overall it's a well-rounded menu.  I ordered the California Scramble with hash browns and 2 blueberry pancakes.  The eggs come scrambled with melted jack cheese topped with sliced avocado and salsa - you have the option of smashed red potatoes and onions or hash browns and also the choice of tortilla, toast or two buttermilk pancakes for under $10 which is a great deal.  My boyfriend got the breakfast sampler which is two eggs, 2 slices of bacon, 2 pork sausage links, 2 pieces of ham, hash browns, toast, and 2 pancakes also for around $10.  Another nice feature is that you can \"upgrade\" your pancakes from regular buttermilk to any other flavor of pancake for a small upcharge, which we both did and our meal still came to under $25 with tax, so not a bad deal for dinner out.

The service was a mix but mostly because it seemed that there were only 2 people working the floor while we were there, but we went after seeing a movie so we got there around 9:30 PM on a Thursday, which I'm sure isn't typically a busy time, hence only 2 people on shift in the dining room.  Our server was really nice, but she was covering a lot of tables and our table didn't have regular syrup, which we had to ask for and the toast didn't come with my boyfriend's order, so we had to ask for that as well.  I don't fault her, I just think that they were understaffed.  The floors needed to be swept/vacuumed but again, while they weren't overwhelmingly busy there were only 2 people working.

Overall it was a decent experience, and I might go back the next time I'm in the area and craving breakfast late night."}
{"text":"When you walk out with a pancake in each hand, you know you probably had a good meal. As I get older, I'm not as price conscious and typically like to go to places on the nicer side. Today, my wife decided we needed pancakes from IHOP, so we gave it try. The food was surprisingly good. The place was very busy though, and seems a little chaotic. That said, our waiter was very nice and attentive, our service was prompt, our food arrived quickly. And it was pretty good. We mostly got the basics, Pancakes, scrambled eggs, bacon, hashbrowns. My one daughter, who always wants something out of the ordinary, got Cremes with Strawberries. Since ate them all, so was pretty tasty. So, they do have other options besides the standard pancake. Time for the bill...it was very reasonable. I rate them A-OK mainly on the atmosphere, like I said, a bit chaotic, lots of people, moving fast, etc. That isn't necessarily a bad thing when you have a cranky 2 year old granddaughter to feed. Back to the pancake in each hand, that was my granddaughter. As we exited the restaurant I noticed she had a silver dollar pancake in each hand, and I thought, well...it can't be a bad place when you're little girl liked it that much!"}
{"text":"Had a great time. Food was yummy (try the eggnogg pancakes) and our service was awesome. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Christmas morning after opening present no one felt like cooking. So thankfully ole trusty IHOP was open. We thought it was going to be a crazy wait, luckily it was only about 10 min. The Waitress was so friendly and nice. I know it couldn't be the best to have to work Christmas morning but she was cheerful. We ordered our drinks and I chose the Denver Omlette with chicken fried steak.. Yeah, this morning I said screw watching my diet. I chowed down and killed it all! My daughter got the Crepes which she loved and my wife got pancakes. The food and the service was pretty damn good. We got our food fast and didn't have to wait for refills. We were honestly expecting decent - horrible service just because of the day. Luckily, we got taken care of and took care of our amazing waitress in return! When the local small favorite breakfast joints are closed and you need something that wont let you down give this place a shot."}
{"text":"I don't even know why we keep giving this IHOP location a \"chance.\" We just literally walked of the place after standing in the front for a while and waiting for someone to seat us. It's probably understandable if it was busy and the place was packed but the it didn't looked that busy at all. It's 11 PM on a Friday night and nobody was checking the front for people coming in. If you're having a craving for IHOP I strongly advice a different location with better service."}
{"text":"Most I ihops I get dragged along to look sketchy as hell and kind of give off that dirty murder scene look in a movie. This Ihop was super nice and clean. Lots of natural light and the staff were really nice. 

I ordered the crispy chicken salad and it was delicious! The plate was bigger than my face and my hunger was definitely satisfied. My drinks were refilled attentively and I didn't even have to ask for another glass or anything. 

I recommend not going during the rush hour on weekends, usually around brunch time though. It gets crowded and hectic inside. Loads of people and kids. I like going in the afternoons to mid afternoons. The booths by the windows are open and it's nice to look out. Overall a pleasant experience dining here."}
{"text":"We came here on 4/2/16

First off, the parking lot is terrible! Such a bad inconvenient place to get to.  As for the service, it was one of the worst experiences I have ever had!  Took well over 30mins to get 3 waters and 1 coffee.  Food was decent, but after waiting nearly an hour, anything would've been great.  2 of the orders were wrong, the other 2 were correct...so, 50% of the time, they were right.  With plenty of other options around the area, I would suggestion going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Is the second and last time that I will come to this IHOP location, the service was good but the food sucks. I got two pieces of bacon that look that they have been refried several times, it was totally disgusting."}
{"text":"We usually get decent service at this place, today totally different, dirty coffee mugs, wrong orders and missing items on the orders. Hopefully they read this review and get their stuff in order for next time.  Again another one Of those days that no one seems to know what they doing, ask for my hash browns to be extra crispy, nothing complicated just let them cook little longer on the grill so they are not soggy on the inside . Apparently the cooks don't  know what the hell they doing. He shredded the hash brown and cook them in grease, seriously !!!"}
{"text":"Not worthy. Eggs over cooked, burnt, cold. Bacon undercooked, cold. Pancakes cold. Hash browns cold, sausage cold. Sad for a breakfast restaurant. Never again. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Late breakfast, Thursday.
Seated and served promptly.
Orders taken, efficiently.
Had sampler breakfast. Ordered eggs over medium, they arrived with whites liquid and runny. Mgr. came by, took care of it, new eggs okay. Ordered second helping of pancakes on Ayce special, no problem.
Service attentive, food okay, value okay.
They were reasonably busy, but took care of us.
Not a destination restaurant, but acceptable."}
{"text":"I am a serious breakfast addict and I can always count on this IHOP to get my pancake/French toast fix. Pancakes are always perfect, hash browns are delicious. I work at another popular breakfast joint and I come here instead of where I work because I love this ihop so much!"}
{"text":"I will not do dinner here ever again. They do great breakfast. Tonight the food was not up to par. Potatoes were cold, chicken fried steak was lukewarm, onion rings were almost cold, when I received my salad I ordered blue cheese and it came with tartar sauce instead. Come to find out they did not have any blue cheese someone labeled the container wrong. Server never came back to fill out drinks. We were informed that they were shortstaffed but that was no excuse for the lack of service we had tonight."}
{"text":"I used to go here at least once a month...until recently. That is, when I found a hair at the bottom of my eggs. It was a short, dark hair, most likely a beard hair. I can only pray it wasn't a pube. The waitress, Barb, was very apologetic and didn't charge me a dime. 

btw, Barb waited on me almost every time I came in here and she has a mustache. So I don't know if it was one of her stache hairs, or what. Either way, the management should have a meeting for the staff there on personal grooming. Seeing her stache always made me sick. Barb also seems to have a cheese fetish. She always asked me if I wanted cheese on everything; my eggs, my hash browns, etc. She was the ONLY waitress to ever ask me this every time I came there. I'm surprised she never asked me if I wanted cheese in my water :0) I wish she had asked me if I wanted hair in my eggs because I would have said no.

The very last time I visited this location, the waitress I got was rude. The only thing she did was take our order. She didn't come back and ask how the food was, offer refills...she wasn't even the one that served us the food. I had one interaction with her and that was to place the order. It then took forever to get the bill, and she of all people had to ring us up because there was no one manning the register. I didn't even want to tip her, but she rung me up so I was forced to. She was totally curt and unfriendly.

What a dump. Next time I'll go to Denny's. Although also a dump, at least their staff doesn't have staches and are only half as bitchy."}
{"text":"Patrick was our waiter tonight, and he did a fantastic job. It was at 00:24 when we walked in. To be honest, I thought we were not going to get a great service since it was very late and could imagine our waiter could be tired; however, Patrick approached to the table nicely and with a lot of energy, and he gave us many different options to drink a to eat. I will come back soon for sure for such a great service."}
{"text":"Went back after the owner contacted me and asked me to give them another chance. Ordered the country omelet again and am happy to report ham sightings! Egg was waaaay overdone, however. Pancakes had better flavor than last time but still rock hard butter."}
{"text":"This IHOP isn't great, but then again, I don't think any of them are, lol. It's busy, loud, chaotic, food coming out at random times, inconsistency, etc. The servers are nice, but flustered. When my husband and I went the first time they \"broke\" my hearty grain and nut pancake, so I had to wait for another one. In the meantime my husband received and ate his entire meal before mine came out. (Idk why it takes 15 mins to remake a pancake.) Anyway, the next time we went it was better. So I'm giving it 3 stars. Not great, but not the worst IHOP I've ever been to."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with IHOP. We went on Christmas Day for breakfast and it was packed! But even for being so extremely busy the device was very good! Even pretty fast. And our waitress was very kind."}
{"text":"When we went, it was a Tuesday morning around 830am there were only two tables seated that I could see. Our server Antonio was very nice and attentive. I saw no issues other than they completely ran out of kids menus. Didn't bother me! We ordered fairly quickly and our food arrived about 10-15mins after we ordered. I'd definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I've been to this IHOP a couple times, usually on Sundays... sometimes we beat the Sunday \"church\" crowd, and sometimes we get stuck in it.  

Overall, this IHOP puts out decent food, my only complaint is the wait times and sometimes the service due to it being slammed.  I'm sure if we attempt to go anytime other than a Sunday, my service experience would be a lot better.

This past time I went with a friend and we waited about 15min for a table... when we were escorted to our table, the table was meant for 4 people and then there was no chair on the other side.  That that I didn't want to get cozy with my buddy, but it may look weird if two guys were sitting side-by-side at a table meant for 4 people!  When we asked for a chair, the hostess looked at us with a puzzled look, but then obliged and pulled the chair from the adjacent table.  It took a while for our food to come out, but you can see the kitchen was slammed....  the food lasted about 5 seconds as I inhaled it into my mouth."}
{"text":"It took 15 minutes to be seated and after an additional 15 minutes of sitting at the table, I wasn't even acknowledged by a server, so I walked out.

There were only 4 other people seated in the restaurant so I couldn't understand the delays.

It's obvious they don't need my money so I took it elsewhere."}
{"text":"My waitress was amazing!!!! My service dog and I walked in at 10:30pm to a crowded restaurant. We were immediately seated where I requested. Everyone was polite, kind, and welcoming. My food took a while to come, but they made up for it with extra cocoa and bacon. (My sweet waitress said to give it to my dog, but we waited til home) On my waitress's recommendation I tried the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes. She brought out hot, fresh maple syrup, and I can say I ate EVERY bite. I hope Heaven has an IHOP with endless (calorie-free) pumpkin cheesecake pancakes. 

Going back for more soon. 

Oh, and the manager stopped by our table and made us feel welcome too!

A great experience!"}
{"text":"Out of pure convenience would I ever eat at a chain restaurant for breakfast but for that factor alone IHOP will suffice. Nothing seems to have an overly personal touch, however like some have quoted before its pretty quick great hangover food."}
{"text":"IHOP is IHOP....however, for starters, this one is not very clean at all. Also the service is far from stellar and
Breakfast prices are getting out of control. It's unfortunate that this franchise is getting as bad as McDonald's."}
{"text":"I think this is the best Ihop I've ever been to. Best pancakes I've had in a very long time. I'm extremely picky about my pancakes. Theirs are huge and fluffy. I give it 4.5 stars. Portions are huge. Waitstaff is very friendly and efficient.  What else do you need in a chain breakfast place?"}
{"text":"Immediately I did not feel welcome. The hostess seemed inconvenienced by seating me. She then proceeded to sit me in the children's area. Kids were screaming the entire time. I asked for a pitcher of water. Never got it. The food was mediocre at best. This experience was terrible."}
{"text":"We came in with the family, the waitress was very confused on our order to begin with.  She wrote everything down read it back, everything was good.  We had an extremely long wait to get our food, then when it came out the order was completely wrong, missing items, and food is cooked burnt.  We did not enjoy our dinner, which is a bummer because we used to love IHOP."}
{"text":"We were on our way to the airport and decided to stop here believing it would be quick and easy. We were entirely wrong. Our waitress took our drink orders and came back with them and no straws. She took our food order and promised to return with straws. 45 minutes later we still had no straws and hadn't seen our waitress again. People were arriving, eating, and leaving while we still waited. We finally left without ever receiving food or straws or even an apology."}
{"text":"I come here and the waitress Olivia A. always takes good care of us every time we have breakfast or lunch at this location."}
{"text":"This IHop is actually fairly decent and I don't see why it gets so many negative reviews. My wife and I came here one Sunday and it was jam packed full and the wait was about 10-15 minutes. Anyways, we waited and were seated promptly. It is a little bit small in terms of space, but overall the service and food were excellent. The manager even came by to chat with us on how the food was and we also explained to him that it was great and everything was going well. There must be quite a few people who come here often simply because there were numerous tables who were excited to see our waitress and chatted with her."}
{"text":"First time at this location, we were seated right away and it was a full house! Our waitress was attentive and friendly. Our food came out really fast and hot. Ordered the chicken and waffles, the waffles were perfect light and fluffy. I'd come back to this location. From observing the other wait staff and bussers they are all Fast and work together to make sure tables are cleaned quickly so the tables are ready for the guests."}
{"text":"This is my go-to ihop. They're always on point (whenever I go at least) and get my orders right. I know ihop is a chain, but you can never go wrong with the pancakes or waffles! They're great :) AYCE pancakes are also a grand deal!"}
{"text":"The waitress was very nice but she was alone running around trying to cover everything. Ordered a ceasar salad but they do not carry it. So I ordered a house salad which came without croutons. I asked for some but it is not something they carry, how can you not carry croutons at all? IHOP is a BYOC (bring your own croutons) type of place. Is this America we are living in? Get croutons back on the menu or the terrorists win!"}
{"text":"This has been by far one of the best IHOP I've ever been to. Sadly i don't live nearby but... 

Came on a busy Sunday morning & even though the waiting crowd seemed large, the staff was efficient in getting everyone in & out fast. 

The food came surprisingly fast &a the quality was great. Service was great as well... everything went smoothly."}
{"text":"Hair throughout my meal!! Unacceptable! Asking them for a refund as I write this review"}
{"text":"The food at the Westin wasn't all that great and my son and I decided to go for a drive to get breakfast.  Ihop seemed like a sure bet and we stopped by to grab some eggs and pancakes.  Service was fast and friendly.  I was hoping for a booth but we got seated at a table.  I guess that makes sense since it was just the two of us.  No biggie.  Coffee was served promptly and that immediately changed my morning from blah to YAY!!! I don't function without coffee.  My veggie, egg white omelet came out fast and so did my son's mini pancakes.  I was not pleased with their wheat pancakes though... there was something fishy about them.  They weren't spongy at all and they would crumble apart!  :(  I'd give 5 starts to service but 4 to the cooks... I hate it when they mess up my food."}
{"text":"Great study place at night. The hostess that worked tonight was one of the sweetest people ever."}
{"text":"To the \"Manager\" running this location, 
First and foremost I am a current manager with 5 yrs experience both in fast food, and customer service so I'm pretty sure I know how a restaurant/ business should be managed. Walking in to this location we were greeted and said there was a 10 min wait , we agreed to wait and quickly noticed the frustration on all of the other guest faces. 35 Mins go by before we were seated. Starving and tired we waited 10 mins for our waitress to even acknowledge our table. When she finally arrived we all quickly said we wanted coffee 10 mins go by until our coffee arrived we prompted to order as we didn't want to be there any minute longer.
As we started looking around we realized that there was still a huge waiting line in front meanwhile there was about 10 open seats right where we were seated. Most of the guests that were seated befor us still hadn't received their food.
The waitress was visibly frustrated, we heard her yelling eveytime she stepped foot to the back of the house. This is where my \"manager mode\" came on. There was 4 hostesses walking around doing absolutely nothing while their coworkers are all very frustrated, no one ever offered any help what so ever. 45 mins go by until we FINALLY received or
 food, my pancakes were cold my bacon tasted like really old oil ,I'm talking about days old I could taste it. 
The \"Manager\" not once walked in to the kitchen to see why everyone's food was taking so long , never offered help or assistance to anyone, never even stepped near to were we were seated. Needless to say he was no were to be found when I asked to speak with him.
HE WAS OBVIOUSLY not doing his job. I really wish I could give this no stars on this rating. I can honestly say this was one of the worst experience I've ever had EVER, ANYWHERE.  Never again."}
{"text":"I went here this morning with my friend.
My visit was unsatisfactory.
My food was hardly warm when served.
I had ordered a crepe griddle combo and water.
I asked the waitress if I could substitute the meat for some fruit bc I'm vegetarian and bc I have done so here before without issue. She told me I could not, that you can only substitute a meat for a meat. So my friend ordered her food with the fruit as her side and I was just going to give her the meat. Somehow We still ended up getting charged more. We spent over $20 just on food
And I left still hungry.
I won't be visiting IHOP again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm beginning to come in during early morning hours (6am) and the food and service I've been getting has been excellent!! Although all I order is two scrambled eggs and four sausage links with a small glass of milk. I haven't tried anything huge off their menu to say how good their large menu items tastes. I will soon that's for sure. My waitress is very pleasant and I admire her hardwork cleaning tables and making sure everything is where it needs to be before the breakfast rush, and while making sure I'm good. So far, so good!!"}
{"text":"Worst ihop ever. Took forever to get seated in an almost empty building. Then our waitress Daphne had a bug up her butt from the get go. Avoid!!! Food wasn't good either."}
{"text":"Late night was busy for one server who was also greeter/seater and cashier; good
and quite other wise.  Slow having order taken and for refills, but food oder came out right and tasty.  

The menu changes regularly and seasonal pancakes make it entertaining for our high schoolers. How did I ever grow up without a salted caramel or red velvet pancakes?

We will be back, maybe no at midnight"}
{"text":"Very good food, excellent service today as usual.  Liked this months turkey dinner and chocolate pancakes.  Only thing missing is Christmas Music?  What is up with this?  Our third time since thanksgiving?"}
{"text":"here on a Tuesday for brunch.. got seated quickly, was greeted upon arriving.. food was delicious and fast getting to our table.. blueberry pancakes & i asked for my hash browns well done & was actually given exactly what i asked for.. the only down side was the iced tea.. it just didn't taste fresh.. the double BLT was great as well.. will return.. dinner specials 2pm- 10 pm daily.. & 24 hours daily.!!"}
{"text":"Do not come to this ihop. The food is good but the service is extremely terrible. From start to finish. My boyfriend and I walked in and usually we are greeted by someone, but instead we walk into seeing 5 servers all crammed at one register trying to figure out what is going on, and as my boyfriend and I still stand there waiting to be seated (or at least acknowledged) someone finally says \"can someone seat these people before we get yelled at\"...... it took 10-15 min for any server to realize that we had been seated. Our server was actually nice and attentive once she realized we were sat in her section. After we finish eating our server brings us our bill and as we go upfront ready to pay our bill, waiting for someone to cash us out since no one was up at the front at this point, another server comes up and starts cashing someone else out?????? As I stand there looking at her with my bill in my hand, still staring at her ugly eyebrows, finally she acknowledges me and asks me who my server was and called my server over to cash us out. Needless to say the staff here does not know what they're doing and have no respect nor manners. Simple courtesy goes a long way. None of that was found here. Do not waste your money here."}
{"text":"After picking up our granddaughter from daycare we thought we would take her out from some brinner (breakfast for dinner).  We were seated right away and they were speedy with the high chair for the one year old.  The coffee I got was delicious and very fresh.  I got the fruit and cream waffle which was very good and fresh.  The hubby got the usual sampler with plenty of pancakes, pork products and eggs.  He was happy.  I got the granddaughter a scrambled egg and a pancake.  She enjoyed eating and from her vantage point she could see into the kitchen so she spent a lot of time waving to the line cooks and taking, smiling and basically flirting with the cook staff.  The waitress was terrific and very understanding of the unholy mess that only a one year old can create."}
{"text":"It is the International House of Pancakes.  They got the basic breakfast and coffee shop fare.  The new one has some bad service.  I like the harvest nut pancakes.   They are adequate"}
{"text":"I used to think IHOP was alright back in the day, but lately they have really gone downhill. There are only a few things I would order from their menu, but definitely prefer Denny's all the way! I used to like their Chicken and Waffles until they started to over cook the chicken to the point where it was hard to cut or bite into. Sometimes they also forget to give you butter for the waffles. The one thing that really grossed me out is their syrup containers. They are messy, sticky and it doesn't seem like they ever take the time to clean them. One time the regular maple syrup tasted like the strawberry syrup was also mixed into it, ewww! They are so gross that I started to ask for sugar-free syrup, which they will bring to you in a separate plastic bottle. It's a healthier choice as well so no complaints there. Also, they need to do a better job cleaning up the tables. Food on the ground and on the chairs, and the tables were sticky for the next customers, ugh!!

Service is a hit or miss. If they are busy, it will be a while before they seat you, take your order, check on you and refill drinks. I also dislike how they no longer have a cashier in the front anymore. You now have to wait for your server to take the payment for your bill, which sometimes takes forever. Another thing I saw in the past was that a manager just stood on the floor with his arms crossed watching his employees closely and telling them what to do. He did this the entire time I was there. I mean, don't get me wrong, I am sure its not easy being a manager for an IHOP. I understand that he needs to make sure his employees are doing their job, but maybe instead of just standing there looking pissed off all day, do some work too and set an example for your team? 

Not recommended. There are so many other good places to eat in this area alone."}
{"text":"I give 5 stars to Cristian!! We have been going here weekly for a few months. She is so kind and caring of her customers. Goes above and beyond for all. Such a hard worker, seats incoming people, takes orders and waits on her tables, busses her own tables and also has to check out customers. She does all this with no complaining and a big smile on her face. I believe it is too much for one person but she is outstanding. If there is ever a problem with our order it is simply the cooks issue with the preparation of the food. I will continue to go for the awesome services!!!"}
{"text":"Came in here waiting Pan cakes but saw the cowboy bbq burger and it looked good so I order that instead just minus the lettuce and tomato. It took a while to bring mine and my husbands burgers and he got just a plain ol cheese burger but it's fine whatever. When the hostess/ food runner brought out my burger it was the saddest burger I've ever seen. So the menu says it comes with two onion rings, crispy bacon and bbq sauce.. it came with no bacon, one onion ring and like two dots of bbq sauce. I asked the hostess/food runner for more bbq sauce and she literally rolled her eyes and went uhg. The server brought over my bbq sauce and that's when I told her what my burger was missing. And she is the reason I'm not giving it 1 star because she was so nice about it. Her name is Prashawn and the way she handled it and how fast she was to fix it made me feel better about the situation... the hostess/ food runner at 2 o'clock on Sunday Feb 18th was very rude. But prashawn was really sweet. My burger still sucked tho. It was cold by the time I ate it and was over cooked. And I got like 5 fries. But the water was good. It was very cold and didn't taste like tap so that's good I guess."}
{"text":"I was craving WAFFLES! Let's just say that when your tummy tells you, it wants something, give in. It'll save you countless calories eating other food and then having to get Waffles too. 

This breakfast hub is perfect for those days when you want a cup of joe and the typical American breakfast. I had waffles with ham and hashbrowns. Yums! The server was nice and helpful. The place is clean... what more can you ask for??"}
{"text":"For breakfast this place is great. It isn't in the best area and isn't the cleanest place but not all places can be 5 star quality. The staff was very friendly and overworked. The worst part about here was the other people. They were very rude. I feel sorry for the staff that has to deal with them."}
{"text":"We live close by and go here a few times a month. The staff is always friendly and the food is always good. I hardly think ordering one thing and having it not turn out how you expect deserves rating only one star. My order has never been wrong and I tend to ask for alternative stuff:)"}
{"text":"I personally wouldn't even give them one star, but I have no choice. We've come here a few times and the service was ok and the food was average. Today we went in and I put my name in the list and let them know we would need a highchair. We waited the 15 minutes to be seated and then were \"seated\" by a waitress. At the same time she was seating us another \"host\" stepped in front of us and sat someone else there. She pointed us to another table and said she'd get a highchair. My husband stood there with our son for 5 minutes as she walked around helping others while seeing my husband standing there with our now crying 1 yr old. She didn't even bother to say she had someone else bringing it. Then finally a waiter came over and said \"sorry we have no highchairs\" and walked away. We got up and left and when my husband talked to the manager he pretty much got the sorry, sucks to be you, but come back again."}
{"text":"Burnt out IHOP. Food is ok but I'm drunk so my standards are all over at the moment. I would skip this joint and hit McDonalds if I could rewind time 15 mins. Meh"}
{"text":"Stopped here while out with my son.  Thought we could have a relaxing AND cheap brunch.  It really wasn't that busy when we came in around during an off time.  The waiter was a friendly nice guy.  But it was taking forever to get the food and my son was cranky and needed his nap.  So I told the waiter to get it to go.  Ended up being way more $$ than expected.  The food was tasty but didn't get enough to match the price.  I will stick to Dennys if craving a good diner food.  I think their prices are way better.  Would only come back during a special or if the kids meal was free."}
{"text":"Service was super slow! Table that came 5 minutes after us, received their order first. My order was wrong. Hardly any vegan friendly options, just sides really. Sides are priced WAY higher than they should be, for what you get."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with the family, waited too long for mediocre food that was warm and greasy.....very disappointed"}
{"text":"My daughter just returned from a year in Japan and was craving a traditional American breakfast so we went to IHOP at about 7pm. She ordered the combo waffle breakfast, the wife ordered pancakes with a side of bacon. I ordered the bacon and eggs with crispy hash browns. While waiting I noticed numerous tables not cleaned even though there were many bussers and maybe a handful of customers. Large glob of, I think, ice cream on the floor near the kitchen and instead of cleaning it, the waiters, bussers and cook were stepping around it. The mop bucket was right next to it. After about a 15-20min wait we began to receive our meals. Our meals came one at a time. First they brought the bacon on separate plates, 5 min later they brought the waffle, pancakes and my eggs, then after I waited another 5 min for my hash browns. The waitress apologized for the delay for my hash browns and said it was because I asked for extra crispy. 
Wow...the entire table was covered with plates so we just combined the food onto three different plates and got rid of the other plates. Weird!"}
{"text":"Nice and laid back atmosphere with friendly waiter service as well as awesome breakfast selections on the menu!"}
{"text":"I usually like ihop but after last night i will never go back to this location again. When my girlfriend and i walked in about 1040pm there were several couples/groups that i noticed weren't eating and i thought nothing of it. After taking our order from their much smaller menu (none of the dinner items were left. Mainly breakfast items) the minutes started rolling by.   1 couple and an older man sitting by himself (both of which were there before we arrived) finally recieved their order about 25 minutes later. Around 1115pm over 30 minutes go by and i stop the waitress and ask her if our food was started if not we have to leave. As i ask this 1 couple (another that was there before us) gets up and leaves without receiving their food. The waitress being embarrassed and annoyed at the situation I'm sure tells us that he is about to start our order so my girlfriend and i leave. 

The food I'm sure is the same as every other ihop but the cook needs to get his act together. I'll save my ihop visits when I'm  out of town and it's the only option other than denny's"}
{"text":"Nothing different from any of the other IHOP's I've been to. The wait was average, the food was the same, and the customer service was good. 

Again. Nothing different from any IHOP."}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH. The manager at this location went above and beyond to make us happy. Prior to coming to IHOP I called to make sure they had milkshakes. When we got there, we discovered that they didn't actually have milkshakes. We still ordered food and didn't make a fuss, but the manager overheard our request and special made milkshakes for us. I am truly grateful for the kind staff here and their lovely manager."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, your typical chain restaurant. Service was good and the food came out fairly quick. I would go back to this IHOP again."}
{"text":"i had been wanting to write an update of I-hop for a little while and last nights abysmal visit was the motivation I needed to do so. Perhaps I do not understand the concept. Are they a self serve restaurant? Literally, I actually got angry eating here last night. I never do that nor like to give such a low review. Especially to a place that supports educators and nonprofits. 

There were 4 servers working last night and only three tables were filled when I entered and no hostess. Off to a bad start. The wait on a dead night should be less than a minute. Then ( it was a night of thens) the server took too long to get to me after I was seated. The Entree came before my salad ( why?)  and not once did anyone stop by to ask me how I was doing. Another thing they do here, that I just do not understand, is that they do not clear dishes or refill glasses away. I have noticed this on several visits even at out of state I-Hops and it perplexes. me. There is no excuse for leaving dirty dishes on a table in front of a customer for 45 minutes 

The part that made me upset was my server totally disappeared for 45 minutes. I am not exaggerating either. It time stamped at 45 minutes and I never saw him once on the floor. When he finally came out he walked  to the hostess stand and started talking to a lady who had just walked in. He then talked to her for even 10 more minutes without helping nor sending anyone else over to my table. Do you think he would have asked the other servers to check on me, get me a refill, or give me my check? Nope! I had to ask for a togo box from another server who also walked by my table about ten times and never even asked me a thing. (Not my table type of thing.)  And then when he finally came over he acted like it was no big deal. He totally forgot our earlier extensive conversation on a  dessert order and did not even apologize for making me wait 45 minutes to leave. I left without a further food purchase just to get out of there.  

Even stranger he was a super nice person. I had no issue there with any of the staff. They are all very friendly. He really had no idea that he owed me an apology or that I was waiting that long. 

This is not the first time this has happened. I am not sure I understand how they run this restaurant. Do they have a different philosophy on table service maybe that I am unfamiliar with? With all the new and hot breakfast places out there these days how do they stay open? They are not that cheap nor high quality on the food chain. Sad to say, I am not coming back here again."}
{"text":"First I must say we have boycotted IHOP for the last 3 years for an incident that happened at another location that I will leave unsaid, let's just say in the end it was a Christmas Miracle.

So, it was my MIL birthday and we couldn't decide if we wanted breakfast or lunch. It was either IHOP or the Denny's down the street. IHOP won.

Arrived at about 9:15 on a Thursday morning. Place was busy but not crowded.  Manager sat us right away and the waitress was there within a few minutes. Took our drink order and left us to look over the menu. Breakfast looked enticing with a greater selection of choices than lunch but both of us choose from the lunch menu.

Food arrived about 10 minutes, 15 tops after placing our order. MIL had a bacon cheeseburger. Nothing Special, was just an average burger with average fries but the patty was juicy and she ate it all. I had the roast turkey sandwich and I wanted the soup of the day as my side but the waitress didn't know what it was. She said I know we have soup but to be honest I don't get many requests for it this early. She asked if I wanted her to check but I ordered fries instead making her come back.  When my sandwich came I was surprised it had actual thick sliced roasted turkey breast instead of processed lunch meat. Sandwich was actually really good. Lettuce and tomato crisp. Bacon cooked nicely and bread soft with just a shmear of mayo. Would totally order again.

Service was well above average. Waitress came to the table multiple times to see if everything was ok and to see if we needed drink refills. Manager stopped back by to see if service was good.

From the looks of it most of the customers were regulars being greeted on a first name basis.

Glad I gave this IHOP a shot. Service was great and food was better than I expected."}
{"text":"Met a ex-coworker for breakfast on a Tuesday morning about 8:30. Restaurant wasn't too busy and we were greeted right away. Sat way in the back in a booth. Took the waitress a little while to approach us. An older couple was seated behind us shortly after arriving. 

Waitress finally came and took drink orders, they were brought right away. She then proceeded to take the order of the couple behind us before she took ours. Ok, we weren't in a hurry so I'm going to let that one slide. She was pleasant and personable.

Took our order and another server brought our food out in about 10 minutes. I ordered the limited time Apple pancakes combo. Eggs were supposed to be over easy and were a smidge over cooked for me but they were ok, yolk was still a little runny. Pancakes cooked perfectly.  Breakfast companions omelette spot on.

Food was good and arrived fairly quickly. Service was...meh! Like I said before she was very, very nice just not on top of things for how busy they were. I estimate she was waiting on only 2 other tables besides ours. It took forever for our check after we were done eating. She did bring me a refill on my drink before it ran dry. 

This as just a average experience but for the time of day and the volume of customers if service would have been more attentive I would have given a higher star rating.

Will I go back? Probably. Food was good and my pancake, egg and hash brown combo was only $5.99, a bargain at most chain restaurants. Used the ladies room on the way out and it was clean and well stocked."}
{"text":"Our grandsons requested pancakes. So instead of fixing it here we won't to IHOP. Both got exactly what hey wanted and ate well. This was a good choice for the boys and we did not make a mess at home. 
Everyone was nice, helpful and courteous. Place was clean. My m al was fine but more expensive than my regular breakfast spot. 
We will surely visit again."}
{"text":"They did a great job accommodating our party of 12. Our server really toughed it out and was the backbone of our experience. I was disappointed that an additional server was not assigned to help him Nd instead he was stuck running back and forth to the kitchen to carry out 3 trays of drinks and 4 trays of food. Meanwhile the manager was \"busy\" helping a girl serve her 2 tables of 4. Like I said, our guy was a trooper and just kept smiling."}
{"text":"Kara our server was amazing. She was quick to grab our order regardless of how BUSY they were. She was on top of it; she asked us constantly if we needed anything.  Food was hot when served and delicious."}
{"text":"Not really one of my favourite breakfast spots but since my company where in the mood for pancakes and this place was close by we ended up here anyway. 

\"Regular\" pancakes with syrup and jam is a bit boring and i think the ones at Ihop are the same. This time i tried the Red Velvet Pancakes with frosting between the layers of pancakes and these where actually quite good. 

Its more of a dessert or maybe a decadent weekent breakfast as i see it but anyway nice grub!  

Prices are fair as any other Ihop and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This is the best IHOP in the valley.  It's never too crowded, it's never too loud, and the food is always good.  The service is always pleasant and attentive, but not annoying.  The best thing on the menu is obviously the Bacon Temptation Omelet.  It's stuffed with like 50 slices of bacon, covered and filled with some ooey gooey cheese sauce and it's like the size of a small cat.  It's huge and I can barely finish a third of it.  Their waffles are pretty good too, but the BTO is where it's at.  Plus, this one is conveniently located right by the light rail, so there!"}
{"text":"I rated a 2 Star because me and my boyfriend went here today around 11am and we ordered the build your own frenchtoast breakfast and even though the wait for the food wasn't long when we received the food it was cold. My boyfriends eggs were half raw inside and gooey and my French toast was cold and the eggs and hash browns were not even warm. The plate was warm but the food didn't even taste fresh at all. The waiter forgot my drink and my boyfriends toast on the side and never received it. Also we had to ask for silverware because we didn't get any with our food. The staff was friendly but the food and service was very disappointing and we probably won't go to this location again."}
{"text":"My son lives for the all you can eat pancakes so, like it or not, I seem to wind up eating here a lot. All hours too, not just breakfast time. Best advice I can give is, no matter the time, go for some breakfast item. Whenever I stray, even toward simple things, I leave knowing I just messed up. Things other than eggs, bacon, etc just aren't in their wheelhouse and even the bfast items are 3 stars at best. My son always leaves full and completely happy though so, it's worth every meh meal :)"}
{"text":"IHOP is barely a step up from Denny's in terms of boring chain food. Last night was the first time I ever had dinner there, and it tasted like squishy, mushy cardboard. The food took forever even though there were only three tables in the place with customers.

The reason I gave it two stars instead of you is because the breakfasts are pretty good. I don't mind them except the omlettes which are way too oily. The coffee is almost bad, but the waitresses always look happy.

[update April 2, 2011]

Why'd I go back? I hate this place now. We went today for the first time we have all had a chance to go out together for breakfast. I was excited to do this and was eager. I should've stayed home.

My wife got a waffle with her combo that was cold, tasted like cardboard, and was crunchy. The bacon my wife and child ordered was burnt, crispy and did not look like bacon at all.

My sausage (I always upgrade to turkey sausage since the regular pork kid here is vomit worth) was totally cold. I sent it back and complained. I think she microwaved my plate. 

Their coffee is always burnt so I got an iced coffee. She said they had Mocha, Vanilla, or Hazelnut. I asked if they just had a regular coffee flavored one... she said yes, and brought me disgusting hazelnut (glad I'm not allergic!!)

Ok now it's three hours later. My daughter laid on the floor whining about how bad her stomach hurts, I've been to the bathroom twice and my wife is asleep because she said if she didn't lay down, she would puke. Seriously.

The management (district managers) really need to care enough to read YELP.  They remodeled the outside of this place and, I guess, spent all their money to make it look pretty so we'd forget they serve dogfood."}
{"text":"Great food. Great experience. Def recommend. It was wonderful. Loved the environment."}
{"text":"SERVER: Tyjuan (HE NEEDS A RAISE!)

I really don't understand why this IHOP has such a bad rating! I am not a local.. visited from San Francisco, CA and had way better service at this location then ANY IHOP in my area!! 

WAIT - PLACE WAS PACKED! Regardless, it was a Sunday and in SF you're guaranteed to have a 30min + wait.. BUT NO! Only took less then 10 min. to seat my group (3 people total) 

SERVER - His name was TYJUAN! Its been about a week since I've been back to SF and YES I remember him because he was just that darn GOOD!!!
- Greeted our table with name and took drink orders
- Got our drinks asap and provides us a new set of straws because the first set go wet LOL!
- Took our order without making us feel like we were being rushed, he also made recommendations to make our choices from the menu just a tad bit better, and YES his recommendations we perfection.
- Provided us extra napkins and ketchup without even asking(excuse me while I pretend he is the perfect nephew I never had! (': LOL)
- Checked up on our table twice and offered to-go boxes before providing us the bill with his closing thank you.

FOOD - Country fried steak was perfect and delicious! 

CHECK OUT - No line.. so super fast and easy pay!

OVERALL! THIS IHOP IS TERRIFIC! 

And most likely you will not see this but if you do read this Tyjuan, my group and I thank you so much for the terrific service and I hope you stay blessed! (o:"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  We ordered 2x2x2. Pancakes, eggs and bacon. Food was fresh and hot.   Such a nice atmosphere. I would definitely recommend.  We went at 6:30 pm but wanted breakfast for dinner.  Three in our party. All ordered the same and all enjoyed this visit. Thank you IHOP !!"}
{"text":"Seriously, don't waste your time. There's like 100 servers walking around and nobody came too our table for about 25-30 minutes. She took our order, and another 20 minutes later we still don't have drinks. We got our food before our drinks and when we got our drinks there was no ice. Why? Because the drinks were sitting there so long it melted! We have over 10 people including the manager come too our table and every time they came they fucked something else up. Half of the things we ordered we didn't even get, and yet they still tried to charge us for them. Lmfao."}
{"text":"Well, it's not only just IHOP, but IHOP Steelyard lol. I ordered my food to go but the visit and interaction with some of the staff was okay. Both of the workers I dealt with were kind of new, one in particular was laying on the good customer service a little too much (sorry but it was a tad bit annoying).  He started rambling about how I reminded him of his ex-girlfriend and I think he gave me some kind of compliment (backhand maybe)...I think at one point, I heard \"goofy smile\" or something. But besides the weird interaction, food was okay. 

Oh, lol, I forgot to mention that I ordered the Turkey Berry Melt and the same guy, wasn't really convinced that there was a such thing on the menu and thought I meant Turkey Bacon Melt. I told him no and he asked was that (the Turkey Berry Melt) really on the menu. He then said \"oh, I have to get a menu to see that\". SIGH...I'm thinking, \"dude I have the freaking menu in front of me, please just put the darn order in\". But I wasn't rude or mean, just kind of laughed it off...trying to show him my menu but for some reason he had to get his own menu to see it on there. To me, very unnecessary and I'm there longer than I should. 

Overall okay visit, a little annoying but decent."}
{"text":"Our waitress was great. Food was nice and hot. We ordered breakfast mid-afternoon, during probably slowest part of the day. We were in no hurry. We are all baffled why and what the new ihoB will stand for. IHOP has been such an American icon for PANCAKES which they do superbly. We know we can get great pancakes here. Guessing they are trying to broaden their appeal for the masses who may not welcome pancakes all day in today's crazy diet-conscious world (not sure if much of it applies to ihop, I'm talking all the uproar over organically, corn syrup, etc. etc. etc.) We'll definitely be back for more PANCAKES, especially in between workouts when we've earned it :-)"}
{"text":"Ordered the pancake combo with scrambled eggs with cheese, extra crispy hash brown.... my plate had been sitting under the heat lamp as my cheese was no longer melty and hot.. hash browns were not crispy and luke warm.... they serve pancakes on small plates which I don't understand since syrup has to run down pancakes to where the table?!

 Employees were yelling at other co-workers that were in the kitchen. Manager walking around but never once stopped by our table.. server was mediocre and definitely no one really was friendly."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!! Seriously, run far away. If I could give no stars, I would.

There was something odd about the taste of the food from the get go, but I just couldnt figure it out. I was starving, so I ate it anyways. BIG MISTAKE!!! Within a few hours I felt ill, and my lips were numb. I drank some water and attempted to sleep it off. The next morning not only I, but my entire family woke up vomiting and hibernating on the toilet all day long. It was a nightmare! I attempted to call and inform management, but it was impossible to get anyone on the phone - let alone get them to answer the phone. It was the same with corporate, no one seems to want to talk to anyone. 

Terrible! Oh, and in addition to getting sick - the service was terrible. Our waitress was rude! And, there were two tables within a few feet from us that sat unbussed with dirty dishes, food, drinks, and trash from previous customers. 

I will NEVER come here again. NEVER."}
{"text":"I have certain expectations walking into a 24hr IHOP at 10:30 on a Friday night.  Bland, perhaps improperly prepared food, glassy eyed customers, and service wavering between lackadaisical and perfunctory. Maybe someone will speak English. 

So, I was kinda bowled over when the teen and I stopped in after an ASU ballgame and were immediatey greeted by a cheerful young hostess who obviously enjoyed her job. Call me a rube, but I'm a sucker for a kid like that, who strikes up a conversation and makes you feel welcome in what is otherwise, let's face it, a pretty dreary  restaurant. Two stars just for her.

And a star for our polite, attentive waiter, Elias, who got everything right the first time, suggested and brought condiments I wouldn't have asked for on my own, brought refills, etc. 

The food? Hey, it's an IHOP. My club sandwich was okay, ordinary, the kid didnt finish his eggs. The onion rings were perfect; hot, incredibly  crunchy and greasy enough to require a napkin. We finished those. 

One thing I didnt like, and the sort of thing I half dread at a discount Friday night hangout,  is the blonde cashier spent her time between sales seated in an adjacent booth, while her hormonally challenged BF rubbed himself against her person. I like foreplay as much as the next guy, and if it was a couple customers, I  wouldnt feel so indignant. But I just loathe employees who cant seem to separate rudimentary work etiquette from their breathless, all-encompassing personal lives. 

But the reason I bothered to writeup this IHOP was to give a shout to our waiter and hostess, neither of whom I know, who both really took pride in their jobs. You dont always see that, late at night in a pancake house,  and I'd come here again just because of them. You should too."}
{"text":"If I can give negative stars I will. Completely rude Customer service we came in at 2:30 am on August 21st. Empty and yet the service was slow. Took our waiter over 10 minutes given that the restaurant was empty except two women that our server was talking up and giving out his number to. When he came around to take our order he was rude I order a bacon cheese burger but instead of meat I wanted chicken he then commented if I just wanted another item in the menu that has chicken and I stated no. My little 15 year old cousin assumed that maybe he didn't capture what I wanted so as she started to say \"she wants..\" He interrupted and with attitude told her that he is from here and he understands no need for that comment she was trying to help NOT call you ignorant. After he took our order he went back to sit with the ladies until they eventually got up after making plans to hang out again. Coffee was practically water, fries were not crispy or warm, and Bad customer service!!! I regret not checking yelp before coming into this business."}
