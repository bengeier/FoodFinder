{"text":"Made our biweekly trip to visit the Newmarket Costco for gas and found the Buttery through an online search for places to eat breakfast. My husband and I were skeptical at first given the restuarant's location inside a hotel (Best Western),  but we were pleasantly surprised. The set breakfast options were all under $10 and included coffee/tea and juice plus your standard fare options for eggs, bacon, or ham or sausage and either toast or home fries and tomato. There was also set breakfasts with pancakes or French toast. Plenty of other options on the menu as well like steak and eggs.. Coffee was bottomless and although the glass of juice was small - with everything else the size of the meal was just right for both of us. Service was good and they appeared to have a good mix of hotel and walk in customers. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Excellent service after a long drive, in traffic, to the Best Western in Newmarket. They called our room when the food was ready to be picked-up. Food was delicious!  I have a sensitive stomach and would know right away otherwise."}
{"text":"Staff friendly and welcoming. Greek salad was yummy - served over lettuce, fyi. I LOVE liver and onions and was not disapointed. Fresh, crusty sesame bread on table was also a treat. Booths for 2 along wall are very comfortable and just private enough fir someone on their own not to feel conspicuous."}
{"text":"We are not really old but we like to have dinner here. I can't care less about outdated decor . I like it clean, tasty and quick. The soups are usually very good, the ribs are great and Ceasar salad is very delicious. And if you are served by Jesse ,your evening just got better. The deserts are not baked in the restaurant but..so what? The caramel crunch is fresher than in Second Cup, that's for sure. The owners are very professional and polite. The kids love to eat here as well. We would come more often but our dinner for 3 usually runs over $120 so we'll just keep popping in couple times a month or so. Please, keep that cook happy, otherwise we won't have any place to go out."}
{"text":"Hands down best restaurant in Newmarket. I've been going here since I was a kid, probably close to 30 years. The food is amazing, especially the Caesar salad. We've boycotted chain restaurants because I've worked in quite a few on Yonge st and trust me...they're nasty. All their items are fresh...which you do not get at chain restaurants. The people cooking are actual chefs and not 17 year old, hungover kids who could care less about food quality or cleanliness. I recommend this place to everyone, except restaurant snobs who judge a place on its decor and not its food. Those people suck. The buttery has a great breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner menu. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I'm soooo excited to have found a breakfast place that makes hollandaise from scratch! My food sensitivities don't allow me to eat that powdered stuff all other restaurants make. The bene here was amazing. We came at lunch so had to have fries instead of home fries and they were just ok or I would have given 5 stars. Great service and friendly people."}
{"text":"Was staying at the Best Western & went here out of convenience. I wasn't disappointed I travel a lot & enjoy a good meal when the day is done. So it's a elegant casual atmosphere I enjoyed the half rack of baby backs with the Caesar salad. The ribs were tasty but not exactly the K C style ( needs thick sauce) to be true K C style. They were peal off the bone very flavor able without that reheated dryness of a lot of non BBQ restaurants. The Caesar was very good had just a touch of some fine bacon bits & the dressing was spot on. The mixed veggies were just a little crisper than I prefer but still very flavorful. The garlic mashed were good also just wish they had spooned them on instead of the ice cream scoop look. But that's portion control. I will go back and try something else next time I'm in town because there were a couple of other things to try"}
{"text":"Just had 2 American breakfast and an egg Benedict with my parents and I, comes with a total of $36. This place has a nice atmosphere, services are great and a little slow. The American breakfast comes in a large portion, egg Benedict was so delicious as well. The prices are bit high."}
{"text":"First time I been here and very good food Caesar salad is the best homemade service was great will come back soon ."}
{"text":"Been coming to the buttery for years.  My suggestion is going early for the buffet, for the freshest food, either breakfast or brunch.  Service is excellent. I haven't visited in about two years, looking forward to a Sunday brunch one day soon.. my favourite memory? Pre-cut lemon meringue pie slices at sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Newmarket for years.  Sunday brunch is always a hit with the kids, and their holiday menus are special every year."}
{"text":"Tried to have brunch here and it was... unpleasant.  French toast smelled a bit off and was covered in enough powdered sugar to hide something; that thing I suspect was the fact that it was day-old.  Everything else seemed like it either came out of a microwave or started life as a powder.  Can't say I'd go back - but maybe for a traveler it has a different appeal."}
{"text":"I understand this is a wonderful place if you know the password to good service. If you don't, then prepare to wait for poor service and lacklustre food.  I was at the front of the line, waiting for someone to notice me when the ma√Ætre d' rushed up and greeted the people behind me and ushered them into the restaurant. I was outright ignored and didn't even get a glance before he left me standing there, wondering if I have to know the secret handshake to get a seat.   Eventually I was noticed and given a seat, and it was a real trip down memory lane because it was the same decor I remember from when I last visited in the 90s. I got to enjoy it for a long time, too, because the waitstaff couldn't be bothered to take my order.  Eventually I did get some food a while later, but it wasn't worth the wait or my time. Honestly, I wish I'd never walked in the door.  I will add that my senior dad will bring his senior friends here, and they LOOOOOOVE it because they get great service and enjoy the food. I don't know why my service was so poor, while everyone else seems to have a great time."}
{"text":"Came here on Thursday morning at 9:30am and the place was pretty empty. Decor was dated, but nonetheless formal and yet cozy and welcoming. Servers were pleasant. Nice quiet place with delicous food and very reasonable prices. Will recommend!"}
{"text":"Woops, sorry but some of the food is boxed. Apple pie is from Costco. Meals are tasty and well presented. Staff is excellent. You'll be fine here but it's a very average restaurant."}
{"text":"The 5 star is based only on my experiences with sunday hungover brunch.   We come here always to fill up - great selection and variety in their buffet.  Eggs bene, prime rib, antipasto, bacon!  How can you go wrong?    Sure its a bit dated maybe?  Who cares the food is awesome for buffet."}
{"text":"I have to say, I came here because of the stars and man was I disappointed. I just paid double the price for half the food. I paid $10 for a tiny sandwich and had to pay for my side. I have no issue with paying for sides but if I'm paying double what I would normally pay for a sandwich I'd expect at least a decent sized portion. Not to mention the teaspoon I ate my soup with to give you an idea of the size of the soup bowl. Wish I could have said something better and I'm sure there are better/bigger dishes here but I'll probably never find out."}
{"text":"My friend suggested we try out this restaurant and I'm glad we did. I ordered the steak which came with onion rings and vegetables. The steak was a perfect medium rare. The onion rings were perfect and i saved that for last. Unfortunately i was only given 3 rings. The vegetables were seasoned well and were tasty. The service was friendly and attentive. It wasn't busy at all when we went in, around 3-30pm. The washrooms are clean which is a huge plus for me. Will visit again and recommend."}
{"text":"Had a really nice breakfast here. The service was just wonderful, very fast and friendly. Food was fresh and tasty. I liked that in the morning time you are not forced to get breakfast items only and if you want a burger, you can get one. Coffee tasted good and was bottomless. We enjoyed our visit here and will be returning in the future.  The restaurant and bathrooms are clean"}
{"text":"Every so often I just need a nice Eggs Benedict.  Or a nice place to meet up for breakfast.  Or a decadent desert.  Or great service.  Or the world need more restaurants like the Buttery.  Located in the Best Western hotel across from Upper Canada Mall in Newmarket, you can expect a consistent performance at this full service restaurant and its comfortable lounge.  Hotel restaurants can be a crap shoot, but this place has been there for decades, likely managed by the same owners for the whole time.  The meals are always nicely done, the surroundings are comfortable, and the treatment is always homey."}
{"text":"The Buttery has been around for a long time.  They keep updating...  They really care about people and food.   I always look forward to a meal at the Buttery."}
{"text":"I had breakfast there with a couple of friends during Easter and even though service was awesome and friendly, my pancakes tasted like they were too much pre-made. The croissant was ok, but not as flaky as I would expect.  Portions are on the bigger side, so it's filling enough for a good Sunday brunch.  I would return there to taste the other options they offer for breakfast."}
{"text":"I shuttered when I saw the name. Vegan business traveling is challenging, especially when you have to get up super early every morning and the only quick breakfast option is The Buttery. I had vouchers for pre-fixe continental meals none of which were veg friendly. Luckily, the restaurant honored the vouchers while allowing me to build my own vegan-friendly breakfast: Home fries, fresh fruit, toast with jam and a bottomless cup of black coffee. Service is curt and professional--the waitress quickly attending business travelers while also lingering over long time regulars."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. The restaurant was quite busy. We got seated promptly. Our waiter was quick to check up on us for any hot or cold drinks and our orders.  I had the Eggs Benedict ($11 + tax) which came with peameal bacon and home fries. The food was excellent. The hollandaise had the perfect consistency. It was rich and creamy. My friends ordered the more traditional breakfast options and I have to admit that it was really good value for money. Not only are the portions big but the quality is great.  The service was impeccable. In fact our waiter was quite funny. It was a nice to have such a wonderful meal and service together. I will definitely come back here for their other brunch options."}
{"text":"This restaurant is attached to the Best Western Hotel, so it has a bit of a hotel restaurant theme. The decor feels pretty formal and classy, which made both of us a little bit uncomfortable at first, in our jeans and casual wear. The staff didn't care, and everyone else was in varying states of classiness, dress wise, so we were quickly made to feel comfortable.  We had really just wanted a standard breakfast/brunch, but on Sundays they only serve a buffet. We decided that was cool, and went with it.  They had eggs benedict, which I'd never had from a buffet before. They were well done, on the runny side, which is the way I like them. They also had dollar pancakes, sausage, bacon, salmon, even carved beef. They could have a tiny bit more fruit -- there were really only melon and grapes. They also had a very nice selection of desserts, including a delicious pumpkin pie.  They also have great coffee, it was nice and strong and fresh tasting. If you're in the area and looking for a good breakfast buffet, this is a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Very friendly place. Good portions and good for quality. Don't expect service to be speedy though. Coffee not the best in town. Clean and homey place."}
{"text":"I hold the Buttery real close and dearly to my heart. I adore this place immensely; from the food to the service and the price. Two big thumbs up.   This resto holds my one true love, the spicy caesar salad, house made of course. Each night they have a special board which features a few items at a reasonable price. I've had many items including the beef medallions, the lobster tails, the rainbow trout - all were excellent. If you're lucky enough, you'll be served by a man who is the reason I go. I wish I had caught his name but each time I forget. Not because I can't be bothered by because I am so distracted with his kindness and his wunderbar comments. I know it's German but it gets me every time.   If you're in Newmarket looking for a nice restaurant that's different from your usual Keg experience, come here. It's WUNDERBAR!"}
{"text":"My first visit was on a Saturday morning. I walked in and thought OMG this is not a place I wanna eat in. In a word, FORMAL. I thought this a formal dining establishment. I WAS WRONG.  The Buttery is a casual restaurant but definitely gives you a formal dining room type of service. The staff were very courteous and efficient. The room was comfortable and relaxing. I found the coffee to be very good. I had my benchmark meal to rate a breakfast which was bacon and eggs with home-fries and toast. Everything was excellent with a special thumbs up for the home-fries. The toast also deserves a thumbs up. My wife had an omelette which was cooked perfectly, light and fluffy. If I could find a complaint it would the portion size. They were not small but the food is so good there wasn't enough of it.  All in all I'm glad I didn't pass by and not give this place a try."}
{"text":"To change from one visit to another very disappointed the second and third time they're off on both the food and the quality of service although at times the food can be good there's definitely a lack of consistency"}
{"text":"Came here from many good referrals and felt let down. Service was good but the food was average and the decor was something out of the early 90's. The four of us all had different things on the menu, and although it was good, it was just ok. Wouldn't rush back."}
{"text":"It is a great local place. It tends to cater to an older crowd. The food is freshly made in house and is a family run business. It a great place to go for breakfast on a Sunday morning."}
